0,2020/02/28,Santoso to coach singles players,"Experienced Indonesian coach Agus Dwi Santoso will be assisting the India’s singles badminton players, including Olympic silver-medallist P.V. Sindhu, from next month as they prepare for the Tokyo Games later this year.

Santoso comes in after the unceremonious exit of South Korea’s Kim Ji Hyun, who left abruptly last September after guiding Sindhu to an unprecedented World Championships gold.

Santoso has been roped in to guide the singles players — both men and women — ahead of the Games, scheduled to be held from July 24 to August 9.

The Sports Authority of India (SAI) on Friday wrote to the authorities to grant visa to Santoso at the earliest after the Sports Ministry cleared his appointment on Wednesday.

Badminton Association of India secretary Ajay Singhania said the visa process has started and Santoso is likely to join the Indian team in the middle of next month.

“He is a very good coach and we hope to extend his contract till 2024 Olympics. If his performance is satisfactory then we will approach SAI again,” Singhania said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/santoso-to-coach-singles-players/article30945210.ece

2,2020/02/28,"Khelo India University Games | It’s my turn to provide for my parents, says Komalika Bari","Teenager has a hectic month ahead with the Asia Cup starting on March 7

Komalika Bari’s arrows fly at the speed of light, but her feet are firmly planted on the ground. Hailing from the industrial hub of Jamshedpur, the 18-year-old achieved unparalleled success when she became the second Indian woman recurve archer after Deepika Kumari to win a gold medal at the World Archery Youth championships last year.

Interesting read: Meet Komalika Bari, India's gold medal winner at World Archery Youth Championships in Madrid

The teenager also came close to clinching a ticket to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Her latest exploits came at the Khelo India University Games, where she won a silver medal in the individual category and gold in the team recurve event.

Komalika has a hectic month ahead. She will be going to Thailand for the Asia Cup starting March 7 and right after returning, she will have to request her college authorities to postpone her exam. “I’ll be going to the national camp in Sonepat next week before heading to Bangkok. I think I can give my exams later on, the college is pretty adjusting,” she tells Sportstar.

Her mother works in a rural child care centre, while her father is unemployed. She wants to get rid of the financial stress her family is under by bringing in more laurels. “I feel like it’s my turn to provide for my parents. I want to be able to give them everything they want and fulfil all their needs,” she adds.

Komalika has seen money through wins and scholarships. She is keen on saving, and tries to stay away from frivolous spending. “I have two accounts. All my prize money goes into one account, but I don’t have access to that one. I ask my father when I need the money and he transfers it to my other account.”

Komalika wasn’t very drawn to sports growing up. An archery training centre that opened near her house pulled her in. “My father wanted me to play a sport that won’t take a toll on my body and would also allow me to focus on my studies. He thought my mind power would increase too,” she says.

She certainly has become mentally tougher as she stays alone at the Tata Archery Academy.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/2u5c5w/article30934939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28KOMAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/khelo-india-university-games-its-my-turn-to-provide-for-my-parents-says-komalika-bari/article30934940.ece

5,2020/02/28,Mysuru gears up for Invitation Cup Weekend,"It’s come a long way since the time they conducted just one Racing Season from August to October and today they race around the year.

The imposing Chamundi Hill has stared down on the Mysore Race Club for decades.

If it could speak, I’m sure it would regale us with tales of awe because as one of the great Rock Bands in the world The Police wrote “Every breath you take and every move you make... I’ll be watching you”.

But, even with all the watching like an imperial sentinel, I doubt Chamundi Hill would have thought that one day it would witness the Mysore Race Club playing host to the biggest and most glamorous weekend of Indian racing — The Invitation Cup.

Indian racing’s youngest Turf Authority came into being just six years ago. Of course, they have been there for years, but it was only in 2014 that they were inducted as an independent Turf Authority and just six years later they host the Invitation Weekend. Mysore Race Club has been racing for well over 100 years and in fact celebrated their centenary in 1991.

Bird’s eye view: The Mysore Race Club awaits it’s biggest assignment yet.

It’s come a long way since the time they conducted just one Racing Season from August to October and today they race around the year.

The last Saturday of February and the first Sunday of March 2020 will usher in a new epoch in the archives of racing in Mysuru. A true baptism by fire, you might say, as they assert that they have now arrived on the map of the Indian Turf.

Under the chairmanship of Dr. Nithyanand Rao and his committee, backed by a dedicated team of officials, Mysore Race Club has been working round the clock to ensure that Indian Racing’s most glamorous weekend will be showcased in all it’s splendour.

The marquee races

Saturday February 29, 2020 is an auspicious day in itself, coming once every four years.

They couldn’t have chosen a better afternoon to run the first two of four Grade 1 races — The Bangalore Turf Club Sprinters Cup (Gr. 1), a blinding test of speed, and the M.A.M. Ramaswamy Stayers Cup (Gr. 1), a gruelling test of stamina.

And then, the next day the all-important Invitation Cup and the Maj. P.K. Mehra Memorial Super Mile.

These will be backed by the Suresh Mahendra Million, a Grade 2 Affair.

The death toll in the communal violence that rocked the national capital since Sunday rose to 38 on Thursday, with 11 more persons succumbing to injuries at various hospitals. The national capital was, however, spared any major clashes, shifting the focus on treatment, investigation, relief and rehabilitation.

India’s acknowledgement came two days after a source privy to Taliban told The Hindu that around 24 countries are expected to participate in the ceremony where the deal will be signed.

9,2020/02/28,Pro-democracy media tycoon arrested,"Jimmy Lai accused of taking part in Hong Kong rallies

Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai, a high profile critic of Beijing, was arrested on Friday for taking part in last year’s pro-democracy protests that rocked the city for seven months.

The 72-year-old owner of the Apple Daily newspaper is accused of joining a rally on August 31 that had been banned by the police for security reasons.

Mr. Lai was arrested and charged along with veteran pro-democracy activists Lee Cheuk Yan and Yeung Sum, the police said. The trio could be jailed for up to five years if convicted of taking part in an “unauthorised assembly”. They are due to appear in court on May 5.

Tens of thousands of protesters defied the police ban on the demonstration marking the anniversary of Beijing’s rejection of a call for universal suffrage for Hong Kong that sparked the 2014 “Umbrella Movement”.

Some gathered in the name of a religious procession — which does not require police approval — while others claimed they were shopping.

In a separate charge, Mr. Lai is accused of intimidating a reporter in 2018 during a vigil for the victims of China’s bloody Tiananmen crackdown on June 4, 1989.

Amnesty International said the legal action against the trio was politically motivated. “These unjustifiable arrests are a shameless attempt to harass and silence those in Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement,” said the rights group’s Man-kei Tam.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rcimr0/article30945612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28RDLAI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pro-democracy-media-tycoon-arrested/article30945613.ece

11,2020/02/28,Will America see its first Jewish President?,"Sanders and Bloomberg vie to bust barrier.

White House hopefuls Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg could hardly be more different in their politics, but in one striking way they share a similarity marking a milestone in U.S. presidential campaigning: both men are Jewish.

Should Senator Sanders, the progressive torchbearer and current Democratic frontrunner, or centrist billionaire Bloomberg, who is polling in third, win the nomination and then the election against incumbent Donald Trump, America would have the first Jewish President in its history.

And yet the fact that two Jews are in prominent positions in the 2020 race — 16 months after a white nationalist murdered 11 worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue— has been met with muted celebration within the Jewish community, and a sense of detachment among the broader public, observed Rabbi Adam Kligfeld. “It’s amazing, stunning, surprising and odd how little is being made of that data point.”

The two are also drawing concerns. Mr. Sanders is a self-described democratic socialist, while Mr. Bloomberg is a multi-billionaire accused of buying his way into the presidential race.

There is little love lost between them, as evidenced in January when Mr. Bloomberg sand-bagged Mr. Sanders during an address at a Miami synagogue. “I know I’m not the only Jewish candidate running for President,” he said, between quoting Leviticus and jokes about Wolfie’s deli. “But I am the only one who doesn’t want to turn America into a kibbutz.”

The rise of Mr. Sanders has sparked a debate about whether values embraced by Jews, like social justice, are best achieved through policies including universal health care, or by unwavering defense of Israel. He has repeatedly insisted he supports Israel but opposes policies that he says hurt Palestinians. In Tuesday’s debate he branded Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a “reactionary racist”.

For decades Jews have voted overwhelmingly Democratic. But only 11% of Jewish voters support Mr. Sanders, while 8% back Mr. Bloomberg, Pew Research Center polling shows.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/on4nsv/article30945528.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28RDSANDERS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/will-america-see-its-first-jewish-president/article30945529.ece
12,2020/02/28,Malaysia’s Mahathir suffers blow as supporters abandon him,"Mr. Mahathir is seeking to return as PM for a third time after his ruling alliance collapsed.

Malaysia’s king on Friday said he will let party leaders nominate prime ministerial candidates, shifting the battle for power after Opposition parties switched their allegiance from interim leader Mahathir Mohamad to a seasoned politician from his party.

Mr. Mahathir, 94, who is seeking to return as Prime Minister for a third time after his ruling alliance collapsed this week, suffered double blows after the king rejected his call for a vote in Parliament to elect a new leader and his supporters threw their support behind the president of his Bersatu party, Muhyiddin Yassin.

Muhyiddin, 72, is a long-time politician who served under the previous ruling coalition but quit to help Mr. Mahathir form Bersatu in 2016 amid anger over a massive graft scandal involving a state investment fund.

Muhyiddin led Bersatu to ditch the alliance on Monday in a bid to form a new government with several Opposition parties without Mahathir’s designated successor, Anwar Ibrahim, breaking apart the ruling alliance.

But the plan flopped after Mr. Mahathir quit in protest of the plan to work with the United Malays National Organization, the party of disgraced former Prime Minister Najib Razak.

The astonishing twist comes after the palace confirmed in a statement that the king, Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, had been unable to find a candidate with majority support to form a government after interviewing all 222 lawmakers.

The palace refused to side with Mr. Mahathir, who said on Thursday the king would let the lower house of Parliament vote next on Monday to elect a new Prime Minister and that snap elections would be called if there were an impasse.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/be0a32/article30945440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28RDMAHATIR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysias-mahathir-suffers-blow-as-supporters-abandon-him/article30945441.ece

India on Friday advised Pakistan’s top leadership to stop terror funding and dismantle terrorist camps operating from its soil and territories under its control while decrying Islamabad’s efforts to derail the positive developments in Jammu and Kashmir.

India’s statement came a week after the global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in Paris decided to retain Pakistan in its ‘Grey List’ and warned the country of stern action if it fails to prosecute and penalise those involved in terror funding emanating from its jurisdiction.

Exercising the right of reply after Pakistan raised concerns over human rights in Jammu and Kashmir at the 43rd Session of the Human Rights Council here, First Secretary in India’s Permanent Mission Vimarsh Aryan said that the international community cannot be misled by Pakistani hysterical reactions at all global forums to malign India.

“The situation in Jammu and Kashmir is fast returning to normalcy despite serious attempts by Pakistan to derail the positive developments through its active support to terrorist groups and related entities,” Aryan said.

Giving Pakistan a 10-point advise list, the Indian diplomat asked it to stop terror funding and dismantle terrorist camps operating in the country and territories under its control.

“Stop public advocacy and support for terrorists by Pakistani leadership at the highest level, end illegal and forcible occupation and reverse the demographic changes in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and take structural reforms to develop a semblance of democracy in Pakistan,” he said.

Highlighting the plight of minorities in Muslim-majority Pakistan, Aryan asked the Pakistani leadership to end harassment and execution of minorities through misuse of blasphemy law, end forced conversions and marriages of women and girls from Hindu, Sikh and Christian religions and stop religious persecution against Shias, Ahmadiyas, Ismailia and Hazaras.

“Blasphemy law against Aasia Bibi, persecution of Abdul Shakoor, an Ahmadiya, Jagjit Kaur, a minor Sikh girl subjected to abduction and forced marriage are the norms of the day for minorities in Pakistan,” he said.

He also accused Pakistan of recruiting children for terror activities including suicide bombing in other countries.

“Stop killing and targeting political dissidents and legitimate criticism in Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and prevent enforced disappearances and extra judicial killings of journalists and human rights activists by its security agencies,” the Indian diplomat said.

Speaking about the state of democracy in India and Pakistan, Aryan said that the world knows about the dismal human rights records of Pakistan and a tight control cannot hide it all while India’s time tested democratic institutions are robust and adequate enough to address any challenge including those instigated from outside, in order to safeguard interests of all our citizens including minorities.

15,2020/02/28,"Pakistani banks may lose business and pay more for global transactions, if terror not combated: Moody’s","Moody’s Investors Service said the announcement is credit negative for Pakistani banks because there are potential additional restrictions for the banks’ foreign-currency clearing services as well as foreign operations.

Credit rating agency Moody’s has warned Pakistani banks that they may lose international business and pay more for global transactions if the government does not implement the FATF action plan on anti-money laundering and counter terror-financing by the June deadline.

In a report released on Thursday, Moody’s Investors Service said the announcement is credit negative for Pakistani banks because there are potential additional restrictions for the banks’ foreign-currency clearing services as well as foreign operations.

The Paris-Based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which is the global watchdog of international financial transactions, gave Pakistan an extension for completing the June 2018 action plan on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating financing of terrorism (CFT) till June 2020 or risk being placed on its black-list. Presently Pakistan is on the Grey List.

The FATF at its February meet warned that it will urge member countries to scrutinise their business transactions with Pakistan if the country fails to complete the action plan regarding terror financing.

Moody’s further said if Pakistan fails to fully enforce the FATF action plan international financial institutions could curtail their dealings with Pakistani banks, including termination of correspondent banking relationships.

“This, in turn, would further constrain the banks’ ability to generate business and result in higher compliance costs,” the Moody’s report added.

Black and grey: On terror funding and Pakistan

To date, Pakistan has addressed 14 of 27 action items given to it in controlling funding to terror groups such as the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and the Hizbul Mujahideen, which are responsible for a series of attacks in India.

Efforts for compliance with the remaining 13 points have also progressed at varying degrees, according to the FATF.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has expressed confidence that Pakistan will exit the Grey List by June 2020, Moody’s said.

But the report said compliance with the global AML and CFT standards remained weak both by Pakistani banks and the country’s authorities.

“[This] means that banks still risk losing access to foreign-currency clearing services,” it said.

Access to foreign-currency clearing transactions, typically conducted through international correspondent banking relationships, is crucial for Pakistani banks because it allows them to process cross-border payments for clients.

India has maintained that Pakistan extends regular support to terror groups such as LeT, JeM and the Hizbul Mujahideen, whose prime target is India, and has urged the FATF to take action against Islamabad.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ygif7y/article30943665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-Moodys-corporate-headquarters,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistani-banks-may-lose-business-and-pay-more-for-global-transactions-if-terror-not-combated-moodys/article30943644.ece
16,2020/02/28,COVID-19: Chinese couple charged for giving false info to Singapore authorities,"The couple allegedly gave false information to the health ministry officials about their movements and whereabouts from January 22 to 29, when they were contacted during the quarantine period

A couple from China on Friday became the first two persons to be charged under Singapore’s Infectious Diseases Act for providing false information to the authorities relating to the deadly coronavirus, obstructing the process of contact tracing, an important exercise of monitoring people exposed to the infected persons.

Hu Jun, 38, from Wuhan, the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus, and his wife Shi Sha, 36, who lives in Singapore, became the first two people to be charged under the Infectious Diseases Act, in relation to the current outbreak, the Ministry of Health said in a statement on Wednesday.

Hu arrived in Singapore on January 22 and was confirmed to be infected with coronavirus on January 31, the statement said.

Hu recovered and was discharged from a hospital on February 19. His wife, however, was identified as a close contact and was issued a quarantine order on February 1, after the Ministry initiated contact tracing to identify those who may have been exposed to the infected person while he was symptomatic.

The couple allegedly gave false information to the health ministry officials about their movements and whereabouts from January 22 to 29, when they were contacted during the quarantine period.

Shi is also said to have provided other false information while under quarantine.

The ministry said that it was able to determine the couple’s true movements only through detailed investigations.

The couple will again appear in the court on March 20.

Anyone convicted of an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act can be jailed for up to six months and fined up to SGD10,000 for the first offence, according to the media reports.

Three new cases of the coronavirus disease were confirmed by the Health Ministry on Thursday, including a 12-year-old student from the prestigious Raffles Institution.

This brings the total number of cases here to 96, of which 66 have fully recovered.

The ministry said, eight of the 30 patients who are still in the hospitals are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

17,2020/02/28,"IMF, Pak. govt reach agreement on second review of $6 billion bailout package","On completion of staff level discussions between February 3 and 13 in Islamabad, the IMF mission had reported considerable progress to have been made in the last few months in advancing reforms and continuing with sound economic policies

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said it has reached a staff-level agreement with the Pakistani authorities “on policies and reforms” needed to complete the second review of the $6 billion loan approved for the cash-strapped country to help its fragile economy, a media report said on Friday.

In July last year, the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Executive Board “approved a 39-month extended arrangement” under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan for $6 billion to support its economic reform programme.

Pakistan’s Finance Ministry approached the IMF in August 2018 for a bailout package when the Imran Khan government took over.

“IMF staff and the Pakistani authorities have reached a staff-level agreement on policies and reforms needed to complete the second review of the authorities’ reform programme supported under the EFF,” the Dawn newspaper quoted IMF’s Mission Chief for Pakistan Ernesto Ramirez Rigo as saying.

The announcement was made by Rigo through a brief statement after a series of engagements with Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Hafeez Shaikh, Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan Reza Baqir and Finance Secretary Naveed Kamran Baloch through video conference over the last two weeks, the report said.

The agreement is subject to approval by the IMF management and consideration by its executive board, which is expected in early April.

Completion of the review will enable disbursement of around $450 million, the IMF said.

The Pakistan authorities were tight-lipped over the “policies and reforms needed to complete the second review” but hinted that the two sides had agreed over the fact that some breathing space was required to absorb earlier shocks before further adjustment as higher than estimated inflation had put unexpected pressure on majority of the people, the report said.

An official said it was also hoped that an ongoing ease in oil prices would create room for adjustment, a component of which could become part of the next year’s budget.

He said the full disclosure of agreed upon policy actions could be ‘market sensitive’ and should be left for appropriate time.

Normally, details regarding reviews of IMF-supported programmes are made public after the reviews are approved by the fund’s executive board and staff reports are released. The executive board meeting due for early March has now been postponed for a month until early April.

On completion of staff level discussions between February 3 and 13 in Islamabad, the IMF mission had reported considerable progress to have been made in the last few months in advancing reforms and continuing with sound economic policies.

“All end-December performance criteria were met, and structural benchmarks have been completed,” the fund had said, adding the steadfast progress on programme implementation would pave the way for the IMF executive board’s consideration of the review.

Pakistan reached an agreement with the IMF on the bailout package after marathon talks held in June last year.

The $6 billion financial aid includes an immediate disbursement of $1 billion to help Pakistan address its balance of payment crisis.

Prime Minister Khan had changed the entire economic team including the finance minister, chief of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and head of Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) under criticism for failure to improve the economy.

The latest deal is the 22nd bailout package since Pakistan became member of the IMF in 1950.

Pakistan has so far received billions in financial aid packages from friendly countries like China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Last year, Pakistan secured a bailout package of $3 billion from oil-rich Qatar.

Earlier, China gave $4.6 billion in shape of deposits and commercial loans and Saudi Arabia provided $3 billion cash deposit and $3.2 billion oil facility on deferred payments. The United Arab Emirates also provided $2 billion cash deposit.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/drmwsz/article30941693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMFFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/imf-pak-govt-reach-agreement-on-second-review-of-6-billion-bailout-package/article30941694.ece
18,2020/02/28,Greta Thunberg to draw thousands at British climate rally,"Known simply as Greta, 17-year-old Thunberg has captured the imagination of many young people with impassioned demands for world leaders to take urgent action to prevent what she says will be an environmental cataclysm.

Greta Thunberg, the teenage activist who has reprimanded governments across the world for failing her generation with climate change, is expected to draw a crowd of thousands on Friday when she leads a protest in Britain.

Known simply as Greta, 17-year-old Thunberg has captured the imagination of many young people with impassioned demands for world leaders to take urgent action to prevent what she says will be an environmental cataclysm.

She will address a “Youth Strike for Climate” rally in the English city of Bristol, though police issued a safety warning due to the number of people expected to attend.

“The worlds youth are waking up and taking action on the climate crisis,” said the event organisers, the Bristol Youth Strike 4 Climate group, which insisted it had prepared properly and did not need to be “patronised” by safety worries.

The group is part of a global movement of school students who stage protests in school time over what they say is the lack of government action on climate change.

Britain is targetting net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and wants to bring forward a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2035 at the latest.

Organisers say they expect between 15,000 and 60,000 protesters from across the country to attend the event on Friday.

One coach company said it was providing transport from 13 places around Britain, including Oxford, Birmingham, Brighton and Cardiff.

Police and the local council in Bristol issued a joint statement, expressing safety concerns.

“We have seen a number of protests over the last year however this one will be significantly larger,” it said. “Please do not underestimate the scale of this protest.”

Police will close roads around the area where Greta Thunberg, is expected to speak before she joins a march through the city.

Greta Thunberg has been in Britain since the weekend. On Tuesday she visited the University of Oxford, where she met Malala Yousafzai, the 22-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner and campaigner for girls' education, who is studying there.

The pair shared photos of themselves with their arms around each other. Thunberg called Yousafzai her role model, while Yousafzai said on Twitter: “She's the only friend I'd skip school for.”

Thunberg starting missing lessons two years ago to protest outside the Swedish parliament building. She has since sparked a global movement calling for sustainability and awareness of climate change.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7qt8i/article30616559.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THGRETATHUNBERG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/greta-thunberg-to-draw-thousands-at-british-climate-rally/article30941206.ece

20,2020/02/28,COVID-19: New Zealand confirms first case,"Public health officials have begun tracing the patient’s contact history and will test the individual's family members for the virus

New Zealand confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on Friday in someone who returned from Iran, but said the chances of a community outbreak remains low.

The patient — in their 60s — tested positive for COVID-19 earlier in the day. The person is being treated in Auckland City Hospital and their condition is improving, a Health Ministry statement said.

“Although we have our first case of COVID-19, the chances of community outbreak remain low,” the Ministry said.

Public health officials have begun tracing the patient’s contact history and will test the individual's family members for the virus.

The person travelled on an Emirates Airline flight that originated in Tehran, stopped in Bali, Indonesia, and ended in Auckland on Feb 26.

People on the final leg of the flight, who are concerned, should contact authorities, the Ministry said.

New Zealand said earlier in the day it was imposing temporary restrictions on visitors from Iran, where the death toll from COVID-19 had risen to 26, by far the highest number outside China.

The world prepared for a coronavirus pandemic on Friday as hopes the disease could be contained to China vanished and investors dumped equities in expectation of a global recession.

Neighbouring Australia said on Friday another passenger from a cruise ship in Japan had tested positive for the coronavirus.

The patient, the wife of a man who had earlier contracted COCID-19, is the ninth Australian passenger from the Diamond Princess to come down with the illness.

Expressing sadness over the violence in Delhi, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said that Mahatma Gandhi’s spirit is needed more than ever as it is essential to create conditions for a true community reconciliation.

Mr. Guterres has expressed sadness over the casualties following the protests in Delhi, and called for maximum restraint and for violence to be avoided, the UN chief’s spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Thursday.

“The Secretary-General has been following the situation in India and... concerning the violence closely and is saddened by the reports of deaths that we’ve seen over the past few days in New Delhi and again reiterates, as he’s done in other places, his calls for maximum restraint and for violence to be avoided,” Mr. Dujarric said.

Throughout his life, “the Secretary-General has been deeply inspired by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi. And today the spirit of Gandhi is needed more than ever and it is essential to create conditions for true community reconciliation”, he said.

Earlier Mr. Dujarric had said that Mr. Guterres is closely following the situation in New Delhi and stressed that demonstrators should be allowed to demonstrate peacefully and security forces should show restraint.

The death toll in Delhi’s worst riots in more than three decades climbed to 38 as the violence ebbed but did not subside completely.

Communal clashes broke out in northeast Delhi after violence between anti- and pro-Citizenship (Amendment) Act groups spiralled out of control. Frenzied mobs torched houses, shops, vehicles, a petrol pump and pelted stones at local residents and police personnel.

23,2020/02/28,The lasting legacy of 'Into the Wild' and Chris McCandless’ legend,"Years after McCandless’ death, scores of travellers following his journey along the Stampede Trail just outside Denali National Park have died in the harsh reality of back-country terrain.

For more than a quarter-century, the old bus abandoned in Alaska’s punishing wilderness has drawn adventurers seeking to retrace the steps of a young idealist who met a tragic death in the derelict vehicle.

For many, Christopher McCandless’ legend was cemented in the Into the Wild book and movie. But scores of travellers following his journey along the Stampede Trail just outside Denali National Park have been rescued and others have died in the harsh reality of back-country terrain that’s marked by no cell phone service, unpredictable weather and the raging Teklanika River, whose swollen banks prevented the 24-year-old Virginian from seeking help before his 1992 starvation death.

Now families of some of those who died are proposing looking at building a footbridge over the Teklanika. The effort is led by the husband of a 24-year-old newly-wed woman from Belarus who died last year trying to reach the bus.

“People keep going there despite multiple accidents reported,” said Piotr Markielau, who was with his wife Veramika Maikamava when she was swept away by the river. “Making the crossing safer is a social responsibility. It is also a constructive and humane way to learn from people who died there.”

But some local officials in Denali Borough in Healy, about 25 miles away, fear a footbridge could give people a false impression of safety that doesn’t exist.

“It’ll only encourage more people to go,” says Denali Assembly member Jeff Stenger, who rejects the bridge idea and would prefer to see warning signs posted in the area instead.

Borough Mayor Clay Walker wants to see the bus relocated to a safer location on the other side of the Teklanika with the help of federal and state agencies.

“This bus has meaning to a lot of people, and the challenge will be to put together a plan that works for all,” Walker said.

A bridge would not have made a difference in the latest rescue, this one involving five Italian tourists — one with frostbitten feet — who were rescued Saturday after visiting the dilapidated bus. There are other hazards, including harsh weather and dangerous terrain. Some attempting the trip are ill-prepared.

The long-discarded bus sits in a clearing on state land roughly half a mile from the boundary of the Denali National Park and Preserve. Travellers often traverse park land to get to the bus, which was left in the wilderness to house construction crews working improve the trail so trucks could haul ore from a mine, according to the book. It’s outfitted with a barrel stove and bunks, and McCandless wrote in his journal about living there for 114 days, right up until his death.

Author Jon Krakauer, who wrote Into the Wild, said he is “saddened and horrified” by the deaths of people trying to cross the Teklanika. He’s also sceptical building a bridge or moving the bus will solve the problem.

“I really don’t know what can be done or should be done about the unprepared ‘pilgrims’ who get into trouble and perish or need to be rescued,” he said in an email to the AP. “I have no objection to removing the bus, or building a bridge to it, if a persuasive argument can be made that doing either of these things would solve the problem. I am sceptical about the wisdom of either of these proposed measures, however.”

McCandless’ sister agrees. Carine McCandless believes people will keep trying to reach the site, regardless of what locals decide. She said people send her messages every day from all over the world, identifying with her brother’s story, and she understands why people continue to make the trek.

“It is not Chris’s story they are following, it is their own, even if they don’t realize it at the time,” she said. “And as far as the lure of the bus — it’s not about the bus, either. If the bus is moved, people will simply erect a memorial in its place and continue to go there.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/article16953817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30tvf_intothewild,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/the-lasting-legacy-of-into-the-wild-and-chris-mccandless-legend/article30940337.ece

25,2020/02/28,US professor charged with hiding link to China on NASA-funded project,"Prosecutors say Hu defrauded the NASA by failing to disclose the fact that he was also a professor at the Beijing University of Technology

A professor at the University of Tennessee has been arrested on charges that he hid his relationship with a Chinese university while receiving research grants from the federal government, the Justice Department said Thursday.

Anming Hu, an associate professor in the department of mechanical, aerospace and biomedical engineering at the university’s flagship Knoxville campus, was charged with three counts of wire fraud and three counts of making false statements.

After the indictment was announced, the university said Hu had been suspended and that school officials had cooperated. ""University leadership is fully committed to adherence to grant procedures and the protection of intellectual property,” the school said in a statement.

‘Stealing intellectual property’

The arrest is part of a broader Justice Department crackdown against university researchers who conceal their ties to Chinese institutions, with a Harvard chemistry professor recently arrested on similar charges.

Federal officials have also asserted that Beijing is intent on stealing intellectual property from America’s colleges and universities, and have actively been warning schools to be on alert against espionage attempts.

Prosecutors say Hu defrauded the National Aeronautics and Space Administration by failing to disclose the fact that he was also a professor at the Beijing University of Technology in China. Under federal law, NASA cannot fund or give grant money to Chinese-owned companies or universities.

According to the indictment, as the University of Tennessee last December was preparing a proposal on Hu’s behalf for a NASA-funded project, Hu provided false assurances to the school that he was not part of any business collaboration involving China.

In addition, prosecutors say, a curriculum vitae that Hu submitted when he applied for a tenured faculty position with the university omitted any affiliation with the Beijing university.

""This is just the latest case involving professors or researchers concealing their affiliations with China from their American employers and the U.S. government,” Assistant Attorney General John Demers, the Justice Department’s top national security official, said in a statement. “We will not tolerate it.”

26,2020/02/28,"American lawmakers seek assurances, transparency on U.S.-Taliban peace deal","In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the defense secretary, the Congressmen on Thursday called for prioritisation of American security as the US pursued a peace agreement with the Taliban.

Nearly two dozen American lawmakers have sought assurances and transparency prior to the signing of a landmark peace deal between the US and the Taliban in Doha on Saturday to end the brutal war in Afghanistan, urging the Trump administration not to make a commitment that would embolden America’s adversaries and undermine its allies.

The U.S. is set to sign a historic peace deal with the Taliban on Saturday provided that a week-long reduction in violence across the war-torn Afghanistan holds.

The Taliban has also confirmed the plan to sign the peace deal that day.

In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the defense secretary, the Congressmen on Thursday called for prioritisation of American security as the U.S. pursued a peace agreement with the Taliban.

Dated February 27, the letter calls for transparency and highlights the importance of keeping the U.S. safe.

Additionally, it outlines the need for certain security pledges, including that any deal between the U.S. and the Taliban will be public and not contain secret annexes or side deals.

The lawmakers also demanded that there will be no intelligence sharing or a “joint counter-terrorism” centre established with the Taliban.

“We have serious concerns about reports that the United States is preparing to sign a deal with the Taliban, the terrorists who harboured al-Qaeda before and after the attacks of 9/11. President Trump has a proven track record of putting America’s security first and ensuring our country stays out of bad deals that aid our adversaries,” the letter said.

“In keeping with this policy, we are seeking assurances that you will not place the security of the American people into the hands of the Taliban, and undermine our ally, the current government of Afghanistan,” it added.

In the letter, the lawmakers sought assurances that any deal between the U.S. and the Taliban would be public and not contain any secret annexes or side deals and that the administration would not put American security at risk by pretending that the Taliban was a reliable counter-terrorism partner.

The letter said decisions about the U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan must be made based on U.S. national security requirements determined by conditions on the ground.

“Therefore, any deal must not contain a commitment for a full U.S. withdrawal at this point. Such a commitment would embolden America’s adversaries and undermine our allies, including the Afghan government,” the lawmakers said.

“Any deal with the Taliban will include the requirement that the Taliban turn over all al-Qaeda leaders and operatives who are currently hiding in Taliban strongholds. There will be no uneven or premature release of Taliban prisoners,” the Congressmen added.

They also sought assurances that the current sanctions and designations against the al-Qaeda-allied Haqqani network will remain in place regardless of any deal with the Taliban.

“President Trump has taken crucial action to keep our nation safe, including eliminating the world’s most dangerous terrorists and destroying the ISIS caliphate. He knows a bad deal when he sees one. We urge you not to commit America to a dangerous deal with the Taliban that would abandon the President’s track record of strengthening America and putting our security and interests first,” the lawmakers said.

The Taliban was a terrorist group that celebrated suicide attacks, they alleged.

Haibatullah Akhundzada, the overall leader of the Taliban, sacrificed his own son in a suicide bombing in 2017. Akhundzada’s top deputy, Sirajuddin Haqqani, runs a network that specialises in devastating suicide bombings, including some of the most heinous attacks in the history of the war, the letter said.

“The American people cannot rely on these terrorists to safeguard their security,” it noted.

Observing that the Taliban also had a history of extracting concessions in exchange for false assurances, the lawmakers said they would accept nothing less than a full-scale U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan as they sought to establish their totalitarian “Islamic Emirate”.

“Our withdrawal would then allow terrorist groups in Afghanistan to grow stronger and establish safe havens from which to plot attacks against us. Any promises the Taliban may have made to the U.S. related to counterterrorism cannot be trusted, not least because the group is a long-time ally of al-Qaeda,” the Congressmen said.

Indeed, if the initial US-Taliban deal had been approved in September as was originally planned, one of the top al-Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan Asim Umar would likely still be alive, the letter said.

“Umar threatened America and answered directly to al-Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri. He was reportedly killed in a joint U.S.-Afghan raid on a Taliban stronghold in September after President Trump suspended talks with the Taliban.

“It is our understanding that under the current deal, such raids are not taking place - meaning that if Umar had survived a few months longer, he would be outside America’s reach,” it added.

The agreement struck during the talks between the U.S. and the Taliban, if maintained, may secure a peace deal that would lead to a withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan, fulfilling a campaign promise of President Trump.

27,2020/02/28,IOC ‘committed’ to Tokyo Games despite virus: Olympics chief,"The IOC ""is fully committed to a successful Olympic Games in Tokyo starting July 24,"" Thomas Bach told Japanese media in a conference call late Thursday, according to Kyodo News.

The International Olympic Committee is ""committed"" to holding the 2020 Games in Tokyo as planned despite the widening new coronavirus outbreak, the body's president has pledged.

The IOC ""is fully committed to a successful Olympic Games in Tokyo starting July 24,"" Thomas Bach told Japanese media in a conference call late Thursday, according to Kyodo News.

The statement came as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday requested the closure of schools nationwide in a drive to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

Japan has so far seen four deaths related to the virus, among nearly 200 known infections.

Some 700 infections were also detected among about 3,700 passengers and crew on a cruise ship that was moored off Japan after one of its former passengers tested positive.

Mr. Bach avoided directly addressing comments by senior IOC member Dick Pound, who hinted the Games could be cancelled if health authorities block travel.

Mr. Pound also said, however, there has been no formal discussion among IOC members about cancelling the Games.

Mr. Bach said the priority ""is to ensure the qualification procedure and protecting the safety of athletes at the same time"", according to Kyodo.

""This is what we're doing in cooperation with the Japanese authorities, the World Health Organization, the Chinese Olympic Committee and many NOCS,"" Bach said, referring to national Olympic committees.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k2eoel/article30939665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OLYMPICS-IOC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ioc-committed-to-tokyo-games-despite-virus-olympics-chief/article30939666.ece

31,2020/02/28,33 Turkish soldiers killed in Syria’s Idlib,"Dozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment, Rahmi Dogan, governor of Turkish Hatay -- bordering Syria -- said on Friday.

At least 33 Turkish soldiers were killed as violence escalates in Syria's Idlib province after an air strike blamed on Damascus, with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemning ""indiscriminate"" attacks by the Assad regime and Russia.

Dozens more soldiers were injured and taken to Turkey for treatment, Rahmi Dogan, governor of Turkish Hatay -- bordering Syria -- said Friday.

The heavy losses in northwestern Idlib come after weeks of growing tensions between rebel supporter Ankara and Damascus ally Moscow.

Mr. Stoltenberg ""urged all parties to de-escalate this dangerous situation and avoid further worsening of the horrendous humanitarian situation in the region"", his spokesman said Friday.

In a phone call with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the NATO secretary general ""condemned the continued indiscriminate air strikes by the Syrian regime and its backer Russia in Idlib province"", according to the spokesman.

Turkey has urged the Syrian regime to withdraw from Turkish observation posts in Idlib, while Moscow has accused Ankara of aiding ""terrorists"" in Syria.

Under a 2018 deal with Russia meant to bring calm to Idlib, Turkey has 12 observation posts in the region -- but several have come under fire from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hastily convened an emergency meeting in Ankara after the Idlib attack.

Erdogan's top press aide, Fahrettin Altun, said Turkey's military retaliated against all known positions of the regime after the air strike.

In a statement, Mr. Altun called on the international community to fulfil its responsibilities to end the violence in Idlib and the regime's ""crimes against humanity"".

The latest attack means 53 Turkish security personnel have been killed in the province this month.

There was a flurry of diplomatic activity as Turkey's presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin spoke with U.S. national security advisor, Robert O'Brien, state news agency Anadolu reported without giving detail.

More civilians killed

Jihadists and Turkish-backed rebels on Thursday re-entered Saraqeb, a key Idlib crossroads town they had lost earlier in February, reversing one of the main gains of the government's devastating offensive.

The counteroffensive could, however, be short-lived as Russian-backed Syrian troops continued to chip away at other parts of the rebel bastion, capturing 20 localities.

Seven civilians, including three children, were killed in regime and Russian bombardment of Idlib, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, adding to more than 400 such deaths since December.

The UN Security Council, where Moscow has systematically vetoed truce initiatives, met again Thursday amid growing concern Idlib is witnessing the nine-year-old war's worst humanitarian emergency.

State news agency SANA acknowledged there were ""fierce clashes"" between the army and ""terrorist groups on the Saraqeb front"".

An AFP correspondent accompanied the rebels into Saraqeb, where he found a ghost town of bombed out buildings.

The counterattack temporarily reverses one of the key gains of the government since its offensive against the country's last rebel enclave in December.

Refugee fears

The cash-strapped government had been keen to fully secure the M5, a highway that connects Syria's four main cities and passes through Saraqeb.

The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes were carried out by Assad government ally Russia, heavily criticised by the West for the high civilian death toll from its bombing campaign.

State media accused the ""terrorists"" of launching car bombings and other suicide attacks against government forces attempting to retake the town.

It said the army had inflicted heavy losses on the attackers, despite the military support it said they had received from Turkey.

Some 950,0000 civilians have fled the government offensive, raising fears in Ankara of a new influx of refugees.

Turkey already hosts the world's largest number of Syrian refugees -- around 3.6 million people -- placing an increasingly unpopular burden on public services.

The country's ruling party spokesman Omer Celik told CNN Turk broadcaster Friday Ankara was not in a position to ""hold"" refugees any longer and called on the European Union to do more.

More than half a million of those displaced since December are children, tens of thousands of whom are sleeping rough in northern Syria's harsh winter.

UN powerlessness

The Turkish president vowed Wednesday Ankara would not take the ""smallest step back"" in the standoff with Damascus and Moscow over Idlib.

Mr. Erdogan warned the Syrian government to ""stop its attacks as soon as possible"" and to pull back by the end of the month.

The UN has repeatedly warned the fighting in Idlib could potentially create the most serious humanitarian crisis since the civil war's start in 2011.

Nine out of 15 members of the Security Council on Wednesday urged Secretary General Antonio Guterres to step up his involvement in efforts to restore peace in Idlib.

South Korea on February 28 reported 256 new coronavirus cases, taking its total — the highest in the world outside China — to 2,022, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

More than 90% of the new cases were in Daegu — the city at the epicentre of the outbreak in South Korea — and the neighbouring North Gyeongsang province, it added, with no further deaths keeping the toll at 13.

China reported 44 more deaths from the novel coronavirus epidemic on February 28 and 327 fresh cases, the lowest daily figure for new infections in more than a month. The death toll now stands at 2,788 in mainland China, according to the National Health Commission.

The number of fatalities — which is up from the 29 reported on Thursday — were all in Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, except for two deaths in Beijing.

In total, 78,824 people have now been infected with the COVID-19 strain in the mainland.

Friday's figure was the lowest rise in new cases since January 24, when 259 new infections were reported.

Wall Street stocks were pummeled again Thursday as the further spread of the coronavirus exacerbated fears of a global slowdown and raised the risk of a US recession.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 1,200 points or 4.4 percent, to finish at 25,766.64, its worst session in more than two years.

The broad-based S&P 500 also slumped 4.4 percent to 2,978.76, its first close below 3,000 since October. And the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 4.6 percent to end at 8,566.48.

The losses set Wall Street on pace for its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis, as investors continued to flee equities into safer investments like US Treasuries and gold.

The virus has now spread to 50 countries, with cases confirmed in the last day in the United States and Spain that appeared to be contracted locally.

Maris Ogg of Tower Bridge Advisors said there were still too many unknowns about the scale of the global outbreak and that “we're not going to know the answer for a while, probably at least two to four weeks.”

The market's losses have been exacerbated in the US by the lofty valuations that lifted indices to a series of records only weeks ago.

“It's understandable that not only do you have something to worry about, which we haven't had for a while, but we're also due for a correction,” Ogg said.

The Dow was a sea of red, with 3M the only gainer due to robust demand for face masks to guard against the virus.

Other large companies, including Apple, Boeing, Microsoft and Procter & Gamble lost more than five percent.

Markets have been rattled by the prospect that lockdown measures such as those employed in China will become more widespread, denting global growth and producing a “nesting” impulse in the consumer-driven US economy, especially coming at a time when many economies already are fragile.

Goldman Sachs was the latest to issue a warning on Thursday when it slashed its 2020 forecast for US earnings, estimating that it now expects flat earnings in 2020 and lower growth in 2021.

“Our reduced forecasts re?ect the severe decline in Chinese economic activity in (the first quarter), lower end-demand for US exporters, supply chain disruption, a slowdown in US economic activity, and elevated uncertainty,” Goldman said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/business/article17093434.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dow%20Jones,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-stocks-drop-more-than-40-extending-rout-amid-virus-fears/article30937248.ece
34,2020/02/28,Reproductive rights of women are not up for negotiation: Gita Sen,"The pioneering feminist scholar talks about pushing the government to support women’s reproductive rights, and putting women at the centre of population and development policies

A trained economist and feminist scholar, Gita Sen is director of The Ramalingaswami Centre on Equity and Social Determinants, Public Health Foundation of India, and adjunct professor at Harvard University. She was the only Indian among 10 global leaders awarded by UNFPA for their work on population and development at the recently-concluded International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD+25) Summit in Nairobi. Sen was also one of the movers at ICPD-Cairo in 1994, which put women’s rights and gender equality in the spotlight for the first time. Last month, she won the prestigious Dan David Prize for her pioneering work in advancing gender equality, population policies, reproductive and sexual health, and women’s human rights. Excerpts from an interview:

Having actively participated in the ICPD at Cairo (1994) and at its 25th anniversary in Nairobi last year, what have been some of the gains so far?

The biggest gain which could never have happened without ICPD is the change in how we think about population, family planning, contraception and child bearing. It may be hard to imagine but prior to the Cairo ICPD, whenever population conferences took place, there would be no mention of sex or reproduction.

This changed after Cairo. Earlier, the thrust was on fertility control. So, even if women and girls were talked about, it was mainly around how to control their fertility to reduce the population. The change came about by putting women at the centre of population and development. And it was women who put women at the centre in Cairo. So, the normative shift is not small. However, there is still unfinished business — ensuring women’s right to bodily autonomy and integrity, including the right to a safe abortion, when needed.

How did the Cairo gains translate for India?

The big gain was that the Indian government signed up. We worked closely with them in Cairo so they would support the rights of women and girls and promote gender equality. After Cairo, the government said they would get rid of population targets. They changed the population policy. This was the big shift.

Female sterilisation in India stands at over 98%. So what has really changed?

Because the norm has changed, we can keep pushing against the wrong actions and demand accountability. We are a highly class divided society. The middle class loves to think that it is not its consumption but that of others that does the damage. But one child of a middle-class parent does far more damage to the environment than the third child of a domestic worker. Also, there is demographic evidence that if you control for levels of income and education, childbearing of all religions is exactly the same.

But is anyone paying attention to this evidence?

We have to keep saying it. I’ll give you an example. Some years ago, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka went to China and was very taken with the Chinese one-child norm, one of the most coercive population policies in the world. Even China has given it up. Anyway, he came back, and said Karnataka must have a policy like that because population growth needs to be reduced.

Some people came to me to ask how they could tell him it wasn’t needed. I told them to simply tell him that Karnataka’s population had already gone below the replacement level fertility.

So he didn’t know?

No. This is why women’s groups, human rights advocates, young people and the media are critical. They have to keep bringing it up. We have good health policies that are keeping with the norms. But the next steps — implementation and resources, financial and human — are lost somehow. We have to take everyone along and that means upholding people’s rights and making them believe it is their agenda. You can build toilets all your life but you can’t make people use them if they don’t believe in it or if there isn’t enough water. You can’t have a top-down approach.

Has the decline in maternal mortality rate (MMR) come at a price since the number of female sterilisations remains very high?

In the southern states, some level of non-fulfilment of rights was there but, by and large, MMR has come down with increasing age of marriage, education and availability of services. Once women start reaching certain levels of education and income earning, they don’t want to have many children. I think we need to do better if we have to fulfil women’s rights in the area of provision of contraception services. We should follow a very different approach in terms of the information we give women and the services we provide, instead of rounding them all up and throwing them in (sterilisation) camps, like we have been doing all along.

But what about the PM’s push for a two-child policy in some States?

The majority of the country is at or below 2.1 TFR (total fertility rate). So, someone is giving the wrong advice to the PM. The health ministry needs to tell him that the two-child policy is not needed. We have spent a lot of time explaining the population momentum to the health ministry. Even if people have one child, we will have population growth. We have known it for years now that more than 70% of our population growth is coming from this population momentum because India has a high proportion of people in the reproductive age group. What we need to do is raise the age of marriage, improve secondary schooling for girls, provide comprehensive sexuality education and implement the ICPD programme of action, including access to safe abortion services. The delay in tabling the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) (Amendment) Bill, 2019, is unacceptable. Reproductive rights of women are not up for negotiation.

What does the Indian government need to do post ICPD+25?

Constitute an advisory group of researchers, academics, women’s groups and young people to chart out a strategy for changing the system. India’s commitments at ICPD+25 will help us push harder for women’s rights. Women’s groups must hold the government accountable. There is much to do but I’m optimistic because there are a lot of pressure groups, including the disability and LGBTQIA+ groups, that are willing to work together and bring the momentum back. I believe young people, who are as vocal on climate change as they are on sexual and reproductive health and human rights, will be crucial in bringing about this change.

35,2020/02/28,This 68-year-old farmer rides across 25 states advocating organ donation,"Pramod Mahajan, a resident of Dhavli, Maharashtra is visiting 94 cities in 128-days on his bike

“Empathy is a lesson we all need to learn. Stepping up to help each other in times of need will make the world a better place,” says 68-year-old Pramod Mahajan, who is on a mission to raise awareness about organ donation across India. A volunteer at Pune’s Rebirth Foundation, he will visit 94 cities across 25 states during his 128-day tour. His journey, which started on January 18 from Pune is scheduled to end on May 25, when he returns after travelling 17,500 kilometres.

From Maharashtra, he rode through the cooler highlands and tea estates of Western Ghats in Karnataka to reach the tranquil backwaters of Kerala. From there, he rode through the coastal plains of Tamil Nadu to reach Visakhapatnam. However, Pramod’s focus is not on towns and cities, but on the rural areas. “People in cities are educated and have easy access to a lot of information, but educating small-town people about the advances in medical science and the number of lives they can save by donating their organs is the aim of my ride,” he says. Pramod has attached a carrier to the rear of his Bajaj Avenger Cruise 220, that explains his mission. He also stops at popular tea stalls and dhabas to reach out to more people. “People get curious when they see my bike and that helps me explain the need for organ donation. I tell them anecdotes about lives that were saved due to organ donation.” Of the several stories he tells, one comes from his life. In 2000, Pramod donated his kidney to an ex-army man from his village who was struggling to find a suitable donor. “None of the family members’ kidney was compatible with his, so I decided to donate mine. I was well aware that people can survive with one kidney. It has been 20 years and I am fit as a fiddle,” he smiles.

Onward journey From Visakhapatnam, Pramod will ride through Odisha, West Bengal, Bihar, Sikkim, Nagaland, Manipur Assam, Mizoram, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujrat.

A resident of Dhavli, a village in the Sangli district of Maharashtra, Pramod is not an avid biker but hopped on to promote his cause. He has done a similar trip earlier.Last year, he travelled 12,500 kilometres and visited 19 States to interact with people. “The overwhelming response I received made me do it for the second time. Last year, over 250 policemen in Bhopal filled the organ donation form after attending my session.”

His urge to create awareness about medical issues goes back to 2009 when he set out on a self-financed trip across four States to talk about AIDS. “That ride was probably the toughest, as I did not have enough money for my travels. So I went scurrying through junk yards to find discarded spare parts of trucks and sold them to earn money. However, the fact that my attempts could save at least one life is what keeps me going.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/9c0kht/article30941691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27VZPRAMOD1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/this-68-year-old-farmer-is-riding-across-25-states-advocating-organ-donation/article30941692.ece
36,2020/02/28,Sedition case: AAP government gives nod to prosecute Kanhaiya Kumar,"The opposition BJP alleged that the move was in line with the prevailing “political situation” in the Capital amid violent clashes.

The Delhi government has given its go-ahead to the Delhi Police to prosecute former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar and nine others in connection with a sedition case registered against them in February, 2016.

On January 14, the police had filed a chargesheet against Mr. Kumar and the others allegedly involved in a procession where they had allegedly supported seditious slogans raised on the varsity's campus during an event on February 9, 2016.

The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that the move was in line with the prevailing “political situation” in the Capital amid violent clashes.

While the official order in this regard, issued by the Delhi government's Deputy Secretary (Home) was dated February 27 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokesperson and Rajender Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha, in a statement, said the prosecution was sanctioned on February 20.

“Sedition specifically requires the sanction of the government before the prosecution can go ahead. The @AamAadmiParty cannot spin this as a regular policy of ‘non-interference’ with the criminal process. The government's decision to grant or withhold sanction ‘is’ the process,” Gautam Bhatia, lawyer and columnist, tweeted.

According to the order, the Delhi government, in exercise of the powers conferred by sub-section (1) of section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure “...grants prosecution sanction against the accused namely (1) Kanhaiya Kumar (2) Syed Umar Khalid (3) Anirban Bhattacharya (4) Aquib Hussain (5) Mujeeb Hussain Gattoo (6) Muneeb Hussain Gattoo (7) Umair Gul (8) Rayees Rasool (9) Basharat Ali (10) Khalid Bashir Bhat who have prima facie committed an offence punishable under section 124A & 120B IPC 1860...”

“The Law Department of Delhi government has, after conducting due diligence, given its opinion on this matter to the Home department. It is pertinent to mention that the Government of Delhi, as a matter of policy and as a matter of principle, does not and has not intervened in any of such cases. Our government has not stopped prosecution in any case, whatsoever, in the last 5 years,” Mr. Chadha stated.

“This is purely a procedural matter. We believe that judiciary and judiciary alone should decide on the merits of each case. It is not for governments to decide on the merits of such cases,” the statement said further adding that the sanction was granted by Delhi Government on February 20, 2020.

Mr. Kumar, in a tweet, said he welcomed the Delhi government's decision in this regard. “Thanks to the Delhi government for giving permission in the sedition case. I request the Delhi Police and government lawyers to ensure that the case is taken more seriously, that there is a speedy trial in a fast track court, and that justice is ensured in an actual court of law instead of one on TV...”

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, in a statement on the matter, said, “Probably keeping the current political situation in mind, CM, Arvind Kejriwal has finally given sanction to prosecute former JNUSU leader Kanhaiya Kumar. We welcome the decision...We would now like Mr. Kejriwal to help police arrest AAP councillor Tahir Hussain...”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fokbc0/article30945994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-KANHAIYAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kanhaiya-kumar-sedition-case-aap-government-gives-go-ahead-to-delhi-police/article30946003.ece
37,2020/02/28,NIA makes first arrest in Pulwama case,"Shakir Bashir Magrey, a 22-year-old furniture shop owner in south Kashmir, is an overground worker of the Jaish-e-Mohammed.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is said to have made a breakthrough in the Pulwama terror attack case, with the arrest of a 22-year-old furniture shop owner in south Kashmir. Forty CRPF jawans were killed in the suicide attack on February 14, 2019.

The NIA said Magrey, a resident of Kakapora in Pulwama, is an overground worker of the Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).

“Magrey provided shelter and other assistance to suicide-bomber Adil Ahmad Dar. He was introduced to Dar in mid-2018 by Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Umar Farooq, and he became a full-time overground worker of the JeM. During his initial interrogation, he disclosed that on several occasions, he had collected and delivered arms and ammunition, cash and explosives to JeM terrorists, including those involved in the Pulwama attack,” the NIA said in a statement.

The NIA said, “Magrey revealed he had harboured Adil Ahmad Dar and Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Umar Farooq in his house from late 2018 till the attack in February 2019, and assisted them in the preparation of the improvised explosive device (IED).”

On February 14, 2019, Dar rammed a car into a CRPF bus on the Jammu-Srinagar Highway, near Pulwama. All 40 jawans in the bus were killed. The JeM is a Pakistan-based terrorist outfit and is headed by UN-designated global terrorist Masood Azhar.

Magrey’s shop is located near the Lethpora bridge, where the attack occurred, and as advised by Umar Farooq, he conducted reconnaissance of the movement of the CRPF convoy in January 2019.

“Further, he was also involved in modifying the car and fitting the IED in it in early February.”

“The explosives used in the attack were determined, through a forensic investigation, to be Ammonium Nitrate, Nitro-Glycerin and RDX,” the NIA said. The NIA is yet to trace the source of the high-grade military explosives.

An NIA official said DNA samples were extracted from the “meagre fragments of the car” and were matched with Dar’s father to establish the suicide-bomber’s identity.

The two main suspects — Mudasir Ahmed Khan and Sajjad Bhat, the owner of the car — were killed in an encounter with security forces on March 3, 2019 and June 16 last respectively.

The third suspect Kamran, an expert in assembling IEDs, and the fourth suspect, Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Umar Farooq, were killed on March 29, 2019. The fifth suspect Qari Mufti Yasser, JeM’s south Kashmir commander, was killed in an encounter on January 25, 2020.

Magrey was produced before the NIA special court in Jammu and remanded in custody for 15 days.

After the attack, the JeM released a video claiming credit for the attack. It identified the suicide-bomber as Dar, a resident of Kakapora in Pulwama, who joined the outfit in 2018.

The car was first sold in 2011 and was then resold several times before Sajjad Bhat bought it on February 4, 10 days before the attack. Mudasir Ahmed Khan, the other suspect killed in an encounter, had arranged the explosives, the NIA had said earlier.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rr1cen/article30945905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PULWAMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nia-makes-first-arrest-in-pulwama-case/article30945906.ece

39,2020/02/28,Delhi HC hears plea for FIRs against Cong. leaders,"Court seeks response of Centre and Delhi government

The Delhi High Court on Friday sought the response of the Centre, the Delhi government and the police to the petitions for FIRs against political figures, including Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, for allegedly making hate speeches.

One of the petitions by a lawyers’ group has sought filing of FIRs against the Congress leaders, and Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Amanatullah Khan, AIMIM leader Akbaruddin Owaisi and former AIMIM MLA Waris Pathan for allegedly making hate speeches.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar issued notice to the Centre, the Delhi government and the police on the petition by ‘Lawyers Voice’, which has also sought the constitution of a special investigation team to look into the alleged hate speeches.

The court also issued notice to the Centre, the Delhi government and the police on three separate applications — by Sanjjiiv Kkumaar, Vishnu Gupta and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad.

Mr. Kkumaar has sought FIRs against Mr. Amanatullah Khan, actor Swara Bhasker and radio jockey Sayema for their alleged hate speeches. He has also sought an FIR against activist Harsh Mander, who had filed the petition seeking an FIR against BJP leaders Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Kapil Mishra.

Mr. Gupta, who runs an organisation called Hindu Sena, has sought FIRs against Mr. Pathan, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi and Akbaruddin Owaisi.

Mr. Chandrashekhar Azad, in his application, has sought an FIR against Mr. Kapil Mishra.

40,2020/02/28,Delhi violence | Opposition parties seek President’s intervention,"Demand filing of FIRs against all who made “provocative hate speeches” and those responsible for Delhi riots

In a joint letter to President Ramnath Kovind, the AAP, DMK, RJD, CPI(M), CPI, NCP and the Lok Tantrik Janata Dal have sought his intervention to ensure that FIRs are filed immediately against all who had made “provocative hate speeches” and those responsible for the Delhi riots.

CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI general secretary D. Raja, DMK Lok Sabha leader T.R. Baalu, RJD Rajya Sabha member Manoj K Jha, NCP Rajya Sabha member Praful Patel and Lok Tantrik Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav met on Friday morning to discuss the Delhi riots and the fallout. They had earlier sought time to meet the President but his office conveyed that he was not available till March 2.

“An immediate establishment of peace and a direction to the concerned authorities like Lt. Governor of Delhi who is directly answerable to you to ensure the speedy restoration of normalcy. And to ensure that FIR must be filed immediately against all who have made provocative hate speeches and the perpetrators of this violence must be brought to book,” says the joint memorandum.

The Congress met the President on Thursday to seek normalcy and peace in the areas hit by violence, and demanded Union Home Minister Amit Shah's resignation.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Yechury said it was unfortunate that political parties had to appeal to the President of India to get an FIR registered against those who instigated riots. The parties had to take the abnormal course because no other option was available. “The Delhi Police is more interested in filing FIRs against civil activists who are providing relief for the victims of the riots like Harsh Mander and the actual perpetrators are going scot-free”.

Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh asked why the BJP was not taking action against those openly giving inflammatory speeches. “The court has taken the name of Kapil Mishra, Pravesh Verma and Anurag Thakur, then why no action is being taken by the BJP. Is any law and order left in this country. Their own MP Gautam Gambhir is demanding action against them, their allies are asking for action, but they are roaming freely”, he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xlp52n/article30945550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-Left,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-parties-seek-presidents-intervention/article30945546.ece
41,2020/02/28,"Shah, NIA chief should go, says Congress","The Congress also questioned the NIA’s assertion that a chargesheet couldn’t be filed because of lack of sufficient evidence

Home Minister Amit Shah and National Investigation Agency (NIA) chief Y.C. Modi have no right to remain in their posts after a court granted bail to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror conspiracy case accused Yusuf Chopan due to “inadequate evidence”, the Congress said on Friday.

Addressing a press conference, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi asked why the NIA had not issued a signed statement stating that Chopan had not been arrested in the Pulwama terror attack case.

In the statement, the NIA had said the bail was granted to Chopan in a terror conspiracy case and not the February 2019 attack case. However, this press statement has not been uploaded on its website.

“We demand the resignation of the Home Minister and the NIA chief,” he said as he posed a list of questions to the government. “Is a person named Yusuf Chopan a terrorist of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM)? Well, the answer is ‘yes’. Is JeM not responsible for the Parliament attack, Pulwama and many similar terrorist attacks?” Mr. Singhvi asked.

The Congress also questioned the NIA’s assertion that a chargesheet couldn’t be filed because of lack of sufficient evidence. “Isn’t this the worst example of treason?” he further asked and added, “either the government is incompetent or it is guilty of lying”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/udbmum/article30945400.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AbhishekManuSinghvi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shah-nia-chief-should-go-says-congress/article30945401.ece
42,2020/02/28,69 killed in 79 days since Parliament passed Citizenship Amendment Act,"While the number of deaths mounts, the Ministry of Home Affairs is yet to notify rules that will make the CAA operational.

As many as 69 people have been killed in various incidents in the 79 days since the Citizenship Amendment Act was passed by the Parliament on December 11.

While the number of deaths mount, and more than two months have elapsed since Parliament ratified the legislation, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is yet to notify the rules that will make the CAA operational.

The CAA allows citizenship on the basis of religion to undocumented non-Muslim migrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

Also Read BJP takes out pro-CAA rally in southern districts

Senior MHA officials asserted that the rules were still under construction. “The rules cannot be outside the purview of the Act, they will reflect the provisions of the Act but it will not be possible to give a deadline as to when it will be notified,” said a senior MHA official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Also read | Opinion: Citizenship Amendment Act - the fear factor

Another MHA official added that as and when the rules are finalised and published in the official gazette, it would be tabled in the Parliament, within 15 days if it is in session or on the first day of the commencement of the next session.

According to the Manual on Parliamentary Work, “statutory rules, regulations and bye-laws will be framed within a period of six months from the date on which the relevant statute came into force.”

Also Read Opposition inciting riots over CAA, says Amit Shah

The manual states that in case the Ministries/Departments are not able to frame the rules within the prescribed period of six months, “they should seek extension of time from the Committee on Subordinate Legislation stating reasons for such extension” which cannot be more than for a period of three months at a time. The request should be made after obtaining the approval of the Minister, according to the manual.

After the CAA was enacted, six people were killed in Assam, 19 in Uttar Pradesh, two in Karnataka and 42 have been killed so far in the communal riots in Delhi.

Several areas in Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Telengana and Karnataka have witnessed protests against the CAA and its link with a proposed countrywide National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

Several Opposition ruled States have opposed the proposed NPR survey, slated to begin from April 1 along with the decennial Census exercise. According to the Citizenship Rules 2003, NPR is the first step towards compilation of NRC. The NPR form is yet to be finalised and notified but the trial form last year collected details from 30 lakh respondents on 21 parameters including “place of birth of father and mother, last place of residence.”

Amid opposition, the Government informed the Lok Sabha on February 4 that “till now, the government has not taken any decision to prepare National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC) at the national level.”

After several deaths in U.P., Prime Minister Narendra Modi had sought to allay the fears in a public rally on December 22 when he asserted that there had been no discussion, no talk on an NRC for India since his government had taken power in 2014.

However, on December 9, during a discussion on the CAA in the Lok Sabha, Union Home minister Amit Shah had said “there is no need to create a background for NRC, we are clear that NRC ought to be done in this country, our (BJP) manifesto is the background”.

The CAA has the provision to grant citizenship to undocumented members of six minority communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh — Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi — who entered India before December 31, 2014. Though the Act does not mention “persecuted minorities,” the term was included in the statement of objects when the Bill was introduced in the Parliament.

Several groups in Assam have opposed the CAA as it violates the provision of the 1985 Assam Accord that called for “detection and deportation” of all persons who entered the State from Bangladesh post March 24, 1971. Assam’s Supreme Court-monitored NRC, which was published on August 31 last year and excluded 19 lakh of the 3.4 crore applicants, was a fallout of the Assam Accord.

The CAA was passed by Parliament on December 11.

43,2020/02/28,"Indians hold religious freedom dearer than free media, speech or judiciary: Pew survey","Indians also don’t seem to value a free civil society, according to the report’s authors

Freedom of religion, at 78%, remained the top priority for Indians in 2019, significantly eclipsing the levels of support for a free media, freedom of speech and a fair judiciary, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.

Only 37% Indians believe it is very important to have a free media without government/state censorship, a report based on the survey’s findings, released on Thursday, show. While support for freedom of the press rose since 2015 in several nations including France, the U.K. and Turkey (where it jumped by 19 percentage points), the U.S. (by 13 points) and Australia (by 12 points), in India backing for a free media plunged by four percentage points. The median across the 34 nations polled was 64%, and only Lebanon and Tunisia in the Middle East/North Africa region scored less than India, at 28% and 33%, respectively. Greece (89%), Sweden (82%) and the U.S. (80%), meanwhile, led the pack in favour of a free press.

In contrast, freedom of religion, at 78%, remained the top priority for India this time too — in 2015, it was five percentage points higher at 83%. Across the countries, a median of 68% consider freedom of religion as very important. “However, it is the lowest priority in several more secular nations, especially in Europe, where the French, Swedes, Spanish and Dutch all rate it their lowest priority,” wrote the authors of the report titled ‘Democratic Rights Popular Globally but Commitment to Them Not Always Strong.’ Evidently for India, support for freedom of religion remained at odds with backing for freedom of speech, which was favoured by just 32%, the lowest among all countries. This was a 12 percentage points plunge from 2015.

The report however includes a key caveat on the findings on free media and speech where it concerns India as 20% or more of the respondents did not answer the questions relating to these two parameters.

The U.S.-based think tank conducted the survey among 38,426 people in 34 countries last year, between May 13 and October 2. The report analyses how people around the world see the state of democracy in their country on nine parameters: fair judiciary, gender equality, free religion, regular elections, free speech, free media, free Internet, free civil society, and free opposition parties.

Pew noted that globally, people were more dissatisfied (a median of 52%) than satisfied (a median of 44%) with the way democracy was working in their country. “Discontent is often more common among people with lower incomes,” wrote the report’s authors. In India, meanwhile, 70% of people said they were satisfied as compared with 26% who were not. And, while a median of 64% disagreed with the statement “most elected officials care what people like me think,” the number stood at just 31% in India. In the U.S., for instance, that figure was 71%. The free operation of opposition political parties garnered the least support among the nine attributes linked to democracy. While 67% people in the U.S. and Canada favoured free opposition parties, a mere 37% of Indians supported it.

Indians also don’t seem to value a free civil society, according to the report’s authors. Just 35% said it was very important for human rights organisations to operate freely in their country. This was the lowest support by a country, after Russia (at 31%).

Also, the idea of a fair judiciary is “the most vital — a median of 82% say it is very important, and, of the nine items tested, it has the highest percentage describing it as very important in 19 countries (it has the second-highest percentage in 10 countries),” the report’s authors observed. India, however, ranks the lowest on that count as well, with just 58% people supporting it. This was in stark contrast to Greece and Hungary (95% each).

Internet freedom received somewhat lower support overall across the 34 countries, with a median of 59% considering it very important.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indians-hold-religious-freedom-dearer-than-free-media-speech-or-judiciary-pew-survey/article30944515.ece
44,2020/02/28,Congress slams ‘political’ interest litigation,"Party was responding to HC notice on plea for FIRs against Sonia, Rahul, Priyanka

Courts should follow their own rules to ensure that public interest litigation (PILs) do not become ‘political interest litigation’, the Congress said on Friday.

The party’s assertion came soon after a Bench of the Delhi High Court issued a notice to the Centre and the Delhi government on a petition seeking FIRs against Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra among others.

“Notice is not automatic and should never be automatic in PILs. Do you know who has filed this petition?” asked Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi at a press conference and alleged that the petitioner was a former Advocate General of Madhya Pradesh during the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government.

The Congress spokesperson, who is also a senior Advocate of the Supreme Court, said his party would question the maintainability of such a petition.

“When we move the High Court, we will ask the court how was a notice issued in the first place? These are all important questions. We will give a very comprehensive, strong and befitting reply but let me tell you that the whole world is receiving FIRs but the whole doesn’t include the great Mr Kapil Mishra, the great and only Mr. Anurag Thakur, Mr. Parvesh Verma. Not even an FIR after months,” Mr. Singhvi said. Mr Mishra, Mr Thakur and Mr Verma are BJP lawmakers who made provocative speeches during the campaign for the Delhi Assembly elections earlier this month.

The Congress leader said even though 39 people had died in the Delhi riots, no FIR has been registered against the BJP leaders who made hate speeches.

“The Election Commission has not taken notice, the National Human Rights Commission has not taken any notice, agencies are sleeping but when the division bench of Delhi High Court the day before yesterday asks the question, a judge is transferred under a remarkable order,” Mr. Singhvi said.

The Congress also responded to Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s comments that the party should not teach them raj dharma (duty of rulers) as Congress’s own history is full of twists and turns like starting the national population register (NPR) earlier but now opposing it.

Reacting to Mr Prasad’s reported comments that violence in north-east Delhi was instigated by speeches of Opposition leaders, Mr Singhvi said, “I would like him to arrest all of us including those sitting on this podium because we are speaking peacefully in a democratic country against what we believe is a wrong move. I am saying it right now and daring anyone to arrest me.”

“National Register of Citizens is a wrong. If you think that is sedition, if you think that is anti-national, if you think that is provocation and incitement, then I think it is a matter of shame. It’s a shame if we have to live in a country where this free speech without violence, peaceful protest is so treated,” the Congress leader said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/25oa2x/article30944344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-AbhishekSinghvi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cong-slams-political-interest-litigation/article30944354.ece
45,2020/02/28,"Delhi violence | Don’t preach ‘raj dharma’ to govt, BJP tells Sonia","Congress’s own record on this was “full of twists and turns”, says Ravi Shankar Prasad

The BJP on Friday asked Congress president Sonia Gandhi “not to preach on ‘raj dharma’” to the current government as the Congress’s own record on this was “full of twists and turns”. It also alleged that the communal violence in north-east Delhi was an outcome of “instigation” by the Opposition.

Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s observations came at a presser at the BJP’s headquarters in New Delhi a day after the Congress, led by Ms Gandhi, met President Ram Nath Kovind and submitted a memorandum demanding the resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah for ‘dereliction of duty’ in protecting people of all faiths and failure to adhering to “raj dharma”.

Asked about controversial remarks made by the BJP leaders like Kapil Mishra and Parvesh Verma, Mr. Prasad said the party did not approve such statements. “Sonia Gandhi, please don't preach us 'raj dharma'; your record is full of twists and turns”. The National Population of Register (NPR) was started by the Congress-led regime, he observed.

“If Congress does something, it is good. But if we do the same thing, they provoke people. What type of raj dharma is this”, he asked.

‘Fight to finish’ remarks

Referring to the Congress chief's remarks of “fight to finish” at a rally in Ramlila Maidan last year, Mr Prasad asked whether such remarks did not constitute provocation. He alleged that the Congress could stoop to any level for “vote bank” politics. It should act responsibly for maintaining peace and harmony, he added.

Also Read Opposition inciting riots over CAA, says Amit Shah

Mr. Prasad accused the Congress of changing its stand on granting citizenship to persecuted minorities in the neighbouring countries. Such demands for citizenship were regularly made by not just former Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi but also by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

On the transfer of Delhi High Court judge Justice S Muralidhar, Mr. Prasad said the Modi government had great commitment to judicial, media and individual freedom and it was one of its “fundamentals”.

The Minister reiterated that Justice Muralidhar's transfer had nothing to do with any case, as a recommendation to this effect was already made by the Supreme Court collegium and the judge had also given his consent.

“It [transfer] was part of the process. By the same process, dozens of judges have been transferred”. It was the Congress’s record that had been patchy over the issue as witnessed by its actions with regard to the judiciary during the Emergency.

Mr Prasad said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and many other senior functionaries of this government, including himself, had fought against the Emergency for individual, judicial and media freedom. “Our commitment to these freedoms, have been a fundamental [to the government],” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/n2lfhr/article30944020.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-RaviShankarPrasad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dont-preach-raj-dharma-to-govt-bjp-tells-sonia/article30944024.ece

47,2020/02/28,India to attend U.S.-Taliban peace deal ceremony in Doha,"Kabul has sent a six-member official delegation, which will begin the intra-Afghan negotiations with the Taliban soon after the peace deal with the U.S.

India has accepted an invitation to witness the signing of the U.S.-Taliban peace deal in Doha, official sources confirmed. India’s Ambassador to Qatar P. Kumaran will represent the country at Saturday’s event, which will be hosted by the Government of Qatar and will be attended by representatives of about 24 countries.

Also Read Afghans celebrate as week-long truce with Taliban begins

The decision to send Mr. Kumaran to the ceremony came even as Kabul hosted Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla who met the Acting Foreign Minister of Afghanistan Haroon Chakhansuri in the Afghan capital. “Foreign Secretary conveyed India’s support for the people of Afghanistan in their pursuit for sustainable peace, security and development,” Ministry of External Affairs Official Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said after the meeting. “They reviewed and positively assessed developments in bilateral strategic partnership,” Mr. Kumar observed, adding that the Foreign Secretary reiterated India’s commitment to Afghanistan’s pursuit of “sustainable peace and reconciliation”.

Officials had earlier indicated that India would like the peace process to be inclusive — Afghan owned, Afghan led and Afghan controlled — and the participation of the Afghan government’s delegation in the ceremony in Doha would show that the upcoming intra-Afghan peace negotiations would be following the path desired by India. Kabul has sent a six-member official delegation, which will begin the intra-Afghan negotiations with the Taliban soon after the peace deal with the U.S. is signed on Saturday.

Officials here maintain that India will consider the sensitivities of the Kabul government while framing future policies regarding Afghanistan. The peace deal between the Taliban and the U.S. comes after a long and risky negotiation and includes several difficult proposals that will unfold in phases after the deal is signed. During this time, the Taliban had opened up formal channels of communication with other countries like China, Russia, Iran. However, India did not conduct any negotiations with the group.

The deal will face its first test when Kabul sits for negotiations with the Taliban as the latter has extracted a promise from the U.S. for freeing a large number of its cadre from the Afghan government’s prisons. That apart, the Taliban’s participation in the overground political process remains a difficult issue that will also be worked on after the signing of the accord.

Foreign Secretary conveyed India’s support for the people of Afghanistan in their pursuit for sustainable peace, security and development. — Raveesh Kumar (@MEAIndia) February 28, 2020

India has been a key stakeholder in the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan.

In a significant move, India had sent two former diplomats in “non-official” capacity to a conference on Afghan peace process in Moscow in November 2018.

The conference organised by Russia was attended by a high-level Taliban delegation, representatives of Afghanistan as well as from several other countries, including the U.S., Pakistan and China.

Major powers such as the U.S., Russia and Iran have been reaching out to the Taliban as part of efforts to push the stalled Afghan peace process.

India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan controlled.

India has also been maintaining that care should be taken to ensure that any such process does not lead to any “ungoverned spaces” where terrorists and their proxies can relocate.

Ahead of peace deal, India has conveyed to the U.S. that pressure on Pakistan to crack down on terror networks operating from its soil must be kept up though Islamabad’s cooperation for peace in Afghanistan is crucial.

49,2020/02/28,SC sends back Kerala’s plea on Thiruvananthapuram airport to HC,"The Supreme Court on Friday left it to the Kerala High Court to decide the merits of the Airport Authority of India's (AAI) 'Request for Proposal' to grant the right of operation, management and development of the Thiruvananthapuram Airport to Adani Enterprises Limited.

“We are sending it back”, a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde observed.

The High Court had, on December 18 last, concluded that the State’s writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution was not maintainable before it.

The AAI proposal to hand over the airport management to the company was essentially an implementation of the Central policy, the High Court had reasoned.

The High Court said the dispute was between the State of Kerala and the Union government. Only the Supreme Court, and not high courts, has jurisdiction in such Centre-State disputes. Kerala ought to directly file a suit under Article 131 in the Supreme Court, the High Court had advised.

Challenging this conclusion, the State contended in the Supreme Court that the AAI was a necessary party in this dispute. Though it was a government policy, it was the AAI that has to prepare the lease. The lease for turning over the airport to the Adani company would be bad in law without the AAA’s participation.

The State dismissed the idea of filing a direct suit in the Supreme Court under Article 131.

However, the Supreme Court, on Friday, left open the issue whether this dispute comes under Article 131.

The State government has contended that a suit under Article 131 is permitted only if the dispute is exclusively between the Centre and a State government. The AAI does not qualify to be called a ‘State’ under the Article. Hence, a suit under Article 131 cannot be filed in the Supreme Court because though the AAI is a necessary party to the dispute, it does not answer to the definition of a ‘State’. So, only a writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution would lie, it argued.

The State has said that handing over the airport to Adani Enterprises Limited, which has no previous experience in managing airports, is “not in public interest and is violative of the provisions of the Airport Authority of India Act of 1994 as well as the proprietary rights of the State government as regards the land wherein the Thiruvananthapuram Airport is situated”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-sends-back-keralas-plea-on-thiruvananthapuram-airport-to-hc/article30941788.ece
50,2020/02/28,March-May period likely to be hotter than normal: India Meteorological Department,"Above normal heat wave conditions likely in some areas.

The summer months from March to May are poised to be hotter than normal, a forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Friday.

The forecast indicates that the MAM (March-May) season averaged temperatures are likely to be at least half a degree hotter than normal over northwest, west and central India and some parts of south India. The season averaged maximum temperature is likely to be warmer than normal in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Rajasthan and Arunachal Pradesh.

It is likely to be warmer than normal by over 0.5C to <1C over Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi (HCD), west Uttar Pradesh, east Rajasthan, east and west Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, sub Himalayan West Bengal, Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch, Konkan and Goa, central Maharashtra, Marathawada, Vidharbha, north interior Karnataka, coastal Karnataka, Rayalaseema and Kerala.

Above normal heat wave conditions are also likely in the core heat wave (HW) zone during the season (March-May), the weather department said.

The core heat wave zone covers the States of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Telangana and parts of Maharashtra and coastal Andhra Pradesh.

Key to timely monsoon

A hot summer, experts say, is a key factor to a timely monsoon. However, the impact of a warming ocean and its impact on the monsoon is likely to be better apparent around April when the IMD issues its first forecast for the monsoon.

The southwest monsoon in 2019 (June to September) delivered 10 per cent above average rainfall in the country, the highest in 25 years. In 1994, the rainfall was 110 per cent during the June-September period. Before that, more than 10 per cent above average rainfall was witnessed in 1990 (119 per cent).",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rcft2w/article29001422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/heat-wave,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/march-may-period-likely-to-be-warmer-than-normal-imd/article30941759.ece
51,2020/02/28,"Will hear Sabarimala case before taking up contempt pleas on police reforms, says Supreme Court","Apex court spells out its priorities clearly after advocate Prashant Bhushan seeks urgent hearing

The Supreme Court on Friday made it clear that it would hear Sabarimala petitions on the extent of religious freedom available to citizens across multiple faiths before applying its mind to whether authorities should be hauled up for contempt for not complying with its 13-year-old judgment that police should not become a tool in the hands of authoritarian regimes and political bosses.

The occasion came when advocate Prashant Bhushan sought an urgent hearing of contempt petitions pending on the non-implementation of the Prakash Singh judgment of September 22, 2006, which had issued specific directives to unshackle the police from political influences.

Mr. Bhushan made the urgent mention especially in the light of criticism that the Delhi Police did not act with alacrity to prevent violence and save lives before and during the riots which rocked the National Capital.

However, Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, before whom the request was made, said the court would first hear the Sabarimala case. A nine-judge Constitution Bench has been set up to decide the extent of religious freedom under Article 25 and on what would conform as essential religious practices.

It was only on February 26 that Supreme Court judge K.M. Joseph, while hearing the Shaheen Bagh protest case, commented on the “lack of professionalism” shown by the Delhi Police in not stopping people from making hate speeches, which led to the Delhi riots.

“If you had not allowed people to get away after inflammatory remarks, all this would not have happened,” Justice Joseph had said.

Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who was the lead judge on the Shaheen Bagh Bench, had also described the instances of communal violence in Delhi as “deeply unfortunate”.

A third Supreme Court judge, Deepak Gupta, had at a public forum, red-flagged the hike in sedition cases against activists, lawyers and students and branding voices of dissent as “anti-nationals”. Expressing dissent to government’s policies did not amount to acting against the nation, he had said.

The Prakash Singh judgment had held that “commitment, devotion and accountability of the police has to be only to the rule of law”.

“The supervision and control has to be such that it ensures that the police serves the people without any regard, whatsoever, to the status and position of any person while investigating a crime or taking preventive measures,” the Supreme Court had held in 2006.

The apex court had underlined that the approach of the police should be service oriented. The police should not act in a such a way that rule of law became a casualty.

If the police crossed the limits of law, the guilty among them should be brought to book.

The judgment had referred to ‘Political and Administrative Manipulation of the Police’ published in 1979 by Bureau of Police Research and Development, warning that excessive control of the political executive and its principal advisers over the police has the inherent danger of making the police a tool for subverting the process of law, promoting the growth of authoritarianism and shaking the very foundations of democracy.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hphy2g/article30520382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SABARIMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/will-hear-sabarimala-case-before-taking-up-contempt-pleas-on-police-action-says-supreme-court/article30941277.ece
52,2020/02/28,Terror financing: ED secures 2 convictions,"Case linked to Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh; quantum of sentence decision on March 17.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has secured the conviction of an Indian and a Bangladeshi national in a case of terror financing linked to Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB).

The ED said Rahamatulla was a senior JMB leader. The second convict was identified as Mohammed Burhan.

“They have been convicted by the sessions court in Kolkata under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in a case relating to terror financing,” said an official.

The case was registered on the basis of an FIR lodged by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and the Explosive Substances Act.

The NIA probe was into a bomb explosion on October 2, 2014, in a house in West Bengal’s Burdwan that claimed two lives and caused injuries to many.

“It was part of a larger conspiracy of JMB, a terrorist organisation that operates primarily in Bangladesh. The ED identified the properties of the accused persons during the money laundering investigation,” the official said.

A property in Burdwan was jointly acquired by Rahamatulla and Burhan.

“Investigation further revealed that a huge amount of money was paid in cash to the the property owner to conceal the proceeds of crime. The accused persons undervalued the property in the registered deed,” the official said.

The ED also traced a bank account opened by Rahamatulla using forged identification papers. It issued two orders for the attachment of assets, which were confirmed by the PMLA Adjudicating Authority.

Subsequently, a charge sheet was filed against three accused persons in November 2018. Based on the evidence, the court convicted two of them.

“Court hearing on the quantum of sentence will be held on March 17. Charges have been framed against the third accused, Mohammed Yusuf, who is the main conspirator of JMB in India for financing terror activities. Further trial proceedings will be conducted against him,” the official said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/nzvuvm/article26191677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-stock-terrorism-guns-pixabay,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-secures-two-convictions-in-terror-financing-case-linked-to-jamaat-ul-mujahideen-bangladesh/article30941063.ece
53,2020/02/28,Balakot strike dispelled taboo on air power use: Air Chief,"Rajnath Singh describes it as a singular event of military precision and impact.

The use of the Air Force in the sub-conventional domain was considered a “taboo” in the past and the Balakot air strike was a “paradigm shift”, Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal (ACM) R.K.S. Bhadauria said on Friday.

And Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the air strike “forced the rewriting of many a manual and rule book across the Line of Control [LoC]” regarding support for cross-border terrorism.

Addressing a seminar on ‘Air power in no war, no peace scenario’ organised by the Centre for Air Power Studies, he said, “Balakot was a clear demonstration that there exists a space within the sub-conventional conflict boundary wherein the Air Force can be used for targeting and yet have escalation control.”

Use of air power was discussed in the past but most suggestions in this regard were negative and it was decided better not to use, he stated.

Mr. Singh described the Balakot trike as a singular event of military precision and impact. It taught the leadership to think strategic than tactical. “Our approach to terrorism was and will remain a judicious combination of clinical military action and mature and responsible diplomatic outreach,” he said.

The collective diplomatic and financial pressure on Pakistan to end support to cross-border terrorist was visible with terrorists like Hafiz Saeed being put behind bars. “We realise that this is not enough and unless Pakistan is made accountable, it will continue with its previous policy of duplicity and deceit,” he stated.

Mr. Singh termed hybrid warfare a reality. A mix of kinetic and non-kinetic tools was a genuine threat, he noted.

CDS on credible deterrence

Chief of the Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat said that for the Services to undertake the tasks assigned, it was important to “maintain credible deterrence at land, air and at all times.”

He said, “Credible deterrence comes from the will of the military leadership and intent of political leadership while taking the tough decision. This was amply shown after Kargil and the Uri and Pulwama attacks”.

On the Balakot air strike, ACM Bhadauria said, “When undertaking such targets, we need the moral high ground.” The retort by Pakistan on February 27 last year was aimed at its domestic audience and “fundamentally aimed at de-escalation,” he stressed.

On the regional situation, he said the IAF had an edge over the Pakistan Air Force in terms of Beyond Visual Range Missile (BVR) capability at the time of Kargil. “We allowed that to slip and thereafter it took a decade-and-a-half of struggle in the acquisition process to be able to get better capability”. The induction of Rafale jets in a few months armed with Meteor BVR would restore the balance, he stated but added that the 36 Rafale jets were not enough.

Stressing on need for indigenisation, the Air Chief said that if the country had not been able to develop indigenous weapon systems in the last six decades then the “focus has been in the wrong place.” “We will be very happy that in the next skirmish, the weapons and sensors used are indigenous,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i54lpj/article30940637.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRCHIEFMARSHALTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/balakot-strike-has-dispelled-taboo-on-use-of-air-power-says-air-chief-marshal-bhadauria/article30940638.ece
54,2020/02/28,Supreme Court grants Hardik Patel interim protection from arrest till March 6,"Court slams Gujarat police for ‘sitting on’ probe into an unlawful assembly case in connection with 2015 Patidar quota stir

The Supreme Court on Friday granted Congress leader Hardik Patel interim protection from arrest till the next hearing on March 6 and slammed the Gujarat police for “sitting on” its investigation into an unlawful assembly case in connection with the Patidar quota stir in 2015.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the police, objected to the grant of interim protection. The police said there had been no threat to the personal liberty of Mr. Patel in the past five years.

A Bench led by Justice U.U. Lalit responded that it was exactly because the police did nothing for the past five years in the case that the court decided to step in. “You have done nothing for the past five years. What is the evidence gathered” the court asked the police.

The hearing was based on appeal filed by Mr. Patel, the Patidhar movement chief, challenging a Gujarat High Court decision refusing him anticipatory bail in the case that relates to the violence during a rally at Vastrapur in Gujarat.

In the High Court, the police had argued that there were 10 cases against Mr. Patel and he had absconded for nearly a month fearing arrest.

The apex court indicated that a grant of interim protection for seven days - time enough for the State to file a response to Mr. Patel's appeal - was reasonable.

“If you could not do anything for five years, no harm waiting for seven days”, the court addressed the police.

It issued notice to the Gujarat government.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w378zk/article30940631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARDIKPATEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-grants-anticipatory-bail-till-mar-6-to-hardik-patel-in-patidar-stir-case/article30940632.ece
55,2020/02/28,SC hits out at Uttarakhand lawyers striking work every Saturday for 35 years,"The apex court had rapped the lawyers for resorting to such a “joke” and holding strikes for “flimsy reasons”

The Supreme Court on Friday held as illegal the strike called by lawyers on every Saturday for the past 35 years in three district courts of Uttarakhand.

A bench headed by justices Arun Mishra and M R Shah said the strike called by lawyers on flimsy grounds is tantamount to contempt.

The court issued notices to the Bar Council of India and state Bar Council seeking their response.

The apex court had on February 21 rapped the lawyers for resorting to such a “joke” and holding strikes for “flimsy reasons”, like bomb blast in a Pakistan school and earthquake in Nepal, on all working Saturdays for more than the past 35 years.

The issue came to the notice of the apex court while it was hearing an appeal against the verdict of the Uttarakhand High Court which had held as “illegal” the strikes or boycotts of court work on all Saturdays by lawyers in Dehradun and in several parts of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar.

In its September 25, 2019 verdict, the high court had referred to the 266th report of the Law Commission, which had analysed data on loss of working days on account of strikes by lawyers and had opined that it affects functioning of courts and contributes to the mounting pendency of cases.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/co0nkt/article30636231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24TH-SUPREME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-hits-out-at-uttarakhand-lawyers-striking-work-every-saturday-for-35-years/article30940152.ece

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday said the Balakot airstrikes had sent out a clear message that infrastructure across the border could not be used as safe havens for terrorists.

“If we’ve to be prepared for the tasks assigned to us, then it’s important we maintain credible deterrence at land, air and sea at all times,” Mr. Singh said at the Centre for Air Power Studies.

Balakot airstrike conveyed India’s clear message that infrastructure across the border won’t be safe haven for terrorists. It forced rewriting of doctrines across the border, showed the country’s resolve and capability, the Defence Minister said.

Speaking at the event, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat said: “Deterrence comes from keeping every personnel trained and motivated.”

Mr. Rawat underlined that credible deterrence comes from the will of the military leadership and intent of political leadership while taking the tough decision.

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday lauded Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd for its “consistently excellent financial performance” over the last five years and urged it to face private sector competition as “a challenge and an opportunity”.

Addressing employees at HAL’s cultural event, ‘Kannada Naada Habba’, Mr. Singh hailed HAL, which supplies 80% of military aircraft to the armed forces, as the backbone of national security.

Once the sole defence aircraft supplier, it has been forced in recent years to take part in competitive bidding against smaller private companies. This trend, he said, should not daunt the ₹19,700-crore defence public sector behemoth, which has a rich manufacturing experience and skilled staff.

Key role

As the country tries to get out of huge defence imports and even double its defence exports to ₹35,000 crore by 2024, HAL has a key role in indigenous manufacture, he said.

Sibashis was on board the ship for more than three weeks. It had been quarantined off Yokohoma along the Japan coast due to threat of the COVID-19 infection. Speaking to The Hindu over phone, Mr. Sibashis said he was among the 119 Indians on the ship who were airlifted from Japan by the Indian government.

“We landed in New Delhi at around 5.30 a.m. on Thursday. All of us were shifted to the Army's quarantine facility at Manesar in Haryana, where we will be kept for 14 days”, said Mr. Sibashis.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has pulled up the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) for its inability to prevent drains in Kanpur from polluting the Ganga.

Some of these drains were carrying industrial effluents and had been tapped under cleaning works under the Namami Ganga Programme.

Also read | Debating water quality

The CPCB and the UPPCB had been jointly monitoring 24 drains — two in Unnao and 22 in Kanpur — since March 2019. Drains that revealed “high colour” from chemical effluents or Biochemical Oxygen Demand and Dissolved Oxygen (BODDO) — an indicator of microbial presence and barometers to gauge the health of water bodies — were to be cleaned and errant municipal bodies or industrial units were to be fined or face the prospect of having their units shut down.

Polluting units

Over a thousand ‘Grossly Polluting Industries’ including sugarcane, pulp and paper and tanneries, and slaughter houses had been marked out and monitored for effluent load and whether they were discharging waste into the river.

Four drains — Sheetla Bazaar, Budhiya Ghat, Wazidpur and Ratanpur drain — were identified by the CPCB as continuing to contain high pollutant load. The Sheetla Bazaar, Budhiya Ghat and Wazidpur drains were tapped and weren’t supposed to be effusing toxins.

“During the inspection, tapping arrangement was found to be ineffective and overflow was observed reaching directly to the Ganga,” the CPCB said in its inspection note of February 21. “High total chrome [content] was observed in the wastewater of the drain....indicates discharge of untreated, chrome-bearing wastewater from tannery units located in Jajmau area of Kanpur.”

A Bangladeshi student of Visva-Bharati University, who has been asked to leave India for “anti-government” activities, is learned to have approached the Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Kolkata with a request for the reconsideration of the decision.

The student, Afsara Anika Meem, had shared pictures on Facebook of the anti-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) protests that were held on the Visva-Bharati campus last December. She is a First Year student of Design at the University’s Shilpa Sadan and had not participated in the demonstrations but had merely posted pictures.

Leading Kolkata lawyers Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and Shamim Ahmed are willing to take up her case in the Calcutta High Court but that will be possible only if the student agrees to go to court.

‘Illegal and vague’

“The order is absolutely illegal and vague. It does not disclose the particulars related to her supposed anti-government activities. The Constitution permits even a foreigner to be heard before being prosecuted. Such an opportunity was not given to her,” Mr. Ahmed told The Hindu.

The Leave India Notice, issued to Ms. Meem by the FRRO, said: “...she is found to have engaged in anti-government activities. And such activity being a breach of her visa, has thus committed visa violation. Therefore...the foreigner shall not remain in India and shall depart from India within 15 days of the receipt of the order”.

67,2020/02/28,CBI retrieves child from Dubai after father flouts SC order,"Delhi HC had denied him custody of daughter

The Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday brought back a three-year-old girl, who was taken to Dubai by her father in alleged violation of court directives.

Following a Supreme Court directive, a CBI team visited Dubai to bring back the girl along with her father, Aman Lohia.

It is alleged that Lohia took his daughter abroad about six months ago. The Delhi High Court had given the child’s custody to her mother, Kiran Kaur Lohia, with a condition that he could meet his daughter for a few hours on three days of every week. As directed by the court, he had deposited his passport.

However, when the child came to meet Lohia on August 24 last year, he took her to Dubai via Nepal, using a passport allegedly arranged from the Commonwealth of Dominica, an island country in the Caribbean. A maid and a family friend accompanied them. Personal laws in Dubai enjoin exclusive custody upon the father.

The Delhi High Court directed the CBI to register a case. On the agency’s request, the Interpol issued a “Yellow Notice” to trace the girl.

Yellow Notices are issued by the Interpol on the request of member countries to locate missing persons, they said.

The CBI also filed a charge sheet on December 19 last year before a special court against Lohia, his mother Meena Lohia, alleged accomplice Pawan Kumar and maid Shiuratia Debi Mahto, officials said.

The girl will be produced before the Supreme Court on Friday, officials said, adding that the child is at her mother’s home under the agency’s care.

Lohia claimed he was a “victim of gender bias” of courts and that it was the “love for his daughter” which directed his actions.

Rakhine has been in the news because of Myanmar military’s campaign against the Rohingya who were forced to live in refugee camps in the Chittagong hills of Bangladesh.

69,2020/02/28,‘Protest against Naidu showed people’s pent-up feelings’,"Will resign if TDP can prove that outsiders are involved: Muttamsetti

The people of north Andhra have realised that TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu is against development of the region, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao has said.

Addressing the media here on Friday, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said that Mr. Naidu’s opposition to making Visakhapatnam the Executive capital and his obsession with Amaravati without any concern for the backward north Andhra and Rayalaseema regions were unpalatable to the people of the region.

Stating that the government was committed to developing all the three regions, the Minister said the objective was to avoid demands for further bifurcation of the State in the future.

People showed their pent-up feelings by obstructing Mr. Naidu’s convoy on Thursday, the Minister claimed, and added that he was prepared to resign if the TDP leaders could prove that people from Pulivendula were involved in the protest at the airport.

Objecting to Mr. Naidu criticising the police, he said: “Had the police not been there, he wouldn’t have been able to return safely to the airport lounge.”

The Minister alleged that the TDP leaders were spreading falsehood on the pooling of land that was aimed at distributing house sites to the poor. In Visakhapatnam district alone, 1.75 lakh people sought house sites. Of them, one lakh people were residing in the four Assembly constituencies in the city being represented by the TDP, he said.

The Minister said that developmental works worth crores of rupees were being undertaken in the city, and if the TDP tried to obstruct them, the people would teach it a lesson.

Araku Utsav

Referring to the Araku Utsav, the Minister said that tribal people from neighbouring States would also be invited to showcase their art and culture.

70,2020/02/28,TDP lashes out at govt. for ‘misusing’ police,"MLA claims to have proof of outsiders’ involvement in protest

The government misused the police to stop TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu at the Visakhapatnam airport after granting permission to his tour, alleged TDP leaders at a media conference here on Friday.

Senior TDP leader Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy alleged that DGP Gautam Sawang was acting like a member of the YSRCP.

He further alleged that the government misused Section 151 of the Cr.PC to target the opposition leader. Similarly, the cars of MLAs Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar and Velagapudi Ramakrishna Babu were attacked, he alleged.

Though many persons in the crowd were drunk and heaped abuse on the former Chief Minister, the police, instead of controlling them, remained mute spectators, Mr. Murthy alleged.

Referring to the statements of YSRCP leaders that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was not allowed to move out of the airport in 2017, when he, as Leader of the Opposition, had come to participate in an all-party protest on the Beach Road here, the TDP leaders said the two incidents could not be compared.

Mr. Reddy’s participation in the protest would have resulted in the city getting a negative image as Partnership Summit was then being held opposite the Beach Road, they said.

On the contrary, Mr. Naidu had come to the city after getting prior permission to hold a meeting at Pendurthi, they added.

Mr. Ganesh Kumar claimed that “miscreants from Pulivendula” were hired for the protest and that he had proof of the same.

He alleged that the government was trying to grab lands in the city in the name of Executive capital.

Party leader Sri Bharat took exception to the police “remaining silent spectators” when the YSRCP activists allegedly threw water bottles and eggs at Mr. Naidu’s car despite he being an NSG protectee and given ‘Z’ category security.

Home Minister Mekathoti Sucharitha has insisted that nobody arrested Telugu Desam Party president and Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu during his visit to Visakhapatnam on Thursday.

Speaking to the media during her visit to Kadapa central prison on Friday, she said Mr. Naidu had visited the city only for indulging in politics and it was the people who had resisted his visit.

“We had to send him back for law and order reasons and only to ensure his security,” she explained. She remarked that it was the same police which Mr. Naidu had appreciated in the past, indicating that he should not cast aspersions on the department over the airport incident.

Disha police stations

Ms. Sucharitha announced that Disha police stations would be established across the State to ensure women’s safety and a forensic laboratory would be opened in Visakhapatnam exclusively for handling such cases. She said hinted at taking steps to release prisoners having good conduct.

Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana on Friday announced that the government would accord top priority to meeting the drinking water requirements in the ensuing summer, and funds would not be a constraint in overcoming hassles in the process.

The Minister was reviewing the progress of schemes such as housing, drinking water, employment of ward volunteers, services offered in wards, sanitation and town planning in the six southern districts of Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur, Nellore, Kurnool and Prakasam, when he instructed the officials to get ready with alternative solutions for drinking water supply in towns in view of the ensuing summer.

He asked the officials to map the situation faced during the last three or four years, and come up with viable solution vis-a-vis tie-up with private borewells and transportation of water, besides measures to deepen existing borewells and recharging the structures.

“We need to have an action plan on hand for the problematic municipalities in the six districts,” he said, indicating that sufficient funds would be pumped in for meeting such exigencies.

Tirupati and Srikalahasti in Chittoor district would be provided Telugu Ganga water, while Chippili storage tank in Madanapalle and Pungamma Cheruvu in Punganur would get Handri Neeva water.

Aiming to recharge borewells en route, water would be released from Gajuladinne project to Tungabhadra river in Kurnool district and from Velugodu project to Penna river in Kadapa district.

Focus would be laid on Kanigiri and Giddalur in Prakasam district, which depend extensively on groundwater, and also on Naidupeta (Nellore district), which could face crisis after May.

Transportation was the only option in Gooty and Pamidi municipalities of Anantapur, the officials told the Minister.

Housing

Meanwhile, Mr. Satyanarayana also appealed to the Municipal Commissioners to brace up for allocation of houses in G+3 buildings to the poor beneficiaries by Ugadi.

Those who had made deposits earlier for the State government’s prestigious housing scheme would be considered on priority basis, he added.

Even as the world is divided over continuing Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) or reverting to ballot box, these young minds have unravelled a biometric-enabled EVM as a safer measure.

With a larger view of safeguarding democracy by giving every voter the right to exercise franchise, the system brought out by G. Manyasree and P. Sai Shreya of Springdale Public School also eliminates the scope for impersonation, a malady that has been plaguing elections from the panchayat to parliament level, causing friction among political groups.

As part of National Science Day fete, the school conducted a science expo at its campus here on Friday, when the exhibit on biometric-based EVM caught the attention of all. The system enables registration of a voter’s fingerprint and only allows such registered voters to cast vote. When the same person attempts to vote again, the system rejects him, with a loud beep and text message ‘You have already voted’. “The system can be linked with Aadhaar to eliminate bogus votes and impersonation, even while ensuring speed and accuracy,” the students told the audience.

Similarly, an exhibit by Gayatri and others showed how adulteration of grocery products can be curtailed in simple ways. Another student presented a model of a self-supported house having compost pit, soak pit, biogras plant, poultry, cattle and essential crops. The model of ‘Garuda Varadhi’, the 6 km-long elevated road corridor project now under execution in Tirupati, attracted the audience, while another batch presented the upcoming projects of ISRO such as Chandrayan II, Vikram lander-rover and IRNSS satellite. “Exhibits on hydroponic plantation (growing plants without soil), solar-based irrigation system umbrella and mobile charger, smart digital basket and elevated ambulance are designed keeping tomorrow in mind,” says its Correspondent K.S.

The Minister, however, said that the day’s events had nothing to do with what had happened to Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who had been sent back from the airport when he, as Leader of Opposition, had come to the city to stage a protest during the Partnership Summit.

‘Ulterior motive’

Mr. Naidu was opposing the decision to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital on the grounds that it was vulnerable to cyclones and located far from various parts of the State, forgetting that fact that he had became Chief Minister thrice and Leader of the Opposition only because of the TDP’s victory in the north Andhra region, the Minister observed.

“Mr. Naidu can come to attend the wedding. But in the last two days, he has been making provocative statements that YSRCP leaders are indulging in land-grabbing. He has come with an ulterior motive,” the Minister alleged.

During the TDP rule, the Ministers and MLAs had indulged in corruption, which forced a Cabinet Minister to lodge a complaint with the SIT constituted by the TDP government, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said.

Except for holding meetings at a star hotel, Mr. Naidu did nothing to develop Visakhapatnam, the Minister said.

Mr. Naidu also failed to do anything for the kidney patients of the Uddanam region, he alleged. It was Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy who, after coming to power, had sanctioned a super-speciality hospital there and a medical college at Paderu, he added.

On land pooling, the Minister said that it was meant for houses for the poor. A lion’s share of the 1.8 lakh applications received was from the four constituencies represented by the TDP MLAs in the city, he said.

MPs M.V.V. Satyanarayana and B.V. Satyavathi; MLAs Karanam Dharmasri, Tippala Nagi Reddy, Gudivada Amarnath, Golla Babu Rao and Annamreddy Aadeepraj; and VMRDA Chairman Dronamraju Srinivasa Rao were present.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/people-vented-their-anger-at-naidu-says-muttamsetti/article30936114.ece
84,2020/02/28,Naidu’s detention undemocratic: TDP,"It vows to expose ‘misdeeds’ of YSRCP government

TDP leaders on Thursday came down heavily on the YSRCP government for resorting to “preventive detention” of their president N. Chandrababu Naidu at the airport in Visakhapatnam, and termed the action as undemocratic.

Mr. Naidu was scheduled to participate in the Praja Chaitanya Yatra in both Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts on the day.

The party leaders made elaborate arrangements for the yatra at places such as Kothavalasa, S. Kota and Vizianagaram. Mr. Naidu was scheduled to kick-start the yatra at Chintalapalem village of Kothavalasa mandal at 11.30 a.m. But Mr. Naidu could not make it to the venue as he was confined to the airport premises till evening following the agitation by the YSRCP cadre.

Opposing Mr. Naidu’s “preventive detention,” the party leaders staged a protest at the Collectorate junction here, and raised slogans against Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. They vowed to expose the “misdeeds” of the government and the adverse impact its decision to establish three capitals would have on the State.

“It is unfair to prevent Mr. Naidu from taking part in the yatra. The Opposition leader has every right to meet people of the State in all the 13 districts,” said Vizianagaram TDP in-charge Aditi Gajapati Raju.

Former MLA Kolla Lalitakumari said the people of the State would teach a lesson to the YSRCP government soon.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidus-detention-undemocratic-tdp/article30936092.ece
85,2020/02/28,Naidu’s remarks on liquor irresponsible: Minister,"Deputy Chief Minister and Excise Minister K. Narayana Swamy on Thursday termed the remarks allegedly made by TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu on consumption of liquor by the poor as “ unwarranted and irresponsible.”

“It is ridiculous on the part of Mr. Naidu, who boasts of serving the State for 14 long years, to say that the poor consume it to overcome fatigue after a day’s hard work,” Mr. Narayana Swamy said.

“While Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is determined to impose prohibition in the State in phases for an ‘Arogya Andhra Pradesh’, Mr. Naidu seems to be encouraging the people to espouse the social evil,” he told the media here.

“Many political leaders, who included Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have congratulated the Chief Minister for bringing in the Disha Bill for protection of women, But Mr. Naidu seems to be hell-bent on criticising him,” the Minister alleged.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy was committed to steering the State on the path to progress. It was for this reason he was implementing all his electoral promises, be it Amma Vodi or Vasati Deevena, in quick succession, he said.

87,2020/02/28,Naidu’s visit boosts morale of TDP cadre,"He reportedly asked them to strive for party’s victory in local body elections

TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s recent visit to Kuppam constituency, which he represents in the Assembly, gave the much-needed boost to the disillusioned party cadre, who were learnt to be facing the heat from the ruling YSRCP.

Poll debacle

Once a TDP citadel, Kuppam got the highest vote share for the party. However, in the 2019 general elections, Mr. Naidu’s vote share slid in Kuppam. That apart, the TDP had to face a major embarrassment as it lost 13 out of the 14 Assembly constituencies in Chittoor district. Mr. Naidu’s victory was the lone exception.

After the elections, the TDP cadre either maintained a low profile or vanished from the political landscape, fearing backlash from the YSRCP after its thumping victory.

It was in this backdrop that Mr. Naidu’s visit acted as a morale booster. It was an occasion when the party workers gave Mr. Naidu the “ground report” on how things had gone awry in the entire district post the elections.

‘Do not lose heart’

“Mr. Naidu gave them a patient hearing and asked them not to lose heart. He wanted the workers to leave no stone unturned to win the ensuing local body elections,” party MLC Gounivani Srinivasulu, who hails from Kuppam, told The Hindu.

Mr. Naidu, during his visit, flayed a section of the police for allegedly playing into the hands of the ruling party leaders and “framing” innocent TDP workers.

In the closed-door meeting, Mr. Naidu was learnt to have expressed displeasure over the spate of attacks on the TDP workers.

“I never took sides after the elections. But the YSRCP government is not magnanimous enough,” he reportedly told the leaders.

While recalling that the TDP, despite tasting defeat at the hands of the Congress in 1989, 2004 and 2009, had not suffered humiliation as was being witnessed now, Mr. Naidu reportedly observed, and appealed to the cadre to stay courageous and project the government’s failures to ensure victory for the party in the local body polls.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidus-visit-boosts-morale-of-tdp-cadre/article30936066.ece
88,2020/02/28,"Used cooking oil can fuel your mobility, says Indian Oil Corporation","Do you know where used cooking oil or the grease waste from kitchens of our hotels and restaurants go?

Well, there are disposing agents who collect used cooking oil from many eateries, but no one actually knows what the final destination of this toxic matter is.

Indian Oil Corporation has embarked on a social venture by floating a clean drive called RUCO (Repurpose Used-Cooking Oil). Under this, the oil PSU will encourage entrepreneurs to take up biodiesel production from used cooking oil, with a buyback agreement.

“Waste cooking oil is harmful to health, also it is not environment-friendly to dispose of used cooking oil. The best solution is to process it and convert it into biodiesel,” said D.L. Pramodh, IOCL executive director and Karnataka head.

According to him, restaurants that sell a lot of fried food, such as French fries and fried chicken, are very likely to have large quantities of used oil that they need to dispose of. Various vegetable fats and oils, animal fats, waste grease, and edible oil processing waste can be used as feed stock for biodiesel production.

ICO is currently meeting micro, small, medium and large eateries, restaurants and hotels to engage more of them in this campaign. “With the utlitisation of used cooking oil for producing biodiesel, we are aiming to fulfil the vision of ‘waste to wealth’ in India,” Mr. Pramodh said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/tvmbez/article29740378.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18NDSRN01ZomatGIH6JJE943jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/used-cooking-oil-can-fuel-your-mobility-says-iocl/article30946012.ece
89,2020/02/28,Diabetic nephropathy: study reveals a potential diagnostic biomarker,"Diabetic Nephropathy (DN) is among the most significant long-term complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The risk of End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and resulting premature morbidity and mortality is estimated to increase 12-fold with diabetes.

Microalbuminuria (MIC) is an early non-invasive marker of renal disease and its progression. However, it takes several years of diabetes for MIC to occur. Interventions are also much less effective in some patients with MIC, who manifest advanced pathological changes. Development of sensitive early-stage disease markers and alternative diagnostic approaches are thus essential for the detection of DN.

A recent study has identified urinary Asymmetric to Symmetric Dimethylarginine Ratio (ASR) as a potential biomarker for early prediction of DN, even in those newly diagnosed with diabetes. The research, published in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific Reports on February 19, is a multidisciplinary collaborative effort of scientists from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bengaluru, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) – National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL), Pune, and Madras Diabetes Research Foundation (MDRF), Chennai.

“As diabetic patients are at a high risk of developing kidney failure, we wanted to know whether it would be possible to identify someone who had the risk of developing kidney failure, so that effective preventive steps could be taken before the individual fell ill,” said Kuppan Gokulakrishnan, assistant professor, Department of Neurochemistry, NIMHANS.

The researchers evaluated the efficiency of ASR using Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI MS) from 555 people with varying levels of glucose intolerance. Along with people with normal glucose tolerance, pre-diabetic and newly diagnosed patients and even those with T2DM with MIC and MAC were part of the study.

They found that the ASR profile was lower in MIC and macroalbuminuria (MAC), suggesting that it had the potential to be used as an early diagnostic marker. The study was able to correctly identify 72% of MIC and 91% of MAC, respectively, among the patients.

“Early diagnosis of DN using a sensitive biomarker such as ASR is beneficial, to detect the onset of DN and to prevent or delay the progression into overt nephropathy. Our work is proof of concept that shows the use of ASR for assessing progressive DN, and this could aid future studies to understand the biology of nephropathy and the search for new treatments,” said Dr. Gokulakrishnan.

“Dimethylarginines (DMAs) are susceptible to protein binding, which may result in differential recovery for normal and proteinuric urine samples. Therefore, any quantitative estimation of these biomarkers and eventually meaningful clinical interpretations would have to take this into account as urine from patients with kidney disease has significant protein content. Estimation of their ratios using our approach offers a robust alternative to individual quantitative measurements. In this context, the decreased ASR in patients with MIC and MAC in our study is an important finding,” said Venkateswarlu Panchagnula from CSIR-NCL.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/diabetic-nephropathy-study-reveals-a-potential-diagnostic-biomarker/article30945996.ece

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction on a PIL petition filed by Sumangala A. Swamy, an advocate who complained about noise pollution owing to the use of loudspeaker by Ayyesha Masjid in Govindarajanagar. After the counsel for the mosque produced a copy of the licence issued by the inspector of police of Vijayanagar station, the Bench pointed out that the licence ex-facie appeared to be not in order as power to issue licence under the noise pollution rules is given only to police officers not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police.

The Bench also directed KSPCB to explain its “strange stand” of expressing helplessness in initiating action as per the law against the mosque. When KPSCB officers are empowered by law to lodge complaints on violations of the provisions, how can an officer say the police will have to take action against the mosque, the Bench asked.

91,2020/02/28,Funds to be earmarked in Karnataka Budget for Kalasa-Banduri project,"A day after the Centre’s notification of the Mahadayi inter-State water dispute tribunal award, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said on Friday that the State government would expedite the Kalasa-Banduri nala drinking water and hydro power projects in the region.

Mr. Yediyurappa, who also holds the Finance portfolio, said funds would be allocated in the 2020-21 State Budget to resume the project on the Mahadayi river’s Kalasa-Banduri tributaries in the northern districts of the State. The budget is to be presented on March 5.

Meanwhile, Major and Medium Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has sought ₹200 crore in the budget for the projects. However, speaking at Hubballi, Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Coal and Mines Pralhad Joshi said he had requested Mr. Yediyurappa to allocate “at least ₹500 crore”.

The Chief Minister said the notification of the Union Water Resources Ministry would enable the State to complete the project for supplying drinking water to four drought-prone districts. “We will resume the project work, halted after Goa challenged it, as we are confident of getting our share of the water for drinking and irrigation,” Mr. Yediyurappa said.

In Goa, Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi said all the States concerned would have to obey the order of the Supreme Court on the Mahadayi river water sharing issue.

The Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal, on August 14, 2018, allocated 13.42 tmcft of river water to Karnataka for irrigation and drinking water supply in towns and villages across Bagalkot, Belagavi, Dharwad and Gadag districts. Of the 13.42 tmcft water, 5.4 tmcft will be used in the river basin and for diversion into the depleted Malaprabha reservoir, while the remaining 8.02 tmcft will be utilised for hydro power generation instead of being allowed to flow into the Arabian Sea on the State’s west coast through Goa.

92,2020/02/28,Bail plea filed on behalf of Kashmiri students,"Amid imposition of prohibitory orders around the court premises, as a precautionary measure, a team of advocates from Bengaluru reached the Principal District and Sessions Court in Dharwad on Friday and filed bail applications on behalf of the three Kashmiri students against whom sedition charges have been framed.

Following a request from the Hubballi-Dharwad Police, the Court Administrative Officer allowed the counsels of the three students to file their bail applications during the lunch hour.

Unlike on Monday, when members of the Dharwad Bar Association objected to advocates from Bengaluru and other places appearing on behalf of the students, it was a smooth affair on Friday, with the police taking every precautionary step to allow the advocates to file the applications.

Consequent to the High Court rap, members of the Dharwad Bar Association acted in accordance with the submission of not preventing any advocate from filing the bail applications, which they had made before the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday.

However, the police were extra careful on Friday, and to avoid any further complication, they brought the team of advocates through the back entrance to the court premises. After filing the applications, the advocates were escorted out of the court premises from the front gate by the police. A small group outside the court premises raised “go back” slogan against the advocates.

Earlier, the police escorted the advocates to Hindalga jail in Belagavi, where the students are in judicial custody. As per the High Court direction, the prison authorities allowed the advocates to meet the students and get their signatures for representing them in the court.

He said that the right to protest emerges from the Constitution; it gives citizens the right to assemble and protest peacefully without carrying any arms.

Speaking to reporters in Chitradurga on Friday, Mr. Yatnal said that Mr. Ramesh Kumar does not have any morality to tell him that he (Yatnal) who belongs to Godse’s lineage is unfit to be in the Assembly for his remarks against freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy.

He said that Mr. Ramesh Kumar speaks as if he belongs to the lineage of the king Satya Harishchandra who was known for his truthfulness and who sacrificed his life, wealth, wife and son to keep his words given to Sage Vishwamitra.

He said that there are 23 cases filed against him and all cases are related to agitations carried out demanding irrigation projects and none of them was related to land grabbing, rape and printing of counterfeit currency. “There is no need for me to learn ethics and morality from Mr. Ramesh Kumar,” he added.

Mr. Yatnal said: “Yes, I am an RSS man and I am not an anti-national or a Pakistani agent.” He said that if the police had not taken a tough decision, Mangaluru would have become another Delhi. He said that instead of carrying out agitations against those who are showing guns to the police in Delhi, the Congress is staging protests against him.

Once again attacking Doreswamy, Mr. Yatnal asked Doreswamy how old was he when he joined the freedom movement. He asked whether Doreswamy underwent the kind of torture that freedom fighter Veer Savarkar faced in a British jail. He demanded that the Congress seek an apology for speaking against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Veer Savarkar.

It may be recalled that the seer of Sanehalli Mutt had called Doreswamy as an elephant to which Mr. Yatnal had said that he does not know whether he (Doreswamy) was an elephant or a pig.

Mr. Yatnal asked the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy whether he had been born when Doreswamy was fighting for India’s freedom. He asked him from where did he get all that thousands of crores of rupees being the son of a former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda who was a small-time work inspector when he began his career.

He asked Mr. Kumaraswamy why did he join politics in a retort to the latter’s statement that people joined the Army for food. He also asked whether Mr. Deve Gowda was a soldier who fought for India’s freedom.

Defending Minister Narayana Gowda for raising slogans in favour of Maharashtra, Mr. Yatnal said that Mr. Narayana Gowda had not raised slogans in favour of Pakistan and asked what was wrong in raising slogans in favour of Maharashtra which was a part of India.

He asked why pro-Kannada activists did not agitate when pro-Pakistan slogans were raised in Hubballi and Bengaluru. He also asked where was the land mafia when pro-Pakistan slogans were raised in Hubballi and Bengaluru.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/people-know-how-much-landramesh-kumar-has-grabbed/article30944261.ece
98,2020/02/28,Job aspirants advised to beflexible in their choice,"‘Hold such fairs at different times in different districts to help unemployed youth’

“Job aspirants should be more flexible than demanding. They should give priority to gaining experience which will act as a ladder for success in their career.” This advice was offered to job aspirants by representatives of different companies that are participating in the two-day job fair that began on ITI College premises here on Friday.

Speaking to The Hindu, several company representatives regretted that many aspirants who were participating in the interview, even without any experience, wanted higher salary and jobs in cities of their choice.

Tukaram Jarali, who is working as a branch manager at Sri Sai Bio Fertilizer Company, said that during their interview session, most of the aspirants sought higher salary. “They have no experience in the field, so no company will offer higher salary for such people. Thus, if the aspirants wanted higher salary, they should begin their career with limited salary and gain experience. With hard and sincere work, surely one could get promotion and higher pay scale,” he said.

Meanwhile, several aspirants echoed what the employers said. But some of the aspirants said that they are in need of jobs and they are ready to make certain compromises in their choices.

“Surely, I want to work in Vijayapura; but if there is no job here, then I have to go to other cities. I am personally ready to move to any place for a job,” said Satish Badami, who has completed Diploma in Mechanical Engineering course.

Meanwhile, the common refrain was that the State government was holding job fairs in different districts on the same day.

They said that job fairs should be held on different days in different cities which will help aspirants to apply for jobs in the companies of their choice.

“If job fairs are held in different cities on the same day like the one being held today in cities such as Kalaburagi, then it will leave limited options for aspirants. Therefore, I urge the government to hold such events on different occasions to help unemployed youth,” they said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/job-aspirants-advised-to-beflexible-in-their-choice/article30944189.ece

Diwakara and Janaki alias Vedavathi from the BJP were elected as Mayor and Deputy Mayor of Mangaluru, respectively, in an election conducted on February 28.

Mr. Diwakara is a three-time councillor while Ms. Janaki has been elected to the council for the second time.

The Mayor represents Cantonment ward while the Deputy Mayor is from Kulai ward.

The BJP enjoys majority in Mangaluru City Corporation council. In the 60-member council, the BJP won 44 seats, the Congress 14 and the Social Democratic Party of India two seats in the election held on November 12, 2019.

As two BJP MLAs, D. Vedavyasa Kamath from Mangaluru City South and Y. Bharat Shetty from Mangaluru City North, and a Congress MLC, Ivan D'Souza, enjoyed voting powers in the Mayoral election, the BJP could get two more votes, making it 46 votes. The Congress could get one more vote of Mr. D'Souza, thus the party got a total of 15 votes.

Mr. Diwakara defeated K. Keshava from the Congress 46-15. Ms. Janaki defeated Zeenat Shamsuddin from the Congress 46-17.

The two councillors of SDPI remained neutral while casting their votes to the Mayoral candidate. However they voted in favour of Ms. Shamsuddin, while voting for the Deputy Mayoral candidate.

The office of Mayor had been reserved for a councillor from the Backward Class A category and the office of Deputy Mayor had been reserved for general category woman councillor.

The BJP has been elected to power in the corporation for a five-year term for the second time. It was elected to the corporation for a five-year term for the first time in 2007. The Congress made it to the council by defeating BJP in 2013.

103,2020/02/28,Settar: An untiring historian with a literary flourish,"‘He was a model for all historians because of his wide-ranging interests and his multidisciplinary approach to research’

S. Settar, 85, historian, who breathed his last early on Friday in Bengaluru, was known for his multidisciplinary work, encompassing linguistics, epigraphy, anthropology, study of religions, and art history.

Family sources said he was suffering from respiratory problems and was hospitalised for over a week. Dr. Settar is survived by his wife and two daughters.

Born in 1935 at Hampasagara, Ballari district, he went on to study at Cambridge University and started his career as a professor of History at Karnatak University, Dharwad, his alma mater.

Dr. Settar worked till the very end and never rested on his past laurels. “A day before he was hospitalised, he was proof-reading and giving final touches to a book,” said N. Ravikumar of Abhinava Prakashana, who has published several of Dr. Settar’s recent publications in Kannada. Dr. Settar had also said he would need two more years of research to finish some of the projects he had taken up recently. He leaves behind many important works ready for publication.

The cover page of S. Settar’s book ‘Modala Sahasramanada Kannada Shasanagalu’ which is ready for publication.

Early Buddhist Artisans and their Architectural Vocabulary, a result of his recent research at Kanaganahalli near Sannati, Kalaburagi district, is set to be published by Manipal University Press. For the first time, he had put together all Kannada inscriptions of the first millennium in an eight-volume work, covering 220 inscriptions. He had also compiled a dictionary of every word for over 25 classical Kannada poetry. All these works will be published this year, Mr. Ravikumar said.

Dr. Settar’s early and important works in the 1970s were in the realm of Jain philosophy and ritual death (Sallekhana), with critically acclaimed books such as Inviting Death: Historical Experiments on Sepulchral Hill.

He also wrote extensively on Hoysala and Vijayanagar sculptural heritage. He edited several scholarly volumes on various epochs of Indian and Karnataka’s history. He served as director of the National Museum Institute of the History of Art, Conservation and Museology in 1978 and as chairperson of the Indian Council of Historical Research in 1996. He was also a visiting professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies, Bengaluru.

It was in recent years that Dr. Settar shifted focus to studying the evolution of the Kannada language and literature with multidisciplinary approach and had chosen to write in Kannada. He believed that his choice of language made his work more accessible. Dr. Settar’s works in Kannada, including Shangam-Tamilagam Kannada Naadu Nudi, and Halagannada Lipi Lipikaara Lipi Vyavasaya are regarded as landmarks. His most recent work was Prakrita Jagadwalaya in 2018.

Noted historian and his student S.K. Aruni said Dr. Settar was “a model for all historians” because of his wide-ranging interests and his multidisciplinary approach to research. He drew from art history, linguistics and philosophy, and strictly followed an evidence-based approach to history, often revising popularly held notions and sometimes changing his stands when new evidence came up. For instance, his 2007 work Shangam-Tamilagam ..., which won the Bhasha Samman from the Sahitya Akademi, proved many of the poets of the Sangam period in Tamil were Kannadigas.

“Using linguistics and epigraphy, he re-imagined the ancient history of Karnataka,” Dr. Aruni said.

A polymath, he had a keen interest in music, art, and cinema as well. He even wrote several short stories under the pen name ‘Priyadarshini’ through the 1970s and 1980s. He had a wide collection of art and sculpture.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yj06dm/article30939571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PROFSSHETTARDIRECTORINDIRAGANDHIARTCENTREBANGALOREA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/historian-settar-passes-away-at-85/article30939572.ece
104,2020/02/28,‘Baiyappanahalli terminal to be ready by May’,"Though the railways had taken up work in early 2017, the project was plagued by delays

If all goes as per schedule, the Baiyappanahalli terminal will be completed within three months. After missing several deadlines, the railways has given itself a deadline of May 2020 to complete work on the much-needed terminal.

A senior railway official said, “The quantum of work involved in Baiyappanahalli terminal is quite large. There are seven platforms, two sub-ways, yard modifications, signalling and buildings with various amenities. By May, the project will be completed after which we will start train services in a phased manner.”

Once completed and operational, Baiyappanahalli terminal will help South Western Railways decongest KSR Bengaluru and Yeshwantpur railway stations. SWR plans to shift 64 train services from these two stations to Baiyappanahalli. The terminal is being constructed on 110 acres at a cost of ₹133 crore, of which ₹85 crore has already been spent.

Though the railways had taken up work in early 2017, the project was plagued by delays on account of several factors, including a design change. Initially, the railways had set December 2018 as the deadline for completion.

Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi on Thursday said that the new terminal at Yeshwantpur will be planned after work at Baiyappanahalli is completed.

Cantonment terminal

According to SWR General Manager Ajay Kumar Singh, work on the proposed Cantonment terminal will be taken up in two months.

A senior railway official said, “The tender for civil work is being finalised. The total cost of the project is around ₹38 crore. The proposed terminal will help operations on the suburban rail network.” To a question on the status of the suburban rail project, Mr. Angadi said the project will come before the Central cabinet shortly. He added that Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has been asked to direct officials to facilitate acquisition of land required for the project.

Karnataka Railway Infrastructure Development Limited (K-RIDE), the agency implementing the project, has already floated tenders to carry out a survey of the land required, and the identification and investigation of utilities.

On Thursday, Mr. Yediyurappa flagged off the Shivamogga Town – Chennai Tatkal Express (06221/06222) via video conferencing. Its frequency has been increased.

The train will now run twice a week instead of once a week. It will have stoppages at Bhadravathi, Tarikere, Birur, Kadur, Arsikere, Tumakuru, Chikbanavara, Banaswadi, Krishnarajapuram, Bangarpet, Jolarpettai, Katpadi, Arakkonam and Perambur.

On the occasion, the CM also launched various services of SWR in the Bengaluru division that included the first phase of the Rail Display Network (RDN) at KSR Bengaluru Railway Station, as well as a paid waiting lounge and health kiosks.

A release from the SWR states that the the RDN involves integration of all Digital Display Boards in 32 stations of Bengaluru division. It will help disseminate station-level data to passengers such as arrival and departure time of trains, platform nomination, and late running of trains.

The SWR maintains that the entire project will be implemented at zero cost to the railways as a private agency is bearing the cost of implementing the project with advertisement rights.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/3ijsha/article30939426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGCANTONMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/baiyappanahalli-terminal-to-be-ready-by-may/article30939428.ece
105,2020/02/28,H.D. Kote man sentenced for possessing tiger skin,"A court in Gundlupet recently found a man guilty of possessing tiger skin and has sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment.

The ruling delivered by Chandrashekar P. Diddi, Senior Civil Judge and JFMC, Gundlupet, said the offence is punishable under section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act and the convict was also directed to pay a fine of ₹10,000 as fine in default of which he would undergo imprisonment for another two months.

The Range Forest Officer of Maddur division of Bandipur Tiger Reserve had filed a case against Syed Aslam of Taraka village in H.D. Kote taluk of Mysuru district and two others for possessing tiger skin.

The RFO had received wireless message on January 2, 2008 and nabbed Syed Aslam at the Hongalli-Baragi road junction while his two accomplices fled from the scene.

On searching the bag of Syed Aslam, the RFO and his team recovered the skin of a tiger which was allegedly killed in Antharasanthe range of Nagarahole national park with a muzzle gun by one Venkata. Based on the information the officials tracked down Venkata and arrested him besides seizing 18 tiger nails from him. A separate case has been registered against him for tiger poaching.

106,2020/02/28,Office space with plug-and-play facilities sought to attract firms,"CII office-bearer takes up issue with Jagadish Shettar

Is the absence of adequate office space with plug-and-play facilities one of the reason for Information Technology (IT) companies to stay away from Mysuru?

Long reckoned to be an ideal investment destination, Mysuru had limited appeal for IT companies concentrated in Bengaluru. But, of late, the demand for ready-to-use office space by companies looking to shift to Mysuru has spurred fresh hopes. A couple of IT companies in Bengaluru including Cognizant Technology Solutions, a multinational, were looking for office space in Mysuru to set up a 3,000-strong unit.

Sources in the IT industry said Cognizant has already started its operations on a small scale from a rented space in Kuvempunagar in the city after talks with STPI, Mysuru, for a suitable office space did not fructify. Cognizant has now taken over Software Paradigms Infotech (SPI), a home-grown IT company of Mysuru.

The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Mysuru Zone, has made out a case for the State government to ensure that adequate ready to use office space with required infrastructure was made available to the IT industry looking to move to Mysuru from Bengaluru.

CII’s Mysuru Zone Vice-President Pavan Ranga, who is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Rangsons Technologies, Mysuru, took up the issue with Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar during his recent visit to Mysuru.

Mysuru has about 45 major IT companies, employing about 21,000 professionals, according to sources in Software Technology Parks of India (STPI). “There may be more, but there are 45 major ones with a minimum workforce of 50 in Mysuru”, the sources added. IT exports from Mysuru accounted for a total of ₹4,200 crore during 2018-19. However, large IT companies such as Infosys and L&T accounted for as much as ₹2,200 crore out of that sum.

In view of the pressure on land and real estate in Bengaluru, a number of IT companies will consider Mysuru for their future expansion or relocation if infrastructure including ready-to-use office space with Internet and other plug-and-play facilities were offered.

Though the STPI is setting up a 40,000 sq. ft IT infrastructure and incubation centre in the city with all amenities, sources in CII said the requirement for major IT companies will be different and in larger volumes.

The STPI’s centre, which is in the final stages of completion, is part of the efforts of the government to create an ecosystem to enable the IT industry to start new businesses and expand their operations. The incubation centre will basically enable start-ups to launch their operations. The incubation centre is likely to be formally inaugurated by June this year with work on interiors of the facility in full swing.

Though co-working spaces are available in Mysuru for companies who did not wish to invest in real estate, sources in the IT sector said co-working spaces will be used by start-ups or smaller companies that did not have security issues. Some companies do not wish to compromise with the security while working from co-working spaces.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/zbq8cy/article30939420.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGOFFICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/office-space-with-plug-and-play-facilities-sought-to-attract-firms/article30939421.ece

114,2020/02/28,Release of scholarships for 15 lakh students delayed,"‘It has caused inconvenience to lakhs of backward class families’

Karnataka State Backward Classes Federation has complained that the State government has delayed the release of scholarships to over 15 lakh school students from the backward classes.

This has caused great inconvenience to lakhs of backward class families in the State, federation president K.M. Ramachandrappa told journalists in Belagavi on Thursday.

“The system of providing scholarships to backward classes students from fifth class to 10th class has been in place for over 40 years now. But the BJP government led by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has stopped it. Students have not received scholarships for months. The scholarships ranged from ₹ 500 to ₹ 1,000 and were meant to incentivise backward classes families to send their children to school,” he said.

The federation has requested Mr. Yediyurappa to release the funds for the project.

“He has assured us that the scholarships would be released. But he has not acted on his assurances,” Mr. Ramachandrappa said.

He said that backward classes were being neglected by successive governments. “While the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes enjoy Constitutional protection in quota and fund allotment, OBCs have no such assured protection. Some powerful communities are enjoying the benefits meant for the OBCs,” he said.

The federation, founded in 2002, was trying to raise issues concerning backward classes and lobby with the government to see that schemes intended for these communities reach them, he said.

Federation leader Suresh Latur demanded that the State government release the report of the caste census conducted by the backward classes commission. “This report has been prepared after spending around ₹ 150 crore. It should be used to scientifically craft welfare schemes and development programmes. Such meticulously collected data will help the government better target welfare schemes,” he said.

Leader Rajendra Sannakki said that the State government was including forward communities in the list of backward classes and the former were snatching away the benefits meant for the deserving deprived classes. “This is because the rulers are acting under pressure from powerful communities. This should stop,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ote6el/article30936447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGBELAGAVIBCCONFERENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/release-of-scholarships-for15-lakh-students-delayed/article30936448.ece
115,2020/02/28,DCC bank polls: Two influential BJP leaders likely to cross swords,"This election has attracted State attention as it indicates BJP’s undercurrent of discontent

Generally, the impact of the district credit cooperative (DCC) bank elections is confined to the district concerned. But the forthcoming election to the Belagavi DCC is being watched curiously by State political circles as the undercurrent of dissatisfaction and alleged groupism within the Bharatiya Janata Party are expected to make their mark here.

The political interest in this district-level election is mainly owing to the possible fight between two prominent politicians of the BJP to establish control over the premier credit body.

Former MP and BJP leader Ramesh Katti has reigned over the bank for 17 years. In the 2015 elections, he defeated Laxman Savadi, who went on to become the Deputy Chief Minister in 2019. It is expected that the battle in March will have the same two teams vying for power.

Five years ago, the Jarkiholi and Katti families joined together to defeat Mr. Savadi and his panel. That is because of the long-standing rivalry between Umesh Katti, MLA, and Mr. Savadi. Observers say the bank elections would be interesting this time as the Kattis have allegedly fallen out of favour with the RSS and BJP top leadership, while Mr. Savadi has grown close to them.

“Mr. Savadi was appointed Deputy Chief Minister despite losing in the Assembly election, while the demand by Mr. Umesh Katti to get party ticket for his younger brother Mr. Ramesh for Chikkodi seat was not met. This shows that the State BJP stands by Mr. Savadi. However, the State-level BJP leaders may not interfere in the district central bank elections as they may consider it to be an insignificant local issue,” said another leader.

Major and Medium Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, who spoke to presspersons here on Saturday, he would not interfere in the polls. He, however, said that his younger brother and MLA Balachandra Jarkiholi would work with Mr. Umesh Katti in ensuring that the election passes off smoothly. “I don’t think the current president would be changed. Even if that change has to be made, Mr. Balachandra and Mr. Umesh will take a decision,” he said.

“Whether the Kattis fight the bank elections or the Jarkiholis, it is the same,” he said. This would now mean that the Kattis, who are upset over not getting ministerial berth, may try to take on Mr. Savadi with the help of the Jarkiholis, who too are said to be uncomfortable with Mr. Savadi’s political elevation.

It is generally believed that forces that are at play in getting the president and office-bearers elected to the premier lending agency in the district, can influence other elections. This is because DCC bank supervises the finances of the primary agriculture cooperative societies and other village-level cooperatives in the district.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/8y0xr/article30936185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGRAMESHKATTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dcc-bank-polls-two-influential-bjp-leaders-likely-to-cross-swords/article30936187.ece
116,2020/02/28,Centre issues notification on Mahadayi water row,"Demand for diversion to Supa rejected

The Centre on Thursday issued a notification on sharing the waters of inter-State Mahadayi among Karnataka, Goa, and Maharashtra.

In its order on August 14, 2018, the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal allocated 13.42 tmcft of water from the Mahadayi to Karnataka.

The tribunal was set up to settle the nearly four-decade-old dispute among the three States. The dispute has been a rallying political point for all political parties in Karnataka.

Power generation

Of the 13.42 tmcft of water allocated for Karnataka, 5.5 tmcft is meant for use within the river basin and for diversion to the Malaprabha reservoir, and around 8 tmcft for power generation. The Supreme Court on February 20, 2020, in its interim order, allowed Karnataka’s plea for implementing the final award by the tribunal.

Water-sharing formula

The tribunal had awarded the water-sharing formula on August 14, 2018 and forwarded it to the Union government for action. Later, all three States filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the tribunal award.

Karnataka filed a petition in the apex court seeking directions to the Centre to notify the award.

The notification said the demand by Karnataka for diversion of 5.27 tmcft of water of Mahadayi river to the Supa reservoir of the Kali hydropower project for power generation has been rejected.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/centre-issues-notification-on-mahadayi-water-row/article30936089.ece
117,2020/02/28,Gurukkal critical of teachers’ opposition,"New eligibility criterion for botany and zoology teachers

Kerala State Higher Education Council vice chairman P.M. Rajan Gurukkal has slammed the objections raised by a section of the teaching community to recognising postgraduation in biotechnology as an eligibility qualification for teaching posts in botany and zoology.

Viewing the mounting opposition as an indication of the discipline-centric intolerance of teachers, Prof. Gurukkal said the government order, issued on the basis of a recommendation by the State-Level Academic Committee, which comprised of Vice Chancellors of State universities, rested on the wisdom of experts in the field.

‘Experts’ decision’

“The decision was made by experts who realise that the latest areas of knowledge are inherently cross-disciplinary. Besides, the step has been adopted on the distinct understanding that the disciplinary boundaries of botany and zoology do not let in latest developments in their common domain called life science,” he said.

He added that most of the life science themes belong to science-tech hybrid areas which forge ahead in analysing molecular structures through X-ray crystallography and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Irrespective of whether it is botany or zoology, teachers have to deal with the micro-universe of functional and structural genomics through microarray technologies and automated techniques.

According to the academician, experts have advised the council that the disciplinary boundary should disappear as the related subjects are all part of the life science domain. Teachers specialised in fields of cross-disciplinary nature are indispensable to the task of familiarising students with new knowledge. Student must be assisted in acquiring cross-disciplinary adaptability.

“Whoever is up-to-date and competent in dealing with the latest knowledge in the domain must be given precedence. What the teachers demand is that specialists from allied fields do not be even considered eligible to apply. It is an unashamed cry of obsolescence from disciplinary silos,” he said.

Governor petitioned

The Save University Campaign Committee has petitioned the Governor to intervene and direct the government to withdraw the order. They alleged that the move encroached upon the authority of statutory bodies of universities.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/q59z1l/article30945848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TVRAJANGURUKKAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gurukkal-critical-of-teachers-demand/article30945837.ece
118,2020/02/28,Salary revision a distant prospect in KSRTC,"Referendum to select recognised unions is being delayed

The delay in revising salary and perks is causing much discontent among the 30,000-odd personnel in the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation.

A pay revision agreement signed between the management and employees’ unions had expired on February 28, 2016 and there has been no raise in emoluments for the past four years.

Also, the validity of the recognised unions — the CITU-affiliated Kerala State Road Transport Employees Association (KSRTEA) and the INTUC-affiliated Transport Democratic Federation (TDF) — ended on December 14, 2019 after a six-month grace period, drastically reducing the prospects of labour disputes’ redressal.

The last referendum to select recognised unions was held in 2016.

A minimum of 15% votes is needed for becoming a registered union as per the Kerala Recognition of Trade Union Act, 2010 and Kerala Recognition of Trade Unions Rules, 2011. In the 2016 referendum, the KSRTEA got 48% votes and the TDF, 28%, from an electorate of 42,000.

Unions up in arms

The employees and the trade unions are up in arms against the delay in initiating talks for a pay revision agreement. As the KSRTC is in a deep financial crisis, they cannot resort to stir.

Since there is no registered union, the government or the management find it difficult to hold meetings on crucial issues.

At a time when the 11th Pay Commission has initiated work for revising the salary of State employees and teachers, no step has been taken to enter into a new pay revision pact in the KSRTC. “The unions affiliated to the CITU and the AITUC are behind the delay,” sources in the KSRTC said.

14 unions eligible

Following the intervention of the High Court in a case filed by the TDF, the Labour Commissioner, also the Registrar of Trade Unions, had posted the Regional Joint Labour Commissioner, Kozhikode, as the Returning Officer for the referendum on February 20.

The Labour Commissioner had found 14 trade unions eligible for participating in the referendum.

But, sources said no step had been taken to convene a meeting of these unions, post the Assistant Returning Officer, and publish the voters’ list and the election schedule.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/salary-revision-a-distant-prospect-in-ksrtc/article30945828.ece

120,2020/02/28,Use new fields to make farmers ‘smart’: Governor,"At KAU convocation, he emphasises the need to ensure quality in food processing

Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has called upon agriculture experts to build on sunrise sectors such as food processing and value addition.

Addressing a convocation ceremony of Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) at Mannuthy on Friday, he emphasised the need to build on science and technology to develop global competitiveness and to focus on conformity with global standards and quality in food processing.

Great potential

“Kerala, with its rich biodiversity and agroclimatic variations, offers immense potential to develop value-added products and thereby enhance the income options of farmers. Strict adherence to good agricultural practices (GAP) and quality standards is essential today to meet the demands of diverse categories of consumers,” the Governor said.

“The State needs to develop capabilities in emerging areas such as blockchain technology, nanotechnology, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning and improve use of biotechnology to equip farmers with smart decision-making facilities. This points to newer areas of agricultural research, where young graduates will have a leading role in the years to come. I hope that the recent academic collaboration of KAU with foreign universities such as Cornell University, University of Tokyo, University of Western Sydney, and University of Western Australia will provide an impetus to research in newer areas. Such global linkages can help to transform the university into a one-stop solution provider to the farming community,” he said.

Food security

“It is a matter of pride that ever since its inception in 1972, Kerala Agricultural University has been in the forefront of ensuring the great mission of food security and sustainable agricultural development. By releasing 331 high-yielding varieties of important crops of the State, by providing timely guidance on the best farming practices and effective solutions to agricultural issues, the university has remained socially relevant and committed to the cause of agriculture. I am told that 13 more new crop varieties are going to be released. The credibility enjoyed by the university among the farmers of Kerala is evident in two rice varieties, Uma and Jyoti, covering almost 80% of the paddy area in the State,” the Governor said.

“It is for fresh graduates of today to become the flag-bearers of this great institution by taking forward this legacy. A graduation ceremony is also an occasion to be reminded of the challenges that lie ahead in one’s chosen field. We are aiming for the national goal of doubling farmers’ income by 2022. This certainly adds to our responsibility as professionals,” the Governor said.

Pro Chancellor and Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunil Kumar presided. K. Rajan, Government Chief Whip; K. Alagusundaram, Deputy Director General, Indian Council of Agricultural Research; R. Chandrababu, Vice Chancellor, KAU; D. Girija, Registrar, KAU, and others participated.

121,2020/02/28,Devotees take out march,"Attack on Kuttoor Mahadevar temple on Sivaratri night condemned

The women’s wing (Vanitha Samajam) of the Nair Service Society (NSS) has condemned the alleged indifference on the part of the police in arresting the miscreants who went on a rampage inside the Mahadevar Temple at Kuttoor in Thiruvalla on the night of Sivaratri.

Woman devotees, under the aegis of the samajam, took out a protest march to the police station demanding the arrest of all culprits without any further delay.

Sit-in

The protesters staged a sit-in on the road and samajom leader Prasanna Satheesh, also a grama panchayat member, inaugurated the march.

Ms. Satheesh said a group of miscreants had barged into the temple and assaulted many woman devotees and children who were taking part in the Sivaratri puja.

In a drunken frenzy, they destroyed the bronze lamps and tried to break open the sanctum sanctorum, unleashing terror on the temple premises, she said.

Many devotees were injured in the melee and two of them had been admitted to the Taluk Hospital in Thiruvalla, later, she said.

NSS Karayogam president Sureshkumar and vice president Binil Manicheril said the miscreants fled the scene before the police reached the spot. Though the police had identified all the accused, they were yet to bring them to book, the karayogam leaders alleged.

They further alleged that there were attempts to politicise the issue to protect the key accused in the case. Mr. Sureshkumar said the NSS Karayogam members belonged to different political ideologies and the devotees hailed from all sections of Hindu society.

He said the accused miscreants were still at large in the locality and the Karayogam has sought immediate intervention of the the police in the case and take stern action against them.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/devotees-take-out-march/article30945652.ece
122,2020/02/28,Generate value-added products from milk: CM,"Ksheera Sangamam 2020 concludes

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Friday underlined the need to generate value-added products from milk.

Instead of sticking solely to traditional methods, the dairy sector should be prepared to adopt technical changes in tune with the times, the Chief Minister said, inaugurating the valedictory session of Ksheera Sangamam 2020, a dairy farmers' conclave organised by the Dairy Development Department at the Kanakakunnu Palace grounds.

Ideal scenario

It would be ideal if every dairy cooperative is able to transform at least 10% of the procured milk into value-added products.

The help of institutions such as the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (KVASU) should be sought for such ventures, the Chief Minister said.

The State government is committed to the development of the dairy sector. The State is fast approaching the target of self sufficiency in milk production, he added.

The Chief Minister also gave away the awards for the best dairy farmer parliamentarians on the occasion.

126,2020/02/28,Kozhikode Nirdesh on the verge of closure?,"Extended tenure of deputy director will come to an end today

The Ministry of Defence has decided not to appoint a deputy director general for the National Institute for Research and Development in Defence Shipbuilding (Nirdesh) at Chaliyam in Kozhikode district, giving an impression that the project may be wound up soon.

The extended tenure of incumbent deputy director D.C. Agarwal will come to an end on Saturday. Dr. Agarwal, a scientist, was appointed as a consultant in July 2014 to vitalise and operationalise Nirdesh for five years. Then he was given a six-month extension.

The development comes on the heels of the Ministry of Defence appointing an officer on special duty, V.K. Surendran, who retired from the Mazagon Dock Limited after its project director Captain B. Ramesh Babu was repatriated to his parent organisation in August 2019.

Thus the project will not have a deputy director general as well as a project director.

Official sources say Nirdesh, functioning directly under the Department of Defence Production, has been going through a rough patch at some point or another since former Defence Minister A.K. Antony laid the foundation stone for the project in January 2011.

The five-and-a-half-year tenure of Dr. Agarwal, official sources say, itself has taken a lot of heat, including his setting up of an office in Delhi. He visited Kozhikode only on four occasions, 10 days all these years.

Stay in Delhi

One of the reasons he has remained in the national capital is that he would sort out issues for getting approval and financial support from the Centre. Incidentally, training programmes imparted for multiple agencies came to an abrupt end in 2017. Four research and development projects incurring an expenditure of ₹50 lakh — three at the Indian Institutes of Technologies at Guwahati and Kanpur and one at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru — have yielded no results.

The original proposal of Nirdesh was to set up a world-class ship designing institute at a cost of ₹600 crore. However, the much-touted project for Kozhikode city has reached nowhere till now.

Funds released via Mazagon Dock Limited, Goa Shipyard Limited, Hindustan Shipyard Limited, and Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Limited have sustained the project.

Even as the fate of the project is hanging fire, the State government has planned to recover the land for expansion of the Beypore port.

Unfazed by local-level protests, the government had acquired 40 acres for Nirdesh a decade ago. It was then said that the project would not only generate employment but also stimulate growth in the city.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/inui5e/article30946459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29TVNIRDESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nirdesh-on-the-verge-of-closure/article30944202.ece
127,2020/02/28,Row over nudity in Malayalam play: NSD seeks explanation from director,"Bhaskara Pattelarum Thommiyude Jeevithavum staged at Bharat Rang Mahotsav in Puducherry earlier this month

The National School of Drama (NSD) has sought an explanation from director Suveeran for the inclusion of a nude scene in his play Bhaskara Pattelarum Thommiyude Jeevithavum staged at the Bharat Rang Mahotsav - International Theatre Festival of India in Puducherry earlier this month.

Speaking to The Hindu, Suveeran wondered whether the action had more to do with the political underpinnings of the play and his political speech at the end of the play, referring to the ongoing protests in the country.

NSD registrar P.K. Mohanty, in his letter, says the NSD chairperson and many other dignitaries present on the day had ""huge objections to the scene, which they communicated verbally"" to the registrar.

First performed in 1996

""This play was first performed in 1996, when it was staged at over 100 venues. Now, in this updated version, we have already performed at venues including ITFoK in Thrissur before an audience that comprises of distinguished personalities, all of whom had words of appreciation. The play itself raises questions of the power structures. Following the staging, I had made a speech questioning the silence of the NSD students when students from universities across the country are protesting against the government's policies. I wonder whether this is what led to this letter now,"" says Suveeran, who won the national award for best film for Byaari in 2011

In his letter to the NSD, he says he is amazed by their letter as the NSD has a rich legacy of promoting experimental plays as a part of its academic endeavours.

""I am reminded of an incident while I was a student in NSD. One of my plays was hailed by the faculty members of NSD though an actor was presented nude in the play and I was given the highest score for the play. There were many plays from the West showcased by NSD itself in which nudity was shown. But no incident of banning such plays or they being a topic of much discussion have never been reported,"" the letter says.

Explanation

""The protagonist of the play I directed is a slave who is almost always naked in the play. He is clad in a torn dothi which he uses to cover his nudity. At times the torn cloth is slipped from his hands and exposes his nudity for a while. This culminates in the final scene in which he runs away totally naked. It is a pity that all these things need to be explained to an institution like the NSD, which is the cradle of theatre experimentation in India,"" he says.

On the NSD's allegation that he committed breach of agreement as the DVD submitted while applying for participation did not have the nude scene, he says a play is not a mechanical imitation of the video documentation of its first performance. The DVD was sent for quality analysis.

The director is yet to get remuneration for the play. It is also set to be performed at the Mahindra Excellence in Theatre Awards next month, which is incidentally being held at the NSD in Delhi.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6oww3n/article30946414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20200228193046,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nsd-seeks-explanation-from-director-over-nudity-in-play/article30944132.ece
128,2020/02/28,Missing girl’s body recovered from river,"According to preliminary autopsy report the seven-year-old died of drowning

The body of Devananda (Ponnu), who went missing from Elavur on Thursday, was recovered by divers from Ithikara river that flows near her home.

The body of the seven-year-old was found floating near the bushes when the search party resumed operations on Friday morning. Her preliminary autopsy report revealed that the girl died of drowning and according to the inquest her body carried no injuries or marks of assault.

She was wearing the same clothes she was last seen in and the primary assumption of the police is that the girl must have fallen into the water when she ventured out on her own. Meanwhile, many residents expressed suspicion in the death and Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has demanded a probe into the alleged mystery.

Daughter of Pradeep Kumar and Dhanya of Dhanesh Bhavanam, Nedumankavu, the child was a student of the Saraswathy Vidyalaya, Kudavattoor. She went missing on Thursday morning when her mother was washing clothes outside their house.

According to her mother, she had instructed Devananda to stay indoors and keep a watch on her three-month-old younger brother who was sleeping at that time. When she returned after the chore, she found the girl missing and the front door open. The mother alerted the neighbours and they conducted a search for the girl in nearby areas before informing the police. Her father Pradeep, who works abroad, could reach Kollam only on Friday morning and it was his daughter's lifeless body that awaited him.

The police had launched an intensive search and a 50-member special investigation team, including cyber experts, was formed to track the girl on Thursday itself. Fire and Rescue Services team, diving experts and dog squad had joined the search party, but the girl could not be traced.

Taking into account the possibility of kidnapping, strict vehicle checks were carried out and all major roads, railway stations and bus stands in the district were put under strict surveillance.

After a post-mortem at the Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram, her body was brought to Kollam around 5 p.m. and hundreds of people, including officials, politicians and the public, paid homage to her. Ministers including Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, politicians, actors and prominent figures from all fields condoled the untimely demise of Devananda.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/e48lyc/article30946430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvChild,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/missing-girls-body-recovered-from-river/article30943530.ece
129,2020/02/28,Row erupts over male nudity in Malayalam play,"Bhaskara Pattelarum Thommiyude Jeevithavum staged at Bharat Rang Mahotsav in Puducherry on February 12

A controversy has erupted after the National School of Drama (NSD) issued notice seeking clarification from the director for including an act of nudity in his Malayalam play Bhaskara Pattelarum Thommiyude Jeevithavum (Bhaskara Pattelar and Life of Thommy) staged at Bharat Rang Mahotsav - International Theatre Festival of India, 2020 in Puducherry on February 12.

The play is directed by Suveeran, a best feature film national awardee for Byari (2011). The play is based on the novella Bhaskara Pattelarum Entey Jeevithavum by writer Paul Zacharia.

In a letter seeking clarification, the NSD said some who saw the play at the festival had ‘huge objection’ to the act of nudity in the play. It was presented before an audience comprising the NSD Society chairperson and many other dignitaries. As per the law, nudity and obscenity is banned in public performance.

Responding to the allegation, Suveeran said he believed that if nudity can enhance the total feel of the play it can even be used in public staging. “How can one say that the rules one should observe in public places are applicable in art as well? ... The play was staged in a closed place before a group of invited guests. Is the place akin to a public place,’’ Suveeran asked.

Selection process

The NSD said the play was chosen for the festival after a two-tier selection process and there was no scene of nudity in the DVD of the play submitted by Suveeran. “In view of this, it is clear a breach of agreement by including an act of nudity in the play... without prior information and approval of the NSD authority,” the NSD said.

Suveeran said the DVD submitted to the NSD was for quality analysis. He has never ever heard of censorship in plays. “The organic nature of plays gives the director freedom to intervene and improve the performance in each ensuing stage,” he said.

“The protagonist of the play I directed is a slave who is almost always naked in the play. He is clad in a torn dothi which he uses to cover his nudity.

130,2020/02/28,SC returns State plea on airport to HC,"Merits of AAI’s proposal for operation rights of Thiruvananthapuram airport to Adani

The Supreme Court on Friday left it to the Kerala High Court (HC) to decide the merits of the Airports Authority of India's 'request for proposal' to grant the right of operation, management and development of the Thiruvananthapuram international airport to Adani Enterprises Limited.

""We are sending it back,"" a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde observed.

The HC had on December 18 last concluded that the State’s writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution was not maintainable before it. The AAI proposal was essentially an implementation of the Central policy. The dispute was between the State and the Centre. Only the Supreme Court has the jurisdiction in such disputes. Kerala ought to directly file a suit under Article 131 in the Supreme Court, the HC had advised.

State’s stance

Challenging this conclusion, the State contended in the Supreme Court that the AAI is a necessary party in this dispute. Though it is a government policy, it is the AAI which has to prepare the lease. The lease for turning over the airport to the Adani company would be bad in law without the participation of the AAI. The State dismissed the idea of filing a direct suit in the Supreme Court under Article 131.

However, the Supreme Court now left open the issue whether the dispute comes under Article 131.

The Kerala government contended that a suit under Article 131 is permitted only if the dispute is exclusively between the Centre and a State government. The AAI does not qualify to be called a ‘State’ under the Article. Hence, a suit under Article 131 cannot be filed in the Supreme Court. So, only a writ petition under Article 226 would lie, Kerala argued.

The State contended that handing over the airport to Adani Enterprises Limited, which has no previous experience in managing airports, is “not in public interest and is violative of the provisions of the Airports Authority of India Act of 1994 and the proprietary rights of the State government as regards the land wherein the Thiruvananthapuram airport is situated”.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/reijj0/article30943339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/image,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sc-returns-state-plea-on-airport-to-hc/article30943340.ece
131,2020/02/28,Missing 7-year-old girl’s body found in Kollam river,"Devananda had gone missing from her home on Thursday.

The body of a seven-year-old girl who went missing from Elavur in Kollam has been recovered by divers from the Ithikara river that flows near her home.

Devananda (Ponnu)’s body was found floating near the bushes by the search party on Friday morning.

The child went missing on Thursday morning when her mother was washing clothes outside the house. Her mother Dhanya said that she had instructed Devananda to stay indoors and keep an eye on her three-month-old brother who was asleep. When Dhanya returned from her chores, she found the front door open and the girl missing. The mother alerted the neighbours, who conducted a search for the girl in nearby area before informing the police.

Devananda’s father Pradeep Kumar, who works abroad, reached Kollam on Friday morning.

Police had launched an intensive search with a 50-member special investigation team, including cyber-experts, to track the child. Fire and safety team, diving experts and dog squad had joined the search party on Thursday, but the girl could not be traced. Taking into account the possibility of kidnapping, vehicle checks were carried out; all major roads, railway stations and bus stands in the Kollam district were put under surveillance.

Primary assumption of the police is that the girl must have slipped into water when she ventured out of her home on Thursday. She was found wearing the same clothes she had worn when last seen. Her body has been taken to Medical College Hospital in Thiruvananthapuram for autopsy.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ujxyiw/article30936532.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvChild,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/missing-7-year-old-girls-body-found-in-kollam-river/article30941297.ece

133,2020/02/28,VACB to quiz Kunju tomorrow,"Move triggers speculations of arrest in Palarivattom flyover case

The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) is set to question former Public Works Minister V.K. Ebrahim Kunju again on Saturday.

The Indian Union Muslim League politician had come under a cloud after the agency implicated him for corruption in the faulty construction of the flyover at Palarivattom in Kochi. The VACB has demanded the presence of Mr. Kunju before the investigating officer here on Saturday.

The move has triggered speculations that the summons may be the precursor of a possible arrest. The Assembly is due to convene on March 2 and any such steps will have political implications. Such a measure will require the approval of the Speaker.

So far, the VACB has arrested four persons, including former Public Works Secretary T. O Sooraj, in connection with the case. Mr. Sooraj’s statements to the VACB had brought the probe to the doorstep of Mr. Kunju.

The charge

Investigators suspect that Mr. Kunju had stacked the deck in favour of the private builder contracted by the government to execute the flyover project. He had “ordered” the release of ₹9 crore in advance to the builder. The government had sanctioned the “mobilisation fund” at a nominal rate of interest. The advance credit extended to the builder in “brazenly advantageous terms” had resulted in a loss of ₹60 lakh to the public exchequer.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vacb-to-quiz-kunju-tomorrow/article30939675.ece

V. Muraleedharan, Union Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, on Thursday said that India’s work in the field of science and technology was exemplary.

He was inaugurating the 29th Swadeshi Science Congress held at the Central Plantation Crops Research Centre here. He said that science fulfilled its mission when discoveries were utilised by people for their welfare.

There should be a sincere effort by scientists in this regard, he said.

Mr. Muraleedharan said the Centre had been able to convince the people that solar power could provide the world with clean energy. India’s achievements in space research were a surprise to the world, he said.

The talents of Indian scientists were world-famous. “But when science and technology and society are intertwined, development becomes a reality,” he said. Science had advanced much, but the problems of the common man in the country had not been scientifically solved, he said, adding that inventions should be for the common man.

Appreciating the Swadeshi Science Congress, the Minister said was is an important venue for astronomers to come together, share important scientific contributions, and honour those who had made great strides. Myths and legends were passed down from one generation to another.

“With the development of modern technology, our country’s scientific heritage has reached even the younger generation today,” he said

It was important to tap the possibilities offered by adopting strategies such as re-skilling and multi-skilling the workforce, the Governor said, inaugurating TRIMA 2020, the two-day annual management convention of Trivandrum Management Association (TMA), here.

“The annual convention rightly focusses on the Fourth Industrial Revolution and its impact on our business scenario. The age of Industry 4.0, is marked by automation through robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), promising higher productivity, increased efficiency, safety, and convenience,” the Governor said.

Job scenario

While the Fourth Industrial Revolution will make 75 million jobs obsolete by the year 2022, it is also projected to create 133 million new jobs, according to World Economic Forum report, he noted.

“Moving into the era of Industry 4.0 makes it necessary to build competitive advantage by understanding the impact of new technological changes and to adapt new business models. Business houses need to apprise governments about the active role to be played by the State, as a creator and regulator of innovation,” he said.

Qualities such as teamwork, empathy, curiosity, creativity, innovation, critical thinking, lifelong learning, social intelligence, and emotional intelligence are essential for everyone. An atmosphere of cooperation between the decision-makers and the workforce is of utmost importance in today’s work atmosphere.

138,2020/02/28,Kerala's record comes in for praise at nutrition meet,"Kerala on a par with developed nations, says Governor

All efforts to resolve micronutrient deficiency should be focussed on women and children so that the foundation can be laid for a healthier generation, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan has said.

The efforts taken by Kerala to improve the nutritional status of children and to resolve micronutrient deficiency will see the State on a par with developed nations, he added. Mr. Khan was inaugurating the national nutrition meet being organised by the Department of Women and Children here on Thursday.

UN goal

Ending hunger and malnutrition is one of the Sustainable Development Goals put forth by the United Nations but despite the improvements made by the country in child health, malnutrition continues to be a major issue.

A healthy woman is empowered and it is from her that a healthy family can be built. A diverse diet can help resolve the issue of micronutrient deficiency but not all can afford such a diet. Food fortification is an area where there should be more attention so that the nutritional deficiencies of the masses can be resolved, Mr. Khan pointed out. He was all praise for the manner in which Kerala was nurturing its woman and children.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said the government was trying to ensure that tasty yet nutritious food are being provided to children in schools, including anganwadis.

With the COVID-19 epidemic leaving a global imprint, Kerala Tourism has postponed roadshows planned in Amsterdam, Milan, and Madrid in March for promoting the destination and tourism products.

However, it has decided to participate in ITB Berlin, the world’s largest tourism trade fair, to be held at Messe Berlin from March 4 to 8, Salon Mondial du Tourisme in Paris from March 12 to 15, and the three-day 27th Moscow International Travel & Tourism Exhibition from March 17.

The roadshow of March 16 in Moscow will be held as scheduled. Secretary, Tourism, Rani George will lead the official delegation to the three trade fairs and roadshows.

The decision to postpone the three roadshows in the Netherlands, Italy, and Spain was taken by Kerala Tourism after more people tested positive for COVID-19 and the European Union confirming the outbreak in Europe.

As many as 20 tour operators, representatives of serviced villas/ homestays/ Ayurveda centres, houseboat service providers, and representatives of hotels and resorts were to attend each of these roadshows.

The decision of the AUMA, association of German trade fair industry, and trade show organisers to go ahead with ITB Berlin has come as a relief to Kerala Tourism as Germans accounted for 6.04% of foreign tourist arrivals to the State in 2018.

141,2020/02/28,"Amid COVID-19 fears, Saudi ban hits Umra pilgrims","SpiceJet offloads pilgrims at Karipur, Oman Air deports dozens from Muscat

The ban on Umra pilgrims imposed by Saudi Arabia from Thursday over fears of COVID-19 has hit hundreds of Keralites preparing to fly to Jeddah.

The Saudi government’s announcement reached the State on Thursday morning, triggering panic and chaos among hundreds of pilgrims. As many as 97 Umra passengers who had boarded SpiceJet flight at the Calicut international airport, Karipur, were offloaded when the announcement reached the airport around 5 a.m. The flight, with 180 passengers, was to take off at 5.40 a.m. from Karipur.

About two dozen visit-visa passengers going to Jeddah were also deboarded along with the Umra pilgrims.

Also Read Umra ban hits travel industry

An Oman Air flight which carried dozens of Umra passengers from Karipur offloaded them at Muscat, and deported them back to Karipur. Jeddah flights of Etihad and Air India, scheduled at 9.45 a.m. and 5.40 p.m. respectively, cancelled their Umra passengers.

Confusion galore

The Saudi Arabian Airlines flight (12.35 p.m.) caused confusion at the airport by giving boarding passes to a section of Umra passengers. Airline sources said the confusion happened when the ground-handling wing at the airport went about issuing boarding passes as it had not been given any instruction about the travel ban on Umra pilgrims. However, Saudi Arabian Airlines crew stood ground that no pilgrim would be carried in the wake of the government ban. Nearly 100 Umra passengers of Saudi Arabian Airlines were sent back home.

Although Saudi Arabia had issued the ban order on Wednesday evening, the bureaucratic delay in informing the airlines in time caused the confusion and chaos at the airport.

Uncertainties continued through the day as travel agents and airlines could not give any definite answers. First it was a total ban for all passengers except those having residence permits in Saudi Arabia. Later, the travel ban was reduced to Umra pilgrims and tourists, exempting those going on business and joining family.

“Still there’s a lot of confusion. We don’t know how long the ban will continue,” said N. Abdul Rasheed, joint secretary of the Kerala Umra Welfare Association (KUWA).

KUWA general secretary Mohammed Basheer K., in separate memorandums, has requested the major airlines either to refund the tickets or to reschedule the travel without imposing penalties on the passengers.

Grapevine in the travel industry is that the ban on Umra pilgrims is likely to continue until the second week of May.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/3kz4xx/article30936229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvumrah,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/saudi-ban-hits-umra-pilgrims/article30936228.ece
142,2020/02/28,116 more medical PG seats in State,"MCI nod to convert PG diploma seats

The Medical Council of India (MCI) has given approval to the State to convert the medical PG diploma seats in its medical colleges to PG degree seats, a release here said.

The State will thus get 116 more medical PG seats, including 109 in the government sector and seven in self-financing colleges.

The distribution of the government PG seats are as follows: Alappuzha Government Medical College (10), Kottayam (22), Kozhikode (50), Thiruvananthapuram (27). Admissions to these seats will be possible in the 2020-21 academic year itself. With this, 256 medical PG seats have been newly secured by the State during the LDF government’s tenure

The MCI gave the approval for converting the two-year PG diploma seats to three-year PG degree seats after considering the information on the infrastructural and academic facilities in medical colleges furnished by the Department of Medical Education and the recommendations of the PG experts’ group.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja hailed the MCI decision, which, she said, was a result of the positive steps taken by the government.

143,2020/02/28,It’s alarm bells for the farm sector in Kerala,"KAU issues advisory for summer-time crop protection, experts warn of long-term impact

Rise in temperature levels -- in recent years even before the formal onset of summer -- will have an adverse impact on farming in the State, a situation that calls for smart agricultural practices and efficient irrigation strategies, experts warn.

“The mean atmospheric temperature in Kerala is increasing at a rate of about 0.4 to 0.5 degree in a decade, which is alarming considering its effects on agriculture. Elevated temperature will reduce crop maturity period by 8-10%, which will reduce their yields by 2 to 30% in major crops of Kerala,” says G. Byju, Principal Scientist (Crop Production), Central Tuber Crops Research Institute (CTCRI).

Since mid-February, the India Meteorological Department has been issuing alerts that day temperatures will be above the normal by two to three degrees. The summer months also are expected to be hotter than usual.

Weather aberrations can affect a bevy of crops, including paddy, coconut, pepper, cardamom, coffee and tea, Dr. Byju says. Studies show that in the case of paddy, an increase in maximum temperature by one degree Celsius could affect yield by 5 to 10%, he points out.

“Coconut, the most important crop of the State, cultivated in 39% of the total cropped area, will be seriously affected if there is a prolonged dry spell and high temperature and its yield is likely to be reduced by 10-30% in the next year and subsequent year. The heavy rainfall received during monsoon followed by high temperature and drought will affect the development of nut formation and seasonality of nut production,” he says.

Anticipating a harsh summer ahead, Kerala Agricultural University (KAU) has issued advisories on summer-time crop protection for coconut, paddy, nutmeg, vegetables, banana, areca nut and pepper.

Among other things, KAU has advised farmers to adopt smart and efficient irrigation methods, including micro- and drip-irrigation techniques, during the summer months.

“Rise in temperatures can have a long-term impact on crops, change plant physiology, and even affect the quality of the produce. In perennial crops such as coconut, where irrigation is affected during the warmer months, the impact will be visible in the long run,” P. Indira Devi, Director of Research, KAU, says.

Plausible solutions

Adoption of climate smart agriculture practices such as use of drought-tolerant crop varieties, low external input sustainable agriculture, locally adaptable integrated farming system models, groundwater recharging, and soil conservation measures are some of the plausible solutions, Dr. Byju says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rem3sq/article30936173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tv-Temperaturecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/its-alarm-bells-for-the-farm-sector/article30936165.ece
144,2020/02/28,Kamal Haasan charts path for TN’s economic revival,"Gearing up for 2021 polls, MNM chief outlines plans to boost employment, industry

Moving into campaign mode for the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections scheduled for 2021, Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) founder Kamal Haasan on Friday announced the party’s vision, which includes financial compensation for housewives, support to create at least five lakh small entrepreneurs, and a crackdown on corruption that will generate additional finances to meet social goals.

Describing the philosophy as one of a ‘centrist Enterprise Economy,’ the 65-year-old actor-turned-politician said this would eliminate ‘favouritism based on caste, religion and left/right ideologies.’ Pursuing this would need leadership with integrity and clarity that went beyond “family politics,” which his party thought he could provide, and Tamil Nadu could aspire to be a “$1 trillion” economy, he proposed.

Talks with Rajini

In an hour-long interaction with the media in Chennai, Mr. Haasan said there was scope for discussions with actor Rajinikanth, who is aspiring to take the political plunge.

“He and I have been speaking for the development of Tamil Nadu. It is possible that on some issues we have policy differences, but his comments in recent days appear to be non-partisan and in the interests of the State and country,” Mr. Haasan said.

“We believe all those who feel such a commonality of goals will come together. But let us cross the bridge when we come to it,” he added on possible electoral alliances, which “can be considered if necessary.”

Re-imagining TN

On his vision document titled “Re-imagining ‘Thamizh’ Nadu”, he said widespread corruption in the State was leaking enormous revenue, and curbing just this one factor would save 40% revenue and help implement pro-people schemes.

Conditions in the State were so dismal that industrialists were unwilling to invest, while those who had already set up units felt suffocated, Mr. Haasan said, pointing out that 50 big industrialists could speed up the economy, but so could five lakh small entrepreneurs whom the MNM would support.

Alliance with the people

Asked if forming an alliance without the Dravidian parties was feasible in Tamil Nadu, he argued that people would respond on the basis of actual work, and the MNM relied on the performance factor. “The process of forming a wonderful alliance has already begun with the people of Tamil Nadu,” he said.

The veteran thespian said the contribution of women to the economy was not appreciated, and they were engaged in economic production from home. Financially compensating them would not be a “freebie”, and there was a need to move away from “mere welfare and electoral politics.”

Slide in indicators

Deploring the slide in Tamil Nadu’s indices, the MNM leader said the high-potential State had unemployment of 6.2%, accounted for only 0.79% of total investments across the country at 12th position, besides coming in at a low 15th rank in the Ease of Doing Business index. The NITI Aayog had noted that the State had slipped sharply in the health index ranking, from 3rd in 2015-16 to 9th position in 2017-18. Maharashtra was forging ahead, although Tamil Nadu could outpace it easily, he said.

Primacy to agriculture was a core plank for the MNM, and it could claim credit for being the party that first sought the status of a protected agriculture zone for the Cauvery Delta, Mr Haasan said. “They [the government] waited till everyone forgot who asked for the status, before declaring it,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/9njcuz/article30943878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KamalHaasan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kamal-haasan-charts-path-for-tns-economic-revival/article30943880.ece

Jaishankar, Mr. Palaniswami wrote: “I bring to your kind attention the plight of around 450 fishermen from India, including 300 fishermen from Tamil Nadu who are working in various fishing vessels berthed and operating in various ports of Iran.”

These fishermen were reportedly stranded in Port Kish, Cheeru and other places in Iran, due to the cancellation of flights, following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran.

“The fishermen are requesting to evacuate them from Iran immediately. I request your good office to direct the Embassy of India in Iran to provide the required support to the fishermen and also to make arrangements for their safe and immediate return to India,” Mr. Palaniswami stated.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gdw4v7/article30942199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28FEBTH-EDAPPADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/edappadi-urges-centre-to-evacuate-tamil-nadu-fishermen-stranded-in-iran/article30942201.ece

He recalled that people of his generation had to wait in queue for rice and sugar but things had changed for today’s generation, thanks to the efforts of the scientists. “We should therefore celebrate the achievements of our scientists and technologists today,” he said.

Scientists had made it possible to develop indelible ink, tractors, milk powder and till recently build aircraft. “To bring further affluence in India comparable to that in developed economies I am sure the young graduates will take up challenges of the society,” he said.

Mr. Mande said ‘innovation’ is the buzz word of the 21st century. The younger generation should be prepared with skills such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, which are the science of future. He urged students to actively participate in Science Day celebrations on Friday.

151,2020/02/28,High Court to hear today plea of 21 DMK MLAs,"After a gap of over 16 months since the last hearing, the Madras High Court is all set to hear on Friday a batch of cases filed in 2017 by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president M.K. Stalin and 12 other legislators from his party challenging the breach of privilege proceedings initiated against them for having displayed the banned Gutkha sachets in the Legislative Assembly on July 19, 2017 to prove their availability in local shops.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad would be hearing the batch along with many other cases related to the Motion of Confidence passed in the Assembly on February 18, 2017. Mr. Stalin himself had then filed yet another writ petition to set aside the motion and order conduct of a fresh floor test through secret ballot, under the observation of a monitoring committee, and without evicting any of the legislators.

These writ petitions were first heard by Justice M. Duraiswamy who on September 8, 2017 restrained the Committee of Privileges of Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly from proceeding against the 21 DMK legislators and directed it to defer the deadline of September 12, 2017 fixed for the MLAs to reply to the show-cause notices issued to them on August 28, 2017. Thereafter, the cases were heard by Justice K. Ravichandrabaabu who referred them to a Division Bench.

In the meantime, 18 other MLAs, who were disqualified from holding the posts for having switched sides from the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) to a faction led by that party’s former leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran, too filed individual writ petitions challenging their disqualifications. All these cases were listed together before the then first Division Bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee (now a Supreme Court judge) and Justice M. Sundar.

That Bench ended up deciding the 18 MLAs batch alone after marathon arguments advanced for months together and in the process, the other cases were left behind.

153,2020/02/28,Foreign Contribution Regulation Act violation: Central Bureau of Investigation conducts searches in State,"Case registered based on complaint from the Union Home Ministry’s FCRA wing

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has conducted searches in three locations in Tamil Nadu in connection with a case against Caruna Bal Vikas (CBV), Adhane Management Consultants, Bentinck Higher Secondary School and others for alleged violations of the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA).

“The searches were carried out on the premises of Rampart Patnaiya, Deva Anugraham Daniel and Christopher Rajkumar, directors of Adhane Management Consultants, in Chennai and Yelagiri hills,” said a CBI official.

The case was registered a week ago, on a complaint from the Union Home Ministry’s FCRA wing. It alleged that CBV had used a part of foreign receipts for religious activities. The non-government organisation received funds from Compassion International-United States during the check period.

“Further, CBV has, inter alia, declared its long term objective of ‘converting poor children into fulfilled Christian adults’, and thus engaged in religious activities, including conversions to Christianity. Such activities have the potential to disturb communal harmony and therefore, are in violation of the Section 12(4)(f)(vi) of the FCRA, 2010,” the FIR alleged.

According to the Income-Tax Department’s report, CBV used only 10% of foreign contributions for the declared purposes and the remaining was diverted to 300 NGOs in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other States. Some of these were not registered under the FCRA. The FCRA wing alleged that ₹1 crore was transferred about to non-FCRA registered Bentinck Higher Secondary School, during 2011-14. After the Income-Tax Department initiated a probe against it in 2013, Adhane Management Consultants was allegedly set up in July 2014. The FIR alleged that the CEO of CBV and the company and their directors were the same, and the registered address of the two entities were also the same, in Chennai.

After the company was incorporated, the funds from Compassion International-USA, earlier channelled via CBV, was shifted almost entirely to it, as alleged.

CBV received ₹6.75 crore in 2014-15, as against ₹109.50 crore in 2011-12, ₹130.52 crore in 2012-13 and ₹111.71 crore in 2013-14.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/foreign-contribution-regulation-act-violation-central-bureau-of-investigation-conducts-searches-in-state/article30936626.ece
154,2020/02/28,Minors made to falsify their testimonies by accused: police,"Headmaster, Special Public Prosecutor booked for threatening victims

The Sivaganga district police have booked a headmaster, Murugan, accused in a case of sexual assault of minors, and the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) of Mahila Court, Indira Gandhi, for reportedly threatening the victims to give false evidence in the court, in favour of the accused.

The headmaster was arrested and remanded in judicial custody, following complaints from the girls.

Meanwhile, the district police have sought permission from the Mahila Court for a retrial of the case, as all victims had turned hostile due to “pressure” from the accused. The All-Women Police Station, Sivaganga, on February 8, booked them under two more Sections of the IPC for causing disappearance of evidence and criminal intimidation, and under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

2015 incident

Murugan, who was the headmaster of a panchayat union primary school, had allegedly sexually assaulted six minors on the school premises in 2015.

Since he had threatened them with dire consequences, the children did not report the series of sexual assaults to their parents. When one of the girls complained of pain in her private parts, the grandmother enquired. She then told her the truth. It was after this that a police complaint was lodged.

Murugan was arrested under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

During a routine review of pending cases last year, Superintendent of Police R. Rohit Nathan was told that the case could end up in acquittal of the accused. “When I found that all the children had turned hostile, we probed into it further and were shocked to find that the children had been threatened and coerced into not giving any evidence against the headmaster,” the SP said.

The police found that the SPP had facilitated a meeting between the accused and the children and had also threatened the victims.

“We have registered a case against them for threatening to give false evidence based on a complaint from three of the six victims of sexual abuse,” a police officer said.

In her complaint, one of the girls claimed that she was not aware of the consequences of falsifying in the court and had realised her mistake only after growing up.

All cases in the Mahila Court, relating to Ms. Indira Gandhi, that ended in acquittal, would also be reviewed.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/headmaster-special-public-prosecutor-booked-for-threatening-victims/article30936615.ece

156,2020/02/28,Madras HC devises mechanism to resolve dispute between Vaishnavite sects,"Issues a slew of directions on reciting Prabandham at Kanchi Devarajaswamy temple

Deciding a contempt of court petition filed now for disobedience of a 105-year-old judgment of the Madras High Court passed during the British era in 1915, the court has directed the Executive Trustee of Devarajaswamy Devasthanam in Kancheepuram to lodge a police complaint if a dispute between Vadagalai and Thengalai sects in reciting Prabandham during temple festivals snowballs into a law and order problem.

Justice S.M. Subramaniam ordered that the Executive Trustee should first invite the Thengalai sect during the festivals and on such invitation, they should be permitted to recite first two lines of Srisailesa Dayapathram (initial recital). After they complete, the trustee should permit the Vadagalai sect to commence the first two lines of Ramanuja Dayapathram (initial recital). Thereafter, both of them should recite the Prabandham jointly.

On completion of recital of Prabandham, the Thengalai sect should be permitted to recite the concluding Manavalamamunigal Vaazhithirunamam and thereafter the Vadagalai sect should be allowed to recite Desikan Vazhi Thirunamam.

Accordingly, the process of recitals should be concluded. If any of the two sects was unwilling to recite the Mantrams and Prabandhams, the officer should permit the sect which expresses willingness, the judge ordered.

“The first respondent (trustee) is directed to register a police complaint in the event of any law and order problem or otherwise during performance of the Puja festivals. On such complaint, jurisdictional police shall register a complaint, investigate the same and initiate appropriate actions in accordance with law,” the judge said after ordering that all other religious practices during the festivals should be followed by as schemes approved by the courts in previous years.

“In the event of violation of any of these directions issued in this contempt Petition, it will be treated as contempt of court and the first respondent Executive Trustee/Assistant Commissioner is directed to file an application before this court,” the judge made clear after expressing dismay over the recital of the Prabandham in the temple having been stopped for the last two years due to the unending disputes between people belonging to the two sects.

Earlier judgments

The present contempt petition had been filed alleging that the Executive Trustee was not following the judgment passed by a Division Bench of the High Court comprising Justices Sankaran Nair and Oldfield on January 15, 1915 on an appeal preferred in 1910. The petitioner also said, another judgment of the High Court passed on March 24, 1969 on an appeal preferred in 1963 had been violated and hence the trustee should be punished for contempt of court.

After perusing both the judgments, Justice Subramaniam pointed out that none of the them prevent Vadagalai sect from reciting the Prabandham.

“Thus, the complaint made on behalf of the Thengalai sect that they alone should be permitted to recite Prabandhams can never be permitted. Both the Vadagalai and Thengalai sects should be permitted to recite Prabandhams and there cannot be any other opinion as in the event of permitting a particular sect would result in unconstitutionality,” he said.

Even in the 1969 verdict, the court had said: “Tolerance and mutual respect are the hallmarks of Hinduism and it is a pity that these two sects of Vaishnavites who profess to be the followers of great saints and savants are so intolerant against each other even in respect of small and unimportant rituals and ceremonies. We can only hope that the people belonging to these two sects would realise the futility of this kind of useless and wasteful litigation and stop their acrimonious fight.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/k2ll5p/article30936600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28FEBTH11MADRASHIGHCOURTVG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-devises-mechanism-to-resolve-dispute-between-vaishnavite-sects/article30936601.ece
157,2020/02/28,"Can you hold sittings in State capitals to hear complaints against lawyers, HC asks BCI","Observing that people who lodge complaints against lawyers with the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry (BCTNP) could not be expected to travel all the way to New Delhi when their complaints get transferred to Bar Council of India (BCI), the Madras High Court on Thursday wanted to know if the BCI could conduct sittings in Chennai and other State capitals.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and R. Pongiappan raised the question when a writ petition filed by a complainant to prevent BCTNP from transferring his complaint to the BCI was listed before them for hearing. The judges found that Section 36B of the Advocates Act of 1961 provides for transfer of complaint if the State Bar Council does not dispose it of within a year.

Though the provision had been inserted in the Act through an amendment in 1973 only to ensure that the proceedings on the complaint do not get dragged unnecessarily, “the Bar Councils of the respective States are taking advantage of the said provision and doing injustice to the complainants by transferring their complaints to the file of BCI deliberately.

“Thus, the very purpose of the provision is frustrated. In view of the attitude of the State Bar Councils, Sections 36B of the Advocates Act of 1961 appears to be against the interests of the aggrieved complainants,” the Division Bench said and pointed out the complaint of the present petitioner had been dragged by the BCTNP for nearly three year and not by the complainant.

Finding that such transfer had happened with regard to many other complaints too, the judges restrained BCTNP from transferring any complaint to BCI until the court decides the legal validity of Section 36B of the Act.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/can-you-hold-sittings-in-state-capitals-to-hear-complaints-against-lawyers-hc-asks-bci/article30936594.ece
158,2020/02/28,"We have come together to save India, says Stalin","Pass resolution against CAA, NRC, NPR, says DMK president at ‘Kudiyurimai Paadhukappu Maanadu’

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday refuted the Centre’s accusation that the Opposition parties were wilfully instigating protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR), and urged the Tamil Nadu government to pass a resolution against the three.

Mr. Stalin was speaking at the ‘Kudiyurimai Paadhukappu Maanadu’, organised by the Tamilaga Makkal Otrumai Medai, at YMCA, Royapettah in Chennai.

Stating that the BJP had not fulfilled a number of promises that it made, Mr. Stalin said: “We have not come together to fight the BJP government, but to save India, India’s unity and its people. There are many issues for us to oppose the BJP politically. We don’t need CAA for politics. This is an issue that concerns the people and the country.”

He charged that right wing forces were dividing people on the basis of religion.

“We oppose Hindutva, not the people who believe in Hinduism,” he said.

Mr. Stalin criticised the Central government for allowing the protests to turn violent in New Delhi.

N. Ram, Chairman, THG Publishing Pvt. Ltd., noted that the country had not seen such an “upsurge in several decades” as it had against the CAA, the NPR and the NRC, and said that this was not just a Hindu-Muslim issue but an attack on the Constitution.

‘Violative of Article 14’

“It has gone to the Supreme Court and what I expect from the court is that it will strike down the CAA. It is violative of Article 14 of the Indian Constitution,” Mr. Ram said.

He added: “Even if the Supreme Court fails to strike down the CAA as unconstitutional, we must still oppose it. It goes against the basic structure of the Constitution.”

He said that the Tamil Nadu government must not go ahead with the NPR. He also appealed to actor Rajinikanth to reconsider his support for the CAA, the NPR and the NRC.

Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said: “When I spoke in the Assembly after passing the resolution in the House, I said that India is a democratic country of various cultures. And, we will not allow people to be divided on the basis of religion. If we have to spill blood, we will do it for inter-faith harmony and we don’t care about losing power.”

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan could not make it to the event due to health reasons.

Reading out the message from Mr. Vijayan, K. Balakrishnan, State Secretary, CPI(M), said: “India’s values of secularism and tolerance face a threat today. It is important to safeguard religious tolerance and unity to face these threats.""",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5cp6ng/article30936587.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27THCAAMEETING1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/we-have-come-together-to-save-india-says-stalin/article30936589.ece

This is to be sure on our side that the documents submitted to the DME are genuine,” said an official. Documents of first-year MBBS students have already been scrutinised, following the NEET impersonation scam last year.

He added that verification of documents were completed in a few colleges, while it was under way in a number of institutions.

“However, we have not come across any suspicious documents. Invariably, these are valid certificates. What has happened is impersonation during NEET, and this can be checked only by the Central Board of Secondary Education, that initially conducted the exam, and later, the National Testing Agency,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/8px5h/article30936489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THNEET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dme-directs-medical-colleges-to-verify-students-documents/article30936490.ece
163,2020/02/28,Rising price of coal has negative impact on brick kilns,"Increased production cost, lack of quality are the main issues

Inadequate supply of coal for brick kilns has affected production cost and quality of bricks, according to kiln owners in the district.

The combined Vellore district has over 25,000 brick kilns functioning and many of them are on the verge of closure due to cost escalation of raw materials and labour issues.

A. Purushothaman, of Lalapet, said finding labour for brick kiln has become very difficult as many prefer for lighter jobs and educated youth are not willing to take up this hard job. Adding fuel to the fire, the recent price rise in retail coal in the local market has led to a severe crunch in supply of the fuel. This has affected the manufacture of good quality bricks.

There are over 30 coal dealers in Walajapet, Kaveripakkam and Ocheri who supply coal to brick kilns. These units provide employment to local women. Despite maintaining lower sales margins, they also face problems in the form of variations in demand, said an owner of a coal unit in Walajapet.

A brick kiln owner from Lalapet in Ranipet district said 1 tonne of coal costed around ₹6,700 with additional carriage and labour charges.

“Despite this cost escalation we do it for the sake of our family as we do not have other options. We provide cube bricks at ₹6 per piece and clay rectangular red brick at ₹6.50 per piece,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jn9l9c/article30936452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27FEBTHCOALHIKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rising-price-of-coal-has-negative-impact-on-brick-kilns/article30936453.ece
164,2020/02/28,"In Tamil Nadu, packaged drinking water units launch indefinite strike","Provide NOCs, relax groundwater drawal rules: manufacturers

Packaged drinking water units across the State have launched an indefinite strike from Thursday evening, demanding that the State government provide no-objection certificates to operate and relax norms for groundwater drawal based on the zones.

This follows a directive from the Madras High Court to district collectors to file reports on shutting down of unlicensed packaged drinking water units by March 3.

Members of the Greater Tamil Nadu Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers’ Association said that the 1,612 units across the State were functioning with licences from the Bureau of India Standards and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. However, only about 600 units had been provided with NOC by the Water Resources Department for operation.

The founder of the association, A. Shakespeare, said, “We are prepared to get an NOC from the government. We only draw a minimal quantity of water when compared to the industries. The State government must consider providing NOCs to all existing units and regulate groundwater drawal depending on the critical and overexploited areas. Groundwater drawal can be permitted from a minimum of 30,000 litres a day.”

On average, 25 crore litres of packaged drinking water is sold in the State. Of this, nearly 2.5 crore litres are sold in and around Chennai.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fld7ll/article30936431.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THPACKAGED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/packaged-drinking-water-units-launch-indefinite-strike/article30936432.ece

166,2020/02/28,Farmers air grievances at Vellore Collectorate meeting,"Complaints raised about negligence of officials, crop damage caused by elephants

Farmers’ association members aired their grievances at a meeting organised at the Vellore Collectorate on Thursday.

Several participants pointed out the negligence officials display while handling farmers who approach them with their troubles. A humane approach was the need of the hour, they pointed out.

Vellore Collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram, who presided over the meeting, urged officials to maintain cordiality with farmers and extend their assistance.

Farmers brought up issues on crop damage caused by animals, specifically elephants, in Pernambut, Gudiyatham, Ambur and Katpadi regions, for which they sought a permanent solution like solar fencing and trenches. With the mango season about to start, elephants may cause extensive damage to the crops if left unchecked, a farmer from Gudiyatham said.

Another farmer raised the issue of land records classification which had gone unaddressed by officials for months. He regretted that despite them having all the required documents, they were made to run from pillar to post to get a land classification certificate. In turn, it affected their bank loan process, he said.

On the farmers’ demand for cold storage facilities at taluk levels, the Collector said there were four cold storage facilities in the combined Vellore district.

These were of the on-wheels category which could be hired by a group of farmers when needed, he assured.

A farmer from the Katpadi region said construction of a check dam in Ilayanallur was a pending demand and should be expedited. He said it existed three decades ago and if revived, would help farmers get water for irrigation. It may ensure groundwater recharge as well, he said.

Joint Director (Agriculture) A.

168,2020/02/28,HC to examine legality of taking back land allotted to industries,"AG’s help sought in deciding appeals related to retrieval of lands once considered ponds

The Madras High Court on Thursday decided to undertake a deeper examination of legal as well as environmental aspects related to the State government and its entities having sold lands, classified as waterbodies in the revenue records, for industrial purposes, a few decades ago, but now attempting to retrieve the properties for re-creating the water sources.

First Division Bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad has requested Advocate General Vijay Narayan to assist the court in deciding the significant issue that arose during the hearing of a writ appeal preferred by a small-scale industrial unit, operating from a government industrial estate in Ambattur.

The appeal was preferred against a judgment passed by Justice M. Dhandapani on August 30, permitting Tamil Nadu Small Industries Development Corporation (SIDCO) to retrieve two plots at the industrial estate after returning the sale consideration, along with interest at the rate of 18% per annum, since 1993, and restore them into waterbodies.

A private firm named Tamil Nadu Electricals had preferred the appeal stating that it was allotted 17,504 sq ft of land at the industrial estate in 1993, on payment of ₹4.82 lakh, for establishing its unit that manufactures power and distribution transformers. The company used the land as a yard to store empty transformer tanks and other industrial materials.

Allotment cancelled

Suddenly, in 2008, SIDCO cancelled the allotment of the plot on the ground that it was actually a pond. A similar cancellation order was passed with respect to another industrial unit and hence they filed two individual writ petitions in the High Court, challenging the cancellation orders passed after 15 years of allotment.

Dismissing the writ petitions, pending since 2008, by way of a common order on August 30 last year, the single judge ordered return of the sale consideration, along with interest.

Assailing the order, the appellant’s counsel argued that the lands were allotted for industrial purposes, only because they had lost their original character of being waterbodies.

The counsel contended that it was impermissible under law to retrieve lands that had been sold 15 years ago, just because they were vacant. He said that SIDCO had cancelled the allotment when the appellant had obtained plan approval.

Senior standing counsel for SIDCO M.J. Jaseem Mohamed argued that lands classified as ‘Kulam poromboke’ in the revenue records were inadvertently reclassified as industrial plots and allotted to private units in 1993. He said that such a mistake had to be rectified in the wake of the Tamil Nadu Protection of Tanks and Eviction of Encroachment Act, 2007.

The Bench directed the Industries Secretary and SIDCO to file their counter affidavits and urged the Advocate General to conduct the case for the State.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/3pus5l/article30907773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25MADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-to-examine-legality-of-taking-back-land-allotted-to-industries/article30936382.ece
169,2020/02/28,‘Sloganeering ought not to attract criminal prosecution’,"High Court grants bail to two women Maoists

Holding that slogan shouting by itself, in the absence of any other adverse consequence, ought not to attract criminal prosecution, Justice G.R. Swaminathan of the Madras High Court on Thursday granted bail to two women Maoists, both aged above 50, who have been in prison for over three years.

Taking note of the State’s submission on their sloganeering, the judge observed: “We are a functioning democracy. Free speech is a cherished fundamental right....Therefore on occasions of arrest or remand, they are bound to raise slogans.”

It is not the case of the prosecution that something untoward happened as a result. The women’s right to speedy trial was infringed on account of their prolonged imprisonment, he said.

The judge granted bail to Kala, 59, and Chandra, 52, in one of the four cases pending against them. He added that they had not committed any act of violence and the court cannot lose sight of the fact that they are women.

The court was informed that the women had indulged in provocative sloganeering after attending the funeral of Manivasagam, Kala’s husband and Chandra’s brother, who was shot dead in an encounter in Kerala, last year. The court had granted the women leave to attend the funeral.

The Q Branch, which arrested the women, had said that when their home in Karur was searched, mobile phones, SIM cards and literature of a banned organisation was found.

171,2020/02/28,HC to hear today DMK’s plea for CBI probe into Group I TNPSC exam scam,"The Madras High Court is slated to take up for admission on Friday a public interest litigation petition filed by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) organising secretary R.S.

In an affidavit filed through Senior Counsel P. Wilson, the PIL petitioner insisted that the investigation regarding the Group I examinations must be necessarily transferred from the Central Crime Branch police to the CBI since the local police had let off all top level officials of the TNPSC and had investigated only regarding the involvement of lower rung officials.

The senior counsel contended that it was highly impossible for such a big scam involving theft of unused answer scripts to have happened without the active involvement of the then chairman, secretary as well as other top officials of TNPSC. He pointed out that the CCB itself had conceded that a scam did happen and that TNPSC employees were involved in it.

172,2020/02/28,Tribute | ‘There were so many animation films Arnab Chaudhuri had in his head’,"Filmmaker Gitanjali Rao pays tribute to a pioneering peer who worked and died before his time

The year 2013 was a significant one for India at the Oscars with Arnab Chaudhuri’s Arjun, The Warrior Prince among the five films in The Walt Disney Company’s list of submissions. It was entered in the animation feature category, a rare film to find Disney’s backing considering it was not created but acquired by the studio on its acquisition of UTV, the original producers. While India’s official entry, Barfi!, was mired in controversies, Arjun made it quietly to the long list but unfortunately couldn’t progress further on technical grounds. It had been released on video on demand (VOD) before the theatrical screening in Los Angeles, a rule overlooked by the producers.

The Oscar challenge apart, the film featured in the official selection of almost all the major animation festivals in 2012-2013 be it Annecy International Animation Film Festival, Holland Animation Film Festival or Ottawa International Animation Festival. The director of this path-breaking animation feature film and one of the biggest champions of the Indian animation industry, Chaudhuri passed away on December 25, 2019 in Kolkata. He was admired as much for his work as a television professional, and for his stint at Channel V and Turner.

Members of the Animation Guild, a representative body of animation artistes, writers and technicians, plan to get together on February 29 for the annual Afternoon of Remembrance in which they will honour those from the animation community who passed away in 2019. Chaudhuri will be one of them. Filmmaker Gitanjali Rao writes a tribute to a fellow animation artiste and friend for The Hindu.

A visionary

I got to know Arnab through my animation friends from National Institute of Design (NID) back in the mid 90s. The suave, gentle, talented, confident and terribly attractive young artist who was creating waves in Channel V with his superb work. Arnab was ahead of his times. Not only was his work original and imaginative, but the people who worked with him loved and admired him. And that was rare.

I never got a chance to work with him although I tried, years later, and so did he, but the projects never came through. We were a bunch of animators trying for many years to make a good Indian animation feature film back in the early 2000s when suddenly, India had become a hub of cheap though good backend work. We were a frustrated lot given the lack of funds for animation films in India. But Arnab was the first one to land with a totally Indian film to be created in India, an original India story, Arjun, The Warrior Prince with UTV. It was phenomenal!

Collaborative process

My association with Arnab grew when my partner KK Muralidharan worked with Arnab as production designer on Arjun, The Warrior Prince with his work partner Rachna Rastogi. The film took many long years to evolve and complete. Three or more, I have lost count. From idea to completion. But for me just the fact that I could watch this film happening was a huge learning experience. I would hop on to my partner’s side for many a work-in-progress viewings. This was very important for me as I learned so much about the task of dealing with so many artists to make the film.

No one but animators know the immense amount of work that goes into creating a film like Arjun, The Warrior Prince. Right from the script sessions with writer Rajesh Devraj, which were followed by long discussions, what I noticed and still absolutely admire about Arnab was his ability to listen to others. Always with patience and generosity. He always ended up doing what he felt worked best for the film but he listened and absorbed and worked around everyone else’s opinion.

It might look and sound easy but with animation it’s a very difficult way to work compared to live action. An animation film gives you no liberty with extra takes at the time of editing the film. What you plan to animate is what you have in the end. Nothing more, nothing less. So the planning of the film has to be impeccable before you start animating the film.

Arnab would involve all the creative HODs in the creative process and give each and every one a patient ear. And that I think is the key reason why people who worked with him loved him so much. ‘Fearless yet never aggressive’ as KK Muralidharan puts it.

I clearly remember the time when his animation director, Pavan Buragohain was designing characters. In the first draft, all the characters looked absolutely Indian. They were exquisitely crafted out from inspiration from Indian actors in films pan Indian. I remember the design of Draupadi was based on Malayalam actor and danseuse Shobhana. And my, was she amazing!

Challenges of an animator

After having made my own feature film, I know how difficult and painful that decision must have been for him but he took the right decision given the constraints. This, I feel is the predicament of pioneers. Arnab is the pioneer of Indian animation made to international quality but it all came with a heavy price to pay.

And the price was not just at a creative level. Animation is such a labour-intensive work, that to make a film over three years entails that you have no time to live a life. You have to breathe the project day and night, including weekends to just get a few good seconds done.

In the years following the release of Arjun, we often met and discussed the difficulties of finding finance for our own films. He was pursuing the second part of the Arjun trilogy as planned by him and Devraj. He had managed to make a trailer pitch, which looked outstanding. The last time I met him, a little over a month before his stroke, all he said when he hugged me was “You did it! You actually made your film!”

We are almost the same age, having managed to make our first film makes nothing easier I guess. There were so many animation films Arnab Chaudhuri had in his head, yet to be made. Saying this is a great loss to Indian animation industry would be to do a disservice to him. I’d rather say (and I know he would approve) this is no country for animators.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9ol9ao/article30944619.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG8927,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tribute-there-were-so-many-animation-films-arnab-chaudhuri-had-in-his-head/article30944620.ece
173,2020/02/28,‘Draupathi’ movie review: A bland outing that has very few cherishable moments,"The film is making a lot of noise on social media because of its caste-based connotation, but in essence, is an average revenge tale

Watching Draupathi, I was reminded a bit of Bharath and Sandhya from Kadhal, a couple from a town trying to eke out a living in the big, bad city that’s full of crime and mischief mongers. Now, imagine if Bharath and Sandhya were a ‘fake couple’? Heck, what if Sandhya did not exist at all?

Sounds confusing? Draupathi is making a lot of noise on social media because of its caste-based connotation – and you’d be tempted to think so, going by the fiery dialogues in the trailer – but in essence, it is an average revenge tale that is built around a scam that not many people are aware of.

Director Mohan does a Murugadoss-style plot when he gets Prabhakaran, acting as a tea-seller in the premises of a registrar office, to approach the powers-that-be for a marriage certificate. On surface, it’s a simple scene, but a vital commentary on how things function in a registrar office.

Draupathi Cast: Richard Rishi, Sheela, Karunas

Director: Mohan G

Storyline: A person accused of murdering his loved ones wants to take revenge

In another film, this would have served as the core plot to move things forward. But Draupathi seems to be least worried about the storyline, and rather wants to be a cheerleader for a certain community and pitting them against another.

While the first half primarily revolves around Prabhakaran (Rishi Richard, who looks so different from his Kadhal Virus days) and why he’s in the city doing what he is, we get a sneak peek into the ‘real hero’ Draupathi, after whom the film is named, only in the second. The performance is ordinary (Sheela plays Draupathi) but there’s still some satisfaction of seeing the lead woman get so much footage and relevance in a predominantly tepid revenge tale. She goes about life with courage and she shoots videos of injustice that she witnesses. It might come across as a case of Facebook-activism, but just to see someone in the rural hinterland shooting videos exposing inadequacies that she hopes would be seen far and wide, was heartening.

But then comes the director’s decision to prolong the flashback, which bogs down the film that has a tedious running time. The silambam sequences look out of place and the mandatory ‘farmers vs corporate’ issue that Kollywood has dealt with in 1618 films raises its ugly head yet again.

The climax court sequence, which seems to last an eternity, doesn’t help things either. And the end demand that is met by the court — something that everyone in the theatre cheered for — is something that ought to be the natural result of today’s times. That Draupathi chose to invest two and a half hours to make us see that change is quite farcical.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/yw03ur/article30943617.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/draupathi1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/draupathi-movie-review-a-bland-outing-that-has-very-few-cherishable-moments/article30943618.ece
174,2020/02/28,"Superhero, dad, activist: Chris Hemsworth on his new Netflix flick ‘Extraction’","The Australian superstar is much more than his 'Thor' persona. On the sets of his latest film, he talks stunts, friends and climate change

Chris Hemsworth is deep in discussion with first-time director Sam Hargrave, standing amid piles of fresh tropical produce and baskets of bright chrysanthemums. I’m in Bangkok, on the set of his upcoming Netflix movie, Extraction. A make-up artiste adds some dirt and fake blood to his already grimy forehead before the shot commences. As mercenary Tyler Rake, he shoots at the bad guys and reloads his weapon.

It is the kind of scene that I’d normally document in real time on Instagram Stories or add to my timeline for posterity. But I’ve waited over a year to write this story thanks to an embargo, part of Netflix’s rather secretive protocol. Since January 2019, I’ve stalked everyone associated with the film; there were glimpses of the dubbing, additional photography and, finally, an announcement last week that the movie is out on April 24.

In that time, both Netflix and Hemsworth have been busy. The streaming platform came out with several big-budget blockbusters, including Martin Scorcese’s The Irishman (with a production cost of $200 million) and the Ryan Reynolds-starrer, 6 Underground ($150 million). The latter, with a 45% Rotten Tomatoes rating, was the eighth most popular title in India last year.

Tessa Thompson and Chris Hemsworth in Men in Black: International

Meanwhile, the 36-year-old actor was in Avengers: Endgame, a Men in Black reboot, got a star on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame and announced a fourth instalment for Thor. In the last few months, his Instagram has been a picture of familial bliss, as he has taken some well-deserved down-time in Australia. It has also brought into focus his activism — he donated $1 million to the wildfires that raged across his home country, and has been vocal about the climate change crisis.

Bend it like Hemsworth

With an action-heavy filmography featuring the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it is easy to put Hemsworth in a box. Perhaps it started when he played hunky high-school dropout Kim Hyde in the Australian soap opera, Home and Away. But through his career, there have been some breakaway roles and genre experiments, too. In 2012, it was a horror comedy (The Cabin in the Woods) and fantasy (The Huntsman: Winter’s War). 2013’s sports drama Rush was followed by the adventure, In the Heart of the Sea, a couple of years later.

The most recent — and one that had everyone talking about his acting range over his workout plan — was as psychotic cult leader Billy Lee in the 2018 neo-noir thriller, Bad Times at the El Royale. What drives him to experiment? “Boredom, or the fear of it,” he laughs, adding, “I’d like to do a full-fledged comedy. I had so much fun on Bad Times... because there was an insanity to that character and a darkness, peppered with a sense of humour. It keeps me sharp, and helps me approach drama or action in a different way. Even the new version of Thor [in Endgame, where he went against type, sporting a pot belly] was a big experiment for me.”

The oner Hargrave was keen on attempting a ‘long take’ — an uninterrupted shot that lasts longer than a typical take.

This involved a good three weeks of rehearsal as he ambitiously aimed for 12 minutes.

The shot features car chases, running, a gun fight and hand-to-hand combat, and is one of the highlights of the film.

Breaking free of restrictions

Extraction marks his entry into the world of streaming services, joining stars such as Ben Affleck (Triple Frontier), Renée Zellweger (What/If) and Sandra Bullock (Bird Box), who’ve found success there, while simultaneously pursuing big-screen projects. In the film, his character, Rake — a man who lost his son — is hired to rescue Ovi Mahajan (played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the kidnapped son of an international crime lord, from Dhaka. What follows is an exploration of his dark past and the pursuit of redemption. “I got to invent a new character that isn’t held to any restrictions from something done before or a comic book or a real-life figure,” he tells me. The cast includes Randeep Hooda, Priyanshu Painyuli and Pankaj Tripathi in key roles, as well as David Harbour and Golshifteh Farahani.

Hemsworth is also credited as producer, which gave him more creative input. While scriptwriter Joe Russo had envisioned the lead as an American, he says, “I told Joe that we don’t see too many characters, especially action heroes, outside the country [Australia], unless it is a quintessential Aussie bloke.” So Rake became Australian, and Hemsworth got to keep his accent.

For an action film, the cast found it more emotionally challenging than expected. A couple of moments were quite “raw and painful”, he says. “Sam came in guns blazing, wanting to attempt things on the action front, which I was excited about. But what I didn’t expect was his intuitiveness on where the drama of a scene should take us. You can shoot stuff and make it look impressive, but if you’re not telling a story within that piece of action, it is not nearly as memorable as it can be.”

Over the years, he has altered his approach to such dramatic scenes. Prepping for every line meant he was not really reacting to what was happening around him. “Sometimes, the script speaks to you in a way that affects you directly. When I read my lines and get choked up at certain points, I try and save that for the camera,” he says.

On the sets An hour’s drive to the sleepy district of Nakhon Pathom, I am transported from Bangkok to Dhaka in the blink of an eye — the largely commercial area transformed into a ghetto-like neighbourhood. Art director Harrison Yurkiw tells us that only establishing shots were filmed in Bangladesh; security concerns meant they had to find a suitable location elsewhere. Thailand’s authorities were welcoming, even giving them permission to shut down a bridge, where some pivotal scenes were to be shot.

An immense amount of detail has gone into the sets. Posters on the wall are in Bangla, while auto rickshaws have been flown in from India. The dilapidated cars lining the street match the make and models available in Bangladesh. Yurkiw adds, “The trash strewn all around was carted here from Kolkata. The clothes hanging on the lines and the packaged snacks on the vendors’ carts are from Bangladesh.”

Keeping it real time

When it comes to physical training, the shredded actor goes all out for every role. Hargrave told him he had to be fitter than ever for this film. “It was all about functionality: my training off-screen needed to mimic what I’d be required to do on set. It was the most complex, real-life action we’ve done, no wire gags or special effects,” he says.

For Extraction, staying in the same hotel as the cast and crew — both while filming in India in late 2018 and in Bangkok — gave him the opportunity to train with the stuntmen, fostering a communal spirit that “felt like one big bootcamp”. With recent films like Once Upon A Time… in Hollywood putting the spotlight on stuntmen, it touches upon a topic that the actor feels very strongly about. “They say Sam [a stuntman-turned-filmmaker] is a first-time director, but I don’t think it really applies to him. Guys like David Leitch (John Wick) are making these massive blockbusters. There is this wealth of knowledge and experience that has been unacknowledged. It is not just about the danger; there is artistry involved.” His stunt double, Bobby Holland Hanton, recently shared the Screen Actors Guild recognition for outstanding performance by a stunt ensemble for Avengers: Endgame. This is the kind of acknowledgement Hemsworth is calling for from the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards as well.

After years of working in front of a green screen and in sound stages, filming on location was a refreshing change. “There is a sense of realism that is pulled from you when there is a real environment to interact with,” he says. Just then, a crew member tells us to put our earplugs in — they are testing out an explosive within the market walls. Someone suggests Hemsworth should wear some, too, and he says, “A military guy once told me that in real life, there is no time for that. When the adrenaline kicks in, the body takes care of itself.” He continues, barely containing his laughter, “So I asked another man from the military, and he goes, ‘What’d you say?’” As the father of three children, I suppose the dad jokes should be expected, even if he is one of Hollywood’s biggest stars.

Speaking of family, he gets pensive, saying, “My daughter is seven now and my boys are five... How quickly it all goes.” It is one of the reasons he chose to base his life outside the bubble that is Hollywood. “You’re sort of suffocated and lose perspective. In Australia, there is not a close friend of mine who is really in the industry, so it is hugely refreshing,” he says. Coming to the end of what he calls “the busiest part of my life”, with back-to-back films over the last 12 months, he sounds mildly startled when we point out that he started as Thor 10 years back. “I’ve lost my sense of time, in a way. It has been fantastic to be that busy, and the fortune and fame that comes with it. But it also scares the hell out of me. I am thankful for the opportunity to do what I love, but want to stop looking too far ahead and just enjoy this moment.”

Rudhraksh Jaiswal: “Working with a big star like Chris, and being the youngest cast member, I initially felt a lot of pressure. But he was very kind, giving me advice on how to relate the dialogues to my character. Once, in the middle of a fight sequence, I got a scratch — he was so apologetic, calling the medics and assuring my mother it wouldn’t happen again... That’s the sort of caring person he is.”

175,2020/02/28,"Why the city of dreams is a landscape, character, emotion and more in Sooni Taraporevala’s films","The filmmaker's new film, ‘Yeh Ballet’, released on Netflix last week

The Bandra-Worli Sea Link spreads majestically across the windows of the Taj Lands End hotel in suburban Mumbai. “This is actually one of our locations,” says screenwriter-filmmaker-photographer Sooni Taraporevala of the landmark bridge and the area around it that figures prominently in her new film, Yeh Ballet. “We can actually see Nishu’s (Manish Chauhan, who plays himself in the film) real house from here, left of the Sea Link, on the hill. On the right is the Worli Koliwada,” she says, the familiarity with the city echoing in her voice.

One big takeaway from both of Taraporevala’s feature films — her debut, Little Zizou (2008) and now, Yeh Ballet — has been the city of Mumbai, ubiquitous as a landscape, setting, character, spirit, emotion, thought, ambition and more. Little Zizou took us closer to Mumbai’s Parsi enclaves and the dwindling community through the story of a 11-year-old soccer-crazy boy and his fervent desire to have French football star Zinedine Zidane come to Mumbai. It was all about “her own backyard”, as she once said; a world she knew well, about which she had even compiled a coffee-table book, Parsis: The Zoroastrians of India.

True story

With Yeh Ballet, Taraporevala travels to Mumbai’s slums. The film is based on the true story of two underprivileged boys — Chauhan and Amiruddin Shah (called Asif in the film) — who face several hardships while training in ballet and go on to win international acclaim.

When I ask if Bombay is her muse, Taraporevala shoots back — “Bombay or Mumbai?” — before laughing and telling me about how it all began with Mira Nair’s Salaam Bombay (1988), which she co-wrote.

“[Be it] through photography or film, whenever it’s a story about the city, for me, at least, it (Bombay) is as much a character,” she says. A character she knows intimately, and on whom she casts an affectionate insider’s gaze. “It’s a very exciting and unique city and I can explore it infinitely. It’s endlessly fascinating. There are so many layers to it, and so much history. It’s endless.”

Directing came to Taraporevala long after screenwriting. She worked in Los Angeles as a screenwriter, doing commissioned screenplays for a variety of studios, including Universal, HBO and Disney, and has been collaborating with Nair since 1988.

Her other writing credits include the Indo-Canadian production Such a Long Journey (1998), based on Rohinton Mistry’s novel, and the 2000 Indian-English feature Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, directed by Jabbar Patel.

She started toying with the idea of directing on the sets of Nair’s The Namesake (2006), using the ace filmmaker as a sounding board, confidante and mentor. And thus was born Little Zizou.

Between her two Mumbai features, however, there has been a gap of more than a decade and a lot has changed, naturally. The kids have grown up, for one. Her son, Jahan Bativala, who plays the protagonist, Xerxes, in Little Zizou, is the on-set editor for Yeh Ballet; daughter Iyanah, who plays Liana in the first, steps in as director of second unit photography.

Drawn to it

Taraporevala herself, in the interim, wrote a big, ambitious, futuristic sci-fi to direct herself and had a few other scripts for hire, none of which got made. “It’s not like I was retired and looking at the sunset. It’s just that nothing came out on screen,” she says. In 2016, she directed a 14-minute VR film, Yeh Ballet, for Anand Gandhi’s Memesys Lab, which led to the current feature.

Having learnt ballet as a child, she was naturally drawn to the subject. “It was elitist and exclusive back then. There were no boys in sight doing ballet,” she recalls. Taraporevala was fascinated when she saw Chauhan and Shah dancing, especially because they came into it late, belonged to the margins, and with no background in classical music or dance. “They have imbibed it so deeply and soulfully. It’s not a superficial mimicking of movements... That amazement at their achievement never left me,” she says.

This underdog trope is quintessential Mumbai. We come back to the city. “It’s full of them, each one trying to make it. Some will give up, those who don’t, I hope, will make it. It is about not giving up, about pure will and determination,” says Taraporevala.

So, what’s to come next, I ask. She has given up on the sci-fi film for now, and has begun work on a smaller production which will again be centred on Mumbai. “My Bombay trilogy,” she laughs.

176,2020/02/28,"I am a believer, but I am against corporatisation of spirituality, says Vincent Vadakkan, scenarist of ‘Trance’","The débutante says that the film is as much about people who corrupt religion as it is about familial bonds

“The struggle to get here was real. I felt overwhelmed when it finally happened.” That’s how Vincent Vadakkan looks at his foray into cinema as a scenarist with Anwar Rasheed’s Trance, leaving behind his career in the advertisement industry. “There was a dream team on board my debut project — Anwar sir, Fahadh Faasil, Nazriya Nazim, Amal Neerad, Resul Pookkutty, Gautham Menon.... The canvas turned out to be much bigger than I had imagined,” says Vincent.

Trance is a bold take on merchants of faith who build empires using religion as a foundation; it is about ‘faith healers’ and miracle workers. Vincent says he is a believer but he is against corporatisation of spirituality.

He also views that there is more to the film than just talking about people being exploited in the name of their faith. “It is also about family and relationships. The protagonist, although a motivational speaker, goes into depression because of the turmoils in his personal life and it’s in that situation that he takes up the offer to become a ‘god man’,” says Vincent.

Ad background

So what gave him the confidence to switch over to cinema? “I could tell a story in 30 seconds for a commercial and that made me think about the big picture. I believe in persistence. Even if you are talented, if you are not persistent, you can never get what you want,” observes Vincent, currently based in Bengaluru.

The Kochi-native says he has been a film buff from childhood. He did theatre as well until he got busy with his corporate job. “I have associated with playwright and theatre director Abhishek Majumdar and I had shared with him my desire to write. He told me, ‘You write’. So my first synopsis ran into four pages,” he says.

It was cinematographer Littil Swayamp who introduced him to Anwar. “I was meant to work with Anwar sir in the 5 Sundarikal anthology. But that portion had to be dropped because we didn’t get the perfect cast,” says Vincent.

Calling himself “a self-taught scriptwriter”, Vincent points out that he learnt about screenplays and the format from YouTube videos. “One work that fascinated me was Fargo,” he adds.

The thread of Trance was with him for many years and the narrative underwent some changes later on. The inspiration came from several quarters. “I have had some personal experiences. Some family members and friends also shared instances with me. In order to understand the psyche of these pastors, I watched a lot of videos as well. The investigative documentary, A Question of Miracles, which deals with televangelism and faith healing, was another reference point,” he says.

Fahadh was the only actor he had in mind for the role of Viju Prasad, who turns into Pastor Joshua Carlton. “It is not based on any real-life character,” says Vincent, adding that they had pastors on location to guide the team in various scenes. “We were careful because it is a sensitive subject and we were expecting backlash. One of the pastors helped Fahadh to understand the body language and voice modulation when he makes his first speech as a pastor,” Vincent says.

The writer avers that not all pastors are fake. “I know many who consider it a service to help people. They pray, don’t claim to do miracles and never stop people from consulting a doctor,” he explains.

With bouquets and brickbats coming in for the film, Vincent has taken everything in his stride. “Some said that it was brave of us to have taken the theme whereas others are unhappy about how the story progressed towards the climax. There are even theories doing the rounds that Esther (Nazriya’s character) was just a hallucination. Everyone is entitled to their opinion,” says Vincent.

A huge fan of the works of scenarist Aaron Sorkin, Vincent, a graduate in applied art from Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath in Bengaluru, is now writing dialogues for a bilingual thriller.

177,2020/02/28,‘Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal’ movie review: Dulquer Salmaan’s latest is a pleasant and engaging tale of con artists in love,"Director Desingh Periyasamy does a commendable job of putting together a film that lets the script be hero, and keeps you guessing and entertained

A crucial factor determining a film’s box office performance, as it pertains to Tamil cinema, is how fresh or engaging a script has the director chosen to build a movie around. When financial constraints peg a movie back for years, the script also turns into a film’s single biggest threat; a story line that feels dated hampers a film’s success percentage right off the mark.

Such movies — like Kee in 2019; most recent example: Paramapatham Vilaiyattu, which failed to release yet again — are dime a dozen in Tamil cinema. However, Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal is an exception.

What director Desingh Periyasamy gives you is an engaging film but Kannum Kannum... gets off to an odd start. Little do we realise at the beginning that Periyasamy is conning us into thinking that a stereotypical story lies in store. To be surprised by a filmmaker bold enough to take chances with the script and its characters felt like a breath of fresh air.

Kannum Kannum... follows the story of Siddharth (Dulquer), Kaleesuwara Moorthy aka Kallis (Rakshan), Meera aka Madhumitha (Ritu Varma) and Shreya aka Varsha aka Thenmozhi (Niranjani Ahathian). From the many aliases, it should be evident that what we have is a story of and about con artists.

At the start of the film, we are led to believe that Siddharth and Kallis are two happy-go-lucky youngsters, who divide their time between pool parties, clubbing, video gaming and drinking at home. The intro song starts with the hero taking a somersault dive into a pool not long after he tears across the city in a sporty car.

Siddharth, we are told, is an app developer while his friend Kallis is an animator. Meera, who Siddharth is smitten by, is introduced as a beautician who is stingy with her money (she rides a Sunny; who rides a Sunny these days!). She takes him to an orphanage, discusses growing up an orphan, lectures a shopkeeper about the importance of “tendering exact change” to a customer and not chocolates. So, naturally, Siddharth has to fall for Meera, as is customary with the many uninspiring and “ippadiyum kaadhal varalaam-type” of romantic backstories that Tamil cinema has given us.

He professes his love, which she accepts. She introduces her best friend Shreya, a tomboy, to the duo and Kallis falls for her immediately. We are treated to corny dialogues; at some point Siddharth asserts: ‘It is all a little filmy, right?’ and we think: “Duh, if you say so...” Honestly, I would expect nothing less from any one else other than be taken aback by the ‘oldness’ of these stereotypical circumstances of when a boy-meets-a-girl in Tamil cinema, and think, “Why Desingh, why?”

Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal Director: Desingh Periyasamy

Cast: Dulquer Salmaan, Ritu Varma, Rakshan, Niranjana Ahathian, Gautham Menon

Storyline: Two con men fall in a seductive trap laid out for them by two con women, but the quartet reconcile. However, things take a turn for the worse when a cop gets involved, which leads to a pursuit. Will the fraudsters evade arrest?

As we wonder if it is time to dive into a pool ourselves to save us the embarrassment of having to sit through more corny stuff, in walks Prathap Chakravarthy (Gautham Menon), the obligatory cop in any film featuring con artists. He is presented as suave, cold, calculative, smart, and other similarly complimentary adjectives, which all really mean that he is a cool cucumber of a police man, and that more cops in Tamil cinema should be like him (or was Gautham Menon playing one of the cops from his films?).

Prathap, we are led to believe, is chasing after Siddharth and Kallis, as he stumbles upon an elaborate scam involving electronic goods sold via e-commerce platforms. At the interval mark, in what we have come to understand as the “plot la twist-u“, we discover that Prathap was in fact chasing after a different duo. The plot from this point till the end, except in few places, seldom drops intensity in terms of the audience engagement factor.

Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal is an interesting con story. It is two types of frauds rolled into one: technology and the good old con of seductive damsels. Dulquer Salmaan, the self-confessed automobile and gadget freak that he is in real life, is a perfect fit for the character. As the wide-eyed girl with a charming face, Ritu Varma breezes through her portions along with Niranjani Ahathian (who is also the film’s costume designer). It is also refreshing to see a commercial film factoring in decent screen time for not one, but two lead female characters; however, the fact remains that the female actors’ characters are not fleshed out nearly as enough as the male leads.

More impressive is Rakshan as Kallis, the VJ who seems to have made the transition rather seamlessly to the big screen. His one-liners, screen presence and even his choice of costume brings a smile to your face. It is something that Tamil cinema reviewers have, of late, suspected to have gone extinct from films: comedy.

Rakshan is genuinely funny, and seems to be a find of the decade — provided he chooses films wisely. What also works in his favour is that Dulquer Salmaan does not mind stepping aside for the man who very clearly possesses better flair in comedy to take the centrestage.

More than the visual elegance of its storytelling, there are other factors that seem to have combined well for Kannum Kannum... such as the costumes, for one, is a big reason. The lead quartet all wear appropriate outfits that gel well with the mood of the film at that particular point of time. The background score is another plus.

Desingh Periysamy, who also worked on the film’s script and screenplay, seems to have researched his cons well. The con jobs are not outlandish; they are believable and presented in the simplest possible manner that anyone with a fair exposure to technology and tech fraud can relate to what is unfolding, which, for all the plaudits it earned, was not the case with Irumbu Thirai.

It also makes sense for the “visiting artiste” in Dulquer to do more films in Tamil cinema; this industry needs more performers of his calibre — who are secure in their craft and standing as actors — and who understand the importance of stepping aside, and let the script be the hero.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sog7h2/article30943292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KKK2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kannum-kannum-kollaiyadithaal-movie-review-dulquer-salmaans-latest-is-a-pleasant-and-engaging-tale-of-con-artists-in-love/article30943293.ece

The first look(s) of Vikram’s next project Cobra, has been revealed.

The poster shows as many as seven characters, all played by the same actor, in different looks, ranging from a professor and politician to what seems to be a scientific mastermind connecting all the different people together in some way.

Playing different characters in the same film is not new for the actor, with his popular examples being Anniyan and Iru Mugan. However, Cobra takes the challenge to a new level, akin to Kamal Haasan in Dasavathaaram.

Besides Vikram, the film’s cast includes director KS Ravikumar, Srinidhi Shetty, Sarjano Khalid and former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan. Anticipation over director Ajay Gnanamuthu’s next film has been high since it was announced that the Imaikka Nodigal filmmaker was joining hands with Vikram.

179,2020/02/28,Nazriya Nazim on playing Esther in 'Trance': 'She's a smoker and an alcoholic; these were concerns as I didn't want to look like a novice',"The actor, who appears on-screen with husband Fahadh Faasil in the movie, says she has become a little lazy with her choice of films

Her ombre-dyed hair in a sleek bob, Nazriya Nazim looks different. Gone is Kerala’s sweetheart: Ohm Shanti Oshana’s Pooja Mathew, Bangalore Days’ Divya and Koode’s Jenny. Enter the hard-drinking, chain-smoking Esther Lopez of Trance, her latest movie. “Let me tell you, that me is still here,” she says. And as she laughs, we catch a glimpse of Nazriya, as well as Pooja, Divya and Jenny.

She talks to MetroPlus about becoming Esther Lopez, and more.

Was this film a conscious choice: an attempt do something different from what audiences have come to expect?

(Pauses before answering) I don’t think too much about choosing a film or the character in it. Frankly speaking, it was not at all a conscious decision. There are, definitely, a lot of things the character does that I didn’t know how to — Esther is a smoker and an alcoholic. These were concerns, it shouldn’t look stupid like it is being done by an actor who doesn’t know how. I didn’t have reservations about doing this character. I was excited about doing this role. And I was curious about people (the audience), since they haven’t seen me in a role like this, how they would react. That they would wonder ‘what happened to this girl?’ (laughs). I wanted them to say that ‘she is different’ (in the film) That excited me about this role.

You did Anjali Menon’s Koode (2018), and now Trance. Are you spacing your films?

(Laughs) No, it is just that I have become a little lazy. That is all. There is nothing like I will do one film and then wait four years for the next. Nor did I decide that I’ll take a two-year break after Koode. If a project excites me, fits with my time and makes me think ‘let’s go and do this’... Koode and Trance were two such films. In fact, both films happened to me at the same time. Trance took some time. When I listen to a script I don’t think too deeply, my thought is ‘will it excite me to do this?’ I don’t overthink.

How did you prepare to become Esther, given that she is very different from your other roles?

Like I said, she is a smoker and I was [Nazriya fakes gagging], like Divya in Bangalore Days when she takes her first puff. Everybody on the sets was like ‘Moley, you need to learn how to do this.’ Obviously I also did not want to look like a novice... so there was that, learning to smoke and stuff. My father was like “will you have smoke coming out of ears as well?” (laughs) That was the preparation part of it. The character is not someone I know, for that I spoke to Anbukka (Anwar Rasheed) about the character – her maturity, what has shaped her.... That was it.

This is the first time you are acting with Fahadh, after marriage; after Bangalore Days. (Nazriya married actor Fahadh Faasil in 2014)

During Bangalore Days we did not know each other – we were not talking to each other much. Then we were like ‘we like talking to each other’. Now we are two professional actors. Because we are acting together, we don’t take work home and discuss it. That is very important to me. At the most, Fahadh will ask ‘was that scene okay?’ because he thinks about the film he is working in throughout. Otherwise, on set, it was just like working with any other actor, it was very comfortable. And (laughs) we are going together to work. In the mornings it was like who is going to get ready first.

Do you ask Fahadh for advice or inputs on your films?

I don’t have to go and ask him for advice ... I live with him and I see how much work he puts into his films. It is an inspiration just watching him. Sometimes I wish I had at least a percentage of what he has.

Are they any other films that you are working on?

I was like let Trance release first. I am listening to two scripts, nothing has been finalised.

Fahadh and I...

One scene that moved you in Trance?

There is a scene in the film where Fahadh’s character asks Esther, ‘Is there something wrong with me?’ Esther knows there is, but by then she has a soft corner for him and she looks him in the eye and says ‘No’. That was, for me, the most poignant scene in the movie.

Unlike many female actors in Malayalam cinema, you continue to work in films after your marriage. Was this something you had discussed with Fahadh?

No, there was nothing to discuss as such about it. It was pretty much clear that both of us would do whatever we enjoy doing; there would be no rules or regulations! In fact, once Fahadh asked me, 'Ehy don’t you listen to some scripts?’ (laughs). I have been working before as an actor and I continue to work.

The way we work are completely different. In Trance, most of my scenes were with him. I have always admired him as an actor and so that tension of keeping up with him was always there at the back of my mind.

Does Fahadh help you with acting tips?

On the set, we would discuss, like any other actors, the scenes. But, for me, the character lives between action and cut. When you are watching him act, that really makes you give your best. He has told me a lot of times that he really loved me in this film.

Malayalam viewers have seen you grow up from a chubby child star in Palunku to a teenage sweetheart in Ohm Shanti Oshaana to this troubled woman with a past in Trance...

Frankly enough, I have been lucky. I did not have to really search for a movie. Nothing was planned. It all just fell into place. Whatever excited me, I took it up and did my best. And that’s about it.

And your turned producer last year with Amal Neerad’s Fahadh-starrer Varathan?

It was a joint decision. Fahadh wants to concentrate only on his acting when he is shooting. So I decided to join hands with him, listen to stories and so on. It was an organic process. There has to be someone to look into the nitty-gritty and that is how I turned producer with the film. I plan to produce more films if I come across interesting stories.

Which is more challenging, acting or producing films?

Production has a lot if risks but I think acting is more challenging. You have to make a character look real.

Hrithik Roshan’s next stop could be Hollywood as the Bollywood superstar has been signed by US-based Gersh Agency. According to Deadline, the agency will represent Hrithik along with celebrity management firm, KWAN, in India and manager Amrita Sen.

“Hrithik has always been an envelope pusher. For the last 20 years, Hrithik has been helping to drive Indian cinema into new genres, new narrative concepts and ever-more sophisticated storytelling. He is excited about the fact that the market for global content, which features characters and stories from other parts of the world, couldn’t be stronger than it is today. With Hrithik’s leadership, our goal is to continue to put India in a front and centre position on the path towards globalisation and diversity and help integrate creators into new markets that were previously not available to them. In partnership with Gersh, we will now be taking Hrithik’s ambitious vision around the world,” Amrita said.

The Gresh Agency aim is to introduce Hrithik to Hollywood and create projects to be shot in India.

Hrithik, son of actor-filmmaker Rakesh Roshan, made his Bollywood debut in 2000 with Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai. He is one of the biggest stars in the Hindi film industry with films like Fiza, Mission Kashmir, Koi... Mil Gaya, Dhoom 2, Jodha Akbar, Guzaarish, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, Agneepath, and the Krissh franchise, to his credit.

181,2020/02/28,Indian pop culture has a nostalgia problem and it’s getting out of hand,"New web-series ‘Taj Mahal 1989’ is merely the latest symptom of an industry-wide malaise

For a show set three decades ago, this feels particularly ironic, but it has to be said: in an earlier era, Taj Mahal 1989 could have felt like an interesting failure. This, however, is the streaming era, when even the most prolific binge-watcher necessarily misses the vast majority of new shows and movies being released every week. From the audience’s point of view, therefore, the notion of an interesting failure is a luxury at best — critics must adapt accordingly. And by those standards, Netflix India’s latest original, a series about four interlinked romances set in and around Lucknow University, comfortably misses the mark.

Two of those romances form a campus love triangle, between Rashmi (Anshul Chauhan), Angad (Anud Singh Dhaka) and Dharam (Paras Priyadarshan). Rashmi and Dharam are in a relationship, while Angad has the (mostly respectful) hots for Rashmi. Unfortunately, all three of the young leads lack dialogue delivery skills. They look and sound like present-day Mumbai youngsters. Together, they proved irritating enough for me to fast-forward their stories after episode 3; I have no shame in admitting this and I’d strongly urge you to do the same.

Which leaves us with the middle-aged romances — Akhtar (Neeraj Kabi) and Sarita (Geetanjali Kulkarni) play philosophy and physics professors, respectively, married to each other for dog’s years and about to confront stagnation. Sudhakar (Danish Husain), Akhtar’s college buddy and a gold medallist, has since abandoned philosophy and taken over his father’s old tailoring business. His wife Mumtaz (Sheeba Chaddha) used to be a sex worker.

Linguistic charms

These four characters are well thought out, in comparison, and their linguistic charms — Akhtar’s Urdu and Sudhakar-Mumtaz’s Awadhi delivering a pan-Lucknow spread of sonorous dialogue — are considerable. And yet, ultimately, their stories, too, lose steam because of the same deficiencies that plague the other half of the show — amateurish writing, slapdash editing and a frankly juvenile conviction that a certain number of era-appropriate object shots will add up to period authenticity.

And while we’re on the topic, I should point out that Taj Mahal 1989 is merely the latest symptom of an industry-wide malaise: Indian pop culture has a 90s nostalgia problem and it’s fast getting out of hand. Our engagement with this period is myopic at best and potentially dangerous at worst. Films like Chhichhore (2019) and shows like Yeh Meri Family (2018) are content peddling a cotton candy version of the 90s — an endless parade of iconic advertisements (Taj Mahal’s title credits include an appearance by the ‘Rasna girl’), close-up shots of legacy tech like Walkmans, and wide-eyed references to the wonders of a newly-globalised economy. The 2017 Prateek Kuhad music video ‘Tum Jab Paas’ could very well have been an alternative opening credits sequence for Taj Mahal 1989 (and I’m convinced it’s a source of ‘inspiration’). The same lingering shots of pencil boxes and era-appropriate candy dominate; the same hollow, saccharine nostalgia is shoved down our throats.

It makes one want to grab these filmmakers by their collars and ask: What about Babri Masjid? What about the rise of the BJP? Our collective indoctrination, the long road that has led India to the events of February 2020, may have started earlier but it kicked into overdrive in the 90s — to its credit, Taj Mahal at least tries to incorporate political violence in its plot (it fails miserably, that’s the only thing you need to know). But almost every period drama (Sacred Games, apart) glosses over all of this entirely and asks instead, “Melody itni chocolatey kyun hai?” Remember, collective amnesia goes a long way towards achieving collective apathy.

To be clear, I’m not saying that all nostalgia is stupid and potentially dangerous. But this particular nostalgia is certainly both of those things. And until Indian TV gives me something that addresses the real issues of the 90s, I’m just going to fast forward the fake nostalgia.

182,2020/02/28,‘Parasite’ to get English graphic novel adaptation with Bong Joon-ho’s storyboards,"Drawn by the filmmaker himself, the graphic novel made up of 304 pages, will come out in the US on May 19

The fans of Oscar-winning South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-Ho or ‘Bonghive’ rejoice.

The filmmaker’s latest movie Parasite, which recently went home with four Academy Awards, is set to be presented in the form of a graphic novel which will contain illustrations from the film’s storyboards.

Grand Central Publishing will be releasing Parasite storyboards, drawn by Bong himself, as a graphic novel, which is made up of 304 pages. It will come out in the US on May 19.

“The dialogue, stage, and camera directions will be translated into English from Korean. The book will include a foreword written by director Bong about the making of the film and his creative process,” the company said in a statement, obtained by IndieWire.

The graphic novel is already out in South Korea.

“Director Bong’s illustrations share the illuminating power of his writing and directing, making the Parasite graphic novel a gorgeous, riveting read and fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse at the making of one of the best films of the year,” senior editor Wes Miller, who acquired the graphic novel for Grand Central Publishing, said in a statement.

Parasite, a dark class satire, shattered the 92-year Oscars history recently as it became the first non-English language film to earn the best picture trophy. It was also South Korea’s first ever win.

Apart from the graphical novel, the South Korean filmmaker is also making a limited series on Parasite. Set at HBO, Bong and Succession executive producer Adam McKay will adapt the film for a six-hour long project.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7a9r3k/article30942792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/parasite,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/parasite-to-get-english-graphic-novel-adaptation-with-bong-joon-hos-storyboards/article30942793.ece

184,2020/02/28,‘The Invisible Man’ movie review: Contemporary twist on a classic gone wrong,"Leigh Whannell’s vision for a feminist angle doesn’t quite make the 2020 adaptation of H.G Wells’ novel too cohesive

Long has the lore of H.G Wells’ The Invisible Man fascinated folks. With its 2020 adaptation, director and writer Leigh Whannell (Saw and the Insidious series), gives the film a marked feminist twist. Instead of focusing on the actual man in the story, Whannell emphasises the consequences of control and a chauvinistic erasure of the female identity.

Initially, the film was supposed to be a part of Universal Pictures’ grand scheme to revive the Dark Universe properties. Sadly, The Mummy’s reboot in 2017 put quite a large wrench in the works with its dismal box office performance. The studio then focused on remaking The Invisible Man as a stand-alone low budget feature with Blumhouse Productions. In its second feature of the year after the underwhelming Fantasy Island, the production house sticks to what it knows best with horror, including a science fiction-themed feminist angle.

The Invisible Man Director: Leigh Whannell

Cast: Elisabeth Moss, Aldis Hodge, Storm Reid, Harriet Dyer, Oliver Jackson-Cohen

Storyline: An optics genius uses his suit of invisibility to stalk and harass his ex-girlfriend

Whannell’s contemporary take is evident from the get go. His heroine, Cecelia (Elizabeth Moss) is seen tip-toeing around a beach-front house, fear bulging in her eyes. She’s drugged her boyfriend, optics genius Adrian Griffin (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) in order to escape. Her attempt to fly the coop is only partially successful when weeks later news of Griffin’s suicide surfaces, but mysterious harassment ensues. It’s evident Griffin has returned but Whannell insists on the inclusion of twists and turns that are more futile than surprising. Moss’ turn as a broken woman, who is mentally tortured in spite of leaving an abusive situation, could be triggering for its authenticity. It definitely helps that Whannell spotlights gaslighting, forced isolation, dominance and male power.

But the director’s well-intentioned or probably opportunistic vision — to capitalise on a necessary subject — doesn’t quite realise into cinematic excellence. While Cecelia’s situation elicits due empathy, Whannell is unable to craft a screenplay with originality. The Invisible Man is derivative, merging classic literature with any Hollywood revenge film. That said, there are moments, albeit fleeting, of pure horror when the Invisible Man teases his presence. But when the cat is out of the bag, in this case, a technological marvel of a suit, there’s not enough drama, horror or excitement to grip waning audience attention. It’s a shame that The Invisible Man’s fragmented positives can’t merge into a fulfilling whole, only because awareness about gendered violence is still sorely needed.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/t74a22/article30942523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/liz-moss,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-invisible-man-movie-review-contemporary-twist-on-a-classic-gone-wrong/article30942524.ece
185,2020/02/28,From ‘June’ to Vikram’s ‘Cobra’: 20-year-old Sarjano Khalid’s dream start to his film career,"The Malayalam youngster, who also acted alongside Mohanlal in ‘Big Brother’, talks about his Tamil debut in actor Vikram’s multi-starrer

There is much excitement over Vikram’s Cobra, his upcoming film with Ajay Gnanamuthu. The film features an ensemble cast with the likes of Srinidhi Shetty, former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan, KS Ravikumar and others, and also has music by A.R. Rahman.

However, another exciting development is the addition of young Malayalam star Sarjano Khalid to the cast. The actor is rising up the ranks with his characters in films like the romantic drama June, the Mohanlal-starrer Big Brother and also Gautham Menon’s web-series Queen. Already amassing an avid fan following in his short career, the 20-year-old year is as pleased as can be.

“I actually owe the opportunity to Gouri Kishan (of 96 fame) who put me on to this project. We had acted in a short film together and are really good friends. When my role in Cobra was confirmed, I was absolutely thrilled. I’ve grown up admiring Vikram sir in films like Anniyan and Deiva Thirumagal, and now I’m actually going to share screen space with him,” he gushes.

Sarjano can’t reveal too much about the film, except that it’s a thriller and that he’s as pleased as punch about getting the opportunity to make his Tamil debut with such a massive project.

Sarjano Khalid

“One of my most important learning curves from working with a big star like Mohanlal on the sets of Big Brother was the opportunity to observe him as a person off-camera. I realised there is a reason why some actors become superstars: it’s got as much to do with who they are as people, as they are performers on-screen. Like, I vividly remember him sitting quietly and reading the script on a chair, walking up to face the camera when the director called for the shot, and then suddenly transforming into a different person. It absolutely left me in awe. I’m barely a couple of years into movies now, and working with Vikram sir is going to teach me more such lessons,” he explains.

Unlike many of his peers, Sarjano isn’t widely bullish about his prospects in films and wants to prepare adequately before he tackles each industry: “It’s not just about the language, but also the culture behind the different film industries like Tamil, Malayalam, Telugu or Bollywood. I got my first taste of it while shooting for my role in GVM’s Queen web-series. Chennai and Kollywood have a synergy, a meaning, a film culture of its own and it’s essential to understand that to make it as an actor. I hope my stint on Cobra will help me kick-start things right.”

Revealing that his next venture will be another Malayalam film in which he will play the lead, Sarjano signs off, saying, “I know I’m just 20, but I’m all set to challenge and push myself to take on anything that excites me. For now, I’m just waiting to work alongside Vikram sir and revel in the experience.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hj6y10/article30942187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/sarjano,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/from-june-to-vikrams-cobra-20-year-old-sarjano-khalids-dream-start-to-his-film-career/article30942188.ece
186,2020/02/28,The breakout star of 'Jawaani Jaaneman': Why Aalia became Alaya F,"This star daughter, who debuted in the Saif Ali Khan-starrer recently, cannot sit still and doesn’t want to be confused with Alia Bhatt

In early 2015, while studying filmmaking in New York, Aalia Furniturewalla had an epiphany. She was at a class titled ‘how to direct an actor’ and everything suddenly felt different. She realised that being in front of the camera felt natural to her. “It was so much more rewarding. I remember loving being directed.” So, she enrolled, instead, for acting classes at New York Film Academy (NYFA). “I had to cover up for lost time because I had run away from acting for a while,” says actor Pooja Bedi’s daughter, who made her Bollywood début last month with the Saif Ali Khan starrer, Jawaani Jaaneman.

Name game

She worked hard for four years: first in New York and then in Mumbai. The real work, however, began when she returned to India. She concentrated not only on her acting, but also on her accent and her dancing. “I was a terrible dancer,” she says. She also decided to change her name to Alaya. In an interview with film critic Anupama Chopra, Alaya — pronounced “u-laaya” — said she didn’t want to be confused with actor Alia Bhatt. In another media interaction, she revealed that she deliberately shied away from using the Bedi surname because she likes her independence.

The preparation shows. The breakout star of Jawaani Jaaneman not only won over both audiences and critics with her easy-going charm, but also excelled at hitting the right emotional keys. In the film, Furniturewalla shines in scenes that require the most emotion, like when her unthinking father (played by Khan) pushes her out of his life (twice). It is difficult to believe this is her début.

Recalling the toughest scene (one of the early ones she shot), she says, “I was told it would be shot in one go, without cuts, on a steadicam. It was really complicated because of the way it was blocked and how I had to move, turn my face and so on.” She managed it on the first go.

On the move

The 22-year-old recalls days on which her hours would be so packed with classes and rehearsals that she barely had time to eat. And now, she can’t do without a sense of constant activity. Even when we speak on the phone, she’s on her way to a class. “If I’m sitting idle, it drives me mad. I feel I need to be doing something: going to a class, or a set, or working on a scene,” she says, adding, “I think it [the long hours] was worth it. I am obsessed with preparation. It makes me feel energised and comforted.”

In Mumbai, the actor found mentorship with acting coach Ritesh Kant. The classes were personalised and rigorous. “I had one-on-one sessions with him and we worked on all types of roles. Name a popular movie and I’ve probably done a scene from it,” she says.

Outspoken no more

Hailing from a family of well-known actors, such as grandfather Kabir Bedi, Furniturewalla wasn’t necessarily guided in her craft but did receive rich life lessons. Her parents divorced when she was five. In an interview with Outlook, she said that she had a happy childhood because she barely has any memories of the divorce and her parents are still on great terms. “I was told to work hard and not worry about results. More importantly, I was told to be nice to everyone. I’ve always been vocal with my words and emotions and choices. Now, as an actor, I realise every emotion I needed to experience, I have been allowed to express.” Elsewhere, she has also professed to having no illusions about her privilege and the doors it has opened for her, stating that she knows even her struggles have been privileged.

But this openness has led to occasional confrontations. She has, in the past, been an outspoken critic of the male gaze on social media (she has close to six lakh followers on Instagram), especially when it is deployed to restrict the freedom of women to express their sexuality or comfort with their bodies. The old Alaya would have been furious at sleazy comments. A couple of years ago, responding to one on the Miss Malini website, she wrote: “I am more than my breasts and it is unfair to let them define me.” The new Alaya is less angry, more circumspect and, in her words, “responsible”. “I think I’ve lost my enthusiasm for social media. I don’t take it as seriously as I used to. I am not as outspoken anymore because I’d rather let my work speak for me,” she concludes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/o5wbr9/article30941947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/alaia-f5927-copy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-breakout-star-of-jawaani-jaaneman-why-aalia-became-alaya-f/article30941948.ece

189,2020/02/28,‘Thappad’ movie review: Throwing a punch at patriarchy,"The story of one woman becomes that of every woman, every man and the everyday male entitlement.

There is something about picking up the newpapers and milk bottles from the main doorway and brewing the morning cup of tea, with ginger and lemongrass thrown in and drinking it in a cherished moment of peace in the balcony before the rush of the day gets to consume you. It is a commonplace daily vignette that is interspersed through Thappad, a running thread capturing a different underlying meaning at each juncture in Amrita’s (Taapsee Pannu) life. From the unquestioning contentment in domesticity and keeping her own dreams in the backburner to the uneasiness of being taken for granted in marriage, from the humiliation of the unforeseen slap delivered by an inconsiderate husband in a party to actively questioning one’s own complacency with the role playing in a happy family circus — the morning cuppa tea is a marker in the evolution of Thappad’s protagonist. It’s about how she consolidates within even as the world outside — marriage, relationships, family —comes crashing down. A slow and steady change than an overnight transformation.

Thappad Director: Anubhav Sinha

Starring: Taapsee Pannu, Dia Mirza, Maya Sarrao, Geetika Vidya, Ratna Pathak Shah, Tanvi Azmi, Naila Grewal, Pavail Gulati, Kumud Mishra, Manav Kaul, Ankur Rathee, Sushil Dahiya

Storyline: Amrita’s seemingly happy life comes crashing down when her husband slaps her in a party

Run time: 142 minutes

The trailer of Thappad had left me with a sense of trepidation. How can a film that has revealed its core in the teaser and the title itself sustain the audience interest for over two hours? What more would there be to it than the usual conflict in the wake of an act of violation? How to build a film around a slap? “Just one” slap at that?

However, writers Anubhav Sinha and Mrunmayee Lagoo Waikul do well in turning a solitary slap into larger exploration of male entitlement. They weave a dexterous but concise and economical narrative that, even while focusing on one woman’s life, turns it into the story about every woman. And every man. All of it centred well in a lovely early sequence of women across age groups and societal divides, riding away in to the night in cars and bicycles, some with their men, all with their own stories of patriarchal infringment on the one hand and a soother like orange lolly on the other.

Amrita’s husband Vikram (Pavail Gulati), the one who slaps unthinkingly but is presumably “not such a bad guy”, is not the only one. Much as it is about women who are conditioned to remain quietly at the receiving end of everyday patriarchy (“Bardaasht karna” as a character puts it), it’s also about casual insensitivity of men — “Shit happens. People move on”, says the husband. At times it gets woefully toxic (watch out for Manav Kaul), at others unwitting as in the case of a loving, model father (Kumud Mishra) who could have throttled his wife’s desires even while being the wind beneath the daughter’s wings. It’s these dualities and dilemmas that lend an edge. Slowly, bit by bit, it lays bare the normalisation of male entitlement and holds a mirror to one and all. And, much of the credit for rendering things compelling should also go to the well cast, finely attuned ensemble. There is a range of men — specially Mishra and Gulati in complex turns — but towering over them is the gang of women led ably by the fragile yet steely-resolved Taapsee Pannu. From the ever reliable mother (Ratna Pathak Shah) and mother-in-law (Tanvi Azmi) as the more pliant older order to the younger rebels like the fierce and spirited fiancé of Amrita’s brother (Naila Grewal) and her conflicted lawyer (Maya Sarao) to the house help (Geetika Vidya) —the far from docile insurgent on the margins — its a sorority of much consequence.

It’s at the fag end, in its needless effort to rehabilitate the offenders and turn them abruptly and handily penitent, that the film wobbles but thankfully doesn’t get entirely derailed. On the one hand it holds the more widely palatable but disconcerting possibility of reconciliation, on the other is a simultaneous overriding assurance that it’s not the same Amrita we are leaving the theatre with than the one introduced to us at the start. She has come a long way. Like the woman in the Punjabi poem Mera Pata (My Address) by her namesake icon, Amrita Pritam, referenced in the film: “Te jitthe vee sutantar rooh di jhalak paave, samajhna uh mera ghar hain (Wherever you catch a glimpse of a free soul, regard that as my home).”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/39lr3p/article30940084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thppadi23,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/thappad-review-throwing-a-punch-at-patriarchy/article30940085.ece
190,2020/02/28,Revanth Reddy knocks HC door for security,"Claims threat to life from ruling party in State

Stating that he was apprehending threat to his life from real estate tycoon Jupally Rameshwar Rao and leaders of ruling party of Telangana, Malkajgiri Lok Sabha member A. Revanth Reddy moved Telangana High Court seeking direction to Union Home Ministry to enhance security to him.

Mr. Reddy said in his writ petition that after getting elected as MP in 2019, he addressed a letter to Union Home Minister for protection by any independent agency other than State agency since he had threat from Mr. Rao and others. The Union Home Minister, he claimed, had written back on August 28, 2019 saying the request was under consideration.

Special circumstances

Despite the ‘specific reply’ by the Union Home Minister, the Union Home Secretary failed to respond to provide security, the petitioner said. This was arbitrary, he said. Though security was State subject, the Centre can provide protection under special circumstances, the petitioner said.

Mr. Reddy listed out the various writ petitions and PIL petitions he had filed in the HC over his security and the issues he had taken up against the State government. He explained about the petitions he had filed against Mr. Rao stating that the latter was a close associate of present government.

He sought a direction to the Union Home Secretary to expedite the process of taking a call on providing security to him based on the letter issued by Union Home Minister.

Contempt of court

In a separate case, Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao sentenced three Forest Department officials to undergo two-month simple imprisonment and pay a fine of ₹ 20,000 each, holding them guilty in a contempt of court case.

191,2020/02/28,IICT ready to help in developing Covid-19 drug,"Move to procure raw material required for preparing molecule

The CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IICT) is ready to start preparing the basic molecule which goes into making of the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) for finally coming out with a drug to tackle coronavirus or Covid-19.

Director S. Chandrasekhar informed on Friday that a leading pharmaceutical firm has enquired whether the science institute will be able to prepare the molecule when a requisition is made for making of the API so that the firm could go for mass production of the drug.

“We have not received any indent as such, but we are going to start process by proactively procuring the raw material required for making of the molecule based on which the pharma companies can prepare API and the drug after conducting trials,” he explained.

While he expects the rapid spread of coronavirus to abate in view of the summer season ahead, he pointed out that efforts are on globally to find a drug quickly for treating it. In fact, a leading global pharma major based in the United States has already announced that it will be conducting trials to test anti-viral medication ‘remdesivir’, a therapy previously tested against Ebola virus.

“The basic materials required for making the molecule is ‘Pyrrolo Triazine’ and ‘Ribose’. We are going to procure these materials and test them out just in case emergency calls come. We are very much capable of developing the drug development process ,” he said.

Dr. Chandrasekhar said that if the Covid-19 turns out to be a pandemic spreading to more nations there is a possibility of the drug firms dispensing with the trials and straight away administering the medicine to control fatalities. For now, the late-stage trials could be to check the drug’s efficacy rather than just safety.

An expert appraisal committee of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) has pointed out the short work done by the Irrigation department and its consultant in the application filed for environmental clearance (EC) to the Modikuntavagu medium irrigation project in Jayashankar-Bhupalapally district and deferred its appraisal, seeking more information.

The project seeks to create irrigation potential of nearly 14,000 acres with construction of a 1,359-metre-high earthen dam across Modikuntavagu, a tributary of Godavari river, near Krishnapuram village of Wazedu mandal. The dam envisages storing 2.142 tmcft water for providing irrigation to 5,500 hectares (about 14,000 acres) along with supply of 0.12 tmcft drinking water to 35 Maoist-affected tribal villages in the area.

According to Irrigation department officials, the total land requirement for the project is 574.99 ha, including 499 ha of forest land and 75.99 ha of non-forest land. Of the land required, 13.15 ha is for the dam and 427.8 ha for submergence at full reservoir level at 124 metres and 58.05 ha for construction of canals. Officials stated that the proposal for environmental clearance had been submitted on December 16 last year and public hearing had been conducted at Wazedu on September 29, 2018 where “a majority of people supported early implementation of the project”.

“Based on the monthly inflow yield series for the years 1941 to 2015, 3.716 tmcft water is available in Modikuntavagu, out of which 2.142 tmcft would be utilised for the project. The remaining 1.574 tmcft water would flow downstream for ecological purpose,” an engineer involved in the project work said. The project proposed to be completed in three years would cost ₹425.16 crore.

Although the culturable command area of the project is less than 50,000 ha and it can be appraised at the State level itself, it has qualified for appraisal by the MoEF as Eturnagaram Wildlife Sanctuary and the inter-state boundary with Chhattisgarh is located within 10 km of the project boundary. The project site is located at a distance of 7.5 km from Eturnagaram WLS boundary and the inter-state boundary with Chhattisgarh lies at a distance of 9.13 km.

While deferring the proposal for want of information, the MoEF committee sought details of submergence, rehabilitation and resettlement involved in the project, justification for the project, hydrological clearance from the Central Water Commission and revised cost estimates for implementation of the Environmental Management Plan. Besides, the department has been told to submit an affidavit — declaring that “no inter-state issue” is involved — and necessary documents from the forest and wildlife officials.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/panel-defers-appraisal-of-modikuntavagu/article30945258.ece

195,2020/02/28,Strategy to be drawn up for buying paddy this rabi,"Cabinet sub-committee to meet on March 2

The State government has resolved to chalk out an effective strategy for effective procurement of paddy produced during the rabi season soon.

The Cabinet sub-committee on agricultural produce headed by Agriculture Minister S. Niranjan Reddy and consisting Ministers Eatala Rajender and G. Kamalakar would meet on March 2 in this direction. Government’s chief advisor Rajiv Sharma, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and other senior officials would participate in the meeting being convened to review the existing policy and steps that should be taken in advance to ensure effective procurement.

Mr. Kamalakar held a meeting with the Civil Supplies officials ahead of the meeting here on Friday. The government had set up 3,670 paddy procurement centres across the State and procured 47.11 lakh tonne food grains worth ₹ 8,626.22 crore from 9.28 lakh farmers. With effective planning and steps initiated in advance to meet the requirements, the government could ensure that procurement was not halted and farmers were not put to inconvenience in spite of significant rise in the commodities arriving in the markets.

As part of efforts, awareness was created among the farmers at grass roots level about the support price being offered for their produce. In addition, steps were taken to put in place machines to measure moisture content in paddy as well as weighing machines at these centres. Procurement of food grains was monitored on daily basis through online systems and the amounts were credited directly to the accounts of farmers.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/strategy-to-be-drawn-up-for-buying-paddy-this-rabi/article30944727.ece

197,2020/02/28,Centre discriminating against Telugu States: Vinod Kumar,"‘Kishan Reddy’s claims on increaseing Assembly seats reflects double standards’

Senior TRS leader and State Planning Board vice-chairman B. Vinod Kumar took strong objection to Union Minister of State G. Kishan Reddy’s claim that the Centre had not yet taken any decision on enhancing the number of Assembly seats in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

Mr. Kishan Reddy said it was not possible for increasing the number of Assembly seats in the two Telugu States and the enhancement process would be taken up along with other States. Mr. Vinod Kumar said the BJP leader’s stand reflected the double standards of the party as the Central government had enhanced the number of Assembly seats in Jammu and Kashmir but was reluctant to fulfil the promise made to the two Telugu States in the AP Reorganisation Act 2014.

Asserting that the two States would take a legal recourse for fulfilment of the promise made at the time of bifurcation of erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, he said the BJP adopted “discriminatory approach” towards States which were not favourable for the party. He found fault with Mr. Kishan Reddy for claiming that the enhancement of Assembly seats was incorporated in the Reorganisation Act at the last minute.

The Act was finalized in consultation with senior BJP leaders, including L.K. Advani, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj. “Mr. Kishan Reddy’s comments are belittling these senior leaders. Why is the party not sticking to its claim on one nation – one law?” he asked lamenting that the BJP was deliberately biding time when it came to enhancing the Assembly seats in the two Telugu States in spite of repeated demands since the past six years.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/wuk826/article30944533.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29VINOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/centre-discriminating-against-telugu-states-vinod-kumar/article30944467.ece
198,2020/02/28,Peak power demand in TS crosses highest in combined AP,"Increase attributed to 24×7 free supply to farm sector, LI projects, new industries

Indicating the constant increase in the economic activity in the State, Telangana has registered an all-time high peak power demand of 13,168 mega watt at 7.52 a.m. on Friday surpassing the peak power demand of 13,162 MW of combined Andhra Pradesh that was recorded on March 23, 2014.

Besides, the consumption of per capita energy, one of the key indicators of development, has also gone up in the State by 39.82% in six years as it has increased to 1,896 units in 2019 from 1,356 units in 2013. According to the officials of Transmission Corporation of Telangana Ltd (TS-Transco), the national average of per capita energy consumption is 1,181 units. Chairman and Managing Director of TS-Transco D. Prabhakar Rao said they were able to make the long strides in the sector only with the guidance and cooperation of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.

Significantly, in spite of meeting the highest-ever consumption in the State there were no restriction or load-shedding, the officials said adding that the peak demand registered on February 28 last year was only 9,770 MW and it is recorded 34% higher on Friday. They attributed the increase in demand to round-the-clock uninterrupted free power supply to agricultural pumpsets, operation of several lift irrigation schemes and increase in the industrial demand.

Compared to the peak demand of 5,661 MW met in June 2014, when the State was formed, the peak demand met on Friday is 132.6% more, the Transco officials said. Explaining the increase in energy consumption, the officials said it has increased by 44% with 68,147 MU consumption in 2018-19 against 47,338 MU in 2013-14. During the same period, the average national growth rate has been 23%.

The officials stated that the farm sector used to get four to five hours of power supply before formation of Telangana but within nine months it was given nine-hour supply and from January 1, 2018 all agricultural pumpsets are getting 24×7 free power supply. Prior to June 2, 2014, the demand from the farm sector was not more than 2,000 MW but it is now around 6,000 MW.

Farm power connections have also increased by over 5 lakh after formation of the State as they stand at 24,31,056 now from 19,02,754 in June 2014. Similarly, the demand from lift irrigation schemes was 680 MW and now the demand is around 2,200 MW, the officials explained. The demand is expected to go up further with the operation of more phases of existing and new lift irrigation projects.

Total number of power consumers (connections) has also increased by 38.61% since 2014 as they stand at 1,54,14,451 now against 1,11,19,990 in 2014.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/qijdrn/article30944258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29PADDYCULTIVATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/peak-power-demand-in-ts-crosses-highest-in-combined-ap/article30944259.ece

202,2020/02/28,Elected body still eludes Bhadrachalam Gram Panchayat,"Elections could not be held due to legal wrangles over proposals to upgrade it

As Bhadrachalam gears up to host the annual Sri Rama Navami Brahmotsavams from March 25, the major Gram Panchayat in Telangana’s tribal heartland continues to face a piquant situation in the absence of an elected body at the helm for a long time.

Barring Bhadrachalam and Sarapaka GPs in the district, all the remaining 479 GPs have the elected bodies.

Gram Panchayat elections could not be held for the two GPs last year due to some legal wrangles over pending proposals to upgrade them into urban local bodies, sources said.

The Adivasi organisations in Bhadrachalam Agency have long been opposing any move to upgrade Bhadrachalam GP into a municipality on the ground that it will contravene laws applicable to Fifth Scheduled areas and undermine the interests of Adivasis.

A host of Adivasi organisations, including the Adivasi Sankshema Parishad (ASP), Bhadrachalam Adivasis Committee (BAC) and Adivasi Adikar Rashtriya Manch (AARM), have renewed their demand for continuation of Bhadrachalam as GP and early polls to elect representatives for the rural local body.

The demand has gained momentum following submission of a memorandum by a joint delegation comprising the representatives of several Adivasi organisations in this regard to the authorities of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA), Bhadrachalam, recently.

The Bhadrachalam Gram Panchayat, the grassroots unit of local self-government in the Fifth Schedule Area, has been without an elected body for long, rued former Zilla Parishad chairman of the erstwhile undivided Khammam district and ex-MLA Chanda Lingaiah Dora.

“How long the vital unit of local self-government be allowed to run by special officers without a sarpanch and other elected members,” he questioned, adding that it was imperative to have an elected body to uphold participatory democracy, achieve inclusive development and implement the laws governing the Agency Areas in letter and spirit.

Absence of the elected body is taking a toll on the development of Bhadrachalam GP, deplored ASP convenor Madavi Nehru.

The onus of holding elections to Bhadrachalam Gram Panchayat lies on the government to uphold constitutional provisions and decentralised democratic governance, he added.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/elected-body-still-eludes-bhadrachalam-gram-panchayat/article30936655.ece

206,2020/02/28,Three of a family drown as car plunges into canal,"Teenager rescued by locals

Three members of a family drowned after the car in which they were travelling lost control and plunged into the Alimineti Madhava Reddy Project canal here on Thursday.

Orsu Raghu, 45, his wife Alivelu, 38, and 19-year-old daughter Keerthi, a B.Tech student were found dead when the police pulled out the car from the canal. Youngest of the family, Kartheek, 13, was rescued by locals.

According to the police, the family members were returning to Vanasthalipuram in Hyderabad after visiting their native village of Vadderigudem in Pedda Adiserlapally mandal. The four had come to their native village two days ago to attend a family function.

The accident happened at around 8.30 a.m. near Dugyala village just a kilometre from their Vadderigudem house.

According to police, the car lost control on the narrow approach road after it jumped a small rock on the slight curve and plunged into the canal.

“They were not moving at high speed as it is a very narrow stretch. Raghu, who was at the wheel, seems to have lost control in panic. The car which was floating for sometime sank some 500 metres from the embankment,” police quoting locals said.

“Raghu was still with the seat belt on, the doors remained closed, the mother was hugging her daughter tightly, and only Kartheek could be pulled out. They drowned slowly as everyone watched, even as rescue attempts failed,” police said.

Raghu, a private road works contractor in Hyderabad, had hired the car for the journey, and might not have been an experienced driver and none of the occupants in the car knew swimming, police said.

Kartheek, his relatives and villagers were inconsolable as the bodies of the three victims were handed over to the family members after post-mortem. The last rites would be held at Vadderigudem.

He requested the Home Minister and Telangana DGP to review the insensitive handling by these policemen.

On Thursday, Medak Superintendent of Police Chandana Deepti suspended Sridhar and orders were issued to this effect.

Meanwhile, police registered two cases, one under Patancheru police station limits and another one under BDL Banur police stations limits against unspecified number of people for obstructing the police from performing their duty.

208,2020/02/28,68 junior colleges in Telangana to be closed,"Colleges sans BIE affiliation not to function from next academic year

Sixty-eight junior colleges, which failed to fulfil requirements of affiliation with Board of Intermediate Education (BIE), would be closed from next academic year, the State government told the Telangana High Court on Thursday.

In an additional affidavit filed by the BIE represented by its Secretary Omar Jaleel, the government assured the HC that all colleges without affiliation to BIE would be closed on completion of intermediate annual examinations on March 28. With intermediate annual examinations less than a week away, ‘immediate closure’ of these colleges would create panic in the minds of students studying there. Closure of the colleges would also mean cancellation of the hall tickets issued to them.

That would eventually delay the examination schedule itself, the officials said in the affidavit. A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, which had been hearing a PIL plea on running of junior colleges without affiliation to BIE, earlier instructed the government to take action against such colleges.

When the matter came up for hearing on Thursday, the bench perused the affidavit filed by the BIE and instructed the government to file a report by April 3 as to how many colleges were closed by it in compliance with the HC direction. In the affidavit, the government said that an inter-department meeting was held on February 20 by the officials following the HC instructions to initiate action against colleges which failed to comply with the conditions to secure affiliation with the BIE.

Special Chief Secretary, Education, Home Principal Secretary, Fire Services Director General, Collegiate Education Commissioner, BIE secretary and officials of GHMC and Higher Education attended the meeting. Subsequently, notices were issued to 18 colleges of Sri Chaitanya Educational Institutions, 26 colleges of Narayana Educational Institutions and 24 other colleges for failing to adhere to affiliation rules. Sri Chaitanya group had already given an undertaking to the BIE that it would not apply for affiliation of its 18 colleges for next academic year.

A 23-year-old social worker D. Rajesh filed the PIL alleging that managements of private junior colleges, including those run by Sri Chaitanya and Narayana groups, were not following rules relating to affiliation and facilities.

On February 17, the bench instructed the government to take concrete steps against colleges operating without affiliation to BIE as future of students studying in such colleges would be at stake. The BIE filed an affidavit assuring to take action against 68 colleges that did not have BIE affiliation as their buildings had not complied with fire safety norms.

The matter would be heard again on April 7.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/srylen/article30918663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25HysurNearby1G2Q75RGF11jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/68-junior-colleges-to-be-closed/article30936143.ece
209,2020/02/28,How political is the normal?,"Mahesh Baliga’s paintings challenge frameworks that govern the way we perceive everyday occurrences, says Pooja Savansukha

‘It’s a normal day…’ Mahesh Baliga’s fifth solo exhibition at Project 88 features the artist’s works that showcase his unrelenting concern with everyday happenings. Baliga uses matter-of-fact, playful, and semi-satirical imagery to divulge dissonances within regular days that have been overlooked or ignored, while making a strong case for the relevance of painterly practices. Entering the gallery, one is taken by the impressive display of evenly-sized, small-scale paintings that are exhibited cinematically across two walls of the space and juxtaposed against larger paintings by the Vadodara-based artist. The viewer is compelled to pay attention to the conversation between these works that highlight “Details that have been missed from the day-to-day framing of images of importance — of violence, pain, loss, and love.” Mythological subjects, intimate indoor scenes, depictions of nature, the built environment, and references to Baliga’s artistic identity are brought to the forefront. The artist invites considerations of his painterly medium, the construction of narratives, and idea of normalcy.

Contemplative form

Baliga works with casein, a by-product of milk, mixed with pigment that achieves an intensity and vibrancy that cannot be realised by synthetic colours. He was introduced to the medium while working as a production assistant at senior artist, Nilima Sheikh’s studio and acknowledges in an interview that, “How the paint behaves,” is a question that continues to drive his practice. Allowing his medium to determine the depth and dimensionality within his paintings, Baliga also abandons a strict adherence to realistic perspectives to re-examine regular sights with scrutiny and imagination. Using vivid colours, he captures essences of still moments and dynamism across his paintings, inviting a contemplative form of viewership. The artist expresses in the press note, “The daily practice of painting is often found redundant in the present context; it is normalised/standardised as something of the commonplace. This is the primary action which I consciously retain.”

His paintings draw formally from sources such as Edward Hopper, Caravaggio, post-Impressionists, Ukiyo-e prints, and Persian miniature paintings. In his paintings, Pagala Gach (Ptergota Alata) and Gaze Chart, Baliga also reveals his consideration of children’s charts as reference material for the manner in which he explores numerous ways of depicting trees and fountains, respectively. Some of his paintings furthermore, pay tribute to artists including Nilima Sheikh and Raqs Media Collective, revealing his engagement with art practitioners. Painting enables Baliga to straddle serious subjects, banality, and deliberate humour while exploring the structures of visuality. “The delight of making” remains at the core of his practice; “I cannot sleep without making a painting,” he expresses.

Narrative techniques

For Baliga, making art is linked with, “looking sideways at images that are all too familiar.” His works that are exhibited like a series do not construct a linear narrative, but instead portray various kinds of reversals, contradictions, references to time, and ideas of intertextuality. Baliga explains how his use of recurring motifs within these works provides a sense of distancing and reorientation. “There are conversations surrounding the absent mother, the burnt cycle, the upturned milk van, and the presence of a military tank in a residential area which lives without any caution. The unnoticed everyday responses of an artist to his daily life, moments of introspection, friendships, and conflicts are laid bare for the spectators.” In ‘Artist consuming time’, Baliga appears to have depicted himself eating the moon — a reference to lunar cycles, as well as to the phenomenal experience of the passage of time while painting. ‘Birthday’, alternatively features a date from a calendar (of the artist’s birthday) inviting a consideration of the construct of time. The artist frequently portrays images of noise on a television screen to insinuate a sense of “pause” within his cinematic series, providing viewers a moment to consider “how we see.” In one painting, a rabbit chases a hound, and in yet another the situation is inverted. ‘Pagala Gach’ (mad tree) features a tree from Kolkata’s Botanical Garden in which every leaf is different from another, representing a sense of unity in diversity. Baliga depicts the tree with waq waq tendrils, borrowing from imagery in Persian manuscripts. By placing equal emphasis on images, ideas, and events that are both trivial and critical, Baliga investigates the idea of normality.

Questioning the ordinary

Baliga suggests, “When singular things or events begin to occur regularly, they are rendered normal. When people overlook strangeness it’s normal. Sometimes things are simply normalised to suit institutions of power. News clippings from the sidelines and margins may enter the frames. The normality of everyday gets lost in the articulation of larger discourses of politics.”

In his paintings, Baliga refers to the writer M.M. Kalburgi who was shot dead in 2015 for quoting the writer U. R. Ananthmurthy, news about abandoned babies, ecological catastrophe, and the ill-treatment of animals. “The routine practices of reading unreceived images of violence, alienation, conflict, and desire through the everyday of myself as an artist-person, enters my practice. I ask how political is normal?” the artist explains. Baliga chooses to portray his subjects with a calculated distance. By maintaining a sense of unsentimentality through stylistic exaggeration and consciously not taking any stand within his works, the artist is succinctly reminding viewers to remain vigilant and to look and think critically every day.

210,2020/02/28,Mangalore-based artist Santhosh Andrade lends everyday scenes a new dimension,"Textures and elements of folk art are present in Santhosh D Andrade’s realistic portrayal of childhood memories and surroundings

It is an everyday sight through a framed window of what appears to be a traditional house — a sari-clad woman stoops over, trying to draw water from a well. A realistic portrayal at that, the layered work also has elements and motifs of madhubani hidden within. In another frame, to the backdrop of pink walls and a very defined staircase flanked by walls with madhubani motifs, sits an elderly man in a kurta-dhoti deep in thought. On the staircase is also a little girl, engrossed in her own world.

Realism, as is evident, is artist Santhosh D Andrade’s forte, but the textures that these physical canvases lend to, are what makes his work in acrylic stand out. To the point that they invite one to run their fingers over the canvases.

What started out as a childhood pastime — he used to imitate portraits of Ganapati, Hanuman, and Jesus using crayons — soon grew into a passion. “I was obsessed with electronic gadgets, and still am. I used to paint and operate electronics simultaneously,” he recalls. And after pursuing a Bachelor’s in Fine Arts, specialising in Folk Art, he started painting professionally. Fifteen years after, not much has changed, except of course the technical expertise. Santhosh’s love for his surroundings, and its translation into his canvases, remain the same.

The 39-year-old, who hails from Chilimbi in Mangalore, combines skill with perception in his work. His love for the folk art form of madhubani surfaces repeatedly in the form of motifs and references. “My first brush with madhubani was at a college camp. Then, somewhere down the line, I started mixing folk art with realism,” says the artist, 33 of whose works are on display at Sarala’s Artworld, today. He goes on, “Some of the works on display are representations of my childhood memories. Others are of my own surroundings. Now, we as a society, are losing out on the natural beauty of our surroundings. With industrialisation, this is becoming a reality,” he says.

But what makes his works stand out, are the textures they lend. Though from a distance, they appear to be just another acrylic painting, as one looks deeper, these textures are revealed. Santhosh’s technique is what creates this effect. “Acrylic by itself, is rich. But, I add 10 to 11 layers of colours to the canvas to get the texture. I initially patch the colours on, and let them dry. Meanwhile, more patches are placed beside them. Once they are dry, more layers of different colours are slapped on. The more the layers, the more the richness,” explains Santhosh adding that when different colours are placed layer by layer, new shades take form. It takes him 10 to 12 days to finish one work, says the artist, adding that the tools for the same, are also made by him.

211,2020/02/28,Assam court sentences 12 to life in mob-lynching case,"Local Karbi tribal organisation says it will challenge the conviction in the High Court.

A court in central Assam’s Karbi Anglong district on Friday sentenced 12 people to life imprisonment for their roles in a case of mob lynching seven years ago.

The police in Diphu, the district headquarters located about 250km east of Guwahati, had filed a charge sheet against 19 auto-rickshaw drivers for the death of 16-year-old Jhankar Saikia on July 1, 2013.

The police submitted that the accused had assaulted Jhankar and his lawyer-father Haren Saikia after they had refused to pay ₹30 instead of the regular fare of ₹20. Mr. Saikia recovered but his son succumbed to injuries in a private hospital.

On February 24, almost two years after the trial began in 2018, district judge Amiruddin Ahmed convicted 12 of the accused for lynching the teenager and acquitted four of them. Two others — Barlong Terang and Gibson Timung — have been absconding since the incident, while another person was tried by a court for juveniles.

The sentence was pronounced under five relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.

A local organisation called the Joint Action Committee for Autonomous State, which is campaigning to protect the rights of the Karbi tribals, expressed unhappiness with the district court’s verdict and said it would challenge the order in the Gauhati High Court.

The judgment came a day after the Mizoram government condemned a mob assault on three non-tribal traders in the State’s Mamit district on Tuesday. The people of West Lungdar village in the district had attacked the three persons — two from Uttar Pradesh and one from Assam — on suspicion of being child abductors.

“The incident happened because of rumours spread via social media about strangers attempting to kidnap a 13-year-old boy in the area,” Mizoram’s Home Minister Lalchamliana said.

The assaulted trio was travelling in an SUV. The latest incident was reminiscent of the lynching of two Guwahati-based men, Nilotpal Das and Abhijeet Nath, in Assam’s Karbi Anglong district in June 2018.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3xhsn7/article30944357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-mob-Lynching,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-court-sentences-12-to-life-in-mob-lynching-case/article30944351.ece
212,2020/02/28,Delhi violence: Mamata Banerjee urges Amit Shah to ensure peace,"Bengal CM’s comments came during her address to Eastern Zonal Council meeting

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday urged Home Minister Amit Shah to maintain peace in the country in wake of violence in Delhi .

In the first face-to-face with Mr. Shah following the clashes in the national capital, Ms. Banerjee brought up the issue of riots in presence Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik at the 24th Eastern Zonal Council meeting in Bhubaneswar.

“I am saddened what has happened in New Delhi. It is necessary to bring the peace back. Victims’ families including that of police constable and IB officer should be assisted,” Ms. Banerjee said.

“If a problem takes place in any part of country, it spreads to other parts too. This should not happen. Please see to it that peace is maintained in the country,” the West Bengal CM said at the beginning of her address.

Ms Banerjee asserted that she would take up the issue of Delhi violence politically after normalcy was restored.

The Council did not discuss the National Register of Citizens (NRC). “They did not raise the issue and we also did not. The issues of NRC, Citizen (Amendment) Act and National Population of Register were not in agenda. So no discussion was held,” Ms Banerjee said.

Later in the afternoon, Mr. Shah addressed a public meeting here and defended the enactment of the CAA and abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. He reiterated that opposition parties were spreading lies and instigating people to carry out riots.

“All opposition political parties including Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Left parties and Trinamool Congress are opposing CAA. They are opposing CAA saying that rights of minority communities over citizenship would cease to exist. I and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the floor of Parliament had reiterated several times that not a single Muslim in India would lose citizenship due to CAA,” he said.

“The CAA is not a law that would take away citizenship, but it is a law of granting citizenship. Many communities including Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Jain, Buddhist and Parsee are left behind in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan after the partition. Subsequently, they were persecuted there. They had taken shelter in India to save their respect,” Mr. Shah said.

“After 70 years, these communities are deprived of education, health and basic amenities. Where would they go? What about their human rights? Congress leaders had promised at 27 different places that citizenship would be granted to Hindu and Sikh refugees. They did not keep their promises. Despite knowing that his government would be criticized, PM Modi came up with CAA,” senior BJP leader said.

213,2020/02/28,"Amid raids, police seize vehicles hired by Income Tax officials in Raipur","The IT fficials did not confirm if the vehicles had been hired by them.

As many as 19 cars, reportedly hired by Income Tax officials who are carrying out searches at properties of some senior officials of Chhattisgarh government and others, were seized by the police in Raipur on Friday for ‘violation’ of traffic rules.

Income Tax officials did not confirm if the vehicles had been hired by them.

“In view of President Ram Nath Kovind’s visit to Raipur on March 1, check-points have been set up to keep an eye on suspicious movement of vehicles,” a senior police official told PTI.

“Around 2 a.m. this morning, cars belonging to private travel operators were found parked in no-parking zone near Raj Talkies. Drivers failed to give satisfactory explanation so the vehicles were taken to a police station,” he said.

After recovering fine as per the Motor Vehicles Act, the vehicles were released on Friday afternoon, he added.

“Government agencies did not contact or inform us that the vehicles were being used by IT officials,” the police officer said.

IT officials did not confirm if their Department had hired these vehicles.

“The Department had booked 19 Innova SUVs and cars on Thursday evening. They had asked us to park the vehicles near Raj Talkies,” said Kishan Sonkar, a travel operator.

“We are seeing this kind of action for the first time. Generally, vehicles are released after payment of fine. But the vehicles were kept in police custody for more than 12 hours and released only this afternoon,” he said.

Senior BJP MLA Shivratan Sharma raised the issue in the Chhattisgarh Assembly, alleging that the police were trying to obstruct the ongoing IT raids which began on Thursday.

The Gujarat government has requested the Centre to evacuate 340 Indian fishermen, mostly from the State, who are stranded at a port in Iran after the authorities there have shut the nearby airports and barred people’s movement due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) scare.

Gujarat Minister Raman Patkar has e-mailed a letter to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Thursday, urging him to bring back the fishermen.

Mr. Patkar, who represents Umargam seat of Valsad district, said these fishermen are stuck at Bandar-e-Chiru of Hormozgan Province in Iran and could not return to India as Iranian authorities have sealed the airports and not allowing people to go out of the country.

In the e-mail, Mr. Patkar, who is Minister of State for Forest and Tribal Affairs, said he learnt about the ordeal after some fishermen belonging to his constituency called him.

“Due to coronavirus infection scare, around 340 fishermen, mostly from Gujarat, are stuck at Bandar-e-Chiru of Iran as they are not allowed to go out of the country. They have made a request for necessary arrangements for their return. My humble request to do needful for the same,” his letter reads.

Talking to PTI, Mr. Patkar said that many of the stranded fishermen are from Umargam and other surrounding villages of Valsad.

“While most of these 340 men are from Gujarat, some of them are from other States, such as Tamil Nadu. After getting a call from a stranded fisherman, I have written to S. Jaishankar to make necessary arrangements to bring them back, as these fishermen are not allowed to go out of the country and airports are also sealed off,” the BJP leader said.

Ganesh Tandel, one of the stranded fishermen, said that he and his colleagues worked in Iran on contract and reached that country via Dubai.

“We first reached Dubai on a flight from Mumbai and then Iranian authorities arranged our visa from Dubai to Bandar-e-Chiru, where we are supposed to do fishing for the Iranian contractors,” Mr. Tandel told PTI over phone.

“But due to the coronavirus scare, Iranian authorities are not letting us go and they have shut the airports. All the flights from Iran are cancelled.

218,2020/02/28,Two held for ‘thrashing’ farmer to death over drawing water from well in Bundelkhand,"Breach of water-sharing agreement led to dispute

The Chhatarpur Police has arrested two persons for allegedly thrashing a farmer to death on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday over a water dispute in the parched Bundelkhand region.

Hareram Mishra and Jagprasad Mishra along with their father thrashed to death Mohan Patel in Mahjguwan village over drawing water for irrigation from a well, said the police.

“Five years ago, the victim bought part of their field, and a well separates their properties. They agreed to use its water alternatively,” said Jaswant Singh, Bamitha police station incharge. “The accused had been drawing water for three days when the victim wanted to take his turn. This led to a dispute.”

The three men landed lathis and rods on Patel, who died while being taken to hospital by family, said Mr. Singh. The post mortem report has revealed he died due to excessive bleeding caused by injuries inflicted by hard and blunt objects.

The accused told the police that Patel assaulted them first, instigating them. “However, there are no witnesses to support this claim,” said Mr. Singh. The police have registered a case under section 302 [punishment for murder] of the Indian Penal Code, and were searching for the third accused.

Ruling out scarcity of water in the area, Mr. Singh said, “The dispute ensued following a breach of agreement. There is Ken river nearby, and the water level is good too. Still, farmers draw water from wells in the absence of canals.”

225,2020/02/28,"Selja writes to Haryana CM on ‘felling of trees, construction in Aravallis’","She suggests ways like increasing forest check post, deployment of more guards to keep check on this menace

Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja has written to Chief Minister Manohar Lal alleging that illegal felling of trees and construction on protected forest land was taking place in the Aravalli in the State.

Ms. Selja, also the Rajya Sabha MP, said the government should take adequate steps like increasing the number of forest check posts, effectively utilising drone technology and deploying patrolling guards to keep a check on this menace.

She said the State has the least forest cover of only 3.5% in the entire county, which needs to be saved at any cost. “The Aravalli forest covers less than 2% of the entire State and yet act as green lungs of the National Captial Region. It is a critical water recharge zone and also acts as a home to many wildlife species,” she added.

She said a large number of wildlife deaths have been taking place on National Highways — 48, 248 — and Gurgaon-Faridabad road. “Unlike other States, Haryana does not have a wildlife sanctuary. Therefore, the Haryana government should notify the wildlife corridor in the Aravallis as a wildlife sanctuary,” she wrote.

Ms. Selja added that the State government should also set up a task force to prepare a five-year roadmap to reach 5% legal forest cover by 2024 and 10% by 2030.

Meanwhile, Haryana Forest Minister Kanwar Pal said illegal constructions will not be allowed in the Aravallis and notices have been sent to those who have illegally built farmhouses.

The Minister was replying to a question raised by an MLA during the ongoing Budget session in Haryana Assembly on Thursday. He said drones are mapping from time to time to check illegal constructions in the Aravalli region, if any illegal construction is detected, it is demolished immediately.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/selja-writes-to-haryana-cm-on-felling-of-trees-construction-in-aravallis/article30936095.ece

A notification issued by the Department of Higher Education on Wednesday stated that Khallikote University had not functioned “as per true spirit of a cluster university, so necessity was felt to rather covert it into a unitary university”.

With its changed status, Khallikote University will now focus on intensive research activities, said the notification. Khallikote University was established in 2015 as a cluster university having jurisdiction over five institutions in Berhampur, Chhatrapur and Gopalpur. Its constituent colleges were Khallikote Autonomous College, SBRG Autonomous College, Binayak Acharya College of Berhampur, Government Science College of Chhatrapur and Gopalpur Degree College.

As the status of Khallikote University has been changed to unitary university, it will no more have these colleges under it. The recent notification has directed these five colleges to be disaffiliated from the Khallikote University and be re-affiliated to the Berhampur University with effect from June 1, 2020.

227,2020/02/28,Tribals to heighten protest over Ajodhya Hills hydel project,"Calcutta High Court Division Bench hearing the matter; July 2019 order ‘quashed’ permissions granted by the State govt.

Tribals opposed to a proposed hydel power project in the remote Ajodhya Hills in West Bengal have threatened to heighten their protests. Villagers across two gram panchayat areas in the hills — Baghmundi and Ajodhya — said that even after securing a legal victory in the Calcutta High Court against the proposed 1,000 MW Turga Pumped Storage Project in July 2019, the State government had challenged the order before a Division Bench.

Sushil Murmu, a petitioner in the case and a resident of one of the villages that will be affected by the proposed power plant, said that lakhs of trees will be cut down because of the project, which will impact the lives of those depending on forest produce. “We do not want this project at any cost,” Mr. Murmu, who was in Kolkata for a hearing of the matter, told The Hindu.

The case is being heard before the Division Bench of Justices Sanjib Banerjee and Kaushik Chandra.

Several irregularities

Justice Debangshu Basak, in the order of July 2019, had “quashed” the permissions granted by the State government for the implementation of the project by the gram sabha. The order has cited a number of irregularities in connection with the permission obtained by the State government for going ahead with the project.

Referring to the two resolutions filed by the gram sabha, on the basis of which the State government went ahead with the project, Justice Basak stated in his order that “none of them satisfies the tests laid down under the Act of 2006”. The Act in the order refers to Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006.

“One of the resolutions is unsigned by any villager. The other resolution shows an attendance and does not discuss the number of adults available in the village for the Gram Sabha convened. Requisite notice for convening the Gram Sabha are absent on record,” the order stated.

Forest Rights Act

According to the Forest Rights Act, 2006 if a forest land has to be acquired, then at least 50% of the affected population dependent on the land has to give consent in gram sabha, and a third of the villagers have to be women.

In the order, Justice Basak pointed put that in the absence of the “requisite materials being produced by the State despite opportunities given to the State to do so, the irresistible inference is that, appropriate procedure laid down under the Act of 2006 was not followed for the purpose of convening any meeting of any gram sabha of any village affected by the project”.

Rajen Tudu, a tribal leader from Purulia district said that the people who will be affected by the project are speaking to tribals from other parts of the State, and whatever be the fate of the legal case, the villagers would oppose the project.

Nakul Baske, another villager, said that the hydel power project on the river Tunga will affect 17 mouzas (a revenue collection unit) and more than 60 villages in the region. Mr. Baske said that the villagers have formed the Ajodia Buru Banchao Andolan Sanhati Mancha to protest against the power plant.

Livelihoods lost

The villagers protesting against the project refer to the 900 MW Purulia Pumped Storage Project (PPSP) that came up at Ajodhya Hills in the Baghmundi block of Purulia district around a decade ago. The villagers allege that it lead to massive loss of vegetation and hundreds of tribals lost their livelihoods.

The proposed project is to be implemented by the West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, which comes under the State government’s Department of Power. Despite attempts to reach Power Minister Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, no response could be ascertained from his end on the subject.

“The situation in this case is not only unfortunate, because instead of following the law and engaging as well taking proper consent of the people, which is a must under the Forest Rights Act, the state is manufacturing evidence of consent,” Santanu Chacraverti, an environmental activist concerned with the matter said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ed3ngs/article30935943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20180903174104-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tribals-to-heighten-protest-over-ajodhya-hills-hydel-project/article30935944.ece

229,2020/02/28,Bangladeshi girl asked to leave India requests reconsideration,"Visva-Bharati student had shared photos on Facebook of anti-CAA protests on campus

A Bangladeshi student of Visva-Bharati who has been asked to leave India for “anti-government” activities is learnt to have approached the Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office in Kolkata with a request to reconsider its decision.

The student, Afsara Anika Meem, 20, had shared pictures on Facebook of the anti-CAA protests that were held on the campus last December. She is a first-year student of design at the university’s Shilpa Sadan. She had not participated in the demonstrations but merely posted pictures.

Leading Kolkata lawyers Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and Shamim Ahmed are willing to take up her case in the Calcutta High Court but that will be possible only if the student agrees to go to court. “The order is absolutely illegal and vague. It does not disclose the particulars related to her supposed anti-government activities. The Constitution permits even a foreigner to be heard before being prosecuted. Such an opportunity was not given to her,” Mr. Ahmed told The Hindu.

‘Anti-government activities’

The Leave India Notice, issued to Ms. Meem by the Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office, said: “...she is found to have engaged in anti-government activities. And such activity being a breach of her visa, has thus committed visa violation. Therefore...the foreigner shall not remain in India and shall depart from India within 15 days of the receipt of the order.”

“Non-compliance will attract prosecution under Foreigners’ Act, 1946,” it added. The notice, dated February 14, is said to have been received by Ms. Meem on Wednesday.

230,2020/02/28,"Maharashtra may follow Bihar’s path on NRC, NPR","A resolution could be brought in this session itself, says a senior Sena leader

The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra may take a cue from the resolution passed by Nitish Kumar-led government in Bihar, which is in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), to not implement National Register of Citizenship (NRC) and to implement National Population Register (NPR) without changing the format of 2010.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has already announced that Maharashtra will not implement NRC in Maharashtra. He has also announced that no controversial columns in the NPR will be allowed.

Congress delegation

A delegation of Congress legislators, led by former MLA and senior party leader Naseem Khan, held a meeting with Mr. Thackeray on Thursday demanding that a resolution on the lines of Bihar government be bought in the Assembly. “The BJP is in power in Bihar. The party did not oppose the same there. It is clear that the party cannot have double standards and oppose the resolution in Maharashtra,” said Mr. Khan.

Also Read Towards cooperative federalism

Irrespective of what the BJP says or does, he added that it is important that all three parties in the MVA are unanimous on NRC and NPR. “We don’t want NPR. We want only census to be conducted here. We have demanded that a resolution on this line be brought in the ongoing Budget session of the State legislature,” he said.

After the meeting which lasted for over 25 minutes, Mr. Thackeray conveyed that he is positive over the demand.

According to sources within the Sena, the Bihar resolution has eased the way for the government. “It has weakened the BJP’s stand on these issues. The government is seriously thinking along these lines and a resolution pushing the same can be brought in this session itself,” said a senior Sena leader.

231,2020/02/28,"Elgaar Parishad: Maharashtra may set up parallel inquiry, says Home Minister","348 cases related to Bhima-Koregaon violence have been withdrawn so far: Anil Deshmukh

Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh informed the Legislative Council on Thursday that the State government was considering setting up a parallel inquiry commission under the Maharashtra Police Act to probe the Elgaar Parishad case.

He said he was disappointed over the manner in which the National Investigation Agency (NIA) took over the probe in the case. Mr. Deshmukh said he had received several representations complaining that the previous Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government branded the people who spoke against them as urban naxals.

The Centre last month transferred the probe into the Elgaar Parishad case from the Pune Police to the NIA, a move then criticised by the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government.

At a press conference before the start of the Budget session, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said he did not like the manner in which the probe was snatched from the State government and given to NIA.

Replying to a query on Thursday by Sharad Ranpise (Congress), Mr. Deshmukh said 348 cases related to the Bhima-Koregaon violence have been withdrawn by the State government so far.

“Of the total 649 cases filed against several people in the violence, 348 cases have been withdrawn so far. The rest of the cases will be withdrawn as and when the inquiry gets over,” he said.

Responding a query by Vinayak Mete (BJP) on whether cases filed against Maratha youths during the protests over reservation have been withdrawn, Mr. Deshmukh said, “Of the total 548 cases, 460 have been withdrawn so far. Similarly, of the five cases filed in connection with the agitation against the proposed Nanar refinery, the State government has so far withdrawn three cases.”

In reply to another question by Mr. Mete, the minister told the Council that he did not know if the inquiry commission looking into the Bhima-Koregaon violence had summoned NCP chief Sharad Pawar as a witness.

Mr. Mete had sought information from the home minister as to whether Mr. Pawar had been asked to be present before the Justice (retd.) J.N. Patel commission.

Mr. Pawar has reportedly alleged that pro-Hindutva forces were behind the violence which broke out near the Bhima-Koregaon war memorial in Pune district on January 1, 2018.

232,2020/02/28,‘Guardian members’ can take suo motu action against bogus therapists,"State council has appointed eight doctors to take action against bogus occupational therapists, physiotherapists

In an attempt to clamp down on bogus occupational therapists and physiotherapists, the Maharashtra State Council For Occupational Therapy and Physiotherapy has passed a resolution allowing specially-appointed guardian members to initiate suo motu action. The resolution was prompted by the increase in tip-offs against bogus practitioners as well as institutions over the past few months wherein the complainants refused to step forward to file complaints.

The council’s president, Dr. Sudeep Kale, told The Hindu the notification was issued on February 25. “We have been receiving many reports of bogus practitioners across the State but we could not act unless there was an official compliant filed with us. With this new resolution, the specially-appointed regional members are in a position to act on their own when they get a tip-off,” said Dr. Kale. Action could mean sending a show-cause notice to the practitioners or the institute or initiating proceedings along with the police.

While five doctors have been appointed as guardian members for physiotherapy in various regions such as Mumbai and Konkan, Marathwada, Pune, Vidarbha and North Maharashtra, three doctors have been appointed as guardian members for occupational therapy. These doctors can take action based on tip-offs.

Occupational therapy is an allied health field which uses intervention and assessment to help maintain activities that one would want or need to do everyday. Physiotherapy, also an allied health field, uses various modalities like electrotherapy, joint mobilisation etc. to treat conditions like acute pain, soft tissue injuries, cartilage damage among others. According to Dr. Kale, the council has received many complaints about bogus practitioners listed on online marketplaces. “These practitioners are booked online for home visits. We have scanned their credentials and realise that they have bogus certificates,” said Dr. Kale. The council is in the process of issuing five show-cause notices to people listed on such platforms.

Maharashtra has 800 registered occupational therapists and five institutions recognised under the council to offer the four-and-a-half-year Bachelor of Occupational Therapy course. There are 8,700 registered physiotherapists in the State and 48 colleges under the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences and nearly eight under deemed universities recognised to offer the Bachelor of Physiotherapy course.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/guardian-members-can-take-suo-motu-action-against-bogus-therapists/article30936981.ece

234,2020/02/28,Ranji Trophy semifinals | Gutsy Bengal locks horns with star-studded Karnataka,"Home medium-pacers run into the visitors’ mighty batting array

In a season of miracles, Bengal — consisting of some low-profile players — is talked about for its high-impact performances. Can Bengal do it again against a top opponent like Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy semifinals beginning at the Eden Gardens here on Saturday?

The last time the two teams met, in a group match in Bengaluru in 2015, Karnataka out-batted Bengal in the first innings. This time Bengal will be keen not to let Karnataka, which has all bases covered and is studded with four international players, repeat its performance of 2015.

On a greenish track, the Bengal medium-pacers — possibly the trio of Ishan Porel, Mukesh Kumar and Akash Deep (making a comeback after missing the last match due to injury) — will have to find ways to keep the visiting batsmen quiet.

A look at the formidable Karnataka batting order would leave any opposition awe-struck.

K.L. Rahul’s return has bolstered the tourists’ batting, which also comprises captain Karun Nair, Manish Pandey, R. Samarth, Devdutt Padikkal and K.V. Siddharth in the upper half.

It is a ‘good (selection) headache’ for Karun.

The batting is complemented by a sound bowling attack, which has variety and experience. Abhimanyu Mithun, Prasidh Krishna, Ronit More in the pace department and spinners K. Gowtham, Shreyas Gopal (both all-rounders) and J. Suchith have the ability to trouble any side on any surface.

Karnataka, which is making its third straight semifinal appearance, has gone through ups and downs but has found ways to fight back. “Those are the signs of a champion team. You find ways to come out of difficult situations and you find people to step up,” said Karun.

Here, Karnataka and Bengal stand on the same ground. Bengal, which reached the semifinals after two years, displayed a new brand of fearless cricket this season under the stewardship of coach Arun Lal. It may throw the toughest challenge to Karnataka yet.

Its disciplined seamers, useful middle-order batsmen — the seasoned Manoj Tiwary, Anustup Majumder, Shreevats Goswami — and spin all-rounders such as Shahbaz Ahmed and Arnab Nandi have scripted some unbelievable turnarounds.

The bunch has understood the benefit of playing as a unit and will try to continue the momentum. “We are playing good cricket. It's about continuing to do so,” Bengal captain Abhimanyu Easwaran summed up his team’s approach.

The teams

Bengal: Abhimanyu Easwaran (Capt.), Manoj Tiwary, Anustup Majumder, Shreevats Goswami (wk), Sudip Chatterjee, Abhishek Raman, Koushik Ghosh, Arnab Nandi, Shahbaz Ahmed, Agniv Pan (wk), Ishan Porel, Shreyan Chakraborty, Nilkantha Das, Mukesh Kumar, Golam Mostafa and Akash Deep.

235,2020/02/28,NZ vs IND Test | Mohinder Amarnath backs Kohli to come good,"In New Zealand, you have to play the way Rahane does, says the veteran

One of India’s finest batsmen, Mohinder Amarnath hoped Virat Kohli would come good in the second Test against New Zealand starting on Saturday in Christchurch. Kohli has aggregated a mere 201 runs in nine innings across all formats with just one half- century.

“It is not that they have not played there. They have done well earlier but the difference here is that Virat has not performed,” said Amarnath, in town on a private visit. Another reason, he emphasised, was the absence of K. L. Rahul from the team. “Rahul has done well. He’s been the man in form. And you have to play the man in form. I am surprised he is not playing in Tests in this series. He would have been better than trying someone out.

Interesting read: Kohli’s message to Pujara & Co: Being cautious won't help us

“If you see India’s performance overseas in the last two years Virat has been the key. Sometimes luck doesn’t favour you. But I’m sure he’ll come good in the second Test. He’s a great player. He has the technique to shine in all conditions. All great players adjust themselves very quickly and Virat knows what he is supposed to. He won’t fail in too many innings.”

Amarnath, who excelled in testing conditions away from home, insisted there was a technical aspect too. “The technique of Indian batsmen is good on harder pitches. Or on Indian pitches where the ball is not doing much in the air or off the surface. In New Zealand, you have to play the way Ajinkya (Rahane) does. I really like the way he bats. You have to play very tight and with soft hands, especially when you are defending.”

Soft hands

In Amarnath’s opinion, the batsmen were, “jabbing” at the ball. “When the ball takes an edge it carries. Not the case when you play with soft hands. When you play tight you may miss connecting those deliveries. The technical aspect of batting has been the reason for the failure in this Test. You have to adjust. You can’t play in your flamboyant style even if it is your natural game.”

Bounce, he noted, was not the problem. “You can cope with the bounce. It’s the seam movement and the swing where the technique comes into play. You have to be there all the time and concentrate hard. Not that they don’t do but the shortcomings show obviously. The bat is mostly away from the body. If the ball seams and swings in the second Test, too, the it will be a tough test for the Indians.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/h59mgg/article30944839.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-ViratKohli,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-second-test-in-christchurch/article30944784.ece
236,2020/02/28,ICC Women’s T20 World Cup | England beats Pakistan,"SA hands Thailand a thrashing

England kept its hopes alive in the ICC women's T20 World Cup with a 42-run win over Pakistan here on Friday.

Captain Heather Knight once again led from the front with 62 in its 158 for seven — her sixth consecutive half-century. In reply, Pakistan was all out for 116.

Knight, who hit eight 4s and a 6, was playing her 100th T20. Natalie Sciver chipped in with 36 and Fran Wilson made 22, with Aiman Anwer taking three wickets.

Some tight England bowling pinned Pakistan down and at the half-way stage, it was struggling at 51 for five. Aliya Riaz did her best to accelerate the run rate in a 41-run cameo.

“We probably would have liked a little but more (total), but the wicket was slow,” said Knight. “Our bowling and fielding was pretty good, but there's always room for improvement.”

Earlier, South Africa clubbed the highest total in the World Cup as it thrashed Thailand by 113 runs.

Proteas skipper Dane van Niekerk won the toss and opted to bat, with her team building 195 for three, anchored by powerful opener Lizelle Lee's 101.

It was the biggest score in the tournament's history, beating India's 194 for five against New Zealand in 2018. In reply, Thailand was all out for 82.

“The box we wanted to tick today was to take the win,” said van Niekerk. “Credit to Lizelle for that century... but I think our fielding let us down a little bit today.”

The scores: England 158/7 in 20 overs (Natalie Sciver 36, Heather Knight 62; Aiman Anwer 3/30) bt Pakistan 116 in 19.4 overs (Aliya Riaz 41; Anya Shrubsole 3/25, Sarah Glenn 3/15).

South Africa 195/3 in 20 overs (Lizelle Lee 101, Sune Luus 61) bt Thailand 82 in 19.1 overs (Onnicha Kamchomphu 26; Shabnim Ismail 3/8, Luus 3/15).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jxsbzx/article30944758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29LEE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-womens-t20-world-cup-england-beats-pakistan/article30944759.ece

Asked about India’s inability to make short work of the tail, a factor that has often haunted this side, Shastri said: “It has been a problem in the last year or so. We’ve had a chat on this. We have been over-aggressive or at times too defensive. We will look to address it.”

Ashwin’s batting

On R. Ashwin, Shastri observed: “He is a world-class bowler. If anything, he will be disappointed with the way he has batted. He would want to improve his batting. We have had conversations on this.”

On having to choose between Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja for a place in the eleven, Shastri said: “We will see how much of a role a spinner has, first of all. How many overs you think he is going to bowl in the game. Is there going to be something for him on day four or five.

“Will the second innings be that important. Do you need him more in the first innings. Is his batting going to count? Is his fielding going to count? Is his overall fitness going to count? Those are areas you look into.”

Shastri felt a defeat, such as the one in the first Test, was sometimes good for a team. “I always believe when you are on a run like we were, a shake-up like that is good because it opens your mind-set.”

He said: “When you are on the road winning all the time, or you have not tasted defeat, you can have a closed mind-set. I thought we were a little conservative and tentative in that first Test. Winning away from the sub-continent in red-ball cricket is always difficult. You need to adapt.”

Pacers ready to strike

Talking about the Indian pacemen, Shastri exuded confidence. “Bumrah is very close to getting a five-for or a six-for, might happen tomorrow. Similarly with Shami, so nothing to worry about. The Indian bowlers have to be more patient, bowl more in the right areas and create pressure.”

Looking at the second Test, Shastri is not short on optimism.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/mi625v/article30944625.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29KOHLI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/new-zealand-vs-india-second-test-in-christchurch-head-coach-ravi-shastri-press-conference/article30944626.ece
239,2020/02/28,NZ vs IND second Test: Batsmen will have to step up for India to draw level,"Ishant out with injury, Umesh likely to come in; Kiwis all set to unleash pace power

The Hagley Oval is flanked by lush green gardens that mirror the city’s serene and pleasant ambience. However, things will not be remotely as peaceful for the Indians on a grass-laden surface as they strive to square the series in the second Test beginning on Saturday.

A big game

Also at stake would be 60 points of the World Test Championship. It’s a big game for both sides.

Interesting read: New Zealand vs India: Why India pacers struggled in Wellington

The Test has not begun and India has already been hit by an injury blow. Ishant Sharma’s ankle injury — picked up during the Ranji season — has flared up again and the lanky paceman will miss the second Test.

Ishant was, by far, the best Indian bowler in the first Test and returned a five-wicket innings haul. Umesh Yadav, sharp but not as tall as Ishant, is expected to come in.

While Ishant relies on bounce and an off-stump line, Umesh, a handful with his pace, does damage with reverse-swing. Umesh pitches the ball up and can bowl out-swingers with the new ball.

The Indian batsmen will have to approach the Test with a fresh mind-set. At Wellington, they appeared under a mental siege. They were neither convincing in defence as the ball seamed around nor able to pierce the infield. Simply put, the Indian batsmen could not take the challenge to the Kiwi pacemen.

In fact, apart from Mayank Agarwal’s second-innings half-century, none was able to find the balance between aggression and defence.

Sweet memories

The Kiwis comprehend the green, seaming track here and the conditions well. In the Test against Sri Lanka, here in 2018, New Zealand won by a whopping 423 runs. Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Neil Wagner were red hot.

And that was a Test where New Zealand, asked to bat, was dismissed for 178 in its first innings. So the toss alone does not determine outcomes in these parts.

A team has to play good cricket, adapt to the conditions. The batsmen, including the young Prithvi Shaw, have to wait for the ball to come to them, and play late.

The Indian batting could be under greater scrutiny in the Test with the Kiwis likely to play four specialist seamers plus Colin de Grandhomme’s teasing swing.

Kohli & Co. will have to face off against left-armer Wagner, who employs short-pitched bowling with telling effect, both over and round the wicket, often from wide of the crease.

Before Wagner enters the picture, the Indians will have to cope with the left-right swing bowling of Boult and Southee. Then there is the off-stump line and bounce of Kyle Jamieson.

On a seaming track, firm pushes in the `V’ rather than big drives are more productive. If the length is short, the cut and the pull can fetch runs. It does help if the back-swing is straight.

Know your off-stump

The Indian batsmen have to play and leave, know where their off-stump is. They also need to display footwork, balance in the stance, and a still head. It’s important that the batsman covers for movement.

Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami did not bowl the right length in Wellington. Both should pitch the ball up for it to swing. And land on a good length for the sphere to seam around.

The Indians have a fight on their hands on what could be a seam-trap.

240,2020/02/28,Ranji Trophy semifinals: Gujarat or Saurashtra | Who will shade the derby?,"It is a toss up between Parthiv’s Gujarat vs Unadkat’s Saurashtra

The past decade has seen the State of Gujarat at the forefront on the cricket field, with the likes of Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravindra Jadeja and Jasprit Bumrah having risen through the ranks. The rise of these superstars has also led to their respective sides reaching new highs in domestic cricket.

While Gujarat — Bumrah’s home team — clinched its maiden Ranji Trophy in 2016-17, Saurashtra — the team of Kathiawari cavaliers Jadeja and Pujara — has made it to the final thrice in the last seven editions.

No wonder then that the Gujarat derby at the Saurashtra Cricket Association stadium over the next five days will decide one of the two finalists of the Ranji Trophy. With the Gujarati giants set to take each other on, the derby overshadowed the “limited DRS” build-up on the pre-match day.

Epitome

Both teams will be without the three stars, but they have captains who epitomise “leading from the front”.

Parthiv Patel may not have had the best of seasons with the willow but the manner in which he has shaped this team over the last decade is admirable to say the least. His hundred versus Goa in the last week’s quarterfinal would give Gujarat the belief that the veteran is peaking at the right time.

Jaydev Unadkat, meanwhile, has been relentless all through the season and emerged as the leading wicket-taker with 55 scalps. Having taken over the reigns from Jaydev Shah midway through last season, Unadkat has ensured Saurashtra’s lesser-known stars have become a formidable force.

Settled look

The fact that the teams have a settled look — with the core intact for at least three years — has helped the two leaders. Both Parthiv and Unadkat would be hoping that their teammates rise to the occasion when it matters the most.

Despite qualifying for the knockouts for four seasons in a row, Parthiv & Co. would be eager to book a place in the final for the first time since their breakthrough season in 2016-17. Saurashtra, meanwhile, is keen on making it to the final for the second season in succession.

The teams

Saurashtra: Jaydev Unadkat (Capt.), Harvik Desai, Snell Patel (wk), Avi Barot (wk), Vishvaraj Jadeja, Sheldon Jackson, Arpit Vasavada, Chirag Jani, Prerak Mankad, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, Kamlesh Makwana, Kishan Parmar, Samarth Vyas, Kushang Patel, Chetan Sakariya, and Parth Bhut.

Gujarat: Parthiv Patel (Capt.), Priyank Panchal, Samit Gohel, Bhargav Merai, Manprit Juneja, Chirag Gandhi, Roosh Kalaria, Chintan Gaja, Arzan Nagwaswalla, Siddharth Desai, Rujul Bhatt, Dhruv Raval (wk), Kshitij Patel, and Tejas Patel.

241,2020/02/28,"Can’t take any team lightly, will shift focus to semifinal after SL clash: Harmanpreet","“I know we have qualified, but the next game is still crucial for us.”

The Indian women’s team captain Harmanpreet Kaur on Friday insisted that her side will take its final group game of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup against Sri Lanka seriously before shifting focus on to the semifinals.

India became the first side to sail through to the knockout stages after securing wins against hosts and defending champions Australia, as well as Bangladesh and New Zealand, in the first week of the tournament.

“I know we have qualified, but the next game is still crucial for us. We will be taking Sri Lanka very seriously,” Harmanpreet said.

“They’ve been doing well. I know they haven’t won a game but they were almost there on both occasions. We will be taking it very seriously before we start thinking about the semi-finals,” she added

Victory over Sri Lanka on Saturday would see India top Group A and head into the semifinals high on confidence.

“We try to take every wicket in all of our games. Every wicket is an important one at this level. We just have to try and stick to our plan, especially to get out the likes of Chamari Athapaththu early. That will be crucial.” Harmanpreet said.

Sri Lanka have arguably had the toughest start to the tournament having lost to New Zealand and Australia in their opening two games, and now in-form India awaits then in their third Group A fixture.

But Sri Lanka gave Australia a mighty scare in Perth by reducing the hosts to 10 for three in the early overs.

Sri Lanka veteran Shashikala Siriwardena – who will retire from all formats of the game at the end of the tournament after 17 years – is proud of her team’s fight so far, but admitted that it would be a big disappointment if they fail to register a win in her farewell tournament.

“We want to take victories in our next two games. We did well against Australia and New Zealand, but we couldn’t turn it into a win,” Siriwardena said.

“We have to do what we have done well in previous matches against India but at the same time we need to correct the mistakes we are repeating, especially in fielding,” she added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/17v5qd/article30941094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARMANPREET,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cant-take-any-team-lightly-will-shift-focus-to-semifinal-after-sl-clash-harmanpreet/article30941095.ece
242,2020/02/28,"Ishant down with pain in right ankle, doubtful starter for second Test","Ishant joined the team before the series after recovering sufficiently from a grade three tear on his right ankle.

The Indian team’s worries ahead of the second Test against New Zealand increased after senior-most pacer Ishant Sharma skipped Friday’s practice session due to pain in his right ankle, making him a doubtful starter for the game.

Ishant came for practice but apparently felt discomfort after which he was taken for precautionary scan of his right ankle.

The reports are awaited and if Ishant is ruled unfit, then either Umesh Yadav or Navdeep Saini will take his place. Umesh looks a more likely candidate at the moment because of his experience of 45 Tests.

Ishant, who was the best Indian bowler on view with figures of 5/68 in 22.2 overs against New Zealand in Wellington, joined the team before the series after recovering sufficiently from a grade three tear on his right ankle sustained during a Ranji Trophy game against Vidarbha.

He was expected to be out for six weeks but apparently made a “miraculous recovery” at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) under physio Ashish Kaushik.

243,2020/02/28,"Shaw is fit and ready to go, confirms Shastri","Shaw missed Thursday’s training session due to swelling on his left foot.

Young opener Prithvi Shaw has recovered from a foot injury and is “ready to go” in the second and final Test against New Zealand starting here on Saturday, India head coach Ravi Shastri has said.

Shaw missed Thursday’s training session due to swelling on his left foot, increasing the Indian team management’s worries ahead of the second Test.

But the good news for India was that Shaw was back in the nets on Friday with an extensive session under the watchful eyes of Shastri and got some valuable tips from skipper Virat Kohli.

“Prithvi is ready to go,” Shastri said, clearing the air on the opener’s fitness.

Shaw had a poor outing in the first Test in Wellington, getting dismissed cheaply in both the innings.

244,2020/02/28,Women’s T20 WC: India look to iron out batting woes against SL in final group game,"India’s unpredictable middle-order has repeatedly squandered good starts to eventually settle for low scores.

A semifinal berth secured, the unbeaten Indian women’s cricket team would look to address some of its batting issues in the final Group A match against a deflated Sri Lanka in the ICC T20 World Cup here on Saturday.

The Indians are on a roll, having easily sealed their semifinal berth with wins over defending champions Australia, Bangladesh and New Zealand. The Lankans, on the other hand, are out of the semifinal race following two losses so far.

While India beat hosts Australia by 17 runs in the tournament opener, they defeated Bangladesh by 18 runs before eking out a narrow four-run victory over the White Ferns on Thursday.

And come Saturday, the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side would look to end its group engagements on a high when it takes on the islanders.

But the Indians definitely have a few things to worry about, especially their below-par show with the bat, going into the business end of the tournament.

In all the previous three outings, India failed to put on big scores on the board. They managed just 132 runs against Australia, 142 against Bangladesh and 133 vs New Zealand.

India’s unpredictable middle-order has repeatedly squandered good starts to eventually settle for low scores.

In all the three matches, the bowling unit came to India’s rescue and the bailed the side out.

Heavily reliant on the brilliance of a 16-year-old Shafali Verma, the Indian middle-order has cut a sorry figure so far and it’s time senior pros like Harmanpreet and Veda Krishnamurthy step up and take the responsibility.

Opener Smriti Mandhana too has failed to join the party so far.

Verma has been impressive at the top registering scores of 29, 39 and 46 for a total of 114 from three games. But it’s high time she converts the starts into big scores.

Skipper Harmanpreet has rued the inability of her batters to capitalise on good starts and cautioned them against making “silly mistakes” in the knock-out rounds.

“It’s a great feeling when your team performs day in day out. Still we made the same mistakes after a good first 10 overs, we got a good start but couldn’t carry the momentum,” Kaur had said.

“We can’t make silly mistakes with harder games coming up. Shafali (Verma) is giving us good starts, her initial runs are crucial for us,” she added.

The Indian bowling, however, has been phenomenal in the tournament so far and played a vital role in their smooth entry into the last-four round.

Leg-spinner Poonam Yadav has been the star performer for India, picking up eight wickets so far, including match-winning effort of 4 for 19 against Australia.

She has been complimented well by the likes of Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Deepti Sharma and pacer Shikha Pandey.

Young Shafali was adjudged the player of the match for scoring a 34-ball 46 and the 16-year-old was elated with her performance.

“Feeling good, very happy with the performance, want to continue doing this. I waited for the loose balls and converted those,” said Shafali.

245,2020/02/28,Ranji Trophy semifinal | Karnataka aims to make Bengal see stars,"Rahul’s presence makes it near full-strength line-up

The availability of the world-class K.L. Rahul for the Ranji Trophy semifinal against Bengal gives Karnataka a big boost, says all-rounder K. Gowtham.

Rahul joins the likes of Manish Pandey, Karun Nair and Devdutt Padikkal to form a formidable batting line-up to take on Bengal at Kolkata on Saturday. Mayank Agarwal, who is part of the Indian Test side in New Zealand, is the only notable absentee in an otherwise full-strength unit.

Interesting read: K.L. Rahul enters record books in wicketkeeping gloves

Big boost

“Rahul coming back is a big boost. We will definitely look to capitalise on that,” Gowtham said at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Thursday.

""If Bengal starts thinking about the big names in our squad, they’ll end up putting pressure on themselves.

“There’s no doubt that having world-class players like Rahul gives us more confidence, but on any given day, it’s about going out there and expressing yourself,” he said.

Gowtham was all praise for the character that the side showed in the quarterfinal against Jammu & Kashmir. Karnataka bounced back from a precarious situation to steal the first-innings lead, before Gowtham wreaked havoc with a seven-for haul in the second innings to seal a 167-run victory.

“More than the win, the character we showed in defending the 200-odd first-innings total was great. Jammu & Kashmir was around 100 for two on a batting-friendly pitch, but the way our pacers and (left-arm spinner) J. Suchith bowled showed the character of the team.

“And the way we batted in the second innings (Karnataka made 316) — if we can continue doing that, we can bring the Ranji Trophy back home,” the 31-year-old said.

Karnataka will look to overcome the semifinal stumbling block it faced in the previous two editions of the tournament.

Almost there...

Incidentally, Eden Gardens was the venue where the unit suffered a narrow five-run, last-four defeat to eventual champion Vidarbha in 2017. A year later, on home turf, Karnataka was knocked out in the semifinal by Saurashtra.

Interesting read: Kapil doffs hat to Kiwi consistency

And, India has won just one Test in this country in a span of 30 years. It’s a demanding ask.

The New Zealanders are expected to play an all-seam attack here with the lion-hearted Neil Wagner coming in for Ajaz Patel.

Also read Rahane comments: NZ vs IND second Test: Confuse the Kiwis, Rahane’s advice to colleagues

Varied attack

On view will be a high-voltage Kiwi pace attack with Wagner, the hustler with his short-pitched stuff, joining the classic left-right new-ball pair of Trent Boult and Tim Southee, not to forget the lift and movement of Kyle Jamieson or the control and swing of Colin de Grandhomme.

Also read: Prithvi skips practice with swollen foot, call to be taken on Friday

India is likely to make one change. Ravindra Jadeja is expected to come in for R. Ashwin.

It’s essentially a move to strengthen India’s batting with the left-handed Jadeja becoming solid and being able to construct an innings with judicious strokeplay in recent years.

With the ball Jadeja offers control, holds one end up, can pick up a wicket or two. In the second innings Jadeja, if the ball grips, could be a bigger factor. To top it all, he is among the finest all-round fielders in the world.

To be fair to Ashwin he bowled well at Wellington, doing the difficult job against the wind, getting some drift and dip and scalping three. If India had not run into problems with its batting, he could have held his place.

But then, India finds itself in a situation where it needs to strengthen its batting in order to give its bowlers sufficient runs for a victory push. And this is where the drying up of runs from Ashwin’s willow has made him vulnerable. The team looks at him as an all-rounder.

Also read: The influencers in Indian cricket in the last half century

It’s a tough call and if Ashwin finds himself dropped, he could consider himself unlucky. However, given the team’s needs away from the sub-continent, he has to rediscover his batting mojo.

India will be hoping to win the toss and insert New Zealand. On a fresh, green track, the Indian pace attack could sting. However, Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami have to pitch the ball up and allow it to swing. If they are looking for movement off the seam, they have to bowl good length, not back of a length.

Tougher path

And, if India loses the toss, it faces a much tougher path to victory. The side has to find the balance between offence and defence.

The Indian batsmen cannot afford to get into a defensive rut and allow the Kiwi bowlers to dictate play. Kohli and his men have to win the mind game. The Indians will have to push the New Zealand pacemen off their game-plan and do so without being reckless.

The key to succeeding on the New Zealand pitches is to play the ball late. These are not the sort of conditions where you hurry your shots or go at the ball with hard hands; there is a cordon waiting for just that.

The advantage of playing the ball late is that you cover for the movement and have the opportunity to place your strokes. Just watch how Kane Williamson bats in these conditions.

He plays the ball late and without any exaggerated movement. Everything about his batsmanship is measured, crisp and precise. And he times the ball.

Milder winds

The wind at the Hagley Oval is not expected to be as big a factor as at the Basin Reserve. So the batsmen would not have problems holding the bat and adjusting their back-lift against the stiff breeze.

New Zealand’s strength is planning and execution. India has to counter the Kiwi moves.

248,2020/02/28,"Rash driving, overspeeding by private buses continue","‘Private buses are accountable only to the Regional Transport Officers and there is a lack of redress mechanism for them unlike TNSTC buses’

Jennifer (name changed), a 25-year-old woman working in Coimbatore, boarded a private bus to Uppilipalayam on February 25 near Coimbatore Medical College Hospital. Having boarded the bus, she noticed that the bus was overspeeding to the extent where a senior citizen lost her balance while boarding a bus, she claimed.

When asked by a fellow passenger to drive slowly, the bus conductor allegedly replied in a rude manner and was unfazed when the passenger threatened to click photos on her mobile phone. Narrating this incident to The Hindu, Ms. Jennifer said that she had lodged an online police complaint regarding this incident, saying that such rash driving could lead to fatal accidents if remained unchecked. Nearly two weeks ago, a video of a driver and conductor in a private bus indulging in a physical altercation with an alleged passenger near Coimbatore Railway Station went viral on social media.

Incidents like these highlight the issue of rash driving by private bus drivers in the city. Unlike Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) buses, private bus operators seemed to have far less accountability, making them prone to indulge in violations.

K. Kathirmathiyon, consumer activist and member of the District Road Safety Committee, said that the private buses are accountable only to the Regional Transport Officers in the city and that there is a lack of redress mechanism for private buses unlike TNSTC buses. Many private buses stop in particular bus stops for a higher duration, with some even choosing to turn off their engines, in a bid to have more passengers aboard. “To compensate for the time lost (in bus stops), private buses tend to overspeed,” he observed.

V. Duraikannan, president of Coimbatore District Bus Owners Association (South), conceded that there are stray incidents of rash driving and rude behaviour in private buses. He pointed to a shortage in drivers and conductors for private buses in the city, which affects the efficiency of these buses. “The drivers are provided with counselling to not indulge in overspeeding as they have to pay a heavy fine amount,” Mr. Duraikannan said.

As many as 154 private buses and nearly 100 private bus operators are functioning in the city, according to Mr. Duraikannan. The association will consider setting up a grievance cell soon, where passengers shall complain to the higher officials regarding issues in private buses. “That way, we could inform the operators to take further action,” he said.

The major concern for private buses, which results in overspeeding, are the lack of changes in time duration for buses in spite of traffic congestions and diversions, Mr. Duraikannan said. “The Regional Transport Authority (District Collector K. Rajamani) must pass an order suspending the timings for buses till the flyover construction works are ongoing,” he said, noting that the construction works are a major cause of traffic congestions and diversions. Mr. Duraikannan claimed that suspension of timings will not affect the availability of buses to passengers and could reduce cases of overspeeding.

Mr. Kathirmathiyon said that there are certain routes in the city which are not possible to ply within the fixed timings. “The bus owners could appeal to the Collector regarding the timings during road safety meetings,” he noted.

An official from Transport Department said that no strict disciplinary action is initiated against drivers and conductors by private bus operators in case of violations.

249,2020/02/28,200 small farmers empowered through Trustea training programmes,"About 200 women smallholder farmers (SHFs), associated with two bought leaf factories Tamil Nadu’s Nilgiris district are being steadily empowered through training on implementation of Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs).

In a press release, Trustea – India’s sustainable tea programme, said that introduced in 2013, the programme has ensured that more than 14,000 smallholder farmers, including 3,500 women farmers in South India have access to formal training opportunities on sustainable farm practices focused on environment, safety and livelihoods. “The Trustea programme, a voluntary certification, backed by Unilever is an India specific sustainability code for the Tea industry with a multi-stakeholder model,” the press release said.

“This programme comes at an opportune time, when an increasing number of women-owned businesses are slated to contribute to the country’s economy, with rural agripreneurs identified as a distinct segment - working as a critical catalyst to modernise agriculture and the rural ecosystem,” the press release added.

The training programmes include a range of topics, including the usage of water, appropriate use of fertilizers for effective nutrient management, soil testing, safe handling of agro-chemicals, use of PPE (personal protective equipment) while applying fertilizers and integrated pest management.

Trustea’s interventions have helped to reduce fertilizer application by almost 30% in Thummanatty, while helping a small farmer. They also helped to eliminate spraying herbicides near waterbodies in order to eliminate the possibility of water contamination.

Through the interventions, the SHFs are complying with a notified wage of ₹ 328/day for tea workers, while for plucking, which is the preferred mode of employment for workers, the wage is fixed at ₹ 6-7/kg of green leaf.

Since most of the small farmers do not have irrigation and rely on rain, the programme has also helped to guide them to follow the practices of water conservation by adopting sustainable agricultural practices, the press release from Trustea said.

Ashish Gupta, Procurement Director- South Asia, Unilever, said that sustainable agricultural practices can also help in addressing climate change.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/la5un7/article30939006.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB28LEAF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/200-small-farmers-empowered-through-trustea-training-programmes/article30939007.ece
250,2020/02/28,Skill training for rescued child workers,"As many as 50 children at a special centre run at Vellalore learnt to make glider plane models using plastic during a session held on Wednesday.

The centre, which is part of the National Child Labour Project (NCLP), has children aged between nine and 14 and all of them are rescued child workers or school drop outs.

According to T.V. Vijayakumar, project director of NCLP, students from Sri Ramakrishna Engineering College explained to the children about aeroplaces and how the planes function. The half-a-day session learnt the basics of aeroplanes. They also distributed resources to the children so that they could try making glider plane models.

Mr. Vijayakumar says 250 children in the nine NCLP special centres in the district get to learn several handworks. For instance, the teachers at the schools taught them to make products out of coconut shells. Similarly, they have made several greeting cards. Three years ago, the students in the special centre got to see a real aeroplane.

“We are planning some special programmes for June 12 which is the Child Labour Day. We want to give the children exposure to different fields and skills so that they are motivated to pursue higher education,” he said.

252,2020/02/28,Delhi water doesn’t conform to ISO standards,"BIS files report in Supreme Court after 11 samples were tested.

None of the drinking water samples randomly collected from across Delhi conforms to the ISO standards of purity in one or more requirements, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) informed the Supreme Court on Friday.

Of a total of 11 domestic piped drinking water samples, one is from the residence of Union Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Pawan. The sample taken from his 12, Janpath residence failed on the parameters of odour and aluminium and coliform contamination. The BIS functions under the Ministry of Consumer Affairs.

“It was found that all the drinking water samples drawn from Delhi were non-conforming in one or more requirements as per IS 10500:2012 [specification for drinking water],” concluded a 64-page report filed by the Department of Laboratory Policy and Planning Department of the BIS, represented by advocates Vipin Nair, Karthik Jayshankar and Anshuman Bahadur.

The samples were sent for testing at the laboratories accredited to the National Accreditation Board. The test reports are on record in the court.

On January 13, the court ordered the pollution control board and the BIS to conduct a random check of water quality in Delhi and submit a report in a month. The BIS report said it drew samples from various locations across Delhi and 20 other State capitals under an integrated scheme.

On Friday, a Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta deputed another joint inspection by the Central Pollution Control Board, the BIS and Delhi Jal Board. The Delhi government has maintained that potable water in the national capital is safe. The re-inspection has been ordered for further clarity.

The court, however, asked the BIS to suggest measures to improve water purity and asked it for reports on the samples taken from the other cities. The court said one of the main reasons for contamination in Delhi was leaking pipes.

In its report, ‘Report of Testing of Piped Drinking Water Samples Drawn from Delhi’, filed on February 19 in the court, the BIS said it had focused on water supplied by city municipalities, corporations, water boards, local bodies. It said the samples were sent for testing against 47 out of 48 parameters (excluding radiological test). “These covered organoleptic and physical test, chemical test, toxic substance, bacteriological, virological and biological test,” the report said.

“Coliform contamination occurs when faecal matter gets mixed with treated water supplied to consumers... Ultimately, consumers face dangerous gastrointestinal diseases, like dysentery, as a result of this contamination,” Mr. Nair argued.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4xdjk9/article30945551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28DELHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-water-doesnt-conform-to-iso-standards/article30945552.ece

A 60-year-old rag picker, Ayyub Shabbir on Friday became the latest victim of the violence that has gripped the city since Sunday, taking the death toll in the clashes to 42. Three other persons succumbed at the Guru Tegh Bahadur (GTB) Hospital to injuries sustained during the clashes.

Senior IPS officer S.N. Shrivastava has been given additional charge of Commissioner of Police, Delhi from March 1 until “further orders,” an order issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said. Present Commissioner of Police Amulya Patnaik is set to retire on February 29. Mr. Shrivastava, a 1985-batch IPS officer was recalled from the CRPF last week following the riots in northeast Delhi.

Friday’s death calls into question the Delhi Police spokesman’s claims that the situation in the northeastern part of the city was “under control”.

Shabbir’s son Salman said he died of head injuries while being taken to hospital. “I had cautioned my father against going out today [Friday] but he said the situation is normal now and we cannot stay inside for long and not earn anything,” a grief-stricken Mr. Salman said.

Four other persons succumbed to injuries. “The total deaths in our hospital stands at 38 [of this, 28 were brought dead and 10 people died during treatment]. Patients have come in with burns, stab, blunt assault, and gun wounds. We have received 215 patients from February 24 onwards,” an official at the GTB Hospital said.

254,2020/02/28,"HC stays proceedings against Kejriwal, others in defamation case by BJP leader","Mr. Kejriwal and three others have challenged a sessions court order.

The Delhi High Court Friday stayed proceedings in a defamation case against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and other AAP leaders for their remarks over alleged deletion of voters’ names from electoral rolls in the national capital.

Justice Anu Malhotra, while staying the proceedings in the trial court, issued notice to the Delhi government and BJP leader Rajeev Babbar, who moved the defamation complaint on behalf of the party’s Delhi unit, seeking their responses by April 23.

Mr. Kejriwal and three others – Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Rajya Sabha member Sushil Kumar Gupta and party leaders Manoj Kumar and Atishi Marlena – have challenged a sessions court order which upheld a magisterial court’s decision to summon them as accused in the complaint.

They have sought quashing of the magisterial court’s March 15, 2019 and sessions court’s January 28 this year orders.

Mr. Babbar, in his complaint, has sought proceedings against them for “harming” the reputation of BJP by blaming it for the deletion of the names of voters from electoral rolls here.

He had claimed that the AAP leaders, during a press conference held in December 2018, alleged that on the directions of the BJP names of 30 lakh voters from Bania, Poorvanchali and the Muslim community had been deleted by the Election Commission.

Mr. Kejriwal and others, represented by advocates Mohd Irshad and Rishikesh, have claimed that the trial court failed to appreciate that no offence, whether defamation or otherwise, is made out against them.

Mr. Shrivastava, a 1985-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer of Arunachal-Goa-Mizoram Union Territory (AGMUT) cadre, was recalled from CRPF last week when several parts of northeast Delhi witnessed communal riots that have so far left 39 people dead. He was on Central deputation to CRPF.

257,2020/02/28,AAP for elevating its ‘Delhi model’ to national level,"Party to contest upcoming panchayat and municipal elections in Madhya Pradesh, says State unit chief

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), carrying the promise of elevating its ‘Delhi model’ to the national level, had decided to contest the coming local elections in Madhya Pradesh, said its State unit president Pankaj Singh.

“We have faith in voters that they’ll understand our struggle to raise their issues. Citizens are supreme in a democracy,” he told The Hindu. As part of a month-long ‘nation building’ campaign until March 23, volunteers and party workers would visit houses, explaining the policy decisions of the party in Delhi in the past term which, they believed, heralded it back to power recently.

The party had provided a workable model before the country, characterised by access to education, electricity, water and better health services. “Besides, we’re researching peculiar needs of people of Madhya Pradesh. Our pitch here will be a synergy of the model and local issues,” he said.

The whole country recognised the potential of the Delhi government’s policies, as a result of which its education system and mohalla clinics were replicated by several other States. Last year, the Madhya Pradesh government set up mohalla clinics, rechristened as Sanjeevni clinics. “People are now fed up with politics based on religion of other parties. They want politics of work,” he said.

Mr. Singh noted that the AAP’s model was not exclusively urban. It aimed at implementing the Swaminathan Committee recommendations and “offered the highest compensation for crop loss in the country - Rs. 20,000 an acre. Moreover, the 23 rural Vidhan Sabha seats in New Delhi voted for the AAP, attesting to its pro-rural approach”, he said.

The party contested the 2018 Vidhan Sabha elections in Madhya Pradesh but failed to secure any of the 230 seats. Even worse, its State unit disintegrated owing to infighting, before it was reconstituted recently.

“In the previous elections, we fought with full force. We’re still analysing where we lacked and changes we need to bring about in our approach. We have returned with renewed energy after the New Delhi re-election,” said Mr. Singh.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/yo2clv/article30937205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20200223132639,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-for-elevating-its-delhi-model-to-national-level/article30937206.ece

A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel observed that the EC for the project was granted “without application of mind”.

“In view of our conclusion that the EC has been granted without proper evaluation and the project cannot be allowed without such proper evaluation about its sustainability or otherwise in the light of available data, a case is made for interference by this tribunal for having an evaluation done from an independent committee of experts,” the Bench said.

The tribunal said that the committee will comprise representatives from the Union Environment Ministry, senior scientists from the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Foundation, Central Ground Water Board, Central Pollution Control Board, School of Planning and Architecture and senior scientists from Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology among others.

While observing that the project will have adverse effect on the environment, the Bench said, “The site in question was originally parking for the metro station.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Delhi Jal Board to submit a detailed plan pertaining to the cleaning of drains while observing that adequate steps were not taken by the agency.

A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the DJB to furnish the action plan to the NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) within one month.

“Since the action taken is not enough, let further action be taken to prevent or remedy pollution of the drain and a revised detailed action plan, drain-wise, including phyto-remediation with timelines be filed by the DJB within one month,” the Bench said.

The YMC, comprising former Delhi Chief Secretary Shailaja Chandra and retired NGT expert member B.S. Sajwan, will consider the action plan and take appropriate steps.

Emission of gases

Earlier the green panel had sought a report from the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) following allegations of pollution in drains from Shahdara to Ghazipur. It was alleged that the pollution was resulting in emission of gases leading to air pollution.

In a January 7 meeting, it was decided that the EDMC would remove the solid waste from both banks of the drain and keep a vigil to prevent garbage dumping. “Messages should also be displayed at prominent locations. Also, CCTVs be installed at suitable locations to monitor garbage waste dumping,” the DPCC said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/submit-plan-on-cleaning-of-drains-ngt/article30937214.ece

Scared for their lives, after the recent clashes that broke out in the national capital, four Hindu families which resided in Chandu Nagar, close to Chand Bagh, left their houses on Thursday morning and arrived at their friend’s house in Khajoori Khas seeking shelter.

Karishma (20), a Class XII student, said that shops in their area were looted, vandalised and set ablaze and gunshots were fired. She said they were afraid that the mob was going to subsequently target the houses in the area. “We did not step out of our houses for the last three days. We did not even go out to buy vegetables,” she said.

The families have shifted to one Balvinder Singh’s house and said they would stay there till at least Friday evening owing to the tense situation. “Our Muslim neighbours said they could help us be safe from locals, but what would they do if outsiders came? Prayers are held every Friday...We have to take precautions,” said Reena, a member of one of the families that have shifted.

Mr. Singh’s daughter, Jassi (16), said: “When Section 144, curfew and shoot-at-sight orders are in place, how is this violence even happening?”

Many Muslim families in the area also vacated their houses and left for “safe” places on Wednesday.

Talking about the violence, Mr. Singh said that the clashes only resulted in loss to common people. “Outsiders come and incite locals. They get involved. The result is loss of life and property. This is just taking the country backward,” he lamented.

An uneasy calm prevailed across north-east Delhi where most of the shops were shut, with people onto the streets anticipating a “peaceful tomorrow”. “I have opened my shop after three day and only for a few hours. Roads are being cleaned of burnt remains. But people are scared and still in shock,” said Lokender Singh, a resident of Jaffrabad, who owns a pharmacy shop.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/scared-4-families-take-shelter-in-friends-house/article30937213.ece

A day after the body of Intelligence Bureau officer Ankit Sharma’s family blamed AAP leader Tahir Hussain for the youth’s death, the Delhi police on Thursday registered a case of murder and rioting against Mr. Hussain.

Ankit had gone missing on Tuesday evening. His body was recovered on Wednesday. His father Ravinder Sharma, who works with the Delhi police, alleged that his son was caught by rioters and taken to a building which belonged to AAP corporator Tahir Hussain and was brutally murdered.

According to an AAP leader, Mr. Tahir has been suspended from the party’s primary membership till the police investigation is over.

Commenting on the allegation, Mr. Hussain, in a video, said: “This is not true. Things are being said about me only to defame me. A crowd broke the gate of my office and went to the terrace. I sought help from the police. They reached after hours and I left the place along with my family.”

He said that he had requested for police deployment at the building to make sure nobody used it for illegal purposes. “But the policemen, who were already deployed, left and rioters did what I was afraid of. Whatever has happened is wrong,” he said.

CM’s statement

Responding to allegations of petrol bomb and stones being found and thrown from the terrace of Mr. Hussain’s house, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that everyone who incited violence should be put behind the bars. “Arrest them and put them in jail. If anyone of them is found to be a an AAP member, then punish that person twice. Stop doing politics over the security of the country,” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal, in his statement, said that strict action must be taken against everyone who is found guilty of instigating violence, irrespective of the political party the person belongs to. “I do not have control over the police... Seeking comments from the public, officials, leaders, etc. will not resolve the issue.

Women students of at least five Delhi University hostels began an indefinite sit-in protest demanding the removal of curfew in their hostels as well as the implementation of the Saksham Committee Report among other demands, they said.

Amisha, a DU student residing at Ambedkar Ganguly Hostel, said that residents of the hostels had reached a “saturation point” with hostel administration imposing arbitrary rules and regularly making sexist comments, she said.

“The administration keeps saying that changing the rules is not in their hands, that’s why we are taking it in our hands,” she added.

Among demands being made by the protesters, include allowing 24-hour entry and exit at all DU women hostels, removal of restrictions on ordering food from outside, abolishing of the interview system to allocate hostel seats, fixed allotment of hostel seats to students for the entire period of their course, transparent elections of wardens among various other measures.

Fundamental right

Arguing against the curfew, the students in a statement said, “.. the humiliating practice of imposing curfew on women students debars us from accessing basic university and social resources, violates our fundamental rights as citizens, infantilises us, is in direct conflict with our autonomy and mobility and is direct encouragement of those who commit public acts of sexual violence by making it appear as if women do not belong to the public space and must be punished when they venture into it.”

Talking about the clashes which broke out a few metres from his residence, Mr. Ram, who is among the few Hindus living in the street mostly inhabited by the Muslims, said he never felt like it was a Muslim- dominated colony and that on the day of the incident, his neighbours told him, “Hum jaan de denge tumhare liye, lekin kahin jana mat [We will lay down our lives for you, but don’t feel leave].”

Standing next to him was Mr. Rehman, who said: “I won’t let anyone even touch him.” He works in Mr. Ram’s bag-making factory on the ground floor where he lives as well. “All my documents have this address. He [Ram] treats me like his family,” said Mr. Rehman, the only Muslim worker in the factory.

Mr. Rehman, a father of two, said that his family in Unnao has been asking him to return home because, but he has refused. “I have told them that I cannot come. I believe nobody is our area can lay a finger on him, but outsiders might try to harm him. At that point, I will vouch for him and make sure he is safe,” he said.

Talking about the clashes, Mr. Ram said he only believes in humanity and that is his religion. “Bahar ke log aa kar bhadkaate hain, yahan sab thik hai [Outsiders come and incite violence... everything else is fine here otherwise]’,” he said.

Looking at his employer, Mr. Rehman said, “If something happens to me, I know he will be the one who will take me to the hospital.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pq35cq/article30937198.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27VIOLENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rehman-refuses-to-leave-ram-alone-in-city/article30937199.ece
265,2020/02/28,Gurugram bus commuters hit by non-availability of travel cards,"The cards are sold at six points of sale across the city

Commuters travelling by the city bus service, “Gurugaman”, are put to inconvenience due to non-availability of travel cards for the past few days. It may take another two weeks before the supply of cards is restored, said an official. The cards are sold at six points of sale across the city — HUDA City Centre metro station, IFFCO Chowk, Krishna Chowk, Gurugram bus stand, Dundahera bus stop and Sector-56.

Himanshu, an executive at HUDA City Centre metro station PoS, said, “Dozens of commuters approach me everyday to buy travel cards, but I have run out of stock. We have informed the officials concerned, but we were told that it might take another 10-15 days before the supply is restored.”

Rakesh, a commuter, said he had come to the PoS for the second time in less than a week, but was told that cards were not available. “The cards are available at only six such points. More points should be opened. Also, the cards are not charged online. The commuters again need to travel to the PoS for a recharge,” said Rakesh.

Sanjay, an executive at bus stand PoS, said that the situation was similar there too.

A senior official of the Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited said that the travel cards were supplied in an arrangement with IDFC First Bank and were given free of cost. However, a dispute had now arisen with the bank demanding a charge of ₹100 per card. “It has affected the supply of the cards. We have now approached other banks to explore the possibility of procuring the cards through them. It might take a while before the supply is restored,” the official said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gurugram-bus-commuters-hit-by-non-availability-of-travel-cards/article30937192.ece
266,2020/02/28,Delhi violence: Hindu teen recounts how Muslim neighbours stood guard for him,"Muslim woman says neighbours assured her nobody will hurt her family

Seventeen-year-old Harsh Singh was home alone on Monday afternoon when clashes broke out a few metres away from his residence in north-east Delhi’s Khajoori Khas. His “Wahab bhai” and another neighbour pushed him inside the house to make sure he was safe.

Hearing the commotion on the street outside on Monday, Harsh, a Class X student, ran out of the house. Stickers reading “Om Namah Shivay” and “Ram Ram” had been pasted on their door. “I was standing outside when I found people pelting stones at each other. Bhabhi and Wahab bhai came and asked me to go inside and also said that I should inform them in case I face a problem,” he said, referring to his neighbours, who belong to the Muslim community. The woman was not found at her residence when The Hindu visited it.

Harsh’s father Satpal Singh is a driver with the Delhi Transport Corporation and was at work when the clashes had broken out. His mother Sheela Devi had left for her mother’s house on Sunday evening to attend a wedding. “My father got to know about the situation and called mamu [Wahab] and asked to take care of me. He said he would return at the earliest,” the teenager said.

The neighbours also asked Harsh if he was hungry as his mother was away, he told The Hindu. “I am not scared at all. I have lived here since birth. They [neighbours] treat me like their own child,” he said.

The boy said he managed to look at the two sides clashing on Monday and “spotted friends on both the sides”. “I saw my Muslim friends on one side and Hindu friends on the other. One of my Hindu friends saw me and asked me if I was trapped. I said, ‘Bhai, yeh mera ghar hai [Brother, this is my house]’,” he said.

Harsh was alone at home on Thursday as well and remained safe.

The second Hindu household in Harsh’s neighbourhood was of 25-year-old Rahul Kumar. He became a father a few days ago. On Monday, he said, the neighbours stood guard and made sure the family was safe.

“On Tuesday morning, my neighbour Iqrar bhai came and told us, ‘Hum bachpan se sath hain, darne ki koi zaroorat nahi hai. Koi dikkat ho toh humain batana [We have been together since childhood. You don’t need to be scared. Let us know if there is any trouble]’,” said Mr. Kumar. Before taking their newborn son to the hospital on Tuesday, Mr. Kumar’s wife Reshma asked a grocery shop owner in the area to take care of their house.

Right across the road, in a Hindu-dominated area in Khajoori Khas, lives Anjum (48). She said her three sons have not gone to work for the last three days and mostly stayed inside the house.

Ms. Anjum’s is the only Muslim family in the locality and “felt safe” after a neighbour, Balvinder Singh, told them not to worry on Monday.

“He came and told us not to be scared and that no one from our locality will hurt us. But we are not sure how people here will react if outsiders come and attack us,” she said.

While both the communities feel safe in their own areas irrespective of the dominance that prevails, the two sides are not crossing over due to which people residing in the Muslim-dominated area are facing a water issue.

Suraj Kumar, a resident of the Muslim-dominated area, said that people in the area had to go fetch water from the other side as their area was “underdeveloped”. “Since Monday, we have not been able to go there. First, they ask our names and if we establish we are Hindus, they ask us to go back and arrange water,” he alleged. Both his children go to schools located on the opposite side and his concern is if the family will be able to cross the road without facing any issue.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7zebxj/article30937190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27VIOLENCE2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hindu-teen-recounts-how-muslim-neighbours-stood-guard-for-him/article30937191.ece
267,2020/02/28,AAP govt. for 3-level action plan to curb air pollution,"Options include outdoor construction only till Oct. every year

Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Thursday said the government will come up with three-level action plan — five-year plan, one-year plan and winter plan — to fight air pollution in the city.

The Minister said that suggestions have come from a conference held on Thursday on air pollution. It included a joint inter-State committee of implementing agencies and allowing outdoor construction only till October and indoor construction from October every year, among others.

The government also plans to come up with a 20-point list of actions residents can take to reduce air pollution, turning the efforts into a mass movement.

The Environment Department will take a call after submitting a report on the suggestions to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal next week.

40 monitoring stations

Mr. Rai said that suggestions have come that public and contractors should be made aware that outdoor construction should be done only till October and all indoor works should be done during winter, so that we need not ban construction. “This is a new suggestion and we will discuss about it,” he said. Mr. Rai said that last year, the government had prepared an action plan for the 13 air pollution hotspots, but experts have now suggested that 40 monitoring stations should get such an action plan.

“We also plan to analyse all the current action plans and then go forward with a new action plan by combining them,” Mr. Rai said.

Explaining the need for a new action plan, the Minister said, “For controlling pollution, all construction activities were stopped last winter. But many roads were already dug up and it led to more dust pollution. So we need to understand the practicality of the the current action plans.”

On Thursday, Mr. Rai chaired a conference with experts from different institutes, including IIT-Delhi and IIT-Kanpur. Mr. Rai also said that the participants of the conference will be given another 30 minutes each for one-on-one sessions to go into the details of the plans.

An aim to reduce air pollution to 1/3rd of the present level, in the course of next five years, was part of the 10-point ‘Kejriwal ka Guarantee Card’ released by the Chief Minister in the run-up to the 2020 Delhi Assembly elections. “The experts said that as per airshed, there should be a regional-level joint action committee. Then only we can bring a qualitative change,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rsb06t/article30937186.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27DELPRIYAGOPALRAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-govt-for-3-level-action-plan-to-curb-air-pollution/article30937187.ece
268,2020/02/28,‘Delayed’ police deployment questioned,"‘Panic-stricken people who made PCR calls during clashes were declined help’

“When we were born here, grew up here, why would we want anything bad to happen here?,” said 55-year-old Wasima, a resident of north-east Delhi’s Seelampur.

These were, however, not the only questions on the minds of scores of local women like her continuing with their two-month-old peaceful demonstration against the amended Citizenship Act here on Thursday.

Across the road from the Hindu-dominated locality of Welcome and a few hundred metres from the crossing where BJP leader Kapil Mishra sought to issue a three-day ultimatum to the Delhi police to clear sit-in protesters like her from the main road last Sunday, questions regarding delayed police deployment and the role of “instigators from outside” dominated the discussion.

Peace, she said, had returned to the area after “several tense nights”, on Wednesday evening. What remained to be seen, however, was how long it would last.

“Last night there was some peace. [Union Home Minister] Amit Shah did exactly what he did in Gujarat,” she alleged.

“Yes, there were people from here, on both sides, who played a role in the clashes, but there were people from outside who came and instigated them into doing so,” she claimed.

Mr. Mishra, alleged another female resident who asked not to be named, “called people from outside.”

“They [the rioters] came from Uttar Pradesh with sacks of bricks and weapons. People from outside came with weapons. There was no police deployment at that time and calls made to the police control room by residents were answered with phrases like ‘This is the freedom that you wanted’,” she alleged. “As early as this morning, panic-stricken people were calling the PCR but were declined any help and were given similar answers. On the other hand, we got videos on WhatsApp showing the police helping outsiders gather bricks to pelt at our homes,” she alleged further.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/6f43yo/article30937183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27SEELAMPUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delayed-police-deployment-questioned/article30937184.ece
269,2020/02/28,Caretaker ‘trapped’ for 60 hours inside school,"He claims he and his family were rescued after the police arrived on Wednesday

“I don’t want to come back...I wont come back...,” Manoj Kalauni sobbed over the phone sitting amid the ruined remains of the Rajdhani Public Senior Secondary School in Karawal Nagar.

Trapped allegedly for 60 hours sans food or water with his wife, 10-year-old daughter and eight-year-old son within the confines of the campus of the school, where he has been employed as the caretaker for the past 18 years, the 36-year-old claimed the family was “freed” only after the police reached the area on Wednesday afternoon.

“It started around 4 p.m. on Monday; both sides were pelting stones at each other. I don’t know if they were Hindus or Muslims, there were mobs. Thankfully, the students had all gone home. Who knows what could have happened had they been here,” Mr. Kalauni, a resident of Uttaranchal, said.

“We [he and his family] were trapped. We kept shifting from one room to another to avoid being spotted, instead of going out. They [the rioters] from both the sides arrived, took turns to ransack the school. They robbed everything of value in the school as well as everything that I and my family owned. I had no choice. I had to protect my family. I never imagined anything like what I went through over the last 18 years I have been in this city,” he said further, before breaking down.

Faisal Farooq, Mr. Kalauni’s employer, was among the people to meet, console and encourage him to stay on after being rescued by “the administration” around 3 p.m. on Thursday. After his allegedly 60-hour-long ordeal, however, he has made up his mind otherwise.

“I will go back home as soon as I can. My family wants us to return back home as soon as possible...I don’t think they will let me come back. I don’t want to come back. I won’t come back,” he went on.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qkuvgy/article30937180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27KALAUNI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/caretaker-trapped-for-60-hours-inside-school/article30937181.ece

Arun Modern Senior Secondary School and a madrasa, located in Farooqi Mosque on the same street in Brijpuri area, were vandalised and torched by mobs on Tuesday.

“Your home: Your Sweet Home; School: Your Second Home” reads the charred remnants of a textbook in the library of the burnt school where around 1,000 students are enrolled.

“I don’t know why they targeted the school. The signs of violence are present in every corner of the institute. They burnt down the computer laboratory, library, classrooms, toilets, school bus. Records of all students have been gutted,” said a teacher, who wished not to be named.

Bhisham Sharma, owner of the school, said the rioters burnt books worth ₹70 lakh. Mr. Sharma said that the mob was on a rampage and the assault continued from 3.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. “The only thing we are thankful is that there were no children at that time in the school, otherwise the loss would have been huge,” he said. The rioters targeted the properties after identifying it as belonging to Hindus and Muslims, he said.

Kesar Abidi, a school teacher said that most of the children in the school are from Muslim families but it is owned by Mr. Sharma. “They damaged every classroom. It is a very shameful act. God is a witness to everything. He [God] will not spare the perpetrator,” said Ms. Abidi.

Ms. Abidi who is a social studies teacher, said, “How and what will I explain to the students when they will ask me about the damage. How will I face the questions from the students. I don’t want innocent kids to know about Hindus and Muslims.”

Destroy CCTV room

Just after the attack on the school, a mob attacked a madarsa located next door. The floor of the mosque has blood stains, burnt curtains and damaged furniture. “After vandalising the mosque, the mob entered the madarsa and set it on fire. The students ran for their lives. After damaging everything, the rioters returned to set a CCTV room on fire to destroy the evidence of the violence,” said Rizwan, a local resident.

271,2020/02/28,"The Delhi police were missing, Hindus and Muslims agree","As the embers still burn, fear and anger are palpable in north-east Delhi

Some shops are still slowly smoking, in others people could be seen examining what is salvageable. Charred vehicles litter the road at the crossing of Mustafabad-Shiv Vihar in north-east Delhi. Even once mighty steel almirahs dot the patchy road.

At major crossings in Jaffrabad, Ganga Vihar, Shiv Vihar and Gokulpuri, police pickets can be seen. In Gokulpuri, most shops are open while in Mustafabad where many shops and a school were gutted, it’s not business as usual.

Delhi police and Rapid Action Force personnel are deployed in many areas, with local residents making arrangements to feed them. People with metal buckets and paper plates were going around, feeding policemen.

All the glass panes of Rajdhani Public Sr. Sec. School at Shiv Vihar Tiraha are broken. One room is full of notebooks and paper. In what looks like a reception area, only the metal bits remain of what was once furniture.

“There was firing by Muslims from rooftops,” a shopkeeper identified as a Hindu tells me, looking out from his burnt shop. “Monday was so scary,” said a woman with a bindi on her forehead.

Cooped up indoors

After navigating a path through a gali littered with bricks, this reporter walked ahead of the school and towards an inner lane. No residents could be seen.

Two women, identified as Muslims, fear writ large on their faces, ask me if they could be helped to their houses to get clothes for their children as they had fled with nothing. “We have small children and they have no clothes. Please help us.” They are guided to the RAF men at the head of the lane and are allowed to proceed.

Walking back into the lane, this reporter could hear voices from inside the steel shuttering of a house. A woman poked her head out of a small window and said, “We have not got out of our houses since Monday. We are too scared to go out.”

Soon, some men, identified as Muslims, emerge from an inner lane. Fear and anger is palpable. “We have had to flee our houses. Our mosques in Shiv Vihar were desecrated. The nephew of a local BJP leader was seen opening fire. We are not being allowed out by the police even to get milk for our children.”

“Hindus are freely moving around. But the police don’t allow us to move out,” they say in chorus. “Come and see... a Hindu temple in the inner lane is safe.”

Frantic calls in vain

On one thing, both Hindus and Muslims were united. They kept dialling the police, but no one came on Monday. This was a persistent complaint by people in both Mustafabad and Shiv Vihar.

Ravikant Upadhyay, who works at a weighbridge outside Mustafabad, said their installation had been totally destroyed. “We have suffered a loss of at least ₹10 lakh. Our owner is a Muslim, but I have never had a problem working for him.” The shop was still smouldering after three days.

Moving to Shiv Vihar, one could see that a mosque had been burnt from the inside. It was pitch dark and mangled ceiling fans told the story of fire in the mosque. Several Hindu residents confirmed that all the Muslims living in the area had fled their houses after the violence.

Even one Hindu, Ram Kumar Singh, was seen taking his belongings away to stay at an alternative place. He confirmed that all the buildings burnt belonged to Muslims, but some had Hindu tenants. “When madness grips people, you can see the results,” Mr. Singh stated.

Waiting to exhale

As our black and yellow WagonR taxi navigated the patchy roads, this reporter spotted a gathering of several persons. On investigation, it was found that residents of Pradhanwali gali, Johripur, were busy buying potatoes. Since there was a rush, people had been made to queue up. Javed Khan, a taxi driver, and Manoj Kumar, a transporter, stood among a group of people, just ahead of the queue. “We have had no violence here. You can see people here, Hindus and Muslims, are living in harmony.”

But how did the area escape the violence given its proximity to the area where the riots have taken place? “We have never allowed entry to any outsiders. This was not a Hindu-Muslim riot. People had been brought from outside to foment trouble.”

Javed, Manoj and others said they hadn’t slept since Sunday night. Neither had anyone gone to work, to make sure that everyone was safe. The same was the case in the other areas. No one has been sleeping at night for fear of being attacked.

272,2020/02/28,None from Loni crossed border to indulge in violence: Ghaziabad SP,"‘Our team repelled mob from Karawal Nagar, kept vigil till Delhi police arrived’

Neeraj Jadaun, Superintendent of Police (Rural), Ghaziabad has refuted the charge that miscreants from Loni area of the district crossed over to north-east Delhi and indulged in communal violence. “We had sealed the border on February 24 itself and even before that there was no report of suspicious movement from the Loni side as we have checkposts on the border,” he said.

The SP told The Hindu that he and his team of 20-25 policemen had to cross over from Lal Bagh Mandi checkpost in Ghaziabad to Karwal Nagar in north-east Delhi on Tuesday to repel a violent mob of around 200 people.

“In one hour, we had to cross over thrice as the mob was armed with petrol bombs and lathis and was threatening to set the shops and houses on fire,” Mr. Jadaun said. The area, he said, has bamboo furniture shops and even a small fire could have led to a disaster. “It was my call. I felt it was not time to go by jurisdiction. We didn’t have anti-riot jackets but we had helmets. We crossed over and within ten minutes we were able to repel them. When they came again, we threatened them of a lathi-charge.”

‘Riot averted’

Explaining the scene, Mr Jadaun recalled: “When the mob attacked, the families, with children and women, had locked themselves up and were throwing stones from rooftops in self-defence. I could see a person holding a country-made pistol on the rooftop. The mob below was also throwing stones and were holding petrol bombs. Some were trying to break the locks and some had pieces of tin shades to protect themselves from the stones coming from the rooftop. It could have easily spiralled into a riot.”

The official further said he tried to contact the Delhi Police but he was told that they were in no position to reach there. “I also called the Fire Service but didn’t get any response. Delhi Police reached the spot only on Wednesday. The entire Tuesday night we kept a strict vigil.”

He said though there was no rule to control such situations, a thumb rule is to use excess force on the first day of the riot. “In that case, the casualties will be of rioters. If you allow the situation to fester, innocents suffer.”

Dispelling rumours

Mohd. Akhlaq, pradhan of Shankar Colony in Loni said the situation was under control in the area. “There is a heavy police presence. We are going from door-to-door to dispel rumours. We have heard that people are blaming Loni for riots in Delhi. It is a false charge. It was the doing of the locals.”

Praising the role of the police officials, Ahsan Qureshi, a businessman said, Loni had an image of a crime belt but it was not communally charged. “Efforts are being to communalise the atmosphere by sending provocative posts on social media but most of us could see through the game.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/fbvp9a/article30937168.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE27AMIT3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/none-from-loni-crossed-border-to-indulge-in-violence-ghaziabad-sp/article30937169.ece

“The boy had allegedly come out of his house to get breakfast on Tuesday morning when he got caught in the mob and fell on the ground. He later got up and was hit on the back. We found him on the roadside,” said a journalist, who along with locals in the area managed to get the boy admitted in the hospital.

“The boy told us that his mother passed away when he was young and his father abandoned him. He lives with an aunt who is aged. They pull along with the money that he makes working as a daily wager and doing odd-jobs,” the scribe said.

While he was given treatment at a local medical centre, where his head was bandaged, he said that in the middle of the night he started vomiting, after which he was referred to LNJP Hospital, where he was admitted in the neurology emergency ward.

Faisal reported loss of vision. “I can’t see anyone’s face clearly,” he said, sitting next to his parents on a hospital bed. His parents said that doctors had recommended that he undergo a CT scan to diagnose the issue.

While his parents believed that violence had been under control in the area with increased police deployment, asked if he was afraid, Faisal said: “What should I be scared of?”

Apart from Faisal, at least two other patients injured in the riots were admitted to the neurology department. At the burns ward, one victim with acid injuries was undergoing treatment, a doctor said.

Carrying forward the promise of elevating its ‘Delhi model’ to the national-level, AAP has decided to contest the upcoming local elections — panchayat and municipal — in Madhya Pradesh, its State unit president Pankaj Singh said.

“We have faith in the voters that they will understand our struggle to raise their issues ...,” he said, As part of the month-long ‘nation-building’ campaign until March 23, volunteers and party workers will go door-to-door explaining the policy decisions of the party in New Delhi in the past term, that they believe heralded it back to power recently. Mr. Singh said the party had provided a workable model before the country, characterised by access to education, electricity, water and health services. “We are researching the needs of people of M.P.

Mr. Gehlot asked what message was the Centre trying to give by transferring Justice Muralidhar, who had shown his resentment against the police inaction during the violence in Delhi and on the failure of the police to act against the BJP leaders for their hate speeches.

281,2020/02/28,Punjab Minister questions SAD silence on Delhi violence,"AAP MLAs protest in support of farmers’ demands in State

Punjab Cooperation and Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on Thursday raised the issue of the ongoing violence and deaths in the Capital during Zero Hour of the budget session of the State Assembly.

Outside the House, Mr. Randhawa said the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders, who also share power in the Union government, were silent on the issue. “The silence on discrimination with the minorities on the part of SAD, which is said to be representing Sikhs, is unacceptable,” he said.

The Minister said the Capital was in a state of turmoil and the “killing of humanity” on a daily basis was a disgraceful stigma on the democratic and secular fabric of the country. He said all this happened when U.S. President Donald Trump was being given a dinner party in Delhi.

‘A bad image’

“Thus, this phenomenon created a bad image of the country in the eyes of foreign dignitaries because the police and the Union Home Ministry failed miserably to stop the violence,” he said.

Before the start of the budget session, Aam Aadmi Party MLAs, led by Leader of the Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema and State Kisan Wing president Kultar Singh Sandhwan, staged a protest outside the Assembly in support of the demands of farmers and farm hands in the State.

Wearing face masks in the Assembly, AAP MLAs took a jibe at Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on his statement made in the House — the promised smart phones have been ordered but could not be given as they had been held up due to COVID-19 in China —, which the AAP leader said was “a mere face-saving exercise”.

“It was not China, which was afflicted with the deadly virus instead it’s the Captain’s government which has been the victim of ‘carona virus’ and had failed to fulfil the election promises made before assuming power in 2017. By reneging on poll promises, the government had disappointed not only the farmers and farm hands, but also every section of society,” the leaders alleged.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/punjab-minister-questions-sad-silence-on-delhi-violence/article30936907.ece
282,2020/02/28,Amazing qualities,"Lord Mahavishnu is known by the name Maayan. Paripaadal addresses Him as Maayoye. Andal also, in Her Thiruppavai, refers to Krishna as Maayan. But why does the Lord have this name? Antariksha, one of the nava yogeeswaras featured in Srimad Bhagavatam, explains why such a name came about, said P.T. Seshadri in a discourse. Antariksha says that the three acts of creating the world, sustaining it and then dissolving it are done by Maya, and this Maya is Vishnu.

Thirumazhisai Azhvar lists many marvels and wonders, and says each of these is a cause for referring to the Lord as Maayan. The appearance of clouds, the retreat of waves, things moving due to wind, the waxing and waning of the Moon, the rising and setting of the Sun — all these are marvellous and these have earned for Vishnu the name of Maayan, for He is responsible for all these.

Thirumazhisai Azhvar also gives some other examples of His maya. His strength is amazing, and this is a maya. He made the world, and this is another maya. He gave us hands to worship Him, although we use our hands for other purposes. This is another maya. He dissolves the world and this too is a maya. His sankalpa fills one with awe and this too is a maya. When jivas go astray, He does not abandon them. This too is a maya. How can anyone be in possession of so many wondrous qualities? That itself is a maya, says Thirumazhisai Azhvar. So clearly, according to Thirumazhisai Azhvar, His maya means His qualities which fill one with awe. Svetasvatara Upanishad says that this world is responsible for creation. For this reason this world is called Maya. In the Gita, Krishna says that none can cross the Maya caused by the three gunas. Only those who surrender to Him can cross it.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/amazing-qualities/article30945421.ece

It was an evening of fun, entertainment and mouth-watering egg and chicken snacks to dispel misconceptions and drive home a message that there is no truth in the rumours that the dreaded Corona Virus (Kovid19) will be spread by chicken.

Worried that the baseless rumours linking the virus with chicken has hit the poultry industry and farmers , Telangana Poultry Federation, Telangana Poultry Breeders Association, National Egg Coordination Committee and All India Poultry Development and Service Pvt Ltd., mounted a huge awareness campaign -Chicken and Egg Mela- at People’s Plaza, Necklace Road here on Friday.

The widely publicised event attracted thousands of people for an evening that doled out authentic and scientific information that people should not fear eating eggs and chicken that are rich in protein and nutrients based on some rumours spread by social media.

The consumption of chicken dropped by 30% and as a result chicken prices also crashed. Central and State governments and the World Health Organisation issued statements that Corona Virus would not be spread by consuming chicken and it was safe for people to eat chicken and eggs.

Health Minister Eatela Rajender said unnecessary scare was created by social media. There was not even a single case of Corono Virus reported in Telangana. Industries Minister K.T.Rama Rao said baseless rumours affected thousands of poultry farmers and he said they ate chicken and eggs at home daily. Film Star Rashmika too vouched for the safety of chicken and that it was part of her daily diet.

Several film and TV celebrities, Ministers Talasani Srinivas Yadav and Srinivas Goud, MP Ranjit Reddy lent support to the event and exhorted people not to believe baseless rumours and partook chicken and egg snacks to give confidence to people.

Thousands turned up for the event and consumed chicken and egg snacks. The poultry industry got together to prepare 6,000 kg of chicken items, mainly dry finger foods and 20,000 boiled eggs to serve to about 25,000 visitors to the mela free of cost. The aroma of freshly fried chicken filled the air near People’s Plaza.

TV anchor Shiva Jyothi, Bithir Satti, playback singer Anudeep, Lipsika, award winning baby singer Saiveda Vagdevi and others turned up to support and entertain the event.

Three minor girls, including a four-month-old toddler, of the same family were killed late on Thursday night when a wall of their house in Afzal Sagar in Mangar Basthi here collapsed while they were asleep.

289,2020/02/28,COVID-19 scare hits poultry business,"‘Chicken consumption has come down by about 30% leaving farmers worried’

The scare of COVID-19 and spread of rumours on social media linking chicken to the deadly virus has taken a huge toll on the unsuspecting poultry industry and farmers.

Rumour mills

Many people across the country, apparently scared of the rumours doing the rounds on social media about the virus that emanated in China and fast spreading to other parts of the world, ticked off eggs and chicken from the menu at most houses.

“Chicken consumption has come down by about 30%, leaving the poultry industry and farmers worried,” said Broiler Integration Coordination Committee member Ram Reddy. With fall in sales, chicken prices too declined steeply from ₹80 a kg live chicken at farm to ₹40 a kg. The production cost itself is about ₹75 a kg, bulk of it spent on feed for birds.

The poultry industry has been organising awareness campaigns and chicken and egg melas across the country to remove misconceptions regarding the deadly virus.

A practising doctor, Srinivas Raju, who has a breeder farm, said that COVID-19 would affect only mammals and not birds. “Linking chicken consumption with COVID-19 is a far-fetched and irrational notion. Moreover, the Indian style of cooking process at hot temperatures will destroy any bacteria or virus. Eggs and chicken are good sources of protein and please do eat them,” he advised.

General manager of Venkateswara Hatcheries Group K.G. Anand said that the Indian government and WHO stated that chicken and eggs were safe to be eaten and COVID-19 would not spread by eating them.

“Now, consumption is slowly improving though chicken is still under-priced at ₹50 a kg. We hope consumption and prices will be back to normal in three to four weeks,” he said.

Poultry farmers suffered losses whenever a scare was created following an outbreak of an epidemic. The industry would mount a campaign to clear misconceptions. It happened with the bird flu epidemic, later Chikungunya fever, though it has nothing to do with chicken.

Chicken and egg mela

This time too, the Telangana Poultry Breeders’ Association, Telangana Poultry Federation, National Egg Coordination Committee and All India Poultry Development and Service Pvt. Ltd., with more than 25,000 members, mostly small and marginal farmers, got together to organise a chicken and egg mela at People’s Plaza on Necklace Road here on Friday to create awareness on consumption of eggs and chicken. The mela will be on from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m.

Ministers to take part

“We are serving free chicken and egg dishes to general public who come to the mela along with entertainment programmes. Several ministers, including Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao, Health Minister Eatala Rajender, Animal Husbandry Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav, Agriculture Minister Niranjan Reddy, physicians, and celebrities, among others, would attend the mela, and try the egg and chicken dishes to boost the confidence of general public,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/qz1b14/article30936421.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-CHICKEN-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/covid-19-scare-hits-poultry-business/article30936418.ece

291,2020/02/28,State urged to buy red gram under MSP,"Congress MP writes to KCR

Telangana Congress working president and Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy has urged Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to ensure that the entire redg ram crop be purchased by the officials and not restrict the number of quintals for each farmer.

In an open letter to the Chief Minister, Mr. Reddy said officials are coming up with strange restrictions like limiting purchase of 10 quintals from each farmer, asking farmers to prove their identity and also proof of cultivating the same in their farm. It is ridiculous that red gram is not being purchased of the farmers who have not enrolled online, he said.

He said the government had announced minimum support price of ₹ 5,800 per quintal but private traders are paying just between ₹3,800 and₹4,000 per quintal, resulting in a loss of ₹2,000 per quintal to each farmer.

Mr. Reddy blamed the State government for wrong estimation of the produce and the Central government for restricting the purchase to just 47,500 metric tonnes of the produce. Since the production is more, officials are now limiting the purchase to just 10 quintals per farmer. He said farmers have now come onto the roads demanding purchase of all the produce at the MSP but the much trumpeted Rythu Samanvaya Samitis (Farmers Coordination Committees) are no where to be seen. The government must understand the predicament of farmers and purchase all the redgram produced in the State, he demanded.

He said it was “shame” on the part of TRS MLA to provoke Muslims by asking them to chase away BJP workers or any others who visit their houses to collect data.

How can an elected MLA talk against the Constitution, he asked, reminding that the CAA is a law passed by the Parliament.

Mr. Subhash said the people of Telangana would teach a lesson to TRS for its Muslim appeasement policy and the TRS MLA’s speech is an indication of it.

He said the BJP leaders approached Kukatpally police station and lodged a complaint against the TRS MLA.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bjp-objects-to-trs-mlas-remarks/article30936309.ece
296,2020/02/28,Short cuts by cabbies add to inner lane traffic chaos,"As more cab drivers take roads based on online traffic maps, gallies are getting heavy traffic

The cab driver drives straight towards the Inner Ring Road in Attapur, then glances at the phone for directions. Shuffles gears and turns back the way he came. He drives through a narrow lane with dozens of speed-breakers to finally hit the Langer Houz Road.

Another day, another cab driver notices the heavy traffic on the Masab Tank flyover and takes the inner lane, hits Mallepally and exits near Mehdipatnam Kaman before driving on the Inner Ring Road.

“I just follow the map. I know the roads of the city but the path shown here has less traffic and I don’t want to think,” says Jehangir, a cab driver from Hyderguda area, when asked about changing directions.

As more cab drivers and vehicle owners decide the road to travel based on information from real-time online traffic maps, the inner lanes and gallies are getting heavy traffic. Traffic that is way beyond the carriage capacity of the narrow roads. Some of these roads are short cuts that go through densely populated areas for a short distance while others are long stretches that bypass the main roads with heavier traffic. “I stay in Domalguda... The Gagan Mahal road surely qualifies. It’s a one-way road that never has one-way traffic,” says a resident.

With multiple connecting roads between the Lower Tank Bund area and Liberty, the maps guide road users to the one that passes through the Gagan Mahal Road. The result is a day-long traffic mess with flared tempers, raised voices and honking matches between road users travelling in two directions.

Another example is the main road between Tadbun and Kompally, which gets heavy traffic. Many road users get directed to use another stretch that passes through Bapunagar and Centre Point Hotel. “It is not a wide road and has a number of residents moving about. But there is heavy traffic nowadays as many commuters end up using that road,” says G. Sridhar, who lives in the Bowenpally area.

Many residents and residential associations are fighting back but with limited success. On the L-shaped road that bypasses the Nanal Nagar Junction, residents have erected height barriers to keep out bigger vehicles from using the road. Residents of Nalanda Nagar have overseen the construction of two concrete height barriers after the metal ones were torn down using earthmovers by unknown vandals.

Many other areas have seen construction of number of speed-breakers to dissuade road users from accessing them. But as long as real time traffic maps channel the flow of traffic through inner lanes and narrow gallis, many residents in those areas will have to live with noise, dust and heavy traffic.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ipktpe/article30936286.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-TRAFFIC-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/short-cuts-by-cabbies-add-to-inner-lane-traffic-chaos/article30936281.ece
297,2020/02/28,CPI demands Amit Shah’s resignation,"Protesting leaders taken into custody, released later

The Communist Party of India has demanded that Union Home Minister Amit Shah tender his resignation from the post taking moral responsibility for the communal clashes that rocked New Delhi for the past few days.

The CPI leaders led by national secretariat member K. Narayana and former MP Azeez Pasha burnt the effigy of the Union Home Minister in protest against the government’s “inaction” on the developments in the capital.

Dr. Narayana alleged that Mr. Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi unleashed communal violence in New Delhi, on the lines of Gujarat, in a planned manner. This could be seen from the fact that the Union Home Minister is maintaining silence on the developments that are rocking New Delhi over the past few days.

299,2020/02/28,‘KCR Apathbandhu’ scheme soon,"for employing MBC youth

The Backward Classes Welfare department has decided in principle to introduce “KCR Apathbandhu”, a scheme envisaging distribution of ambulances to youth of weaker sections, to assist people in medical emergencies.

BC Welfare Minister Gangula Kamalakar, who chaired a meeting of the department officials, mooted the idea of launching the scheme on a pilot basis.

Accordingly, it was resolved to provide one ambulance each in all the districts to group of five unemployed youth hailing from the most backward communities.

Sewing machines

The meeting resolved to provide sewing machines to 10,000 poor women, besides providing training to them.

It was decided to train the unemployed women through the NIFT and provide them with employment opportunities.

The Minister exhorted the officials concerned to work with effective coordination at the field-level to ensure that the benefits intended for weaker sections reach all the eligible beneficiaries.

He said he would forthwith visit districts to inspect the facilities made available in the BC welfare hostels as well as residential schools. Ministers, MLAs and other elected representatives would be asked to visit the BC welfare hostels as part of ongoing Pattana Pragati and inspect the facilities there.

300,2020/02/28,CM turns good Samaritan to man in distress,"Physically challenged man allotted pension, 2BHK house

It was a case of being at the right place at the right time that helped an old physically challenged and impoverished person find a solution to his hardships. The much needed help and assistance came to the sickly man Mohammad Salim, unexpectedly from Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao himself on Thursday.

Salim, with a representation in his hand, was noticed by the Chief Minister on his way back from attending a private function at Tolichowki. He stopped the car, walked towards the person and learnt about his distress. Salim, who used to work as a driver, had been ill for the last nine years. His situation became worse when he fell down from a building four years ago and fractured his leg. He pleaded with the Chief Minister that his son was also sick and the family did not even have a house and urged for help.

Moved by his plight, Mr. Rao directed Hyderabad District Collector Shweta Mohanty to address Salim’s grievances, sanction pension for the disabled, and a double bedroom house. The Collector immediately acted upon the Chief Minister’s instructions, went to the place where Salim is residing, made an inquiry. As Salim has a medical certificate to confirm his disability, the Collector sanctioned the pension immediately and also a double bedroom house at Jiaguda.

The Collector assured Salim that his medical treatment would be borne by the government and assistance would be extended to his son suffering from illness under the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/4yufrf/article30936249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY28KCR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cm-turns-good-samaritan-to-man-in-distress/article30936250.ece
301,2020/02/28,APSFC seeks TS police help for protection of 270-acre land,"Unauthorised constructions have come up in the lands at Gajularamaram village

The Andhra Pradesh State Financial Corporation has requested the assistance of Telangana police for demolishing the unauthorised constructions that came up in over 270-acre lands at Gajularamaram village of Medchal-Malkajgiri district.

In a letter addressed to the station house officer of Jagadgirigutta police station, a senior manager of the APSFC said the Revenue officials agreed to extend cooperation in the removal of the encroachments and wanted deployment of at least 25 police personnel including 15 women and 10 men at the time of demolition of unauthorised constructions on APSFC lands. Interestingly, the land in two parcels at Gajularamaram village was alienated in favour of APSFC in the erstwhile united State in 2007.

The land was, however, resumed by the State government in 2015 (GO Ms 195) as it was not being utilised for the purpose for which it had been given as per the terms and conditions of allotment, even after seven years.

The neighbouring State government filed an appeal in the High Court subsequently and the court had ordered ‘status quo’ in the matter.

Senior officials said though the government had resumed the allotted land, no Punchnama was done subsequently as a result of which the land was not transferred into the State’s land bank and this has allowed the APSFC to stake claim on the land. The land allotted to APSFC formed part of the pending reorganisation issues relating to Schedule X institutions where it was said that no information pertaining to punchnama was available.

On the basis of location, the land at Gajularamaram village has to be allotted to Telangana as per the terms of Section 53 of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014 as it did not form part of the headquarter. Officials claimed that the headquarter asset had been clearly defined by Section 53 of the Act and the Central government too gave ample clarity on the issue.

“The Act mandates that only headquarter assets and those which have operational jurisdiction over both the successor States should be bifurcated,” a senior official said adding the Gajularamaram land did not come under the definition of headquarter nor are there any operational units functioning from there, thus making it the property of Telangana on location basis.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/apsfc-seeks-ts-police-help-for-protection-of-270-acre-land/article30936241.ece

303,2020/02/28,TRSA chairman moots NH Road Safety Plan,"National Highways witnessed 30% of total accident deaths in 2018, says IPS officer T. Krishna Prasad

National highways, which constitute less than 2% of total road network in the country, witnessed 30% of total road accident deaths in year 2018.

The total loss incurred due to these fatal accidents on National Highways, according to an estimation, is coming close to 1% of the Gross Domestic Product of the country, which translates to ₹1,90,102 crore.

Stating this in a report submitted to the Bureau of Police Research Development (BPR&D), Telangana Road Safety Authority chairman and senior IPS officer T. Krishna Prasad mooted the idea of creating a dedicated enforcement agency for National and State Highways. By bringing down accidents on National Highways by 50% in five years, the agency can save five lakh crore rupees of the GDP, Mr. Prasad told the BPR&D by citing his National Highway Road Safety Plan.

To check accidents on NHHs, constitution of a dedicated and pan-India enforcement agency is the need of the hour, the report said.

The National Highway Road Safety Plan should comprise three basic elements of education and awareness, enforcement and emergency, the senior IPS officer explained in his report.

The agency with headquarters in Delhi should have 22 regional offices across the country, the plan proposed.

It would have 84 divisional offices, 160 group offices, 237 sub-group offices and 651 field offices.

Each of the last category would enforce the road safety plan covering 300 kms of National Highways.

The office establishment, manpower, vehicles and other expenditure for this agency would be ₹3,308 crore capital cost and ₹2,007 crore recurring cost annually, Mr. Krishna Prasad said in his report.

The TRSA chairman also reviewed the recent accident involving death of three persons after the car they were travelling in drowned in Kakatiya Canal near Thimmapur of Karimnagar.

He directed officials of all the districts to collect data of bridges and culverts and identify the black-spots of accidents to take remedial measures.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/trsa-chairman-moots-nh-road-safety-plan/article30936153.ece

305,2020/02/28,Demand for more ro-ro vessels gathers steam in Kochi,"Call for additional service on Vypeen-Fort Kochi route

The Fort Vypeen Janakeeya Kootayma, a collective of organisations that are on the forefront of agitation seeking improvement in transportation and other amenities in Goshree islands, submitted a mass memorandum to Mayor Soumini Jain on Thursday, seeking the introduction of a third roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) vessel on the Vypeen-Fort Kochi route.

The service is crucial in averting a shutdown in transporting people and vehicles between the two areas if either of the existing ro-ro ferries breaks down, said Majnu Komath, chairman of the NGO. “I once again apprised the Mayor of the need for at least one more vessel in the busy corridor. She concurred with this and said three or four such vessels would be of much help to commuters on the stretch,” he added.

“I also spoke about how people are not benefiting optimally from the two vessels since KSINC is not operating them for 16 hours. The two vessels are available only for 12 hours, said to be because of inadequate number of trained people. The vessels must operate at least from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. We had demanded a spare vessel even before the two vessels were introduced by the Kochi Corporation,” Mr. Komath said.

306,2020/02/28,GCDA budget foresees revenue of ₹146 crore,"Ropeway-cum-entertainment hub and tourist boat jetty complex proposed at Marine Drive

Kick-starting of work on LIFE Mission housing, an affordable scheme in panchayats around Kochi city, a 30,000-sft exhibition-cum-convention centre at Kadavanthra, sports city at Ambedhkar Stadium, ropeway-cum-entertainment hub, tourist boat jetty complex at Marine Drive in association with DTPC, and resurfacing of the Kaloor-Kadavanthra Road are among the prominent projects announced in the Greater Cochin Development Authority’s budget for the 2020-‘21 fiscal.

The budget foresees expenditure worth ₹122.95 crore and a revenue of ₹146.90 crore. The LIFE Mission scheme suffered a temporary setback when the assets of the construction company, which was about to begin work, were auctioned off. Another firm will begin work from March, GCDA Chairman V. Salim said here on Thursday. “We have proposed a ropeway along the Marine Drive waterfront and a five-storey entertainment hub in the immediate vicinity. A safe tourist boat jetty along Marine Drive too is necessary to weed out illegal and unsafe jetties being set up by private boat operators. A ₹7-crore project will shortly begin to renovate the Marine Drive walkway,” he added.

He listed other schemes too, including a studio-cum-theatre complex in 80-cents at Kakkanad and a studio and film institute on a 30-cent plot at Gandhinagar in association with with the Kerala State Film Development Corporation (KSFDC). The GCDA also intends to develop the Kadavanthra market and set up a sewage treatment plant which will have 125 cubic metre capacity nearby and commercial complexes at Olimugal in Kakkanad and near the High Court.

Solar panels

An amount of ₹4 crore has been earmarked for installing solar panels atop the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium to generate 1 MW power under the Smart Cities Mission programme on public-private partnership (PPP) basis. In addition, a study is under way for setting up a green city in the suburbs, for which 12 locales have been identified under the Kochi Economic City Development project. Talks are also on with stakeholders for setting up a Land Bank, for which expression of interest has been invited.

The GCDA will also establish a godown-cum-office complex at Kaloor, a women’s hostel at Kadavanthra, and an eco-tourism spot at Rameshwaram in accordance with CRZ norms.

Adalats

Mr. Salim said the GCDA’s annual income had gone up by ₹3.42 lakh crore through hosting an adalat to settle cases regarding rent with tenants of the authority’s properties. The income will increase further, he added.

307,2020/02/28,"Railways neglecting Thripunithura station, allege residents","‘Authorities unmindful of rise in revenue from ticketing at station’

Despite a steep increase in passenger traffic and revenues from ticketing and parking, the railway station at Thripunithura is getting little priority compared to stations like Angamaly, Mavelikkara, Karunagappally, and Cherthala.

Improvement of basic infrastructure at the station and stoppage for express trains have been long-standing demands of Thripunithura residents. Interestingly, with the extension of the Kochi metro to Thripunithura, the station will become a major transit point.

In the last seven years, there has been a three-time rise in revenue generated by the station, and passenger traffic has doubled, said V.P. Prasad, chairman of Thripunithura Rajanagari Union of Residents’ Association (TRURA).

TRURA had recently handed over a memorandum with details of revenue earned by the Thripunithura station to Hibi Eden, MP.

Mr. Prasad said the earnings of the station where only 18 trains stop (some only in one direction) were much higher compared to Angamaly where 32 trains stop. While Thripunithura earns ₹1.17 crore a month with 95,000 passengers, the revenue of Angamaly with 1.4 lakh passengers is only ₹91.7 lakh.

The station earns over ₹2 lakh a month in terms of parking fee alone, according to the information provided by the Railways, said Mr. Prasad. Nonetheless, the Railways declined to grant stoppage to the Kochuveli- Nilambur Road Rajya Rani Express at Thripunithura, saying that ticket sales were below the Railway Board’s expectations.

In the memorandum submitted to Mr. Eden, TRURA had demanded stoppage for Kerala Express, Sabari Express, Janasatabdi Express, and Amritha Express. It also said that Malabar and Jayanthi Janatha Express trains, which stop at the station in one direction, should be granted stoppage in both directions.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/6tke6m/article30937104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27KI-TRIPUNITHURA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/railways-neglecting-thripunithura-station-allege-residents/article30937105.ece
308,2020/02/28,High levels of chlorine detected in water samples,"The special squad deployed by the district administration to check the quality of water supplied by private tankers was in for a surprise after seeing the test results of a few samples taken when the team was active a week ago.

The residual chlorine levels were found 10 times higher than the maximum limit in three samples drawn from tankers collecting water from private wells in Aluva and Kalamassery. The sudden spike in chlorine levels came after previous samples tested negative for residual chlorine. The presence of residual chlorine is an indicator that sufficient amount of chlorine had been added to the water to inactivate bacteria and some viruses.

“The presence of residual chlorine was nil in majority of samples drawn from private wells. To overcome this shortcoming, the operators started adding chlorine without adhering to the guidelines. A tanker driver told us that a bucketful of chlorine was added to the tanker,” said a senior member of the squad.

The unchecked dumping resulted in chlorine levels reaching 5 mg/litre in samples examined by the team. Officials said they had decided to ask drivers to take tankers with high residual chlorine to the hydrants operated by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA). “The idea was to fill water from the hydrants till the residual chlorine level reached the prescribed limit of 0.2 mg/litre to 0.5 mg/litre,” they added. High levels of chlorine could result in irritation of eyes and throat and vomiting.

309,2020/02/28,Checks on private water tankers come to a standstill,"It follows replacement of Collector’s orders with govt. guidelines

The inspection of private water tankers to find out possible distribution of contaminated water has come to a halt in the city.

The situation emerged after a meeting of the district administration held on February 18 to discuss drinking water supply by private tankers announced that the orders issued by the District Collector had been replaced by government guidelines.

The appointment of an eight-member squad to check water tankers on a regular basis was one of the key decisions taken at the district-level on the recommendations of the Assembly Committee on Petitions. The committee had taken a strong position following complaints that water tankers had been collecting water from illegal sources.

Officials of the special squad pointed out that they used to conduct regular checks at select points in the city and the outskirts over the last few weeks. Two-thirds of the samples taken from tankers drawing water from private wells were found to have the presence of coliform bacteria, an indication of faecal contamination. There is no clarity whether the State-level guidelines insist on such regular monitoring and checks, they said.

The official communication issued by the district administration after the meeting also lacked clarity whether water tankers should install Global Positioning System (GPS) to enable enforcement agencies to track their movement. The Assembly Committee had on December 6 recommended that the district administration set a deadline for operators to set up GPS facility. Even though January 31 was fixed as the deadline, only a handful of tanker operators had installed the facility.

Meanwhile, Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) officials admitted that they had not been told to take action against tanker operators who had not installed GPS on their vehicles. “We have almost completed the registration of tankers operating in the district,” they said.

According to the district administration, the State-level guidelines say that drinking water should be supplied by tanker lorries that have Food Business Operator (FBO) licence under the Food Safety and Standards (Licensing and Registration) Regulations, 2011.

All drinking water supply sources, other than the Kerala Water Authority hydrants, should have FBO licence. Water should be collected for distribution only from such licensed sources. The sources should have certificates proving the safety and quality of water. At the same time, water quality should be tested every six months at government laboratories or those accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/78gvfl/article30937056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28KI-drinking-watercol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/checks-on-private-water-tankers-come-to-a-standstill/article30937058.ece
310,2020/02/28,Shortage of clotting factors at Haemophilia Treatment Centre,"Haemophilia patients resort to panic buying

Mohammed Rasil, 21, from Muvattupuzha has been at the Haemophilia Treatment Centre (HTC) at Aluva for the past two weeks. His mother Subi says lack of blood clotting factors has confined her son to bed. It is surprising that clotting factor 8 is unavailable even at the State centre at Aluva.

On Tuesday, Rasil was given cryo precipitate, a by-product of blood plasma, from the blood bank as the factor was not available. It gives some relief but is not really effective in case of severe pain, says Ms. Subi.

She has to visit Karunya Pharmacy at Ernakulam, Perumbavur, or Angamaly every day to buy factors as pharmacies provide only the recommended dosage for a day. Since factors were not available at pharmacies on Tuesday, cryo was prescribed.

Rasil is an inpatient at the HTC, and his medicines have to be procured every day after getting approval from Kerala Medical Services Corporation Limited (KMSCL), which is responsible for all drug purchases by the government and distribution under various schemes through Karunya pharmacies. Rasil’s requirement of 2,000 units a day was cut down, and he was given only 1,000 units a day for nearly a week.

Anil Kumar Nair, 52, from Thrissur is another patient at the HTC. His surgery for kidney stone removal is being delayed thanks to unavailability of clotting factor 8. He has been at HTC for the past one week.

Similarly, Jehangir, 22, from Thiruvananthapuram, has been at the HTC for a month now. His daily requirement is 2,000 units of clotting factor 8. Though his mother Sheeja visits the pharmacy daily, she gets less dosage.

Mujeeb M., 42, from Malappuram, reached HTC on Tuesday. “Reaching here, I realised that even at the State centre, medicines are not available,” he says.

According to KMSCL general manager Dr. Dileepkumar, as many as 4,000 units of factor 8 are required a month at the HTC, and there is a stock of 2,878 units now to see through the month. “Stock for the next month will arrive soon. There is no panic situation. All the factor units required are approved immediately,” he says. Still, patients resort panic buying. “We are not providing factors for stocking at home,” says Dr. Dileepkumar.

The supply of potable water using unlicensed vehicles by various private agencies is in full swing in the city with even as the district administration is yet to come up with specific guidelines on water supply in view of the summer season. Sources of water collected by such vehicle operators remain unknown as local bodies are ignoring the issue in the absence of a district-level directive.

The regulations fixed by the Food Safety Department stipulate that the licence number of water suppliers should be displayed on tanker lorries during the service. However, there are still vehicles in operation without any such number. Similarly, drivers who are responsible for keeping a copy of all the certificates proving the quality of water, its source and fitness certificates of dealers concerned are seemingly ignorant of the responsibility in the absence of enforcement drives. Though hotels and industrial units continue to be the main customers of such suppliers, they too don’t verify the documents and check the quality of water.

Some of such clients have even defended their stance saying that they never use the water for drinking or cooking purposes. According to them, the water purchased from such suppliers is used for cleaning purposes.

Packaged water

Apart from tankers, wayside eateries are reportedly sourcing packaged drinking water supplied at a lower cost by unregistered agencies. Such bottles have no proper labels bearing details of manufacturers. Helplines mentioned in some bottles are not even operational.

Meanwhile, Food Safety Department officials said a State-level directive regarding rules and regulations to be followed while supplying potable water using tanker lorries had already been issued and any suspected violations could be communicated to the department through the toll free number-18004251125. The district-level directive for public awareness would be issued soon, they added.

A senior official attached to the regional office of the Food Safety Department said checking squads had already launched surprise inspections in the district. “However, staff shortage was making full-fledged operations difficult,” the official said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/k7ytmd/article30945475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01CTTANKER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/water-supply-by-unlicensed-operators-goes-unchecked/article30945476.ece

The third edition of the Malabar Innovation Fest was kicked off at the Regional Science Centre (RSC) and Planetarium here on Saturday.

Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran opened the three-day event which is aimed at fostering innovative science ideas, projects and inventions.

An obstacle-avoiding robot presented by Mohammed Anseel and K.M. Amal from the RSC Innovation Club was one of the innovative projects which attracted the visitors on the first day. The mobile robot was designed in such a way as to avoid collision with unexpected objects with the support of ultrasonic sensors.

A candle power bank developed by students from Government Polytechnic College, Meenangadi, was another attraction. It can be charged without electricity. They came up with the innovative model as it could be used during emergency situations and unexpected power outage.

Effective waste segregation instruments, navigation aid for visually challenged persons, and air-conditioners with advanced features were among the other projects presented by students. A robot made by the RSC staff using electronic waste too drew the attraction of many visitors.

RSC will remain open up to 8.30 p.m. till the conclusion of the fest on March 1.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/4s4erw/article30944808.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200228-WA0020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/fostering-innovative-science-projects/article30944809.ece
314,2020/02/28,Minister calls for investmentin small-scale industries,"District Industries Centre holds investors’ meet

An increase in small-scale investments will pave the way for better economic growth and an increase in the number of local employment opportunities, Minister for Transport A.K. Saseendran has said.

Opening an investors’ meet organised by the District Industries Centre here on Saturday, Mr. Saseendran said the hurdles caused by red-tapism had already vanished from the State. “With the positive evolutions in the sector, the majority of investors have changed their earlier perception that Kerala was not an investor-friendly State,” he observed.

According to him, the number of total labour days in Kerala’s industrial sector was satisfactory as protests affecting the functioning of industrial units were on the decline. “We have managed to maintain this positive ambiance for over four years,” he claimed.

Referring to the pro-industrial policies of the State government, Mr. Saseendran said any investor who wanted to start a venture below ₹10 crore will be able to do it now without any official hurdles or technicalities. “Kerala is again moving ahead with such novel decisions to attract more investors,” he pointed out.

Addressing the meet, A. Pradeepkumar, MLA, said the investors’ meet organised following the directive of the State government had already helped many entrepreneurs to express their ideas and suggestions in an effective way. He also promised efforts to ensure continuity in holding such meets in the future.

District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao said Kerala was witnessing a slew of model investor-friendly development initiatives in the industrial sector. He said the single-window clearance system was implemented effectively in the State.

District Industries Centre Manager I. Gireesh moderated the discussions. Sessions were held on the need to follow business ethics, use of modern technology to boost the business and ways to overcome unexpected business challenges. A face-to-face with prominent investors was also held.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/minister-calls-for-investmentin-small-scale-industries/article30944194.ece
315,2020/02/28,Forest officials blamed for delay in hill highway work,"Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran has accused forest officials of delaying the work on the hill highway.

Inaugurating the Kacherikkadavu bridge here on Friday, he said the Karnataka Forest Department should be blamed for delaying the hill highway work. Kerala forest officials too were taking a negative stand on the project. Even though the Forest Minister had given instructions, the officials were not taking necessary action. Twelve stretches were yet to be completed along the hill highway, he said.

The Minister said several applications were submitted to the Forest Department in connection with the highway.

The new bridge was built parallel to the existing narrow bridge across the Kootupuzha, connecting Ayyankunnu and Payam panchayats. The bridge, which links the State Highway 30 Thalassery - Coorg Road and the Valavapara - Kacherikkadavu Palathukadavu Road, is 66.96 m long and 11.5 m wide. There is a 1.50-m wide walkway on both sides.

316,2020/02/28,PWD moots installation of solar panels on proposed bridge,"KIIFB team reviews DPR on Kunjali Marakkar bridge

The National Highway wing of the Public Works Department (PWD) has come up with an innovative idea to generate solar power worth ₹27 lakh a year by installing solar panels on the proposed Kunjali Marakkar bridge at Iringal at Vadakara. A detailed project report (DPR) has already been submitted to the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) for implementing the idea along with the construction of the bridge.

Officials attached to the National Highway Bypass Sub Division (Kozhikode) of the PWD claim that it will be the first such bridge project in India which will harness solar energy through a grid of solar cells to be fixed with the support of the Kerala State Electricity Board. The expected daily production on completion of the proposed grid-connected project will be 142 kW, they add.

The east-west direction of the bridge will be used to fix solar panels for the generation of maximum power. About 1,400 square metre area will be covered using solar panels to achieve the daily production target.

The total length of the new bridge, which will connect Iringal with Vadakara sandbanks as part of the ongoing Kozhikode coastal highway project, is 564 metre.

“The solar panels will be fixed without affecting the architectural beauty of the bridge. Sufficient space will be provided under the bridge to fit the switch circuit and other controlling devices,” says PWD (NH) Assistant Executive Engineer P.B. Baiju.

He also adds that the DPR submitted for the project has already been reviewed by the KIIFB team and measures are under way to acquire land for project execution.

Apart from the solar power generation plan, the bridge will have some creative design elements that reflect the region’s historical association with Zamorin’s naval chief Kunjali Marakkar.

The approved design which was prepared by the Design Research Investigation and Quality Control Board under the PWD has incorporated sword as the main theme.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/6ymsz2/article30939797.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28CTKUNJALIMARAKKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/pwd-moots-installation-of-solar-panels-on-proposed-bridge/article30939799.ece
317,2020/02/28,"New facilities to be opened at General Hospital, MCH","CT scanner at GH is expected to reduce rush at medical college, says MLA

Some new facilities are all set to be opened at two of the major public health institutions in Kozhikode city on Friday.

While the Government General Hospital will get a new CT scan machine and a high-tension sub-station, the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) will have a collection well and pump house for a sewage treatment plant, 16 slice CT scanner, out-patient ticket counters, USG scanner and an ortho intensive care unit.

Minister for Health and Family Welfare K.K. Shylaja would declare them open on Saturday, A. Pradeep Kumar, MLA, told the media on Thursday.

Mr. Kumar said that the sub-station would help address the future needs of the general hospital where more facilities were expected to be opened in the coming years. Efforts were on to set up a stroke unit there.

“The CT scanner is expected to help poor patients. It will reduce rush at the medical college hospital too,” Mr. Kumar pointed out. He said that a detailed project report for ₹177 crore had been submitted to the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board for approval to take up new works. Work was on for a cardiology department and an outpatient ward as well as a cath lab, he added.

The sewage treatment plant at the medical college hospital is being implemented as part of the zero waste medical college project. The plan is to reduce the discharge of sewage to Mayanad, which is leading to high level of pollution in the area. OP ticket counters are being set up as part of the Ardram Mission.

The 16 slice CT scanners to be opened at the Institute of Maternal and Child Health would help poor patients, especially children, avoid approaching the medical college wards.

The ortho ICU would have 20 beds and other facilities.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/k2180m/article30939778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27KIHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/new-facilities-to-be-opened-at-general-hospital-mch/article30939779.ece
318,2020/02/28,DISHA review meeting held after two years,"Discussion of projects implemented under NRuM leads to heated debate

MADURAI

After a gap of about two years, the review meeting of District Development Coordination and Monitoring Committee (DISHA) was held to assess the implementation of Central government schemes in Madurai at the Collectorate on Friday. Officials sources said there was a heated debate during the discussion of projects implemented under the National Rurban Mission (NRuM).

Members of Parliament Su. Venkatesan (Madurai), the chairman of the committee, B. Manickam Tagore (Virudhunagar) and O.P. Raveendranath Kumar (Theni), both vice-chairmen, and Collector T.G. Vinay, secretary of the committee, participated in the meeting. Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar also attended the meeting.

In Madurai, Kovilpappakudi and 15 surrounding village panchayats were chosen for implementation of the NRuM. Sources said three projects under the NRM, including a proposal for laying solar panels for ₹2 crore, were cancelled by the Committee. The Committee Chairman also ordered the Collector to inquire about the condition of soak pits built under the scheme.

Official sources said in the meeting, which was held for four and a half hours, 32 schemes were reviewed.

Mr. Venkatesan said the committee would monitor the implementation of the Central schemes at the ground level and take necessary action if there were any discrepancies. He emphasised the need for coordination among different departments.

Speaking during the meeting, Mr. Udhayakumar said the committee would guide the officials during the implementation of development projects. He also said the committee was important to coordinate among various departments in the implementation of projects.

Mr. Manickam Tagore stressed that review meeting must be held once in every four months. Mr. Raveendranath said he would work to address drinking water issues in Sholavandan and Usilampatti constituencies, which came under his purview. He also said top priority would be given to building houses for the homeless and to skill development of women.

319,2020/02/28,Court calls for the formation of guidelines to engage senior lawyers in SC/ST Act cases,"Judges says this will help District Magistrates across the State follow a uniform pattern

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has directed the State government to frame appropriate guidelines to be followed by District Magistrates (DMs) while exercising their powers for engaging eminent senior advocates for conducting trial under the SC/ST Act and Rules, within one month.

The court was hearing a petition filed in 2008 by M. Mallika of Pudukkottai district, seeking a direction to declare the term ‘senior’ as found in Rule 4 (5) of the Scheduled Caste and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995, null and void.

The contention of the petitioner was that guidelines must be framed by the State government for deciding on the eminence of an advocate based not only on the years of practice, but also on the actual and effective practice.

Disposing of the writ petition, a Division Bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad observed that the words ‘eminent senior advocate’ in Rule 4 (5) of the SC/ST Rules was not a synonym of the definition of a senior advocate as contained in the Advocates Act, 1961 (Designated Senior Advocates).

The court said that, “A lawyer having ample years of practice with a substantial expertise in the field of criminal law can be considered to be eminent even if he is not a designated senior advocate under the 1961 Act. The purpose is to make available the best legal brain.....for the purpose of conducting trial as per the provisions of the 1995 Rules.”

“Guidelines and parameters are required to be formulated by the government so that the same can be uniformly applied throughout the State by the DMs......”, the court said.

The court observed that though a long standing at the bar beyond a period of 10 years might be a necessary benchmark, the eminence of a lawyer should be gauged also by the nature and number of cases handled by him, more particularly in the field of criminal law, in order to place him in the panel of eminent senior advocates to be engaged by the DMs.

A committee, comprising the DM and the Principal District Judge, could be formed to suggest and recommend the names of such advocates to the panel. “Care should be taken about the integrity and the ethical standards of the lawyer as well, which is more important in matters of such crimes to ensure that the advocate is otherwise not influenced either way while conducting the trial,” the court said.

Further, the court observed that “The parameters, therefore, have to rest on expert as well as ethical considerations with emphasis on an effective engagement of a lawyer who is dedicated towards the cause and not merely his professional placement”.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/form-guidelines-for-engaging-senior-advocates-to-conduct-scst-act-cases-madurai-hc-pudukottai/article30945394.ece

The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has transferred the missing case of an advocate’s 17-year-old son to the CB-CID. A Division Bench of Justices T. Raja and B. Pugalendhi ordered a CB-CID probe taking into account that the boy went missing last year.

In his petition, advocate N. Ganesan of Pudukkottai district said that his son, a student of Class 12 went missing from their home on September 4, 2019. He said that his two-wheeler also went missing on that day. He added that his son did not have a mobile phone.

Unable to trace his son, he said that he had lodged a complaint with the police on September 5. However, his son was yet to be traced by the police. He said that his belief in astrology had led him to Coimbatore and on inquiring some hotel owners, they recognised the photo of his son and claimed to have seen him.

The hotel owners told the petitioner that his son had approached them for a job, but they had turned down the request. Though this was informed to the police, they had not made any efforts to look into the case from this angle, he said. He sought a direction to the police to trace his missing son.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-transfers-boy-missing-case-to-cb-cid/article30945259.ece
322,2020/02/28,Graduates ready to work as night watchman and office assistant,"Need for promoting vocational education for them stressed

Madurai

K. Muthumalai*, an MBA graduate who has been on a job hunt since 2014, recently attended an interview at the Collectorate held for the post of an office assistant.

“Though I am overqualified for the post, I hope that I get this job so as to meet the financial needs of my family,” he says.

Mr. Muthumalai is among 199 graduates who attended the interview for the post of an office assistant, which requires a minimum qualification of Class 8 pass. Out of the 657 candidates, who were called for the interview, nearly 50% of them were graduates. A total of 487 candidates attended the interview, and around 43% of them were graduates.

Similarly, 338 candidates were called for the interview for three posts of night watchman, which does not require any educational qualification. Among those candidates, more than 30% were graduates. A total of 278 candidates attended the interview, and around 19% of them were graduates.

In these interviews, which were conducted by the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, a large number of graduates, including those who had completed M.Sc., M. Com., and M.A. had participated, indicating the level of unemployment among graduates in the district.

Mr. Muthumalai says that there are fewer jobs available in the market which pays them a good salary in accordance with their educational qualification.

“Many private companies offer roles which pay a monthly sum of only around ₹ 8,000. With the increasing competition, it is very difficult to get a job that offers a position in relation to the education qualification,” he says.

V. Mahesh*, an M. Sc. graduate, who attended the interview for the post of a night watchman, says that there is no job security available in the private sector.

“Many private organisations hire us only on a temporary basis for a lower salary. There is always this constant fear that we might be asked to resign from our jobs at any time,” he says.

Another candidate, N. Vignesh*, a B.E. graduate, says that the pressure of repayment of education loan is building. “This forced me to attend the interview,” he says. The main problem is that there is a major mismatch between the number of jobs available in the market and the number of students who graduate every year, says G. Kalyanasundaram, Chair of Madurai Chapter of Young Indians, a wing of the Confederation of Indian Industries.

Adding to these problems, the employability skills of the graduates are also poor, he adds.

One of the ways to tackle this issue would be to promote vocational education among graduates and focus on developing their skill sets, says Madurai District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association President B. Muruganantham.

“The skill development agency of the government and its policies must be promoted. Developing the skill sets of graduates will help to create more entrepreneurs, which, in turn, will create more job opportunities,” he says.

325,2020/02/28,BJP takes out pro-CAA rally in southern districts,"Cadre demand legal action against political parties ‘spreading false information’

Supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act, the Bharatiya Janata Party cadre took out a procession here on Friday evening.

Led by Tirunelveli city district president Maharajan, the BJP cadre took out the rally in support of CAA, National Register of Citizenship and National Population Register from a private school on south bypass road towards the District Collectorate.

However, the processionists were stopped near the District Science Centre, where they organised a meeting in support of CAA, NRC and NPR.

Led by former Union Minister Pon. Radhakrishnan, they submitted a memorandum to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish. In the memorandum, they demanded legal action against the DMK, Congress, CPI, CPI (M), Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi and the Muslim outfits “for spreading false information” about the CAA, NRC and NPR.

Mr. Radhakrishanan said these political parties, with the ulterior motive of inciting violence across the country, were carrying out malicious campaign and hence tough legal action should be taken against them.

When Mr. Radhakrishnan demanded action against the ongoing relay dharna in Melapalayam by the Muslims, Ms. Shilpa said cases under appropriate sections had been registered against these protestors since it was going on without police permission.

Thoothukudi

In Thoothukudi, the BJP cadre, led by party’s Thoothukudi south district president P. M. Paulraj, staged a demonstration at Chidambara Nagar bus stop in which Mr. Radhakrishnan, women’s wing secretary Victoria Gowri and Rajya Sabha MP Sasikala Pushpa, who defected from the AIADMK to join the BJP recently, participated.

Addressing the protestors, Mr. Radhakrishnan said the Congress, the DMK, the Left parties, Muslim outfits and the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi were spreading false information about CAA, NRC and NPR even though the Centre had made it clear that no Indian citizen would be affected by it. Since these political parties and the Muslim outfits were inciting violence by spreading false information, the State Government should initiate appropriate legal action against these parties and the religious outfits.

When the BJP cadre took out a rally from the protest venue towards the Collectorate, they were stopped at Vembadi Esakkiamman Temple from where Mr. Radhakrishnan, Ms. Sasikala, Ms. Victoria and a few others went to the Collectorate in a car to submit petition in the Collector’s Office.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/9e6mfm/article30944235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA29BJPTUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/bjp-takes-out-pro-caa-rally-in-southern-districts/article30944236.ece

328,2020/02/28,"‘People’s Right to Health violated by quacks, unrecognised medical practitioners’","Centre, State should keep a check on institutions offering invalid courses: HC

MADURAI

Dismissing a batch of petitions filed by practitioners holding an unrecognised medical diploma, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday observed that people’s Right to Health was violated and proper medical care denied by quacks and such medical practitioners.

Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana observed that the case of the petitioners was a classic case of students undergoing an unrecognised course and even after the completion of the course they had to linger around the court at the cost of their time, money and risk, for which they were not responsible.

“Eventually the life of the patient is at risk....The quality/faith in the medical education would come down significantly if the existence of these unrecognised medical certificates are permitted to be issued or granted... talented doctors are also put to jeopardy,” the judge said.

The Central and State governments should take the responsibility to keep a check on such institutes so that students were not admitted and given a diploma, which at the end turned out to be invalid or unrecognised. The students should also be cautious before choosing an institute, the court said.

Taking cognisance of the fact that the medical practice was not recognised, the court said the common man and aspiring students should be informed and awareness be created with regard to unrecognised courses. As this had caused serious prejudice to the lives of the young petitioners, the Central and State governments were directed to take immediate action against bogus institutes and keep a check on them.

The court was hearing a batch of petitions filed by practitioners holding unrecognised diploma in Electropathy/Electro Homeopathy. The petitioners said they had completed a three-year diploma course and were practising the system of medicine.

They had sought recognition from Tamil Nadu Homeopathy Medical Council (TNHMC). But, their request was turned down. The practitioners moved the High Court challenging the decision of the TNHMC to turn down their request.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/peoples-right-to-health-violated-by-quacks-unrecognised-medical-practitioners-madurai-high-court/article30943915.ece
329,2020/02/28,Murder-for-gain case solved after five long years,"MADURAI

Madurai City police have cracked a five-year-old murder-for-gain case with the arrest of three accused and recovery of two sovereigns of gold and four weapons used in the crime.

The accused have been identified as M. Kannan, 24, of Vazhaithoppu, M. Vijay, 22, of Coimbatore, and R. Chellapandi, 19, of Kamarajapuram. The case pertains to the murder of R. Suryaprabha, 59, on the first floor of her house in Keeraithurai. The woman was found dead with multiple stab and cut injuries, and over 17 sovereigns of gold jewellery on her body were missing on September 2, 2015. The case, registered by Keeraithurai police, was later handed over to the Serious Crime Squad. However, it remained undetected since then.

Meanwhile, Madurai Commissioner of Police S. Davidson Devasirvatham formed a special team to assist the Serious Crime Squad, led by Inspector G. Srinivasan, who assumed office three months back. The team was supervised by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) E. Karthik and City Crime Branch Assistant Commissioner of Police Justine Prabhakaran.

The team managed to gain the confidence of the locals and started to follow various suspects. With some vital clues, the team first nabbed Kannan. During interrogation, he reportedly confessed to his involvement in the crime along with four others.

After his arrest on Sunday, the police also recovered four knives the accused had used to assault the woman. Based on his confession, the police arrested Chellapandi and Vijay. The police recovered two sovereigns of gold from Kannan.

A police officer said the accused, who were involved in petty thefts, targeted the woman for her jewellery. After following her for sometime, they went to her house ensuring that she was alone. “They gained entry into the house claiming that they had come to buy white metal gift articles, which her daughter-in-law was selling from home. The woman took them to the room on the first floor,” a police officer said.

Within a few minutes, the accused pounced on her and indiscriminately attacked her with sharp weapons. As the women collapsed dead, they took away her jewellery and fled the scene.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/murder-for-gain-case-solved-after-five-long-years-madurai/article30936378.ece

Of them, first rank holder, Nithyananda from Attur in Karkala, was the cynosure of all eyes when he received the degree certificate from Vice-Chancellor P.S. Yadapadithya at the 38th convocation of the university here on Thursday.

The audience applauded his achievement with a big thumbs-up.

His mother, Vinodha, an anganawadi assistant in Karkala, took her son, born visually impaired, to the dais to receive the certificate.

Nithyananda lost his father, Narayana Poojary, 12 years ago.

His two brothers, Nithesh and Nithin, are studying their diploma and ITI courses, respectively.

After receiving the degree, he told reporters that his visually impaired classmates Gururaj from Belthangady and Pradeep from Udupi had bagged the second and third ranks, respectively. But they were not present to receive the certificates at the convocation.

He said that a computer software helped them in their studies while they pursued their course. They wrote the examination with the help of their attendants.

Nithyananda said that Braille had helped them in their education till pre-university. Earlier, he studied at the Roman Catherine School for the Blind in Mangaluru.

He said that he could make it with support from teachers of Alva’s College and his friends. The teachers gave them special attention in their studies. He said that the three studied the notes given by their teachers using screen reading software because Braille textbooks for the course were not available.

He thanked M. Mohan Alva, chairman, Alva’s Education Foundation, for imparting him free education and providing free hostel accommodation. He is now searching for a job.

334,2020/02/28,Liberal education required at undergraduate level: Minister,"‘There is a need to re-invent it in line with India’s ancient knowledge system’

Union Minister of State for External Affairs and Parliamentary Affairs V. Muraleedharan said here on Thursday that the country required vibrant multi-disciplinary institutions of high quality that increased the capacity of higher education and ensured equitable access.

Delivering the 38th convocation address at Mangalore University, the Minister said that it was highly justifiable to introduce liberal education at the undergraduate level for preparing students for future employment scenarios and professional roles.

“Simply tailoring people into jobs that exist today, but that are likely to change or disappear after some years, is suboptimal and even counterproductive,” the Minister said.

He said that the New Education Policy 2019, which was in its draft stage now, has made an earnest attempt to seek relevance as a cardinal value for the education system. It provided for multiple exit and entry options for students, starting with the secondary education stage and going all the way up to undergraduate and postgraduate education and research.

The Minister also said that there was a need to make the country’s education system relevant by re-inventing it in line with India’s ancient knowledge. The ancient Indians paid utmost attention to making the education system relevant to their times, he said.

“Everyone of the 64 Vidyas (streams) taught at the ancient Takshashila was useful to society. Today, we need to make our education system relevant to our times by re-inventing it in line with our ancient knowledge and our current priorities and challenges,” he added.

“Our youth, holding the brilliant promise of demographic dividend, must acquire domain-specific application-oriented knowledge, requisite skill-mix, positive mental attitude, constructive learning habits and progressive result-oriented values. Knowledge without character, ‘Vidya without Vinaya’, will do more damage than any good. It is needless to say that values that we pass on to our children touch their destinies much more than the valuables that we may bequeath upon them,” Mr. Muraleedharan said. The Minister told the graduates that “Indians should be proud that all of us belonged to a country which had a stellar heritage”.

The honorary doctorate was presented to K.C. Naik, a city realtor.

336,2020/02/28,Issue of Indians in West Asian jails will be taken up: Minister,"‘They are in prisons for alleged provocative social media posts’

Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan said here on Thursday that his ministry will take up, at the highest government level, the matter of some Indians languishing in West Asian jails for their provocative social media posts, through alleged hacking of their accounts if a “pattern of deliberate hacking” of social media accounts were found.

However, the ministry will take up all genuine cases of hacking with the authorities concerned, he said.

In an informal chat with reporters on the sidelines of the 38th convocation of Mangalore University, the Minister said that if there are isolated cases of alleged hacking the judicial process of the respective countries will take its course. But still they will be provided with the consular access.

The Minister said that sometimes posts were misrepresented owing to the mistranslation of the original posts made in vernacular languages into Arabic.

“Our West Asia desk has Arabic translators who can give a correct context to such posts,” he said.

Referring to two such cases relating to Kerala which he is aware of, Mr. Muraleedharan said that one case was in Saudi Arabia and another in Qatar. While the person from Saudi Arabia is out on bail, another person from Qatar has since come back. Earlier, a relative of Harish Bangera from Beejadi in Kundapur taluk of Udupi district brought to the notice of the Minister such a case.

In this case, Mr. Bangera is in a Saudi Arabia jail since December 22 for allegedly insulting religious sentiments and abusing the Saudi royal family through provocative posts on his social media account.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/hih0h8/article30936112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGMURALI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/genuine-cases-of-hacking-will-be-taken-up-muraleedharan/article30936113.ece
337,2020/02/28,"Coronavirus spread to impact India’s auto component industry, says body","China accounts for 27% of India’s automotive component imports

The supply restrictions from China caused by the spread of coronavirus, which have started adversely affecting the Indian automobile industry, is likely to have a negative impact on the automotive component and forging industries in India shortly, an industry association has said.

China accounts for 27% of India’s automotive component imports and, this year, vehicle demand in the country is projected to decline by 8.3%, the association added.

S. Muralishankar, president, Association of Indian Forging Industry (AIFI), said, “The Coronavirus is expected to have an impact on the Indian automotive industry and hence also on the automobile component and forging industries, which had already reduced their production rate due to the market conditions and on account of the impending change over to BS-VI emission norms from BS-IV from the April 1, 2020.”

China is one of the leading suppliers of automotive components in India and the slowing supply of components manufactured in China would cause shortage, he said.

As per recent reports, the impact on commercial vehicle (CV), passenger vehicle (PV) and the two-wheeler (2W) segments will be profound.

Currently, the OEMs have reduced their production plan for February and March due to the non-receipt of components, according to reports.

“The problem is further aggravated by the Chinese government's suspension of shipments by sea until further notice and allowing air-only shipments that are not suitable for auto components and forging industries, therefore the Indian OEMs are unable to plan production beyond the inventory as currently available to them,” he said.

Further, the international customers have asked for shipments to be delayed till further advice, as their supply lines too are facing the adverse impact of the disruption caused due to the shutting down of manufacturing facilities temporarily in China, he added.

“The Indian Government has also issued a notification mandating the decontamination of containers at the port prior to release to the Indian Customs,” he said.

“However, the guidelines/procedures to be followed for decontamination have not been notified, therefore it is not possible for the Indian importers to clear consignments that have already reached Indian shores on time,” he added.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bguro6/article29344217.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th06-Raghuvir-Automobile-industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/coronavirus-spread-to-impact-indias-auto-component-industry-says-body/article30940645.ece
338,2020/02/28,‘We are focusing on faster growth categories’,"Digital business, which is multiple billions, continues to grow in double digits: Cognizant CEO

Cognizant has witnessed a slew of changes in terms of its strategy, spearheaded by Brian Humphries who took charge as CEO on 1 April, 2019. Mr. Humphries talks about the company’s strategy and hiring plans. Edited excerpts:

2019 was a mixed bag for Cognizant with a lot of changes in terms of strategy. How do you see 2020 shaping up?

[The year] 2019 was the year of change for Cognizant, with a new CEO coming in. The new CEO who had inherited the company which might have been little distracted in the last few years. So, it was an important year of analysis and I tried to rally the organisation together behind the promise of returning to growth, a promise of once again being a bellwether in the IT services industry.

Through a transformation office, we have assessed where we stood at various levels in terms of our culture, our delivery organisation, commercial teams etc. We now have our so-called fit-for-growth strategy in order to scale Cognizant from $17 billion to $30 billion in the coming years. For three quarters in a row, we beat Wall Street’s expectations. [The] other good news is that there is a growing level of employee confidence, as evidenced by the fact in Q4, voluntary attrition was at its lowest level in two years. I am very optimistic that all the hard work from last year will serve us well in 2020.

What has been your major strategy shift?

We have refined our previous strategy, which allows us to expose ourselves to faster growth categories. Categories include international markets. By international markets I mean everything other than North America. Today, they represent just 24% of our business and we have a huge opportunity given that we are under penetrated in those countries.

The second part of the strategy is focusing on digital, in which we have selected four key battle grounds — data and analytics, cloud, digital engineering and Internet of Things (IoT). This business, for us today, is already multiple billions in size and larger in operations already. It continues to grow in double digits. We are also leveraging our strong balance sheet to strengthen our strategic execution.

For instance, in the last month, we have acquired two sales force platinum partners with a view to facilitating the execution of our planned strategy.

Do you think the double digit revenue growth rate is a thing of the past?

I hope not. We have a big ambition to return Cognizant to being great again. I think the momentum has been building. And there is a feeling inside of Cognizant, it is coming back and we are on the way once again here to beat and scare the competition. All this starts with client-centricity.

That has been one of the many things I have been preaching and practising ever since I joined Cognizant. As a new CEO, you want to set values and behaviours. One of things I wanted to re-integrate at the executive level is client centricity. It is going all around the world, seeing clients every day, every week and making sure we talk about new face of Cognizant and its new and refined strategy. We are planning to reinvest about $300 million back into revenue growth. One of the great things about our industry is it is huge and market is about $1.3 trillion, growing at about 5%. So, it is a huge growth market. And, there are pockets like digital where the growth is above 10%, which keeps us going.

Your lay-off announcement last year had created a lot of panic. What will be your hiring strategy?

There have not been [any] mass lay-offs and they were just rumours. We are planning to increase our headcount in India. We are adding 23,000 freshers this year starting June, when compared to the 17,000 we added last year. So, you are seeing our commitment to India on an the ongoing basis.

Once in a while, you have to reshape your pyramid because you became little bit heavy in the middle or the top. We will always do that. I don’t wake up and think about headcount reduction, I wake up to think about growth. Currently we are here to make sure that our employees are working for a winning company and drive higher growth rate. Given our focus on digital business, we have gone on record to say we need 25000 skilled people to meet the growth we anticipate in the business. Me and our Indian Head Ramkumar Ramamoorthy have spent a great deal of time working with Universities in India on the required skill sets. The 25000 requirement would be met through combination of freshers hiring and training them, reskilling of existing employees and also through laterals.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ip7u0z/article30936361.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28BUBRIANHUMPHRIES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/we-are-focusing-on-faster-growth-categories/article30936362.ece

Indian stocks nosedived on Friday, that saw most equity benchmarks the world over lose heavy ground as concerns on the global impact of COVID-19 outbreak made investors turn cautious towards risky assets such as equities.

The benchmark Sensex lost a whopping 1,448.37 points, or 3.64%, to close at 38,297.29. This was the sixth straight session of losses for the index during which it lost a little over 3,000 points.

On Friday, Sensex constituents such as Reliance Industries and HDFC lost over 4% in a single day. Overall, more than 2,000 stocks lost ground on the BSE againstabout 400 gainers.

Meanwhile, the broader Nifty settled at 11,201.75, shedding 431.55 points, or 3.71%. Incidentally, the India VIX index surged almost 28% on Friday to end at 23.24 and was now not very far from its 52-week high of 30.18.

“Indian equity market plunged sharply today hitting the lowest level since mid-October on fears that COVID-19 outbreak may trigger a recession across major economies,” said Siddhartha Khemka, head, retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, adding it was the worst weekly fall since 2009.

Elsewhere in Asia, the benchmarks of South Korea, China, Japan, Australia, Singapore and Thailand all lost more than 3% each. Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 870 points to 25,036 in early Friday trade.

“As COVID-19 spread rapidly around the world, hopes that it would be contained has vanished and markets fear it could turn into a pandemic.

Investors are fearful that it might lead to a global recession as the outbreak is spreading to the world’s largest economy — the U.S. as well as Europe which will adversely impact the global supply chains big time and derail economic growth,” added Mr. Khemka.

FPI sell equities

Back in India, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) sold equities worth nearly ₹1,500 crore, bringing its net flows in the current month at about a paltry ₹1,800 crore. In January, FPIs were net buyers at ₹12,123 crore.

The fall would have been steeper if domestic institutional investors, that include insurance firms and mutual funds, did not step up their buying with net purchases of almost ₹7,700 crore.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/vdanhp/article30317499.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THRTRSTOCKEXCHANGE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/sensex-tracks-global-markets-plunge/article30945826.ece
341,2020/02/28,"COVID-19 | Dow drops 1,000 points as pandemic fears heighten","Defensive lead losses among sectors; S&P and Nasdaq too down.

The Dow Jones Industrials slumped more than 1,000 points in intraday trading for the third time this week on February 28, as the rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak raised fears of global recession.

Over the week, virus fears have wiped nearly $3 trillion off the combined market value of S&P 500 companies, putting the three main indexes on track their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis.

As the world prepares for a likely pandemic, investors rushed to safe assets, deepening an inversion of the U.S. Treasury yield curve, a classic recession signal.

The benchmark S&P 500 fell about 12% from its record closing high hit last week, confirming its fastest correction in history on February 27.

All the 11 S&P sectors shed at least 2% and the defensive utilities, consumer staples and real estate sectors dropped more than 3%. The three sectors have outperformed the benchmark index this month.

“This selling is a bit extreme for something that we don't know enough about,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.

“What I do know is that the coronavirus is not going to lead us into a financial crisis that is long lasting. It could put us in a technical recession, but the real concern is does that recession cause the U.S. consumer to pare back on spending?”

While the magnitude of the economic damage from the containment measures, which have crippled supply chains and hit business investment, remained unclear, analysts have sharply downgraded their outlook for growth and corporate earnings.

Adding to worries, the Commerce Department's data on Friday showed U.S. consumer spending rose less than expected in January, a loss of momentum that could be exacerbated by the virus outbreak.

Traders are now pricing in an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve as soon as next month, but many have expressed doubts about how this would mitigate the impact of the outbreak.

Among individual stocks, Mylan NV dropped 6% after the drugmaker cautioned a financial hit from the coronavirus outbreak and warned of drug shortages in case of continued spread of the virus.

The Indian Rupee plunged by 60 paise to settle at 72.21 (provisional) against the U.S. dollar on Friday, tracking heavy sell-offs in domestic equities and sustained foreign fund outflows.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 71.90 to the U.S. dollar. During the day, it hit a low of 72.29.

The domestic unit finally settled at 72.21, down 60 paise over its previous close.

Continuing its downward spiral for the sixth straight session, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 1,448.37 points, or 3.64%, lower at 38,297.29.

This was the benchmark’s second-worst drop in absolute terms after August 24, 2015, when it had plunged 1,624.51 points.

Similarly, the broader NSE Nifty sank 431.55 points or 3.71% to end at 11,201.75.

Investor sentiment remained fragile amid sustained foreign fund outflows and concerns over the impact of coronavirus outbreak on the global economy, traders said.

China reported 44 more deaths from the novel coronavirus epidemic on Friday and 327 fresh cases. The death toll now stands at 2,788 in mainland China, according to the National Health Commission.

Global markets went into a tailspin on Friday as investors stampeded out of stocks and commodities and flocked to the relative safety of government bonds, prompted by fears of a global recession due to the spread of the coronavirus.

After Wall Street experienced its worst rout since 2011 on Thursday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 1,190.95 points — its largest single-day drop in history — global markets took their cue on Friday. Indices across the world, beginning with Tokyo’s Nikkei, Seoul’s Kospi and European indices such as the FTSE 100 in London and Frankfurt’s DAX, were all bathed in red as investors rushed to dump shares.

Uncertain impact

Markets were spooked by the uncertain impact of the virus on global economic health.

The BSE Sensex sank by 1,448.37 points, or 3.64%, to close at 38,297.29. This is its sixth straight session of loss, and the index is now 3,976 points lower than its high of 42,273.87 points registered on January 20 this year.

Reflecting the turmoil in the stock markets, the rupee hit a six-month low against the dollar, at ₹72.27, before recovering marginally to close at ₹72.21.

Worst week

U.S. markets appeared set to experience their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis. The broad-based S&P 500 index was down 4% in early trade on Friday and is now down almost 15% since its all-time high set just six trading sessions back.

Yields on U.S. Treasury bills fell sharply as investors embraced its relative safety over stocks. The bond markets displayed an inverted yield curve where short-term bills yield more than long-term ones, signifying nervousness over economic prospects.

Yields on the 10-year Treasury bills fell to 1.17%, even as that on the 3-month bill remained at 1.43%. General economic wisdom holds that an inverted yield curve is the harbinger of a recession.

Oil prices experienced their worst week since 2016, with the prices of the benchmark Brent crude falling to as low as $50.51 a barrel. Elsewhere in the commodity markets, metal prices fell by up to 6%.

Global borrowings benchmark Libor experienced its worst single-day drop in a decade, falling to 1.46275%, as the markets raised their bets on accelerated rate cuts in the U.S. as a response to the economic turmoil.

The second wave of the coronavirus set off fears of a recession in the U.S. and the Euro zone. Ratings agency Moody’s warned that the impact of disruptions in global supply chains, investment pullbacks by companies and slowing travel could trigger a global recession in the first half of 2020.

346,2020/02/28,What should India’s joint command structure look like?,"The Chief of Defence Staff must spell out India’s strategic interests as part of a vision document

The massive restructuring of the military command structure has dismantled the old civil-military relationship, with far greater powers in decision-making now being bestowed on the armed forces. Madanjit Singh and Anit Mukherjee discuss this complex transformation in a conversation moderated by Atul Aneja. Edited excerpts:

Admiral Singh, following the Kargil War of 1999, the imperative to create a Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) assumed great importance. What were the takeaways of the debate back then on tri-service integration and how much do you think it influenced the current appointment of the CDS, the decision to set up theatre commands, backed by the formation of the Department of Military Affairs (DMA)?

Madanjit Singh: After the Kargil War, a decision was taken to overhaul the higher defence organisation as several weaknesses were detected, especially in the conduct of joint operations by the three services. Many senior officers from the services headquarters and the government spent several months in compiling the report. Besides, we reviewed procurement and indigenous production, the Defence Research and Development Organisation, manpower issues, etc. We were very conscious that military and civilian organisations have a strong sense of history and a deep cultural ethos. In a nutshell, they are extremely reluctant to change.

As I understand, there was a comprehensive review of the entire command structure after the Kargil War, which was followed by specific proposals for reforms in view of the Revolution in Military Affairs, which also demanded doctrinal changes. A nuclear dimension had also come into the equation, following the 1998 nuclear tests, the ‘no first use’ doctrine, and the need for a second strike capability through a nuclear triad. Could you weigh in on the nuclear dimension, and its broader implications on command and control?

Madanjit Singh: Yes, the task force did that [discuss the nuclear dimension]. We were of the view that we should keep the strategic assets separate from the conventional assets. We also discussed who should be on board the Nuclear Command Authority. We laid down the concept for that. We also proposed the formation of a Department of Defence Services. We did not call it DMA. We recommended that it should be headed by the Vice Chief of Defence Staff and not the CDS. We also deliberated on the theatre command concept but had recommended formation of regional commands.

It has been quite some time since the post-Kargil recommendations came. But real action is taking place now, with the appointment of the CDS, a decision in principle to form theatre commands, along with the DMA machinery. How do you explain the timing?

Anit Mukherjee: I do not think anybody knows why they created the CDS now. It’s all conjecture that the Doklam crisis with China and the Balakot air strikes in Pakistan were the trigger points. Or perhaps it was a call by the Prime Minister — that these issues were festering for too long and something decisive had to be done.

Madanjit Singh: I think the decision was more financially driven. You have all heard: in the services we don’t get enough money. The Navy had a wishlist of 200 ships, the Air Force targeted 45 squadrons. It made some people sit up and consider that with the change in the nature of warfare and limited resources, we needed to look afresh, pool and share costly assets, bring down the costs, but also sharpen the combat edge through streamlined tri-service operations.

Anit Mukherjee: But perhaps there were other issues brewing beneath the surface as well. For instance, the patchy experience with the tri-service Andaman and Nicobar Command, the first tri-service command, set up in 2001 to focus on India’s interests in southeast Asia and the Strait of Malacca. This joint command was not allowed to succeed because the three services did not want to share their assets, and did not post their best officers on it. So, with this negative experience in the background, the current leadership may have gone all out and appointed a powerful CDS capable of sweeping aside resistance from individual services. So, I want to give full credit to this government for creating an empowered office of the CDS.

While the CDS heads the DMA, is the Principal Adviser to the Defence Minister and the Military Adviser to the strategic nuclear forces, he is not — at least not yet — an operational head of the tri-service theatre commands unlike, say, the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee in the United States. Do you think this can cause problems in command and control?

Madanjit Singh: That’s a moot point, that is about the apex body... should we follow the U.S. style of Joint Chiefs of Staff model, or what other countries such as Germany follow. I think we need to clearly think this through, perhaps by appointing a dedicated task force in which the three services are involved, with a six-month time frame to define the concept, which addresses command and control aspects, which cover theatre commands and the assets they command, within the framework of our limited resources.

Do you think this theatre commands framework is something which is desirable for India, given its present and future interests? Is this the right approach structurally, to create theatre commands; dedicated tri-service commands that are to be deployed along the northern border with China, the western border with Pakistan, an air defence command, and in the maritime domain, a peninsular command. Do you think we are pursuing the right model here?

Madanjit Singh: I think before we start moving concretely in this direction, we need a clear, realistic vision document about what our strategic interests are, and flowing from that, specific roles that the theatre commands need to be perform.

Anit Mukherjee: It is very important that within the next six to eight months the CDS should come up with a vision document explaining his plan. Regarding the relevance of theatre commands, if you ask me personally, I think theatre command is something that we required day before yesterday. In the absence of theatre, you will have a duplication of functions, duplication of roles. But alongside we need to ask tougher questions of all three services as well. To the Army we need to ask: how can you go in for modernisation and increasing or maintaining manpower at the same time? To the Navy: do you really need three aircraft carriers? So, I think these are the debates that need to be had for the future of India, for the future of Indian taxpayers.

Madanjit Singh: Theatre commands work best when you have dedicated assets. The main point is, how do you allocate the resources, the permanent resources that need to be allocated, to a theatre command? The Andaman and Nicobar Command did not take off precisely because nobody allocated resources. I also wish to make one more point specific to the Navy. Given the vast maritime frontiers, the formation of one peninsular command, as recommended, is simply not good enough. If you look at the vastness of the Indian Ocean... now we are also looking at Asia-Pacific, we have got the Quad with the U.S., Japan and Australia on the radar. We need to get rid of this prolonged ‘sea blindness’ so to speak.

Is the three-year time line for rolling out theatre commands as indicated by the CDS, General Bipin Rawat, realistic? Are we creating artificial time lines here?

Anit Mukherjee: I would say three years is good enough. Because I do not think the same impetus and urgency will be there if the bureaucracy is given as much time as they want. They will keep prolonging it, and avoid difficult conversations. Of course, in the process there will be institutional winners... it won’t be painless. But I don’t think it ought to be kicked even further down the road.

In the formation of the DMA, which is a key pillar of the ongoing military reforms, the uniformed personnel for the first time appear to be in the cockpit of decision-making. Have we got the balance right here, in terms of decision-making between the civilian bureaucracy and the armed forces?

Anit Mukherjee: I have not seen this model discussed previously. It was not a part of the Committee on Defence Expenditure, not a part of the Kargil Review Committee, and not a part of the Naresh Chandra Committee. As a scholar, I have studied institutions and systems, but I cannot think of any other country with a similar system. I’m a little sceptical. But perhaps this is what you get when the civilian bureaucracy has been dragging its feet on developing a more rational model of civil-military relations. And I think after a while, perhaps somebody lost that patience with the civilian bureaucracy and went ahead with the current model.

But we have to ask a deeper question here. Under the DMA, the military has been asked to perform complex administrative roles, but I think professional military education within the armed forces is still geared far too much towards operation and training and not enough towards education. So, it is important to encourage your officers to get a wide education and not just go to the Army War College, Naval War College, Air War College, which all create their own echo chambers because exposure to the civilian stream is minimum. When I look at the U.S., at European countries, education means awareness of the wider society. So, I have been advocating for a long time the setting up of the Indian version of the National Defence University.

The National Defence University should not be the exclusive preserve of the armed forces, because the armed forces are not experts on higher education. We need to have a greater discussion among civilian policymakers, academics, military officers to think about what sort of education we are going to give to officers to equip them to perform complex inter-agency roles as demanded by institutions such as the DMA.

347,2020/02/28,A step forward in South Sudan,"With two rivals coming together to form a unity government, there is now a fragile hope for peace

The inauguration of a national unity government in South Sudan last week is a milestone following the country’s independence from Sudan in 2011. But the durability of the peace in the world’s youngest nation depends on reconciliation between the majority ethnic Nuer and Dinka communities under the terms of the 2018 peace deal. The first peace deal, attempted in 2015, two years after Juba was plunged into a civil war in 2013 that cost an estimated 3,80,000 lives, collapsed. The implementation of the 2018 deal has been slow.

A compromise

The formation of a unity government, the centrepiece of the 2018 peace agreement, was deferred twice last year over differences regarding the demarcation of regional boundaries. The new formula reflects a compromise between the government of President Salva Kiir Mayardit of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) and the opposition SPLM-IO (in Opposition). Under the new arrangement, the exiled rebel leader Riek Machar is the first vice president (among five), a position he had held until his removal in 2013 on suspicion that he was plotting a coup. A security guarantee for Mr. Machar and other opposition leaders, as also an invitation to the thousands of refugees to return home, are goodwill gestures from President Kiir.

The new package also commits to fresh appointments to a jumbo-sized cabinet, gubernatorial positions for the nation’s 10 states, and the chiefs of the three new administrative regions. The creation of administrative zones had proved contentious as recently as last week. Mr. Machar was apprehensive that such a reconfiguration was just another ruse to reward regime loyalists. President Kiir said last week that he would return to a system of 10 states from 32, a major opposition demand.

The establishment of a tribunal to try war crimes is the other pillar of the 2018 deal. Describing the accord as a turning point, President Kiir had acknowledged that the prolonged conflict since 2013 and the humanitarian crisis was a betrayal of the aspirations behind South Sudan’s independence.

Shortcomings

But last year the shortcomings of the 2018 accord became apparent. The European troika and the U.S. saw it as unrepresentative of a broad spectrum of interest groups in South Sudan, focused instead on the country’s elites. A UN report exposed the recruitment of thousands of children into military units, highlighting how regional vested interests were violating the 2018 UN and U.S. embargo on arms sales to South Sudan. A human rights watchdog revealed the diversion of oil revenues to finance armed militias.

No less damning is evidence released last week of civilian casualties, incidents of mass rape and abduction of children documented by the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan. Established in 2016, the body has said in its third report that while over a million people have been internally displaced, the deliberate obstruction of aid supplies has caused extreme hunger among more than half the population. In particular, the Commission draws attention to continued fighting between government and rebel forces in the Equatoria region, resulting in mass migration to areas bordering DR Congo. Recent executions depict a most ironic picture of a country that has been witness to mayhem and plunder. With many more remaining on death row, the Commission has called for a moratorium on the death penalty.

There is much at stake in the unity government for South Sudan’s vast majority reeling under hunger and malnutrition, and severe drought in recent years. The conduct of free and fair democratic elections in 2022 would be a critical test and confidence-building measure. Institutionalising a legitimate succession mechanism is an important element in that process, given that Mr. Kiir has remained President since independence. The people had voted for secession in a referendum nearly a decade ago. Their hopes cannot be belied by their leaders.

348,2020/02/28,Access to the trouble spot during riots,"Eyewitness accounts are crucial to understanding communal violence

We had made it to Kandy in record time, a little over two hours. On a normal day, it would have taken nearly double the time in traffic, to get to the city in Central Province from the capital, Colombo. But it wasn’t a normal day.

The roads were empty because of a police curfew declared in the district following a rampage the previous day. A mob, reportedly Sinhalese, set fire to dozens of Muslim homes and Muslim-owned shops in the area — an incident that has since been referred to as the “Digana riots” of 2018.

Triggered by a road rage incident a few days earlier, after which a group of Muslim youth fatally beat up a Sinhalese driver, it escalated into a full-blown communal riot.

Seeing the incessant news of the violence in Delhi over the past few days and reading about colleagues being attacked for trying to do their job, I am reminded of those tense days in Sri Lanka.

I travelled to Digana with a couple of journalist-friends to get eyewitness accounts from the spot, and details of the attacks carried out the previous day. Trapped inside his burning home, a 27-year-old young Muslim man had died.

But even before we met some of the affected people — the driver’s bereaved family, the young man’s father, and many others whose homes and shops were destroyed in the fire — we witnessed a fresh round of violence in Akurana, not far away. It erupted despite a police curfew in place. It went on amidst heavy police presence in the vicinity and a familiar risk of greater violence, given that Sri Lanka had witnessed similar anti-Muslim attacks in the preceding years.

Responding to the crisis, then President Maithripala Sirisena declared a national emergency, allowing the army to be summoned into action. Except that by then, much damage had been done.

Muslim shop owners watched helplessly as their assets went up in flames. Many had lost their homes. And worse, a few had lost a loved one. The Sri Lankan government blocked social media, citing inflammatory videos — some with hate speech by instigators from hard-line Sinhala Buddhist groups — and rumours as having potential to heighten tensions.

Mainstream media had access to the turbulent areas. Neither the police nor the army stopped us, unless we were too close to a building that was burning. The fact that we could see the trail of violence, its ashes and aftermath meant we could tell the story with some specifics and make some inferences with the available information.

It was obvious that the perpetrators had marked the Muslim households and shops and set them to fire, leaving out the other homes in between. It was clear that police had not intervened soon enough. The violence, which investigators later said caused losses amounting to millions, was undoubtedly communal. Names and details of some of the instigators, who were arrested and out on bail, would come up again, during the spate of anti-Muslim attacks following the Easter terror bombings in 2019. The pattern was hard to miss.

If we hadn’t been able to visit the spot, we might have been forced to maintain that it was a “Sinhala-Muslim clash”, which it was just after the accident, and not the mob attack on Muslims that it eventually turned into. Access was crucial to understand that.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kfddha/article30937218.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Digana-riotsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/access-to-the-trouble-spot-during-riots/article30934676.ece
349,2020/02/28,"Aadhaar, no standout performer in welfare delivery","Aadhaar-based biometric authentication did not reduce PDS leakages, finds Jharkhand-based empirical study

“Aadhaar has curtailed leakages of government subsidies... Through Aadhaar, savings worth ₹90,000 crore have accrued to the government,” said Ajay Bhushan Pandey, then CEO of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) and current Revenue Secretary, in UIDAI’s 2017-18 annual report.

But not so fast, say Professors Karthik Muralidharan, Paul Niehaus and Sandip Sukthankar. They have just published a new working paper in the prestigious National Bureau of Economic Research, which details findings from an extensive empirical study of the impact of Aadhaar in reducing leakages and accruing fiscal savings.

When Aadhaar was conceived a decade ago, the rationale postulated was: India spends nearly three trillion rupees a year across several core welfare programmes such as Public Distribution System (PDS), LPG, Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act etc; roughly 30-40% of this is lost in leakages; leakages are largely due to ‘ghost’ and ‘duplicate’ beneficiaries using fake identities to avail these benefits; a unique identity biometric scheme can eliminate these leakages and vastly improve efficiency in welfare delivery. In fact, the former Union Minister, Arun Jaitley, even renamed the Aadhaar Bill to ‘Targeted Delivery of Financial and other Subsidies, Benefits and Services’ Bill, making it amply clear that Aadhaar’s primary, if not sole purpose, was to improve welfare delivery efficiency. The Bill’s renaming was also a clever by half attempt to legislate it as a money bill, thereby avoiding debate and scrutiny in the Upper House.

This new research paper, the first comprehensive field study of Aadhaar, offers a sobering counter to all of us, “Aadhaarphiles”, who truly believed that Aadhaar was the panacea for India’s leaky welfare regime.

The findings

Professor Muralidharan and the rest of the team tell us that Aadhaar by itself has no impact in reducing leakages significantly. They conducted a scientifically designed study of the PDS system in Jharkhand covering 15 million beneficiaries using the technique of randomised control trials (RCT). The study was set up in a manner where one set of beneficiaries went through the Aadhaar-based biometric authentication while the other group used the old system of procuring their ration. The results were then compared to see if Aadhaar-based biometric authentication had any impact in reducing leakages.

The study concluded that Aadhaar-based biometric authentication had no measurable benefit. Aadhaar-based biometric authentication did not reduce leakages due to elimination of ghosts and duplicates, as widely perceived. On the other hand, they found that Aadhaar-based biometric authentication increased transaction costs for beneficiaries. That is, to claim ration worth ₹40, beneficiaries in the Aadhaar system incurred an additional ₹7 of costs than those in the old system, because of multiple trips to authenticate themselves and the opportunity cost of time spent. This is a whopping 17% extra cost burden of the value of the benefit they were entitled to receive.

To make matters worse, Aadhaar-based biometric authentication also introduced what empirical scientists call Type I error of exclusion. In simple terms, Aadhaar authentication falsely rejected genuine PDS beneficiaries who were then denied their ration supplies. The study finds that nearly 10% of legitimate beneficiaries were denied their ration either because they did not have their Aadhaar linked to their ration card or due to an exclusion error.

In summary, the study states that there was no direct impact of Aadhaar in reducing leakages but it denied ration to 10% of genuine beneficiaries and increased costs by 17% to those that were forced to get their ration using Aadhaar. They conclude that Aadhaar authentication for PDS in Jharkhand caused “some pain with no gain”. Put simply, Mr. Pandey’s boast of ₹90,000 crore savings solely due to Aadhaar is hollow.

These findings are sure to shock many who genuinely believed Aadhaar could be the ‘game changer’ in welfare delivery. The study was undertaken by eminent scholars using scientific techniques and published in a respected academic journal. So, there is no need to doubt its veracity or intent. The findings of Professor Muralidharan and the rest of the team also expose many larger fault lines in India’s approach to policy making.

No testing

There was widespread belief among the policy elite that ghosts and duplicates were the scourge of India’s welfare delivery and that Aadhaar would eliminate this. But this belief was never empirically tested. It was deemed to be true simply because the intellectual elite said so. Based on this belief, an entire story was concocted about improving welfare efficiency through eliminating ghosts and duplicates with Aadhaar and a whole new law was enacted to this effect.

Many studies now establish that ghosts and duplicates are not the significant cause of leakages. Would it not have been better to have undertaken a robust pilot project of scale to test the belief about ghosts and duplicates, before embarking on it nationwide?

GST parallel

This is much like the boisterous claim of policy economists for over a decade that a multitude of State taxes are a drag on inter-State commerce and hence a nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) by stripping States of their fiscal autonomy is badly needed. There was no empirical evidence to back this claim. Three years after GST, the promise of vastly improved inter-State trade and a two percentage point boost to GDP seem distant while States are hurting badly with sole dependence on the Centre for their taxes.

The other fault line in policy making that this new study exposes is the engineer’s way of measuring policy outcomes only through the prism of numerical efficiency. In an engineer’s world, if say, nine people are denied welfare due to a system error while nine million are benefited through greater efficiency, then it is considered a net benefit for society and the policy is given a thumbs up. But in a sociologist’s world and in a liberal society, a policy that could run the risk of denying welfare to just a few people, putting their lives at risk, is not worth implementing regardless of how many millions it benefits. Aadhaar was held hostage to the engineer’s worldview of policy efficacy.

350,2020/02/28,A browning east: On climate change and the Eastern Ghats,"Climate change impact warnings for Eastern Ghats underscore need for forest protection

If the Western Ghats are the crown jewels of India’s natural heritage, the Eastern Ghats spread across some 75,000 sq. km. from Odisha to southern Tamil Nadu, play an important dual role: fostering biodiversity and storing energy in trees. In these mountains exist a reservoir of about 3,000 flowering plant species, nearly 100 of them endemic, occurring in the dry deciduous, moist deciduous and semi-evergreen landscapes. Many animals, including tigers and elephants, and some 400 bird species are found in these discontinuous forests that receive an annual average rainfall of 1,200 mm to 1,500 mm. Crucially, many parts, primarily in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, provide forest produce and ecosystem services to millions. Given the key functions that the lands perform, in modulating climate, fostering biodiversity and providing sustenance, new research findings arguing that the Ghats face a serious threat from climate change, and temperature variations are a cause for worry. It is noteworthy that a disruption of the annual average temperature and diminished rainfall would rob the productivity of these forests, in terms of their ability to store carbon, and provide subsistence material. Existing data point to the impoverishment of areas experiencing rainfall reduction in the driest quarter of the year and a rise in seasonal temperature, through reduced plant species diversity and a dominant role for herbs over trees.

Protecting the Eastern Ghats, which are separated by powerful rivers — the Godavari and Krishna, to name just two — is an ecological imperative. India is committed, under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes through enhanced forest and tree cover. Yet, forest protection policies have often failed dismally. By some estimates, the Ghats have shrunk by 16% over the past century, and just one region, Papikonda National Park, lost about 650 sq. km. in two decades from 1991. Relieving the pressure on forests can be done through policies that reduce extraction of scarce resources and incentivise settled agriculture. Schemes for restoration of forest peripheries through indigenous plant and tree species, matching national commitments, could qualify for international climate finance, and must be pursued. At a broader level, the response to the warnings issued by researchers from IIT Kharagpur, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics and the University of Hyderabad in a recent publication on changes to temperature and rainfall calls for decisive steps to mitigate carbon emissions. Improving tree cover nationally is certain to confer multiple benefits, including modulation of the monsoon, improved air quality and wider spaces for biodiversity to persist.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-browning-east-the-hindu-editorial-on-climate-change-impact-on-the-eastern-ghats/article30935306.ece
351,2020/02/28,Virus marches on: On the rapid spread of COVID-19,"The rapid spread of COVID-19 outside China is cause for concern

Even as the number of laboratory confirmed cases in Wuhan and other parts of mainland China has come down in the last few days (78,497 cases and 2,744 deaths as on February 27), the spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 disease remains unchecked in a few countries. The number of countries/regions that have so far reported at least one confirmed case has also gone up in the past week — 3,346 cases from 49 countries as on February 27. This does not include the 705 confirmed cases on a cruise ship in Japanese waters. Till some time back, the cases on board the vessel were the highest outside China. But that changed on February 24 when the total number of cases reported from South Korea stood at 763, overshooting the number of cases on the ship. With 1,766 cases and 13 deaths, South Korea has the most number of infections outside China as on February 27. Beyond the high number of cases reported from South Korea, what is indeed alarming is the rate of viral spread. From just 51 cases and no deaths on February 20, the number of cases has grown rapidly each day during the last seven days. Many of the cases in the country are linked to a religious cult group. At their services in the south-eastern city of Daegu, the virus spread to many in the group, who in turn fanned out around the country, aiding viral transmission. As on February 23, the number of cases traced to the Daegu church is more than half the nation’s total of infected people. What has made it arduous for South Korea in containing the spread is the difficulty in tracing the contacts of cult members as they prefer not to disclose their affiliation to the church.

All about the China coronavirus COVID-19

The spread has been equally alarming in Iran though the numbers are far fewer compared with South Korea. From just two cases on February 20, the numbers in Iran increased to 245 on February 27; there have been 26 deaths too, the highest outside China. And from three countries in the WHO East Mediterranean region on February 21, it has increased to nine now. For the first time, one case each has been reported from South America (Brazil) and WHO African Region (Algeria). With 528 confirmed cases on Thursday, the number of those infected in Italy is more than double that of Iran; there have been 14 deaths as well. In contrast, cases have been increasing only slowly in Hong Kong; Singapore has almost cut the transmission cycle. Be it the over 500 cases in about half-a-dozen jails in China, to the large number of cases on the cruise ship and large clusters seen in churches in South Korea and Singapore, it becomes apparent that mass gatherings in enclosed spaces are an ideal ground for the virus to spread. This raises the question whether shutting down Wuhan and other cities in China, thus locking both healthy and infected people together, had provided a fertile ground for the virus to spread.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/virus-marches-on-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-rapid-spread-of-covid-19/article30935293.ece
352,2020/02/28,PRR: Govt. seeks a week’s time to resolve compensation issue,"The State government is expected to clear all issues pertaining to compensation for acquisition of land for the upcoming Peripheral Ring Road (PRR) project in a week’s time.

Farmers have been demanding a fair compensation for 1,810 acres of their land that has been earmarked for the PRR project and are staging a dharna outside the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) office. Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan on Friday chaired a meeting with officials and farmers to hear their issues. He said the compensation issue would be finalised after discussions with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa.

More than 15 years ago, nearly 4,000 landowners across 67 villages on the outskirts of Bengaluru were told by the government that they had to part with their land to relieve traffic congestion through this 65.5-km road. The farmers are against the 2013 agreement. Government agencies are yet to commence land acquisition as land losers are demanding a higher package.

In a press note, Kodihalli Chandrashekar, president, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha and Hasiru Sene, said the farmers would continue the protest at the BDA office since the government has sought one more week’s time to announce the compensation package.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/prr-govt-seeks-a-weeks-time-to-resolve-compensation-issue/article30946009.ece
353,2020/02/28,Proposal to hike guidance value by 5 to 10%,"Buying a house may become a more expensive prospect as a proposal to hike guidance value by 5 to 10% has been placed before the government. Sources said the government is likely to take a decision by mid-March.

Last year, the Department of Stamps and Registrations had hiked the guidance value by 5% to 25%. Guidance value is the base price of properties in a particular area fixed by the government. Property registrations cannot go below that fixed price. It is a major revenue source for the State.

Sources said the proposal has factored in the inflation rate as well as cost of living. “We have to revise it every year. A 5 to 10% enhancement is what we are looking at this time, and the proposal is with the government,” said an official..

Before the hike in 2019, the guidance value had been hiked in March 2017. But reasons such as the slump following demonetisation and the Assembly elections had resulted in the guidance value not being revised. Officials had said that there had been a huge gap between the guidance value and market rates before the 2019 revision.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/proposal-to-hike-guidance-value-by-5-to-10/article30945923.ece
354,2020/02/28,COMEDK official kidnapped and robbed,"The accused allegedly demanded ₹30 lakh in cash for his safe release

The Jnanabharathi police are on the lookout for eight people who allegedly kidnapped a COMEDK official, robbed him of cash and forced him to sign cheques amounting to ₹15 lakh. The alleged incident took place on Thursday morning near his house in Ullal.

The victim, Gururaj R. Bhatt, was heading to work on his motorcycle when a man on another two-wheeler stopped him, said the police. The person confirmed his identity and then asked if he could talk to him. As soon as Bhatt parked his bike by the side of the road, six people surrounded him and bundled him into a waiting car.

“Bhatt tried to resist but in vain. The men started driving towards Tumakuru. In his statement, he said that throughout the journey, the men questioned him about his assets and accused him of making money illegally,” said a police officer.

When Bhatt denied the charge, the men allegedly questioned him about a family feud over a property. The men allegedly demanded ₹30 lakh in cash for his safe release. He told them that he did not have the money.

The men allegedly searched his bag and stole three pen drives, a cheque book and two ATM cards.

“When they reached NICE road, one of the kidnappers made a call to another person and received instructions. They then asked the victim to sign three cheques of ₹5 lakh each before taking him to an ATM where they withdrew ₹40,000 after forcing him to reveal the PIN number,” the police officer added.

Bhatt was allegedly confined to the car for several hours before the accused set him free at Goraguntepalya. “One of the accused was riding his motorcycle and had been following the car,” said the police. The men drove away after allegedly warning him against alerting the police.

Bhatt returned home on his motorcycle and narrated the alleged incident to his family before approaching the police who have taken up a case.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/comedk-official-kidnapped-and-robbed/article30945531.ece
355,2020/02/28,BIFFes 2020: On the language of cinema and telling stories,"One filmmaker says film is a language and not a composite art borrowing from literature, art and music

The language of cinema was one of the topics of discussion on Thursday. At a media interaction, Siddhartha Tripathi, whose film A man and his dog, is competing in the Indian Cinema section at BIFFes argued that film is a language and not a composite art borrowing from literature, art and music. “We are still in the process of developing the language of cinema. Like any art form, making a film is both political and personal. It is like writing a poem,” he said.

A man and his dog is about displacement with a family losing its home to a mining project. “For me, it was as personal as it was political. My family home is a coal pit today. We suddenly became super rich as our land was taken up for mining. But our wealth came at the cost of home, and my memories of childhood. It changed the entire geography of my childhood,” said Mr. Tripathi who is from Chhattisgarh.

The film revolves around a man who refuses to leave his village even as the others leave. The village is deserted as miners have bought the land, and the man only has his dog for company.

Despite being a trained cinematographer, Mr. Tripathi worked in the social sector for over a decade and returned to films only recently. “In 2010, I stayed with a tribal inside Kudremukh National Park for a year. This was when people were not allowed to live inside the national park, though mining was allowed. I did a film on that,” he recalled, adding ‘reckless mining’ in Ballari echoed similar concerns with coal mining in Chhattisgarh.

The festival’s opening film, Cinema donkey, also explores the language of cinema and its processes. “My film deals with what happens off screen. How a film is made not just through the eyes of humans, but also from the perspective of a donkey,” said Iranian filmmaker Shahed Ahmed Lou.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/206yce/article30945037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGSIDDHARTHATRIPATHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/biffes-2020-on-the-language-of-cinema-and-telling-stories/article30945038.ece
356,2020/02/28,40 international films have their India premiere at BIFFes,"Film festival gets its groove back

After the first day was marred by delay in handing out passes, the Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFes) got into its stride on Friday. Orion Mall, the main venue of the festival, was abuzz as film buffs were seen exchanging notes and planning their day.

The catalogue of films being screened finally reached all delegates by Friday morning. Noted Kannada filmmakers Girish Kasaravalli, P. Sheshadri and Lingadevaru were among the delegates queueing up to watch films, and many fans approached them for film recommendations.

Forty international films are premièring in India for the first time at the festival. This is a first for BIFFes, too. Some of the films that will be screened are Canadian drama Kuessipan, French war drama Sympathy for the devil, and Ukranian films U311 Cherkasy and My Thoughts are silenced.

“In the past, we have had films having their Indian premiere at the festival, but never so many. This shows that the film festival is being recognised across the world. We have been able to get these many films to premiere here despite organising the festival in just 48 days,” said N. Vidyashankar, artistic director, BIFFes.

The organisers hope that visibility on the international film festival map will increase once the BIFFes gets international accreditation, which it has applied for. Film festivals across the world are given accreditation by the International Federation of Film Producers’ Association.

Florence Girot, director of Film Festivals at the Federation, is attending BIFFes this year as one of the foreign delegates to decide on the matter.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/qvurdw/article30944986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGBIFFES1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/40-international-films-have-their-india-premiere-at-biffes/article30944987.ece
357,2020/02/28,IISc.’s biochemistry department turns 100,"Established in 1921, it is one of the oldest in India and Asia

The Department of Biochemistry of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) stepped into its centenary year in 2020. Established in 1921, it is said to be one of the oldest departments not only in India, but in all of Asia. Around 850 students have graduated from the department so far.

P.N. Rangarajan, Chairperson, Department of Biochemistry, told The Hindu that the major achievement has been its students, many of who are now leaders in industry and academia. “One of them J. Padmanabhan – alumni and faculty – became the director of IISc. M.R.S. Rao went on to become the president of the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, and Ram Rajasekharan became the Director of CFTRI-Mysuru,” he said.

The department has planned a major conference and alumni reunion in December, as well as a centenary lecture series that will be held almost every month. On the IISc.’s Open Day on Saturday, it is organising an exhibition highlighting its past and current activities.

Prof. Rangarajan’s own research has led to the development of the hepatitis B vaccine. “At least four vaccines are currently in the market. The hepatitis B component in these vaccines came from the lab of the Department of Biochemistry,” he added.

In a recent issue of the journal Current Science, Prof. Rangarajan lists out the progression of research in the department. This includes ‘research of societal relevance’ in the early years which resulted in the development of methods for conversion of municipal waste into organic manure and fluoride removal from drinking water, to name a few.

The article makes note of key contributions in basic research such as the identification of yeast chromosomes and nuclear membrane.

Ongoing research

At present, a novel drug combination for extremely drug resistant and multi-drug resistant TB, as well as new blood-based biomarker signatures of host genes for diagnosis of tuberculosis and for detecting response to anti-tubercular therapy are being developed, he told The Hindu. “A novel inhibitor of DNA repair enzyme called SCR7 has also been developed in our laboratory. It has the potential to develop as a cancer drug,” said Prof. Rangarajan.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/iiscs-biochemistry-department-turns-100/article30944866.ece
358,2020/02/28,Over 250 IISc. researchers and alumni condemn violence,"Release statement expressing concern over recent developments across the country

More than 250 research students, researchers, staff, alumni and faculty members of the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru have released a statement expressing their concern over recent developments across the country and condemning the communal violence in Delhi over the past few days. The signatories clarified that the statement is in their personal capacity.

They criticised the failure of the government to maintain law and order, and protecting the lives of citizens. As of Thursday, the death toll in the riots in the nation’s capital was 38.

“The communal targeting of Muslim communities across Delhi and elsewhere is antithetical to the secular and democratic ethos of India,” they said in the statement.

They demanded that the government take measures to prevent the situation from deteriorating, and restore peace and normalcy. The signatories have called for stern action to be taken not just against those actively participating in rioting but also against individuals who have “indulged in incitement to violence”. The asked authorities to ensure that those affected by the violence in Delhi and elsewhere are provided medical, material and legal aid.

“We also demand that a mechanism of adequate compensation be put in place for those who have lost their loved ones, suffered injuries or have had their property damaged or destroyed,” read the statement.

Signatories underscored their rights as citizens of a democracy to stage peaceful forms of dissent against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

“Over the past two months, there have been a number of peaceful protests against provisions of the CAA, NRC and NPR…. We call upon the government of India to protect the right to peaceful and non-violent dissent, and engage in constructive dialogue to resolve the concerns being raised.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/over-250-iisc-researchers-and-alumni-condemn-violence/article30944757.ece

360,2020/02/28,Buy-back scheme launched to promote electric autorickshaws,"Three Wheels United (TWU), a Bengaluru-based social enterprise that offers holistic financing solutions for autorickshaw drivers to own a light-electric vehicle, has launched a buy-back scheme. The entity has a mandate to finance 10,000 electric vehicles in the first year and one lakh by 2024.

The TWU said to make the switch to EVs easier, the company was working with large manufacturers, such as Mahindra Electric to buy back and scrap vehicles older than 10 years. This buy-back amount then goes towards the down payment of the EV.

The old vehicles will be scrapped according to the scrapping policies; and wherever applicable, the TWU would also assist the drivers in applying for government subsidies.

As per Greenpeace South East Asia, the economic cost of air pollution is estimated to be $150 billion in India. Clean transport can contribute to a significant reduction in toxic pollutants. India has over 12 million autorickshaw drivers operating a fleet of over 6 million vehicles that contribute to 21 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually.

A report by TERI on vehicular emissions from autorickshaws plying in Bengaluru says approximately 1,200 tonnes of carbon dioxide, 4 tonnes of NOx and 0.5 tonnes of PM10 are emitted daily. These figures indicate that a switch from conventional engines to electric autorickshaws can considerably reduce carbon emissions and substantially contribute towards bringing down air pollution.

The programme has been launched in Bengaluru and will soon be extended to Hyderabad, Kerala, and Delhi, says the company.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/buy-back-scheme-launched-to-promote-electric-autorickshaws/article30944032.ece
361,2020/02/28,IISc. to be thrown open to the public on February 29,"The institution will hold the 43rd edition of its annual Open Day to showcase its activities and research

The gates of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.) will be thrown open to the student community and the public on Saturday when the premier institution hosts the 43rd edition of its annual Open Day to showcase its activities and research. The day-long event will be held from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The event already has registrations from 900 institutions, some from outside the State, said Prof. Rahul Pandit, chairperson, Open Day 2020, IISc. The event had a footfall of 40,000 last year, and IISc. is expecting more visitors this time.

At a press conference on Friday, Kaushal Varma, Chairperson, Office of Communication, IISc., said for the first time, an academic stall will be put up to guide students interested in pursuing courses at the institute about the entrance exams, eligibility and admission process.

The Science Gallery Bengaluru (SGB) will also have a stall this year. The gallery is a new space that aims to be an interface between the natural and human sciences and the arts, through a roster of experimental spaces, exhibitions, education workshops, training programmes and public events. It is being developed with the support of the Karnataka government, academic partners National Center For Biological Sciences and Srishti Institute of Art, Design & Technology, and is a member of the Global Science Gallery Network pioneered by Trinity College, Dublin.

“The first Open Day was held on March 3, 1977. Satish Dhawan was the director then. We are trying to improve the experience for everybody. That is how the kids’ zone was introduced four years ago as we felt that there should be something even for children. Now, the largest crowd is at the kids’ zone,” said Professor Varma. “We want to dispel myths that science is too complicated. Science is happening even as we talk,” he added.

Prof. Pandit said the institute has taken further steps to make the event a sustainable one by not using paper flyers and instead starting an app (IISc Open Day, available on Google Play Store). “Visitors can bring their own water bottles and we will provide drinking water,” he said.

About the highlights this year, he said, “Cutting edge research is happening in all departments. But one aspect of science and engineering we want to focus on is safety. We have a special safety demonstration,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/99qwsm/article30945016.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGOPENDAYATIISCBENGALURU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/iisc-open-day-tomorrow/article30942392.ece
362,2020/02/28,‘Export size testimony to State’s link to the world’,"Karnataka’s growth rate is higher than the national average, says official

Karnataka stays well-linked to the rest of the world, with the size of its exports pegged at $90 billion as against its $250 billion economy, said Gaurav Gupta, Principal Secretary, Department of Industries and Commerce. With a growth rate higher than national average and lowest unemployment rate in the country, the State is key to fulfilling the India’s aspirations of becoming a $5 trillion economy, he said.

“There are several advantages that Karnataka offers including a robust ecosystem, skilled manpower and a vast talent pool. However, one of the key concerns is job creation. We need to analyse in what way industry can create more jobs across the social spectrum, and not just for the skilled and educated,” Mr. Gupta added, while speaking at a CII event on Thursday.

Soumitra Bhattacharya, Managing Director, Bosch Ltd was of the opinion that India's demographic dividend could turn into a demographic disaster if we do not have a working model on vocational training. “Out of the 30,000 people who come into the job market, only 1,000 get jobs. Though we have some of the best educational institutions in India, our practical training in skills is not good enough. Hence, graduates spend a year on the bench before becoming productive,” he said.

“Bengaluru has a growing population, traffic has slowed down to 9 km per hour. If we don’t tackle the environment and infrastructure issues with a holistic granular game plan, we may be sitting on a time bomb,” he cautioned.

CII has announced its new office-bearers for Karnataka.

As many as 50 members of Campus Front of India (CFI) were arrested for staging a dharna in front of Raj Bhavan on Thursday to protest the violence in Delhi and the failure of the police. Protesters were restrained and taken away from the spot in police vans.

“The protesters, who staged a dharna in Bengaluru, did not have the required permission and obstructed the free flow of traffic,” said a senior police officer.

According to the police, they ignored warnings to cease the protest and allegedly continued sloganeering. “The protesters have been charged for obstructing traffic and unlawful assembly,” said Chetan Singh Rathore, Deputy Police Commissioner (Central division).

364,2020/02/28,Rowdy killed in police encounter near Bengaluru,"His associates helped him escape from a police vehicle but he was nabbed by another team

A 31-year-old history sheeter, Bharath, who was named in over half-a-dozen criminal cases, was killed in an encounter at Soladevanahalli early Thursday morning.

A native of Tamil Nadu, Bharath, was living with his mother in Laggere. He was on the run after allegedly attacking a police team in KS Layout in January when they went to arrest him. “He fled to Moradabad in U.P. where he was hiding in a friend’s house. We tracked him down and brought him back to the city,” said the police.

On the way back, when the team was in Bengaluru, his associates allegedly tried to stop the police vehicle near SS Circle in Peenya and attacked the police team. “They were following the team in an attempt to free Bharath,” said a senior police officer.

Sub-inspector Venkataramana opened fire in the air, but Bharath managed to escape in a car. Constable Subhash sustained injuries in the melee. Venkataramana alerted the control room and sounded a red alert. Rajgopal Nagar Inspector Dinesh Patil and Nandini Layout Inspector Lohith, who were on their rounds, spotted Bharath and his associates in a car on Hesaraghatta Road.

366,2020/02/28,Saplings planted around Red Hills lake to prevent dumping of garbage,"The reservoir, which is brimming with water, has faced various challenges, including dumping and burning of garbage along its banks of late

In a bid to discourage the dumping of garbage around Red Hills Lake, the Water Resources Department, along with the Tiruvallur district administration, has started planted saplings in the vacant spaces around the water body.

The Red Hills reservoir, which is brimming with water, has faced various challenges, including dumping and burning of garbage along its banks. As an effort to put an end to the menace and also to protect the drinking water source, it was decided to fence the vacant space around the lake and also plant saplings along the Red Hills-Tiruvallur Road.

Spread over about 50,000 sq.ft., the vacant site along the reservoir near Alamaram bus stop had became an easy prey to the dumping of garbage in the absence of a dedicated dump yard in neighbouring local bodies, officials of the WRD said.

Now, about 100 saplings of native species, including mahogany, neem, magizham, poovarasam and ilupai have been planted with the support of Saranalayam Trust and the Red Hills Lake Restoration Group. Tiruvallur collector Maheswari Ravikumar participated in the inaugural event.

At present, the lake has a storage of 2,680 million cubic feet (mcft) against its capacity of 3,300 mcft.

The site where saplings have been planted will be maintained by the restoration group and other voluntary organisations in the locality.

S. Sameer of the Red Hills Lake Restoration Group said the team has been involved in clearing garbage in canals bringing water to the lake and also creating awareness about the significance of the water body. “We plan to create a park on the site and also propose to increase green cover around the lake,” he said.

Saranalayam Trust has come forward to provide saplings to be planted around the lake’s circumference extending to 30 km. With the local bodies now allotting a dedicated dumpyard in Kummanur, sources noted that the issue of garbage dumping near the lake may reduce.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iazuf4/article30942910.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28FEBTH--REDHILLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/saplings-planted-around-red-hills-lake-to-prevent-dumping-of-garbage/article30942911.ece

After a long negotiation process, Good Shepherd School in Nungambakkam has given land for construction of the Sterling Road Metro Rail station, that forms part of Chennai Metro Rail’s phase II project.

The private school has given 17,495 sq.ft of land from its premises for building the station, and Chennai Metro Rail has handed over a cheque now for acquiring this piece of land, according to a press release. CMRL officials refused to reveal the amount of money given for acquiring this parcel of land from the school. Besides, Chennai Metro Rail will also need additional land for the same station and officials are in the process of acquiring more land from other private land owners as well, sources said.

For months now, Chennai Metro Rail has been in the process of acquiring land for the phase II project that will cover 118.9 km of the city with 128 stations.

For the whole project, Chennai Metro Rail will need 117.12 hectares for the three stretches -- Madhavaram to Shollinganallur, Madhavaram to SIPCOT and Light House to Poonamallee. CMRL began issuing notices to land owners last year in this regard.

368,2020/02/28,Vandalised Paranur toll plaza to commence operations from Sunday,"The Highways Authority has lost nearly ₹8 crore of toll collection at the plaza as it has not been operational for the last month

After four weeks, tolling will commence at the Paranur plaza in Chengalpet on Sunday. Fee collection had to be stopped after the plaza was vandalised and cash stolen following violence after a fight between a bus crew and plaza staff in January.

“All the repair work has been completed. We are awaiting clearance from the police to commence operations since we had to stop toll collection due to the violence. The police have also given some suggestions that we are implementing,” said an official of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).

In the last three weeks, the NHAI has lost nearly ₹8 crore of toll collection at the plaza as it has not been operational. The NHAI has sanctioned ₹50 lakh for the civil work. “The funds have been released from our exigency funds. We do have insurance coverage, we are also exploring that avenue,” said an official source in the NHAI.

Sources in the Chengalpet police said that a permanent police booth would be established near the plaza to act as a deterrent. “We have also asked to check the antecedents of the staff, who number close to 100, and ensure that only those who do not have any suspicious background are employed,” a police officer said.

Violence was unleashed after the toll staff had asked the crew of a government bus from Chennai to Tirunelveli to pay the user fee since the vehicle had entered the cash-only lane. But the crew did not pay. This led to an altercation and ended in an assault. Irate passengers, the public and crew members from other buses too, jumped into the fight and the plaza was vandalised. Six toll collection booths, computers, boom barriers, furniture, CCTV cameras and electronic toll collection scanners and systems were broken by the mob on that day.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7a6x3w/article30941253.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28FEBTH--TOLL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/vandalised-paranur-toll-plaza-to-commence-operations-from-sunday/article30941254.ece
369,2020/02/28,"Madras High Court in the process of getting child-friendly chambers, says Chief Justice Sahi","Justice Sahi said these were measures to create a better atmosphere and help victims

We are now in the process of having child-friendly, separate chambers in order to assess evidence and find out as to how an incident did occur, said Madras High Court Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi.

Speaking at the inauguration of the seventh international and eleventh biennial conference on ‘Emerging forms of victimisation: multi-disciplinary perspective’ at Stella Maris College on Friday, Justice Sahi said, “These are small measures which help in developing courage to the victim to come up with the truth. After all, the justice delivery system is nothing else but the search for truth. In order to find out the truth, methods should be evolved.”

Pointing to the emergence of the rights of the victim in modern society, Justice Sahi said there had to be certain measures and a better comfort zone, to be created in order to allow a pleasant atmosphere, a fearless atmosphere. “We should discuss values when we discuss victimisation,” he said.

“Today we do claim that in our systems we are civilised. But then the need of the hour is to discuss victimology. Victims and crimes are discussed side by side. In today’s modern world, with the evolution of society, we have many emerging forms of victimisation: domestic victimisation, victimisation of labour, victimisation on the strength of racism. These emerging forms of victimisation is a result of what? We will come to a common conclusion if not a unanimous conclusion. It is greed and depreciation of values that has led to this situation,” said Justice Sahi.

Stressing on the need for self-introspection on moral values, Justice Sahi said, “Moral science classes in our young days were compulsory. Today it is not even optional.”

“When your mind is gripped with violence, I believe, we forget ourselves. So the need of the hour is to remind yourself, self- introspect and again you have to link it with values. Every law becomes acceptable if it has the moral source behind it. But then morality and law are again a question of debate. It is here that the rights of the victim gain emergence in our modern society.”

Explaining various aspects of victimisation and the reason for people to be perturbed now, Justice Sahi said, “In simple terms, I would say the most difficult task one can experience is to persuade the human mind to believe what is correct and to remove this perversity of mind. Perversity is nothing else but abuse of the intellectual gifts. They try to overawe a situation, putting you at a disadvantage and then try to use it for one’s own advantage. This is a form of violence of the human mind as I understand it. It is an unfortunate state that society is transforming at a very great pace. We are experiencing this stage from telephones, to computers, to laptops, to tablets, and now smart phones. These tools are helpful to us but are equally destructive when it comes to the intellectual abuse of mind.”

“We, every day, find cases and cases piling up now arising from crimes of the cyber world. Our laws are not sufficient to meet them. We have the Indian Evidence Act, where electronic evidence and its admissibility has now become a problem, yet Parliament and the Legislatures, have not been able to meet and cope with it,” said Justice Sahi.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fzvez8/article30941182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28FEBTH--SAHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/madras-high-court-in-the-process-of-getting-child-friendly-chambers-says-chief-justice-sahi/article30941183.ece

Passengers arriving at Egmore railway station will soon be able to access a lounge, with amenities on a par with facilities at some airports.

An executive lounge is also on the cards at the Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Central station, railway officials said.

A senior Railway official said that a modern retiring room fitted with air-conditioning, cushioned chairs, wi-fi, changing room, lockers and restaurant facilities is being proposed.

To be run by IRCTC

The facility, to be constructed and maintained by IRCTC, could be used by paying a nominal cost.

The IRCTC, having successfully commissioned modern rest rooms at Madurai and Tiruchi railway junctions, is giving a complete makeover to passenger amenities at Chennai Egmore station. At present, renovation work is in on.

The Railway official said commuters in Madurai and Tiruchi by paying an entry fee of ₹60 can avail free wi-fi, a clean toilet, newspapers and a shoe shiner at the air-conditioned executive lounge. The lounge also has a separate recliner room, cloak room, shower and changing room, which can be used at extra cost. There is also a business centre, he added.

Commuters can order breakfast, lunch and dinner while waiting at the lounge.

However, many passengers bound for Madurai and Tiruchi rue the lack of awareness about such a facility and want IRCTC to promote the lounge.

371,2020/02/28,"Activists, fisherfolk oppose Marina-Besant Nagar link plan","‘It will be an environmental disaster, disrupt livelihoods’

The direction of the Madras High Court to the State government and Greater Chennai Corporation to study the feasibility of extending the Marina Loop Road beyond Pattinappakkam and linking Besant Nagar through an elevated corridor has come as a shock to environment activists and fishermen.

The activists, on a tour organised to the broken bridge near the Adyar estuary on Thursday, said that the proposed elevated corridor would be an environmental disaster and would also disrupt the livelihood of fisherfolk.

The activists, through the Save Chennai Beaches campaign, and the fisherfolk of Urur Olcott Kuppam pointed out that the Marina-Besant Nagar Link Road proposal would lead to eviction of fisherfolk, disruption of the livelihood of thousands of fishermen, rise in sea levels, damage to the Olive Ridley turtle nesting habitat and the Adyar estuary, which supports several marine life forms and migratory birds, and ruin the beauty of Chennai’s beaches.

S. Pallayam, a member of the Urur Olcott Kuppam administration committee, said thousands of fishermen who have been living in the locality for several generations would be evicted. Also, the proposed link road would put a big question mark on their livelihood, as they would not have space to dry their nets and their catch.

Environment activist Nityanand Jayaraman said the porposed Marina-Besant Nagar Link Road would not solve the traffic problem and would end up creating new bottlenecks on interior roads of Besant Nagar.

Mr. Jayaraman also questioned how the High Court instead of being a protector of the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) was viewing the CRZ as a hurdle.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rnqc77/article30936949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THBROKENBRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/activists-fisherfolk-oppose-marina-besant-nagar-link-plan/article30936950.ece
372,2020/02/28,Unemployed engineers queue up for parking attendant jobs,"Over 70% of the applicants are graduates; qualification needed for post is SSLC

Starting Monday, many qualified engineers will start manning parking spaces in various parts of the city, along with parking attendants with just an SSLC.

So far, all of the parking attendants in the city have been retired armed forces personnel, who had completed high school.

More than 1,400 candidates have applied for jobs of parking attendants. More than 70% of the applicants have completed graduation. Over 50% are engineers, indicating the level of unemployment among engineers in the city.

Chennai Corporation will inaugurate the parking management system in more than 2,000 parking slots in areas such as Anna Nagar, Nungambakkam and Purasawalkam on Monday.

For instance, Anna Nagar Second Avenue will get 550 parking slots where motorists will have qualified engineers requesting them to download the app for parking management.

Currently, 222 parking slots have been offered for motorists. But, the digital mode has not been promoted properly by the civic body so far.

“Many of the applicants for the parking attendants posts have also completed their master’s in engineering. These people may be ideal candidates for promoting the digital mode of parking management. The actual qualification for parking attendants is an SSLC,” said an official of the private vendor who is implementing the parking management system.

As many as 1,000 persons have been hired by the vendor for the posts of parking attendants. They will start work on Monday. Many of the engineers who visited Ripon Buildings on Thursday said they were applying for the parking attendants jobs because they were unemployed.

Tough times

“I have completed civil engineering. I do not have a job because of the market condition in the real estate industry,” said an applicant.

As many as 18,000 persons have downloaded the app for parking management in the city.

“Each of the engineers will have to educate the motorists. It is purely a digital mode. The number of downloads of the app has to increase for successful implementation of the system,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mpl8li/article30936923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THPARKINGATMARINA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unemployed-engineers-queue-up-for-parking-attendant-jobs/article30936925.ece

375,2020/02/28,‘Tamil news channels not sensationalist’,"English and Hindi news channels engaging in shouting matches, says N. Ram

Tamil news channels by and large stood out and did not follow the propagandist and sensationalist trends observed in a majority of the English and Hindi news channels, N. Ram, Chairman, THG Publishing Pvt. Ltd., said on Thursday.

Addressing a seminar on ‘Media and Advertising - Controversies and Challenges,’ he said that, barring some exceptions, the news channels in English and Hindi have become the worst in the world with their shouting matches, propaganda and lack of civility.

The seminar was organised in the backdrop of Advertising Standards Council of India's (ASCI) recent ruling that an advertisement issued a few months ago by a popular TV network ahead of its launch of a Tamil news channel was in violation of its code, particularly Section 4.1 (e) that deals with unfair denigration, attack or discrediting of competitors.

Mr. Ram stressed on the need for news organisations to have a policy to not publish such derogatory advertisements.

Pointing out the lack of regulation for digital advertising, he highlighted the need for formulation of a code for the purpose. He said that while self regulation in the media was proving to be inadequate in certain circumstances, allowing the government to regulate will certainly turn out to be a bad alternative.

Speaking aside later, Mr. Ram welcomed actor Rajinikanth’s latest statement indicating the violence in Delhi as a failure of Union government, but said that the actor’s stance on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), however, needed to change.

He said that the actor’s earlier statement that he supported the CAA was perhaps made superficially and without thinking deeply about the issue. “I have high regards for him as an actor. I believe that his position (on the issue) is evolving,” he said. Acknowledging that it was a complex problem involving technicalities, he said that meetings could be arranged with the actor, to discuss it.

Mr. Ram blamed the Union government, particularly Home Minister Amit Shah, for its failure to prevent and control violence in Delhi.

Highlighting that CAA, National Register of Citizens, and National Population Register cannot be seen in isolation, he criticised the Central government for making false statements that the three were not linked.

M. Gunasekaran, editor, News 18 Tamil Nadu, said that the widespread condemnation for the advertisement from fellow journalists were reassuring of the fact that the media landscape in Tamil Nadu was different.

S. Karthigaichelvan, Managing Editor, Puthiya Thalaimurai, said that the channel did not achieve whatever it wanted through the advertisement since the reaction largely went against the channel.

Peer Mohamed, Alliance for Media Freedom, said that the advertisement must also be seen as an attempt by the particular cross-media television network to monopolise the market.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/xpcpiq/article30936855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THNRAMSEMINARONMEDIAANDADVERTISINGCONTROVERSIESCHALLENGES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tamil-news-channels-not-sensationalist/article30936856.ece

After a seven-km chase, the Poonamallee police on Wednesday nabbed a suspect and launched a search for three of his associates who managed to escape.

Following information about a gang going around with dangerous weapons, sub-inspectors S. Anandakumar and K. Suresh, Grade I constable K. Shridhar, and Home Guard G. Ellappan went on two motorcycles to conduct a search.

When they were combing the Senneerkuppam-Avadi Road at 10.30 p.m., the police team spotted an autorickshaw with five men. When they tried to intercept the vehicle, the auto took a U-turn and sped away.

The policemen chased the vehicle despite the criminals brandishing weapons and threatening them. After a while, the autodriver pulled the brakes and the policemen fell from their motorcycles. Two of them sustained injuries. “We did not give up the chase,” said Sub-Inspector S. Anandakumar.

Suresh Kumar ordered that even if a single illegal unit was reported to be functional on Tuesday, the Collector concerned must be present in the court, along with the officer concerned responsible for the delay. “If we come across any non compliance on the next date of hearing, this court shall be constrained to call the Chief Secretary to the Government before this court,” the Bench warned, and expected meticulous and punctual compliance of its orders.

The judges also made it clear that no government department would be allowed to take an excuse that it was not a party to the proceedings and therefore it could not comply with the orders. All government departments are expected to work in tandem, they said.

When it was represented before the court that some of the packaging units had applied for renewal of its licences and those applications were still pending, the judges ordered that a final decision on those applications should be taken before Monday.

The Bench expressed its dismay over the officials not having taken any effective steps despite Justice S.M. Subramaniam of the High Court having passed an order on October 3, 2018, for stringent action against units which draw groundwater illegally and exploit it for commercial gains.

In that order, the single judge had directed the State government officials to lodge police complaints for the offence of theft against packaged drinking water units which draw excess groundwater, than the permitted quantity, by tampering the flow meters.

He had said that even those who waste water must be punished for the offence of causing wrongful loss to the State by booking them under Section 425 of the Indian Penal Code, which declares as mischief any act committed with the intention of causing damage to public property.

The officials were further directed to suspend licenses of units against whom police complaints had been lodged and permanently debar them from obtaining licence for extraction of groundwater if they get convicted in criminal cases. A directive was issued to all Collectors in the State to keep an eye on such units.

Every Collector was also directed to constitute monitoring committees, comprising five individuals, to monitor the extraction of groundwater by individuals for commercial purposes. The committees shall collect proof of illegal extraction of water and lodge complaints with the jurisdictional police stations, the judge had said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/close-illegal-drinking-water-packaging-units-hc/article30936602.ece
382,2020/02/28,Technology offers hope to those waiting for a liver,"Organ discard rates expected to come down

Hypothermic Oxygenated Perfusion (HOPE) can make marginal or high-risk donor livers transplantable.

This, doctors say, can reduce organ-discard rates and benefit patients waiting for liver transplants.

Marginal organs, according to a press release, are from elderly donors, either with a fatty liver or some form of damage during brain death. Since there is a shortage of donor organs globally, these organs are accepted to save lives.

Viability assessment

On Thursday, Andrea Schlegel, consultant surgeon, Liver Unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, U.K., who has been involved in the development of HOPE, interacted with liver and kidney transplant surgeons at MIOT International and spoke on the issue of viability assessment in liver and kidneys treated by HOPE.

“The first clinical use of HOPE was in 2010 in the U.S. The technology helps in improving the function of marginal donor livers, such as in the case of fatty livers. We take the organ, do a biopsy, put on cold perfusion, measure the injury and check liver quality. It helps repaire and improve the quality of the liver, and predict if it would work or not,” Dr. Schlegel told reporters.

When the liver is harvested from a brain dead donor, it is preserved in a solution. In HOPE, the machine pumps preservative fluid into the organ at a temperature of 4-10 degrees and oxygen is added to the fluid, the press release said.

Ilango Sethu, hepato pancreatico-biliary surgery and transplant surgeon, MIOT International, said that the hospital’s liver discard rate was 16%, and the technology would help reduce this rate.

383,2020/02/28,Iconic P. Orr and Sons building plays host to a reunion,"The great great grandson of the founder comes calling

The iconic P.Orr and Sons building on Anna Salai, which has stood the test of time and been witness to many timeless moments, played a host to a historical and emotional reunion on Thursday evening.

Andrew Orr, the great great grandson of Peter Orr, founder of P. Orr and Sons, and his wife Antonia were greeted by some of the long-time employees and customers, who recalled their association with the watch company, which opened in 1849.

The couple was greeted by 88-year-old M. Murugesan, who has been working with P. Orr and Sons since he was 12 years old.

Built by British architect Robert Chisholm in the Byzantine and Indo-Saracenic styles of architecture, P. Orr and Sons has sold about 40 lakh watches so far.

The couple was treated to dance performances and also interacted with the distributors of the company.

Voyage of discovery

A medical practitioner by profession in Scotland, Mr. Andrew Orr said it was his ninth visit to India. “It was a voyage of discovery for us. My father didn’t follow into business. But, I grew up listening to fabulous stories about Chennai and P. Orr and Sons,” he said.

It was in 1994 that Mr. Andrew Orr first came to the city to renew his connection. “It was like magic when all this wonderful history came to life. I fell in love with the city and its people and visited frequently. This company, in this heritage building with ultra-modern facilities, has been growing,” he said.

He earlier narrated a brief history about how his family arrived in then Madras in 1843 and joined watchmakers George Gordon and Co. He recalled Peter Orr to be a goldsmith apart from watch and chronometer maker.

“I have also developed an interest in gold and precious stones. I have heard stories about diamonds handled in P. Orr and Sons,” he added.

Book on the cards

Valli Ramaswami, chairperson, P. Orr and Sons, too recalled her long association with the Orr family.

We now have 14 branches and want to expand and reach out to the younger generation,” she said.

Mr. Andrew Orr plans to write a book on the history of the company. “I have spent a lifetime collecting details and pictures. I hope to finish it and visit again soon,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/h42bga/article30936461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THWATCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iconic-p-orr-and-sons-building-plays-host-to-a-reunion/article30936462.ece
384,2020/02/28,A.P. urged to maintain Krishna water supply till April,"Fluctuations in flow seen on account of water usage en route to city

With the flow of Krishna water to Chennai becoming increasingly inconsistent, the Tamil Nadu Water Resources Department has written to its counterpart in Andhra Pradesh to maintain flow from Kandaleru reservoir until April to cater to the city’s drinking water needs this summer.

On Thursday, the State’s entry point at the Kandaleru-Poondi canal received 266 cusecs (cubic feet per second) of Krishna water, which was stored in Poondi reservoir and then transferred to Chembarambakkam lake, the largest of the city’s drinking water sources.

Since September 28 last year, Chennai has received about 6,000 million cubic feet (mcft) of Krishna water. This, along with rains during the northeast monsoon, has helped build storage in the four reservoirs, including Poondi and Red Hills. At present, the combined storage of the city reservoirs stands at 6,229 mcft against a capacity of 11,257 mcft.

WRD officials said that there was no dip in water being discharged from the Kandaleru reservoir in A.P. On an average, about 1,700 cusecs was being released from the reservoir upstream. However, there was a fluctuation in the Krishna water flowing into the State. Water was being drawn through sluices to fill up tanks en route for irrigation and other purposes, officials said.

“We have written to the A.P. authorities to provide about 3,000 mcft and continue water release for the second spell till April. We are yet to receive a reply. Water discharge has not been stopped from Kandaleru reservoir,” an official said.

Chennai’s drinking water supply would be continued at the present rate of 650 million litres a day till the next northeast monsoon with the available resources in the lakes. Veeranam tank in Cuddalore district, which augments city water supply, also has a storage of 1,389 mcft against its capacity of 1,465 mcft.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/j238ym/article30936393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THWATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ap-urged-to-maintain-krishna-water-supply-till-april/article30936394.ece
385,2020/02/28,"Hope, belief and the candles of Shaheen Bagh","Mobs and rulers masquerading as leaders cannot be allowed to dismantle a marvellously democratic experiment

It can be safely presumed that an American President was invited to our shores because we wanted him to see for himself our ‘new India’. And, it can also be asserted with confidence that the India the visitor from Washington ended up seeing was an old India, drenched in medieval animosities and passions. And, if it is to be assumed, as is being suggested by the ruling party’s apologists, that a ‘conspiracy’ was afoot to mar the Donald Trump visit then we are staring at a terrible failure of all our institutional arrangements and of our rulers’ pretentious assertions. This failure has been in the making for some time now, and can get only aggravated because our cunning political saviours remain indifferent to their obligation to strive for healing and harmony in society.

De-legitimising a movement

The rough and ready violence, witnessed in Delhi these last few days, had almost become a certainty because with each passing day it was becoming imperative to de-legitimise Shaheen Bagh and the resistance it came to symbolise against a flawed and discriminatory law like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or CAA, 2019. For over two months, the entire nation has seen images of Muslim women, old and young, staying put, peacefully, braving Delhi’s winter, refusing to get provoked by threats or temptations.

Shaheen Bagh also saw Muslims innovatively using ‘national’ symbols — the Constitution, the Flag and the Anthem — to assert their rights as citizens and as a religious minority. Soon ‘Shaheen Bagh’ became a secular project, even though the ‘boots’ were provided mostly by the Muslim community. A new civic imagination was at work, and, what was more, ‘Shaheen Bagh’ also acquired a moral sheen and attracted global media attention. And, before the managers of ‘new India’ could catch their breath, Muslim women across the land were replicating ‘Shaheen Baghs’ in towns and cities. A new defiance was crawling its way to the centre of our political landscape. This was deeply galling to those who thought they had the dominant control over the street, the media and the national imagination.

Also read | It’s time for the Shaheen Bagh protests to end

The Shaheen Bagh experiment and its peacefulness became deeply frustrating for those who had conceptualised the new citizenship law as a clever project in political polarisation. Even more exasperating for these self-styled chankayas was a failure to cast Shaheen Bagh as a case of “Muslim uprising”. Shaheen Bagh became a perplexing affront to our new rulers who have come to believe that state repression can overcome any political dissent and democratic resistance. Shaheen Bagh, with all its imaginative invocation of republican values and secular chants, had become an ideological eye-sore to the impresarios of a ‘New India.’ Something had to give.

After the election rebuff

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership, overloaded with self-belief, saw an opportunity in the Delhi Assembly election. From the Union Home Minister downward, the BJP leaders, from all over India, were commandeered for election duty in Delhi where they worked themselves into frenzy, inciting violence and invoking ‘deshbhakti’. The voters were invited to send out a message to the Shaheen Bagh protesters. The BJP strategy was to convert the Delhi Assembly polls into a referendum on its politics of religious polarisation and the presumed popularity of its leaders. The Delhi voters denied, firmly and clearly, the BJP this endorsement. Undaunted by the humiliating defeat, the BJP leadership and its cheer-leaders refused to acknowledge the rebuff, and, instead, chose to take comfort from the party’s vote-share and applied itself once again to provoking the Shaheen Bagh constituency. What followed was BJP leader Kapil Mishra’s ultimatum to the Delhi Police to clear the roads of anti-CAA protesters in Jaffrabad.

Perhaps the BJP leadership had also shrewdly gauged the unhappiness in the traditional Muslim leadership with the Shaheen Bagh model — the women were in the forefront whereas the mullahs, the imams and maulvis had been pushed into the background. The Shaheen Bagh model is as much a challenge to familiar ‘community leaders’ as it was to the saffron extremists. The traditional Muslim leaders were losing control over their women and the ‘kaum’. The traditionalists were deeply disconcerted that the Supreme Court-appointed interlocutors were engaging with the women at Shaheen Bagh, and not with them.

Also read | The victory of the Shaheen Bagh women

Nor could the BJP leadership have been unaware that just a few miles across Shaheen Bagh in Yogi Adityanath’s Uttar Pradesh the police force had been let loose on anti-CAA dissenters. Tales of excesses by the U.P. police against the Muslim community floated across the Yamuna, inducing doubts about the efficacy of a peaceful, silent Shaheen Bagh; but worse was the total absence of any institutional restraint on a vindictive regime in Lucknow. Neither the judiciary nor the political parties nor the media nor civil society was able to intervene effectively against a biased, rogue police force. There was anger — and, helplessness — in the Muslim ‘street’. The traditional hotheads knew that Muslim lumpens and under-classes were on a short fuse.

Two extremist factional impulses had a convergence: the coherence and solidarity of the Shaheen Bagh model and its secular promise had to be undermined; the Constitution-waving crowd had to be dissolved into a mob. This convergence finally produced the explosion in Delhi over the weekend. The veterans of the 2002 Gujarat riots perhaps thought that they had a mastery over the art of choreographing street violence. The sly manipulators can take some comfort that finally the capital has witnessed a full-scale communal riot, first since the 1984 carnage against Sikhs; there must be considerable satisfaction in some quarters that we are back on the familiar Hindu-Muslim divide terrain, with an enticing prospect of a rich electoral dividend.

Defeating sectarianism

But this is also precisely the moment to remind ourselves that this ugly denouement was inevitable, given the Modi regime’s barely concealed commitment to dismantling the inclusive and pluralistic elements of the Nehruvian consensus. And, that is the challenge: are our constitutional institutions and instruments robust enough to roll back a ‘this-land-belongs-to-the Hindus-only’ politics? A deeply divided society may reward a few practitioners of conspicuous bigotry but it becomes the sacred duty of all our democratic arrangements to defeat a sectarian regime and its perverse policies and priorities.

The other day, a judge of the Supreme Court of India, Justice Deepak Gupta, came very close to identifying the crux of our — and our rulers’ — dilemma. “Rule of majority is an integral part of democracy but majoritarianism is an anti-thesis of democracy,” argued Justice Gupta. The judge reiterated the basic principle: a political party could possibly come to power, winning 51% of the popular vote, but that did not mean that the remaining 49% were to remain dis-empowered for the next five years. This simple truism should be obvious to one and all, yet it took a Justice Gupta to remind us that the Constitution of India imposes an inescapable obligation on every single office — from the President of India to the Prime Minister down to the lowly police constable — to work for the welfare of all citizens.

It is this kind of clear-headedness that the Shaheen Bagh imagination had sought to re-kindle. The Shaheen Bagh protest is anchored in a hope and a belief that a democratic arrangement can find peaceful ways of addressing the grievances and anxieties of a minority. And, it would be an unmitigated tragedy for Indian democracy if the violence instigated in Delhi is used to delegitimise Shaheen Bagh’s democratic potential and promise. Inshallah (National Security Adviser Ajit Doval permitting).

386,2020/02/28,"Letters to the Editor — February 28, 2020","Delhi’s shame

Citizen’s welfare is the raison d’etre of a democratically elected government. But the Central government seems to be unaware of this. It has bluntly ignored basic issues such as employment, education, health care. These issues are neither discussed nor worked upon. The only thing the government is interested in is to create and step up the communal divide in the country.

The situation in Delhi is very condemnable but what is even more disgraceful and upsetting is the government’s inaction. We elect representatives and rather than have the judiciary appointing mediators, it is necessary that our elected representatives themselves “come down” to the ground and negotiate the terms with the anti-CAA protesters. It is insane to let citizens die due to an issue on citizenship. Democracy is all about involving all stakeholders in decision-making processes. Representatives of the world’s largest democracy have failed in meeting certain basic expectations (Page 1, “Death toll rises to 27 in Delhi violence”, February 27).

Kirti Sharma,

Mohali, Punjab

If the National Security Adviser can try and facilitiate peace, why policemen with guns and lathis could not manage to control the crowd violence is a bit puzzling. Top leaders in the Central government went out in Delhi to explain the CAA in a door-to-door campaign. Soon after elections were announced in Delhi, the entire team again went door to door to seek support and votes. Several road shows were also organised in many parts of Delhi.

But why is there no show now by either ruling party members or the Indian National Congress and the AAP when two communities were allowed to attack each other in the name of pro- and anti-CAA protests? All this shows that the leaders find the means to light fires of hate but look for someone else to douse the destructive flames.

N. Nagarajan,

Secunderabad

The unspeakable, appalling violence with communal overtones witnessed in parts of Delhi is a blot on our great democracy. Equally shocking has been the inexplicable delay by the Delhi police to take prompt and preventive action to quell the violence. It is a sad truth that the 2020 violence in the capital of India would be remembered to be as dreadful as the earlier riots. Needless to say, a high-level, time-bound judicial inquiry must take shape and ensure accountability.

A. Mohan,

India shortchanged?

Though the opinion is that the high octane visit of the President of the United States to India has succeeded in boosting ties between the two acclaimed democracies, the fact is that the short trip has only proved to be more advantageous and beneficial to America (Editorial, “Signs and substance”, and “Trouble lurks behind the bilateral bonhomie”, both February 27). While heaping praise on India as an “economic giant”, POTUS has clinched great business deals on weapons and energy for his country. But, in return India is still stuck with the tag of a “developed country” making it a candidate for trade subsidy investigations. Even the expectations of putting back India on the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) programme, the removal of which has denied India duty-free entry for up to $5.6-billion worth of annual exports to U.S., have been belied. The Comprehensive Strategic Global Partnership that has been announced sounds exciting but is amorphous, especially in the absence of any progress in the Indo-Pacific partnership or a more substantial trade deal.

387,2020/02/28,‘Raahu’ movie review: Kriti Garg stands out in this thriller by debut director Subbu Vedula,"An indie-spirited venture, the movie banks on its story and the excellent performance of its leading lady

Debut director Subbu Vedula begins his film by thanking a few of his favourite filmmakers, including Coen Brothers. At a crucial point in the story, a character talks about The Gatsby Syndrome. Towards the end, when the director has managed to fit in the pieces of the puzzle to deliver a fairly gripping thriller, he proves that the reference to international filmmakers and literature is not just for the heck of it.

An indie-spirited venture, Raahu banks on its story and the leading lady Kriti Garg is a talent who holds promise.

‘Raahu’ alludes to the darkness that engulfs a character, in more ways than one. Bhanu, who was named so that she shines bright like the sun rays, loses her vision temporarily when overcome with stress, especially at the sight of blood. She suffers from Conversion Disorder, particularly ‘hysterical blindness’. The 123-minute thriller explores what happens when she has to fight for survival by overcoming her fears.

It takes a while for the film to find its rhythm. For instance, an action sequence involving the cops and Nagaraju (‘Kalakeya’ Prabhakar), looks amateurish in terms of its action choreography and other technical aspects. There’s bloodshed, an arrest and a cry for revenge but it doesn’t move you, not yet.

Raahu Cast: Kriti Garg and AbeRaam Varma

Direction: Subbu Vedula

Music: Praveen Lakkaraju

Bhanu is the police commissioner’s daughter (Subbu Vedula doubles up as an actor) who grows up knowing that her life is under threat. Hysterical blindness not withstanding, losing her mother as a child still weighs on her psyche.

Soon, a prisoner is on the run and Bhanu is kidnapped. Her story is revealed by and by, going back and forth to reveal her romance with Sesh (AbeRaam Varma), and her present condition of being trapped in a car.

The romance, too, develops abruptly before it finds its momentum. There’s the hummable melody ‘Emo emo’ by Sid Sriram and other songs composed by Praveen Lakkaraju that iron out the rough edges.

While many films suffer from the ‘second half syndrome’, this is where Raahu truly gets its act together. Post interval, a nearly hour-long sequence shows Bhanu in a far-flung house, trying to prevent her nemesis from breaking in. Her automobile engineering skills are also put to test.

There are a few tropes such narratives cannot escape — like having an ominous looking character actually ending up being harmless. So when such a character is introduced and the true nature is revealed, it doesn’t come as a surprise. However, Raahu plays its cards well with the cat-and-mouse game between Bhanu and the antagonist. An unexpected sisterhood is also formed between Bhanu and Spoorthi, a pre-teen who’s part of the household.

The last act ties up the different things cursorily mentioned earlier in the film — references to snakes acquire a deeper meaning, and there’s a subplot involving a minister’s daughter.

Kriti is vulnerable and convincing as Bhanu. The banter between Giridhar and Chalaki Chanti who play small time thugs is crude and the jokes don’t always land, but they come across as creepy enough to convey a feeling of impending danger.

Raahu is an appreciable first attempt. I wish the film had been smarter in laying out its clues such that they hide in plain sight and then allow viewers to connect the dots, than explain them all towards the end.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fpgcj8/article30903196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/raahu,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/raahu-review-kriti-garg-stands-out-in-this-thriller-by-debut-director-subbu-vedula/article30941382.ece
388,2020/02/28,‘HIT’ movie review: This Vishwak Sen-starrer hits close to the bull’s eye,"Director Sailesh Kolanu debuts with a riveting thriller, and signals the beginning of a new franchise

The mark of a well-made thriller lies in its ability to grab our attention and keep us invested throughout, and more importantly make us care for the key characters. Writer and debut director Dr Sailesh Kolanu does that skilfully with HIT (Homicide Intervention Team), building a taut thriller that doesn’t lose momentum.

HIT has a strong screenplay and complementing Sailesh’s vision is a bravura team — cinematographer S Manikandan who creates an atmosphere of intrigue with a largely brown-green-yellow tinted colour palette, art director Avinash Kolla, editor Garry B H who ensures that the pace doesn’t dip, and above all, composer Vivek Sagar whose brilliant background score knows when to ebb and flow. The score adds to the narrative beautifully without overshadowing the proceedings.

Vikram Rudraraju (Vishwak Sen) is an intelligent and committed officer who’s also battling post traumatic stress, haunted by tragic incidents from the past. The gruesome things he witnesses during crime solving become triggers for panic attacks.

But Vikram won’t walk away from the police force and believes that his work keeps him sane. Fire is a leitmotif of sorts in his story and each time he faces it, the trauma resurfaces. These bits are constructed effectively and Vishwak Sen performs without one false note.

HIT Cast: Vishwak Sen, Ruhani Sharma

Direction: Sailesh Konalu

Music: Vivek Sagar

HIT explores why Vikram takes up the case of a missing girl, Preethi, and what it has to do with his own personal story. Vikram is advised against dealing with a case where someone close to him is at stake, as he might let emotions overrule intelligence, but it’s inevitable that Vikram gets to the bottom of the mystery.

In some of the recent thrillers where the plots are built around cases of missing women, the focus is on crime inflicted on women. HIT deviates from this trope and builds a complex web of incidents. At one point when Vikram says in frustration that though there are a handful of clues and suspects, nothing adds up, the tension is palpable.

In this non-linear narrative where Vikram’s past is revealed in flashes, Sailesh leaves it to you to interpret a few things and doesn’t spoon feed. He also makes you subconsciously piece together the puzzle along with Vikram and his aides, which in itself is the success of the thriller.

Vikram’s character sketch is also an intriguing one. Small incidents, presented with a dash of humour, establish what kind of a person he is — like the scene where a child who sells tea is counting money (probably to pay school fees) while his employer has been slapped, and the portion where Vikram rebukes a professor who comments about the degrading culture among students. The smaller sub plot of Vikram’s clash with a jealous colleague also fits in well.

The thriller is dotted with actors who are aptly cast for their different parts. Vishwak performs with a lot of conviction and this is his best so far. Ruhani is impressive in her limited portions. The role she’s given, at least in part one (oh yes, there’s HIT - case two coming up in 2021), is not an author backed one like in her debut film Chi La Sow, but she’s good as the forensic officer and as Vikram’s lady love, Neha. Newcomer Chaitanya as officer Rohit is apt too. Brahmaji, Bhanuchander, Hari Teja and Murali Sharma do their portions well.

The only grouse is with the big revelation in the climax. It could have been even better. The backstory of the culprit is believable and there are no obvious loopholes, and yet, it felt a little underwhelming. A well-constructed thriller such as this one had the potential to end on a high note, with a climax that can knock your socks off.

HIT deserves a thumbs up.

389,2020/02/28,Feast on hotdogs in Tau’s land,"Enjoy a mix of Western and Eastern dishes at Hungry Tau in Gurugram

There is something about the word ‘Tau’. I have a little niece who calls me Tau, and when I was growing up, that was the word we used for village elders and generally all grizzled men. I don’t hear the word much these days — and that’s why, when a friend told me about a restaurant called Hungry Tau, I was all ears.

I called up the owner, Anmol Rampal, and found that the eatery has three outlets in Gurugram, and is planning to open one in Delhi (sometime in June). The largest one — which can seat 40 people or so — is in Gurugram’s DLF Phase 1 (D144, shopping Mall, Arjun Marg) and was set up in December. The other two are in Sector 15 and Sikandarpur. It also delivers food to distances of up to 5 km (phone numbers: 9650507267 and 0124430911).

Young Anmol, who was an IT-guy in New Zealand before he moved to operations and then trained as a chef, has given the dishes a special touch, making the best of the West and the East. The menu is quite an eclectic one — and includes Chinese and Indian favourites. But there is a nice burger and hotdog section, too.

I love hotdogs, and remember eating my first hotdog at a small place called the Milk Bar in Connaught Place some 50 years ago. Tau’s hotdog menu includes Chicken Tikka Hotdog (₹99) and Jalapeno and Cheese Hotdog (₹99). I had the Classic Hotdog (₹119) — which had a nice layer of milk and cheese combined with ketchup and a plump chicken frankfurter nestled in between two buns.

I enjoyed their signature Tau’s Special Pizza (₹149). The crust was thick but crunchy, and the base sauce — cooked in-house with tomatoes, oregano, chilli flakes and garlic — was topped with a coat of Amul mozzarella cheese and peppered with jalapenos, tomatoes and onions. What gives the pizza its twist is the fact that the veggies on top are roasted in a tandoor, lending a toasty flavour to the dish.

Among the burgers on offer are Chicken Peri Peri Burger (₹99), Aloo Tikki Burger (₹59) and Paneer Burger (₹89). The menu includes fries with cheese and capsicum (₹139) and Caesar’s Salad (₹99). The Indian section has dishes such as Matki Chicken Dum Biryani (₹319) and Vegetable Dum Biryani (₹229). I enjoyed the signature Tau Special Murg Mussalam (₹189) — there was keema in the gravy, which had been flavoured with grated mace, clove, and cinnamon.

I like keema, and had asked for the Keema Pao Peri Peri (₹99). Anmol tells me that they add cider vinegar and lemon juice to give the minced meat — served with soft buns — its tangy taste. I, however, found the keema a wee bit too tangy.

But I certainly look forward to Tau’s Delhi debut this summer. The food, cooked fresh with each order, has its special flavours and the chef’s magic. And it will be nice, after all these years, to be able to call someone — even if it’s a restaurant — Tau.

On arrival, they were informed that they would be charged for leftovers on the table as part of the ‘Weigh The Waste, Feed A Child’ initiative. “I was amazed at the bold move,” says Balachandran, adding, “The cost is not much [they charge ₹100 per 10 grams], but it makes you realise you are being called out for being wasteful. Our immediate reaction was to start ordering half and quarter portions,” says the entrepreneur, who found himself sharing pictures of his ‘clean’ plates with his wife.

Perhaps this was what Sherry Sebastian, the resort’s Managing Director, was aiming for when the idea came about at a breakfast meeting. The team noticed the copious amounts of food being wasted by guests. “We saw consciously-prepared food being thrown away, and thought of the huge population that’s still malnourished. We fuse science, logic, math, and heart to optimally use resources,” says Shreya Krishnan, CSR and Marketing Advisor, adding that all proceeds collected from this initiative goes to orphanages in Coorg.

How it works

Typically, at the 123-acre property, guests pay a tariff (between ₹15,000 and ₹20,000) that includes all meals — typically regional and continental favourites such as kuru curry, handmade ravioli and jaggery desserts. The resort, which opened in 2016, believes in leaving behind a minimal carbon footprint and all food is grown locally, sourced organically and no additives are used in cooking. “We let things grow at their own pace and cook food as nature meant for it to be,” says Krishnan. In fact, studies have shown that 25% of the world’s water is used to produce food that is never eaten.

Guests can eat as much as they want, and take as many refills. But once food is on the plate, and not eaten, it will be weighed in front of them and the amount is added to their bill. When the initiative launched, the resort faced a lot of questions. “Even now, we do get the odd entitled guest who feels he/she can waste food as it has been paid for. Some have paid as much as ₹8,000 towards food wasted during their entire stay. We do get the excuse about kids wasting food, but we have to educate children and change their attitude towards food, right?” asks Krishnan, adding, “When guests go back home and send us photos of clean plates, and tell us they have changed how they consumed food, it makes this worthwhile.”

On ground

From 14 composting bins (each can hold 550 kg) of food waste — including vegetable peels, coffee and tea dregs, egg shells and coconut shells — a day, the resort has come down to one bin a day. For instance, on February 24, approximately 15.56 kg of cooked ‘waste’ food was sent to the dump, as compared to the 79-odd kg wasted during the same period in 2018. “That’s a tremendous amount of food saved,” says Krishnan, who was once billed ₹90 for a piece of toast she dropped when dining at the resort.

Among other things, the resort had to train their kitchen and serving staff to wholeheartedly accept this change. “Since it came from the top, the trickle down was easy. We trained our staff to communicate the idea firmly, but kindly.” The move has been a hit among visitors and Twitterati has taken notice. Many are now calling for it to be a mandatory feature at all restaurants/resorts. Ibnii is therefore willing to share this as a ‘Standard Operating Procedure’ (SOP) with other players in the hospitality sector. “Yes, hospitality is an area where the guest comes first, but you can always nudge them towards the right thing to do,” says Krishnan.

Ambareen Junaid Sait, who runs three resorts in the Nilgiris under the SerendipityO brand, welcomes the Ibnii initiative. “It is criminal to waste food and this discipline is good. Many resorts are in inaccessible locations and even ferrying raw material there takes effort. There is always the possibility that guests who don’t share your view might post negative reviews, but that is something we should take in our stride. We faced something similar when we stopped handing out one-litre disposable water bottles,” she says.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/yjh1df/article30941635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ibnii-Online,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/at-the-ibnii-coorg-diners-are-billed-for-the-food-they-waste/article30941636.ece
391,2020/02/28,Bill making Marathi mandatory in all schools passed in Assembly,"Govt. will have power to exempt a student from all or any of the provisions: Desai

The Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a Bill which makes Marathi a compulsory subject across all schools in the State.

The development came on Marathi Bhasha Din (Marathi language day) which is celebrated on February 27, the birth anniversary of poet and Jnanpith award winner late V.V. Shirwadkar.

The Council had passed the Maharashtra Compulsory Teaching and Learning of Marathi Language in Schools Bill, 2020, on Wednesday.

Minister for Marathi Language Subhash Desai introduced the Bill in the Lower House on Thursday.

Mr. Desai said the legislation was on the lines of laws in Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, and it makes teaching and studying Marathi compulsory in all schools (irrespective of the board to which they are affiliated).

Marathi will become a compulsory subject in all schools from Class I to Class X in a phased manner from the academic year 2020-2021, he said.

It will be introduced in Class I and Class VI from the coming academic year and extended to further classes in subsequent years.

The subject will be, thus, taught from Class I to Class X from 2024, and the schools will follow a curriculum prescribed by the government.

The government will have the power to exempt a student or a class of students from all or any of the provisions of the Bill, Mr. Desai said.

The Bill also provides for a penalty of ₹1 lakh for non-compliance.

Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis welcomed the Bill but objected to the provision of exemption.

“This will create a loophole. The penalty of ₹1 lakh is too low. Several schools charge fees ranging from ₹5 lakh to ₹12 lakh. Paying ₹1 lakh would not be a problem for them,” the BJP leader said.

“There is also no provision for penalising repeat offenders,” he added.

Mr. Desai said the rules that are to be framed under the Bill would ensure there is no misuse of the exemption.

“The clause is for students coming from outside Maharashtra,” he said.

He cited the example of someone from outside the State taking admission in Maharashtra in Class VII. The exemption was meant for such students as they would not be able to catch up with local students who would be studying the subject from the Class I, the minister said.

Mr. Fadnavis, however, was not satisfied by the clarification. Southern states do not have such a clause, he said. If someone comes to Maharashtra from outside, it does not mean he or she should not learn Marathi, the former chief minister said. The House then passed the Bill unanimously.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mubko5/article30939612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27BMMARATHILANGUAGEDAYBUDGETSESSION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bill-making-marathi-mandatory-in-all-schools-passed-in-assembly/article30939613.ece
392,2020/02/28,CM alleges atrocities against Marathi speakers in Karnataka,"Uddhav says govt. will protect tribals from citizenship law

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday alleged that Marathi speakers in Karnataka were facing atrocities, and said while the Centre wants to protect Hindu refugees from other countries, “linguistic minorities” are suffering in our own country.

Referring to the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he also noted that tribals often do not possess documents to establish their caste and land rights. Mr. Thackeray was replying to a discussion in the Assembly on a motion to thank the Governor’s address.

After seven decades of Independence, many tribals still do not have complete freedom as they lack land rights and caste validity certificates, he said. “My government will support the tribals completely. There is a lot of unrest over the CAA, NRC, NPR. We will give complete protection to tribals in terms of education, jobs, and residential schools. We will stand by them,” he said.

Referring to border areas as “Karnataka-occupied Maharashtra,” the CM said all parties in the State should unite to end “linguistic atrocities” on Marathi-speaking people of Belgaum and other border towns.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/s7yau7/article30939515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bmAssembly-Backbencherscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cm-alleges-atrocities-against-marathi-speakers-in-karnataka/article30939516.ece
393,2020/02/28,Flash floods in city to become 25% more intense by 2050: McKinsey India study,"Sea level to rise by 0.5 metre; changes to affect nearly three million people living near coastline; city becomes 16th signatory to global climate action commitment

By 2050, Mumbai will see a 25% increase in intensity of flash floods and a 0.5-metre rise in sea level. Also, two to three million people living within 1 km of the coastline will be affected, according to a study by McKinsey India.

The findings were presented on the first day of a conference titled Climate Crisis: Action for Tropical Coastal Cities. Mumbai became the 16th city to sign Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCOM) on Thursday.

Indian and European coastal cities will share experiences on climate change adaptation planning and implementation at the two-day conference. On the agenda are a series of issues from urban flooding and risk management in coastal cities to the ecological impact that climate change is set to have on human health and marine life. The conference will also look at addressing group-specific vulnerabilities of climate change such as the debilitating impact it can have on livelihoods of the urban poor, women and youth.

Speaking at the conference, Dr. Shirish Sankhe, senior partner of McKinsey India, compared the condition of coastal cities including Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam, Florida and Mumbai. He said, “We expect that by 2050 in Mumbai, two to three million people living within 1 km of coastline will be affected by floods, a 0.5-metre rise in sea level, a 1.5-times increase in probability of 100 kmph winds, 25% increase in flash floods’ intensity. Right now, average flood depth is 0.46 m, by 2050, it will be 0.8 m. Flooded area over 0.05 m is 46% right now. It will go up to 60% by 2050. Please start incorporating climate risk in your decision making,” he said.

McKinsey had released its global report in January based on which McKinsey India did its own analysis, building upon it. It modelled a 40-year flash flood event to assess the impact on Mumbai city and its suburbs.

At the conference, Mumbai signed the GCOM commitment, an international coalition of city leaders committed to raising the global ambition for climate action. It became the 16th Indian city to have joined the initiative.

Speaking at the event, European Union Ambassador to India, Ugo Astuto said, “The fight against climate change is an existential issue. We need to act collaterally for the sake of future generations. We need to scale up global ambition when it comes to reducing carbon emissions. It is still possible to contain damage if we act now. That is why EU presented an ambitious vision and mission. We want carbon neutral Europe by 2050.”

He further said, “In Mumbai, we have seen destructive flooding last year, in 2017 and in 2005. It is not just about India. It’s a fact that coastal areas are at risk. The EU in 2013 prepared a strategy for climate change; 1,700 cities in Europe have already committed to enhancing their resilience. In India, so far 15 cities have joined. All metro projects have to go through a check for resilience and carbon footprint. Sustainable transportation is very important,” said Mr. Astuto.

The conference included a panel of consul generals of the Netherlands, Italy and Sweden sharing their experiences of climate change and what can be done to mitigate it.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lz50v4/article30937121.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bm-conference,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/flash-floods-in-city-to-become-25-more-intense-by-2050-mckinsey-india-study/article30937085.ece
394,2020/02/28,"Suspecting affair with friend, Kurar man hacks wife to death","The Kurar police have arrested a 38-year-old man for allegedly hacking his wife to death in their residence in the early hours of Thursday. The accused, Dinesh More, suspected his wife of having an affair with his friend, which led to the murder.

Mr. More used to stay with his wife Maya and their three daughters, all of them under 10 years, at Janu Bhoi Nagar in Kurar. Mr. More was employed as a security guard at a housing society in Malad and would often work late night or early morning shifts.

“Around 2 a.m. on Thursday, Mr. More came home after finishing his shift and an argument erupted between him and Maya. He had for some time been suspecting her of infidelity and was also getting increasingly uncomfortable with what he perceived to be her growing familiarity with one of his friends. These points came up in the argument,” an officer with the Kurar police said.

The officer said in the heat of the moment, Mr. More grabbed a sickle from the kitchen and hacked Maya several times. The sound of her cries woke up their daughters, who were sleeping in another room. But by the time they came out Mr. More had fled. His eldest daughter raised an alarm and the police were informed. Maya was rushed to Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivali, where she was declared dead before admission.

Meanwhile, three police teams fanned out in the area and one of them apprehended Mr. More as he was about to flee the locality. He was arrested and charged with murder under the Indian Penal Code. “Mr. More was produced in court in the afternoon, and has been remanded in police custody. We have recovered the murder weapon from his house and are interrogating him,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/suspecting-affair-with-friend-kurar-man-hacks-wife-to-death/article30937069.ece
395,2020/02/28,Private activism has destroyed public wealth: BMC chief,"Litigation has cost public infrastructure projects in city, says Praveen Pardeshi

Litigation by activists has cost public infrastructure projects heavily in Mumbai, said Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi.

Speaking at a conference titled, Climate Crisis: Action for Tropical Coastal Cities, Mr. Pardeshi referred to compulsory open spaces in housing societies and how it could instead become part of public space.

“Only 11% of the total land in Mumbai is under roads. We have luxurious norms for building open spaces wherein 25% of the area is under a building while a lot of space is under private open space. That's a very big shift we are trying to do with gaothans: increase area under streets,” he said.

On the ecological impact of the Coastal Road that led to litigation and a six-month stay on the project, he said, “We are using eco concrete that allows sea life to breathe. Our retaining wall will be made with it. Mumbai has a higher green cover than any other mega city but it does not translate into purer air. We added wealth to individuals but public wealth was destroyed by private activism. We don’t have roads, sewage treatment because every project has to be fractitiously agreed to. A city like Mumbai is blocked on public actions by the lack of consensus.”

He said at its worst, Coastal Road will lead to a 2-m rise in sea level. “If Bandra Kurla Complex had not been developed through reclamation, development would have to be shifted much further, (to a place) like Tungareshwar,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rmldup/article30937066.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARDESHI21PI73NGQDdisplayjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/private-activism-has-destroyed-public-wealth-bmc-chief/article30937067.ece
396,2020/02/28,"At 38.4°, Mumbai sees season’s hottest day","Maximum temperatures to gradually drop, heat wave to abate from today: IMD

The city recorded the season’s hottest day on Thursday at 38.4 degrees Celsius.

The India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Santacruz observatory, which represents Mumbai, recorded the maximum temperature at 38.4 degrees Celsius, which is 6 degrees above normal whereas Colaba saw the maximum temperature at 35.4 degrees, which is 4.5 degrees above normal.

Experts, in the third week of February, had warned of a rise in temperatures, signalling the end of winter and beginning of summer.

Thursday’s temperature in Mumbai is also the third highest of the decade. The all-time record for the highest maximum temperature in February was on February 25, 1966, at 39.6 degrees.

The minimum temperature in the city on Thursday stayed at 20.4 degrees, one degree above normal.

Maximum temperatures over other coastal stations have also risen leading to heat wave conditions in isolated pockets of Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts.

According to IMD, maximum temperatures are expected to gradually drop, and existing heat wave conditions are likely to abate from Friday. As per the 24-hour forecast for Mumbai, the maximum temperature will hover around 36-37 degrees Celsius.

“Due to the prevailing strong easterly winds from the land region, low humidity values, and delayed setting of sea breeze, the temperatures were expected to rise,” a statement from IMD said.

397,2020/02/28,Central kitchen for backward class student hostels,"Minister for Social Justice Dhananjay Munde on Thursday announced the setting up of central kitchens to ensure safe, clean and nutritious meals in hostels for backward class students. The scheme will start from the coming academic year.

Replying to queries raised during Question Hour in the Assembly, Mr. Munde announced that the existing hostels will be upgraded which will ensure equal amenities to all students residing in it. “The upgradation of hostels will be done in such a manner that students in Mumbai or Pune, and those in interiors of Maharashtra will get equal amenities and benefits,” said Mr. Munde.

The social justice department will also be installing CCTVs in all the hostels to ensure security of girl students, he added.

Nagpur south MLA Mohan Mate had raised a question about the poor quality of food served at the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar backward class hostel at Gaddigodam in Nagpur.

Mr. Munde said that the warden has been transferred and the food supplier changed.

Elaborating on the new proposal, Mr. Munde said, “The central kitchen will ensure better standard of food being served to the students. Decentralised kitchens create problems in supervising and monitoring the standards. If the kitchen is in one place, it will be easier to provide better quality food and also to monitor the process,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/go3gcf/article30937008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bmAssembly-BackbenchersRevcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/central-kitchen-for-backward-class-student-hostels/article30937009.ece
398,2020/02/28,Making children fall in love with news,"KidzByte app unveils video streaming feature and five young presenters

If you are concerned about your children not watching the news then you now have a fun way to help them keep track of current affairs.

KidzByte, a mobile application for children, has launched a video streaming feature, in which news will be presented by children between the age of nine and 15. Equipped with text and audio features, KidzByte unveiled its latest service and five young presenters at Mumbai Press Club. The presenters were selected through a competition, in which entries were invited from students all over the country.

Steep viewership target

KidzByte founder Chetan D’souza said news videos will be streamed on the over-the-top media platform and expects a viewership of around one lakh children. He said, “Through a study, we learned that children in the age group of nine to 17 spend an average of 60 to 120 minutes on smartphones, primarily for games, social media or video surfing. With KidzByte TV, children can watch content which will impart knowledge. Every child hates watching news, but this application will attract the children by offering child-friendly and knowledge-based content when it comes to current affairs.”

Mr. D’souza said the application will stream news from 16 different categories, including science and technology, environment, sports, career and basic politics, which will also help the anchors in improving their vocabulary and confidence.

The child anchors — Damia Mascarenhas (9), Vivaan Goel (9), Joanne Joseph (14), Shawna Mascarenhas (15) and Shaunak Kanavia (9) — are studying in different schools in Mumbai and have varied aspirations. Damia wishes to become a journalist, while Joanne has anchored several events at her school and dreams of a career in the same field.

“Although I wish to study science and become a physicist in future, this field is interesting as it gives knowledge about all the fields which are unknown to me,” Vivaan, a student of RBK International School, said.

Shawna said she has always been interested in politics and debates, and wishes to pursue a future in business management. “I used to argue with my grandfather over watching TV, but now we watch it together. I want to become a dancer, but this field educates me about many things apart from my own aspirations,” Shaunak said.

Mr. D’souza said KidzByte plans to visit schools to give students a studio-based experience in news anchoring, and induct students who display a flair for it.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/oif0io/article30937000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMKIDSBYTELAUNCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/making-children-fall-in-love-with-news/article30937001.ece
399,2020/02/28,5 arrested for daylight robbery bid at Kandivali jewellery store,"Two stolen bikes seized; gang was planning strikes in Pimpri-Chinchwad, Bhiwandi

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch has arrested a gang of five history-sheeters who allegedly tried to rob a jewellery store in Kandivali in broad daylight earlier this year. The accused had already finalised two more targets and were planning to strike again.

On January 22, the five, armed with a country-made handgun and choppers, barged into Pramanik Jewellers on the busy Akurli Road. They held the owner at gunpoint and were about to rob the store when the owner made a lunge for the silent alarm. The accused, thinking that he had succeeded in triggering the alarm, made a run for it. They also threatened several eyewitnesses, who tried to stop them, with their guns before fleeing on two motorbikes.

The Samata Nagar police registered a case against unidentified persons and the Crime Branch Unit XII was instructed to conduct parallel inquiries. Crime Branch officers scanned footage from nearly 100 CCTV cameras and started inquiries in the Dahisar–Nallasopara belt.

“We picked up the five from a slum in Dahisar on Wednesday. Their questioning established their involvement in the attempted robbery, and they also said they were going to try the same at a jewellery store in Pimpri-Chinchwad next week,” a Crime Branch officer said. The five, identified as Bharat Sharma (38), Ghevarchand Suthar (27), Shahid Khan (30), Shahzad Malik (28), and Farmaan Qureshi (24), were arrested.

The officer said, based on inquiries so far, Mr. Sharma and Mr. Suthar met in a prison in Gujarat while serving sentences in different cases of robbery. Mr. Sharma, who is based in Mumbai, told Mr. Suthar that he had already identified three commercial establishments — the jewellery stores in Kandivali and Pune and a medical store in Bhiwandi — as lucrative targets.

“After being released from prison, Mr. Suthar contacted the other three accused, who are from Uttar Pradesh and worked as guns for hire, and enlisted them for the job. The trio also arranged for the firearm and its ammunition, and all of them stayed in a rented room in Nallasopara. They watched the Kandivali jewellery store for the entire first week of January till they had all the information they needed. They reached the store with the intention of robbing it on January 21 but found it shut, after which they returned the next day,” another officer, who was part of the investigating team, said.

The officer said after the foiled attempt, they fled to Rajasthan, where they stayed for a couple of days before returning to Mumbai. This time, they rented a room in Dahisar, from where they were picked up, and also visited Pune on February 9, where they conducted a recce of the jewellery store. They arranged for a country-made gun and three live rounds of ammunition and were going to leave for Pune on Monday.

“We have also seized the two bikes that they had stolen from Mira Road to use in the Kandivali job and were also planning to use the vehicles in Pune. We have handed the accused over to the Samata Nagar police,” the officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3w9fmg/article30936986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bm-Crime-Branch2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5-arrested-for-daylight-robbery-bid-at-kandivali-jewellery-store/article30936975.ece

Un-Stereotype 2020, a flagship event under the inclusion and diversity objective of the Post Graduate Management Program for Women at S.P. Jain Institute of Management Research (SPJIMR) – a part of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan — was recently held at the institute.

Speakers who shared their inspirational stories included Madhavi Latha, founder president of the Wheelchair Basketball Federation of India and national level para swimmer. Ms. Latha spoke about rising above physical disabilities to find an identity.

Parveen Sheikh, who works for the uplift of slum dwellers, highlighted her journey from Mumbai’s footpaths to finding shelter and dignity, while Kiran Gera, chairperson, SAARC Chamber Women Entrepreneurs Council, spoke about the struggles of a woman in the corporate world. Jitender Chhattar, farmer and advocate, spoke about fighting for rights and justice. Sandhya Menon, journalist and #MeToo campaigner, focused on rampant sexual harassment at work and how it is still hard for women to raise such issues.

Veena Gupta, India’s first female bodyguard, discussed choosing a profession which is so ‘male’ and Mittal Patel, trustee, V.S.S.M, who works for the nomadic communities in Gujarat, spoke on her journey of giving them their identity. The event included keynote addresses by Dr. Saundarya Rajesh, founder and president of Avtar and Dr. Ranjan Banerjee, dean, SPJIMR.

Dr. Ashita Aggarwal, chairperson PGMPW, in her address highlighted how unconsciously or consciously we play a role in forming social stereotypes. “Stereotypes by the educated is more dangerous as they are camaflouged as well as reasoned and rationale,” she said. Dr. Aggarwal highlighted that everyone is part of the problem and it is time to start thinking differently and nurture the next generation differently.

Dr. Banerjee emphasised on the significance of inclusion and diversity at workplaces. Sharing his personal experiences, he said “we all are constantly hearing the sound of our own biases and the onus to bring in change lies within us”.

The event was brought together by Bhavan’s SPJIMR, Mumbai, which is one of the top ﬁve business schools in the country, with Avtar, India’s premier diversity and inclusion solutions company. It witnessed an encouraging participation from senior corporate leaders, including CHROs, D&I heads, business and SBU heads of Indian and multi-national companies.

401,2020/02/28,BMC may get department dedicated to climate change,"DMU says will discuss matter with municipal commissioner

The disaster management unit (DMU) of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is all for forming a climate change department in the civic body.

Mahesh Narvekar, chief officer of the DMU, made this statement at Climate Crisis: Action for Tropical Coastal Cities, an event organised by non-profit initiative Mumbai First. The chief officer said he would talk to Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi to set up a separate climate change department.

Mr. Narvekar along with Sanjay Bhatia, chairman, Mumbai Port Trust; Mohanasundar Radhakrishnan from Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) Delft Institute of Water Education, The Netherlands; and Dr. Kapil Gupta, civil engineering professor at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay; discussed the climate crisis in Mumbai and tropical coastal cities.

The DMU chief officer said Mumbai is an almost fully developed city and more development is difficult. “The 2005 flood was an eye-opening disaster. The small control room was upgraded to a large emergency operation centre monitoring the entire city. As it is an unplanned city, commuters from the suburbs travel south in the day, raising the population to four million, whereas the night population remains as low as 17,000. Evacuation of this uneven distribution of people becomes a huge challenge for the civic department during disasters,” he said.

Mr. Narvekar said that earlier, the BMC had just two weather stations, but the number has since gone up to 60, with stations in different parts of the city showing the real-time air quality.

Mr. Bhatia said the Mumbai Port Trust was working to prevent natural disasters. “On the Eastern Waterfront, our main agenda is to redevelop almost 200 hectares into an open space with a huge lake, which will work as a reservoir in times of floods. We have completely stopped the consumption of coal at the port, which will also decrease the impact on the climate. Even the new water transport initiatives, like hovercraft and Ro-Ro ferries, can be used to evacuate people during the time of emergency,” he said.

Mr. Gupta said development increases floods by nine times and suggested a few measures to counter climate change.

“Green roofs at the top of buildings can be made obligatory to compensate the loss of green cover on the ground. Installing a 1,000 litre water tank for rainwater harvesting decreases the loss of water by 43%. Detention ponds can be constructed at various places to store the flood water and can be used alternatively during normal situations. Cities with lack of space can build large underground storage systems like in Hong Kong, which is under a football field,” Mr. Gupta said.

Mr. Radhakrishnan said a city should be frequently upgraded like a smartphone and people should be consulted about climate crisis. “Any plan needs at least six months to one year for the approval and listing in the municipal budget, but initially there should be a political will behind it,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pu3q3z/article30936903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bm-Narvekar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-may-get-department-dedicated-to-climate-change/article30936904.ece

Class VIII students too confirmed the allegation. The teacher then informed the principal, who contacted the Sanpada-based trust.

403,2020/02/28,‘File case against Raj for divisive remarks’,"Outfits say MNS chief’s comments provoking party workers to target minorities

A recent drive undertaken by the Pune unit of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) against alleged illegal Bangladeshi immigrants has drawn heavy flak, with a number of organisations demanding a police case be filed against MNS chief Raj Thackeray for his “irresponsible” and “socially divisive” statements which provoked his party workers to commit such actions.

On Tuesday, the Sahakarnagar police lodged an FIR against some MNS activists after their overzealous drive backfired. They claimed to have nabbed an illegal Bangladeshi immigrant, who turned out to be from West Bengal instead.

The FIR, lodged under Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 and 149 (pertaining to rioting), 448 (trespassing), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 37(1) of the Maharashtra Police Act, 1951, was based on a complaint by Roshan Shaikh, who is from West Bengal and has been earning a living in Pune for nearly two decades.

According to the complaint, MNS office-bearers, led by the party’s city president Ajay Shinde, stormed into Gulmohor Apartment in Dhankawadi on February 22 and accused Mr. Shaikh and two others, also from West Bengal, of being illegal Bangladeshi immigrants. They remained unmoved despite the three men producing papers which showed they were from West Bengal.

The MNS members took Mr. Shaikh and the others to Sahakarnagar police station, where they were detained till the evening and were finally permitted to leave after the police confirmed their credentials.

Satish Gaikwad of the Republican Party of India (I), who, along with lawyer Tosif Shaikh, helped the victim register the complaint, said, “MNS workers are trespassing houses of innocent people and are targeting the minority community in Maharashtra in the name of evicting Bangladeshis and Pakistanis. People are being harassed with demands of proof of citizenship.”

He said the innocent men had to endure the ordeal despite being Indian citizens.

Advocate Shaikh said the MNS’s actions were creating fear in the minds of innocent citizens, and demanded that Mr. Thackeray be made party in the FIR and his statements be thoroughly scrutinised by the police. “The MNS’s vigilantism is setting a dangerous precedent and poses a threat to public tranquillity and peace. It is ultimately the party chief who is responsible for such drives,” he said.

Along with the demand to rename Aurangabad to ‘Sambhajinagar’, the issue of illegal migrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh is high on the MNS’s agenda in the run-up to the election to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation to be held in April. Posters exhorting people to turn in illegal immigrants and claim ₹5,000 from the MNS have already mushroomed in Aurangabad.

Anjum Inamdar, founder of the Mulnivasi Muslim Manch, demanded that the police investigate Mr. Thackeray and lodge an FIR against him. “Mr. Thackeray’s speeches, which are calculated to spark social discord, have resulted in MNS workers conducting such drives. We demand that this self-proclaimed vigilantism be checked and Mr. Thackeray be restrained from making such irresponsible statements,” he said.

Condemning the MNS’s actions, former Bombay High Court judge B.G. Kolse-Patil said every citizen has the right to make his living in any State he or she pleases. “The MNS’s drive against illegal immigrants smacks of crass political opportunism. How can they take the law into their own hands and interrogate whoever they please?” he said.

Mr. Shinde, meanwhile, claimed that the MNS had undertaken the drive with the help of the police — a claim which is now being investigated by the Sahakarnagar police.

Meanwhile, city Congress leaders said that while illegal migrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh must be evicted, the MNS ought to have been more prudent in their drive. “There is every possibility that senior citizens may be harassed during the course of such actions,” said Pune City Congress general secretary Ramesh Iyer.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/8qnr0n/article30936880.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMRAJTHACKERAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/file-case-against-raj-for-divisive-remarks/article30936881.ece
404,2020/02/28,"Kharghar, Taloja residents stage agitation against rise in pollution","MPCB agrees to take up demands and start work by March 5

About 300 members of the Kharghar Taloja Colonies Welfare Association held a protest on Thursday outside the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) office over rising pollution in the Kharghar-Taloja belt.

Their nine demands include the formation of an environment surveillance committee comprising citizen groups, a senior officer from MPCB, Panvel Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner, and a retired judge from the green tribunal.

Mangesh Ranawade, chairman of the association, said, “Every month, the panel will collect 25 air and water samples from PMC wards and five samples from the industrial estate.” He said all factories in Taloja should be shut till the common effluent treatment plant starts working. KTCWA has also demanded real-time air monitoring systems at Kharghar, Kalamboli and Taloja industrial estates. “We don’t want small prototype equipment that can be tampered by MPCB and PMC officials,” Mr. Ranawade said.

Another demand is to halt residential constructions in Taloja Phase 1 and build parks, sports complexes, and industrial parks. “We also want the chemical industrial zone to be abolished,” Mr. Ranawade said. The association has also sought a ban on illegal quarrying around Pandavkada Hills and conservation of mangroves in the belt.

Dhananjay Patil, regional officer, MPCB, said, “We have accepted their application and will start work on it by March 5. Many agencies like MIDC and CIDCO are involved in their demands.” Mr. Ranawade has asked MPCB to given a written assurance that it will take up their demands.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/flr5g2/article30936876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMYogesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kharghar-taloja-residents-stage-agitation-against-rise-in-pollution/article30936877.ece
405,2020/02/28,"Metro 3 passes through Mithi’s main water region, sets record","Tunnelling on 1.48-km stretch likely to be over by March-end

The Mumbai Metro Line 3 has successfully finished tunnelling under the main water channel of the Mithi river making it the second Metro corridor in India to achieve this feat. Of the 1.18-km-long stretch under the riverbed, both tunnels have crossed the 270-metre-long active river channel.

The portion under the river is between Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and Dharavi station and is part of the 1.48-km-long tunnels being built between the two stations. S.K. Gupta, director (projects), Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL), said the two tunnel boring machines (TBMs) had completed 87% and 65%, and were expected to finish work by the end of March.

“One TBM has around 200 metres left to tunnel, while the other has 500 metres remaining. We have completed tunnelling in the active water region of the river. The tunnels are around 8-12 metres below the surface of the water,” he said.

The active water region is a 270-metre stretch where water continuously flows. Mr. Gupta said nearly the entire 1.1-km stretch fills up during high tide, which has marshy soil and mangroves. The two tunnels are being built by earth pressure balance TBMs and a special type of gasket is being used to ensure that the tunnels are watertight.

The MMRCL is also building a third tunnel under the Mithi using the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM), which is a traditional manual intensive form of tunnelling. The BKC will have three lines instead of two with one being used to reverse trains. Around 22.22% of the 153-metre-long tunnel is complete as MMRCL officials said the labour-intensive tunnelling method is much slower than the TBM.

“Typically TBMs build around 10 metres of tunnels every day on an average as opposed to around 1 to 2 metres that is completed using the NATM method,” an official said.

Unlike the tunnels built by the TBMs, those built by the NATM are arch-shaped and built using small excavators, instead of the regular ones and with controlled blasting. Mr. Gupta said tunnelling under the river was a challenging task as the soil underneath the riverbed was soft and porous. The entire underground corridor from Colaba to SEEPZ will be made operational in two phases, with BKC serving as the intermediary station.

Highest density at BKC

BKC Metro station has been planned as a crucial station and is expected to cater to the highest density along Metro Line 3. Metro officials said they will also offer a higher frequency of trains between BKC and Cuffe Parade of around four minutes, with every alternate train from Cuffe Parade terminating at BKC.

BKC is the longest station on Metro Line 3 and will have three lines instead of two. It will also have two island platforms, to provide easy interchange from trains terminating at BKC.

The station will have stabling lines to park trains and a seamless paid-to-paid interchange with Metro Line 2B, where commuters would not need to get out of stations of either Metro to change. Mr. Gupta said they had also made a provision to connect the station to the proposed bullet train.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cutmjc/article30936900.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMMETRO1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/metro-3-passes-through-mithis-main-water-region-sets-record/article30936868.ece
406,2020/02/28,Slack in economy presents chance to innovate: experts,"Focus on future of work in logistics, infrastructure sectors

Experts spoke about embracing the disruption in the banking, finance, services and insurance (BFSI) industries, future of work in logistics and infrastructure sector plus growth strategies for staffing companies at the 2nd Industry Staffing Conclave organised by the Indian Staffing Federation (ISF) in the city recently.

Speaking on the future of work in various sectors, Rituparna Chakraborty, president of ISF, said, “The future seems unpredictable due the existence of imbalance in the market. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Google have touched valuation of $1 trillion each. Ten years earlier, no one would have depicted this. The imbalance exists because of the reality distortion that these companies have created. Apple created it by making great products, Amazon by its reach, Microsoft by software, Google by search and Facebook by influencing consumer behaviour.”

Ms. Chakraborty expressed her belief in the BFSI, technology and logistics sectors and said that they have the potential to grow at a higher rate than 22% with the help of technology.

Hemant Bhargava, former managing director of Life Insurance Corporation, said, “Automation of industries leads to very few people managing huge set-ups which is good, but I also feel worried about the reducing employment opportunities due to this. The biggest challenge is to find increasing set of people who are multi-skilled to handle significant jobs.” He explained that companies like Ola and Uber are not eating up jobs as a lot of employment is created in the back end of these companies.

While economic slowdown is looked at as a disadvantage, Gautam Sinha, head, performance, reward and talent staffing, Ultratech Cement, gave a different perspective. “A slack in the economy is an opportunity to do innovative things and become more efficient in our work. It is also the time to back your work and the value it is creating for the customer,” he said.

Supreet Singh, head, strategic and corporate HR, Tata AIG, said, “Artificial intelligence is the superpower. We will start seeing the disruption if India doesn’t grow at a higher speed and if organisations do not train their workforce to manage that kind of a disruption, we will start seeing players falling out of the market.”

Global human resource leader and coach Mandeep Maitra said it is important to educate oneself to survive in the industry and being relevant is the only way ahead. Ravi Krishnamurthy, president of SBI Life Insurance Ltd., said staffing organisations need to invest in training employees according to the industrial requirements.

The experts even discussed that in future, jobs will be more contract-based than permanent as the millennial generation doesn’t only work for money, but also for a cause.

Dr. Deepak Deshpande, chief human resources officer and senior vice-president of Netmagic Solutions, explained the concept of smart cities and said the government has planned to convert 100 cities into smart cities and a budget of ₹1 lakh crore has been assigned for related infrastructure. “Smart city is a marriage between information, communication, technology (ICT), technology and the people and their lifestyle,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/slack-in-economy-presents-chance-to-innovate-experts/article30936833.ece

The accused, Manisha Singh, is a Navi Mumbai resident. Officers said the complainant was appointed as an advisor in the process of transferring a plot in the name of a housing society. On January 30, he approached Ms. Singh to get the land valued and presented the requisite documents to her. During this meeting, Ms. Singh allegedly demanded a bribe of ₹2,000 for each of the 67 members of the housing society, which collectively comes up to ₹1.34 lakh.

The realtor approached the ACB. In a conversation with Ms. Singh, which was monitored by the ACB, she allegedly reiterated the bribe demand and after some bargaining brought it down to ₹1.25 lakh.

On Thursday, the complainant handed over the first instalment of ₹50,000 to Mahesh Kattimani, a civilian who was allegedly accepting the money on Ms. Singh’s behalf.

409,2020/02/28,COVID-19: ‘govt. should turn adversity into opportunity’,"Industry experts seek necessary measures to protect country’s trade interests

In the wake of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in China, industry experts have predicted a cascading effect on India’s economy if the Central government fails to take necessary measures to protect trade interests.

Naushad Panjwani, president, Indo American Chamber of Commerce (IACC), West India Council, said, “We have a high dependence on China in terms of imports and exports. For example, reliance on the country for pharmaceutical products is huge. The government will have to rejig policies, tariffs and subsidies so that industry is not hit. But I don’t see anything being done.”

‘Address anomalies’

Mr. Panjwani was speaking at an awareness programme on COVID-19 organised by IACC, the Indian Merchants’ Chamber and Lilavati Hospital on Thursday. He said the government has to rise to the occasion, mitigate risks and work towards converting the adversity into an opportunity. “With support from the government, Indian enterprises can be strengthened. The Central government can reach out and see how many Chinese companies can be set up in India,” said Mr. Panjwani. He added, “It is not that orders are going to start flowing overnight. But it is a good time to address anomalies in our system on an SOS basis.”

Infectious disease specialist Dr. Vasant Nagvekar said maintaining basic hand hygiene is critical to curbing the spread of COVID-19. He said, “The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronaviruses were more lethal. COVID-19 is more contagious but less lethal.” Dr. Nagvekar said good hand hygiene was found to be most effective to curb the spread of MERS and SARS outbreaks and should be followed to reduce transmission of any virus.

Farhat Jamal, group adviser, hospitality, Hiranandani Communities, said acting on safety advisories, hotels are holding frequent meetings for their staff on dos and don’ts to tackle the outbreak. Staff members have been asked to wear masks and offer them to visitors. He said, “Our traditional way of greeting, namaste, is good instead of shaking hands.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/u1ls9y/article30936813.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMCoronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-govt-should-turn-adversity-into-opportunity/article30936814.ece
410,2020/02/28,Leaders of different faiths condemn Delhi violence,"Alliance demands Shah’s resignation, action against police

Leaders of various religions and castes on Thursday came together under the banner of the National Alliance against CAA, NRC and NPR to express their disappointment at the continued violence in Delhi.

The leaders, belonging to Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian, scheduled and backward communities, demanded that Union Home Minister Amit Shah resign as he had failed in his duties.

Activist and co-convener of the alliance Rakesh Rathod said, “The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could not accept its defeat in the Delhi elections, and set the city ablaze. The protests against the dark laws continued in peace in various locations in Delhi, but politicians like Kapil Mishra and Anurag Thakur instigated the people through their speeches and suddenly riots took over.”

Mr. Rathod said the Home Ministry not being informed about the violence happening in the city is impossible. He criticised and condemned the ministry and the Delhi Police for turning a blind eye towards the injustice. “We also appeal to the government to identify the Delhi Police officers who carried out violence and to set up an inquiry against them,” he said.

The members and co-conveners of the alliance also met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari and put forth their demands and expectations from the government.

Bishop Ravi Kumar Stephen alleged that the Delhi government was also responsible for the riots, because such incidents cannot happen when a foreign dignitary is visiting the country and high security measures are in place. “When the Delhi High Court directed the police to arrest the people who have instigated violence, Justice S. Muralidhar was transferred.” Bishop Stephen said that during Indira Gandhi’s time, at least the court had the power to announce a verdict against her.

Maulana Ejaz Kashmiri said the police should take action against lawbreakers and perpetrators of violence, irrespective of their religious and political affiliations. He said, “The BJP wants to maintain the enmity between Hindus and Muslims till 2024 so that it can cash on it in the elections. Amit Shah practises dictatorship and at times, acts like a stubborn child who does not want to go back on his word. In a democracy, everyone is given a chance to speak and advice is taken from all. But Mr. Shah is an agent of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/epeycy/article30936807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bm-CAA-protest,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/leaders-of-different-faiths-condemn-delhi-violence/article30936808.ece

Capgemini has unveiled the OUTfront Ally Networking Group (OANG), which will provide emotional assistance to its employees from the LGBTQ+ community. The company has started OANG at its branches in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Noida and will soon be launched across all its branches in the world.

Capgemini is a multinational corporation providing consultation, technology, professional and outsourcing services, and OANG lets its employees from the LGBTQ+ community share their feelings about the workplace and personal problems.

Gayathri Ramamurthy, diversity and inclusion leader - India, Capgemini, said the company has been trying to work for the community so that they can bring their entire self to office. Ms. Ramamurthy said, “Any bisexual, trans, gay or lesbian employee from the company can come up with their problems on the company’s internal connectivity application or can personally meet the diversity department to talk about anything they feel. Also, any individual from the company can be an ally to provide visible support to people from diverse communities.”

She said the initiative also provides education to all its employees on the needs of other employees from the LGBTQ+ community. She said, “Every person is different and they also have their own exclusive needs. We will educate the employees to welcome the needs of their colleagues which will help them emotionally.”

Ms. Ramamurthy said the company has been working on the cause since 2017 and has provided many facilities for their employees from the LGBTQ+ community. She said, “In 2017, our global colleagues felt that there was a need to talk about the issue after which we started having dialogues with the employees through digital media as emotional pain can only be expressed by talking to somebody. We started educating our employees about the science of genders as the organisation has zero tolerance towards gender discrimination.”

Capgemini also gives medical insurance to employees with same-sex partners even if they are not married. She said, “If the employee wants to undergo a gender affirmation surgery, they can use the insurance whereas a regular medical insurance does not cover it under their plans. We have introduced all-gender restrooms in our offices, which can be used by the employees as well as our clients and suppliers.”

Ms. Ramamurthy also said the company provides maternity leave to women who have a child through surrogacy and the leave can be extended for a month.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3ii7qf/article30936764.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BMPride-March,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/providing-emotional-support-to-lgbtq-staff/article30936765.ece
412,2020/02/28,"Woman, daughter among three held for killing husband’s lover","With help of auto driver, they stab her to death, dump body

The Uran police have arrested a mother-daughter duo along with the daughter’s boyfriend for allegedly killing her father’s lover.

The victim, Kalpana alias Jaya Tukaram Ghanekar (33), was found dead among debris on a road that leads from Taki village bus stop to Maqba farm house in Uran, on Monday. It was recognised by her cousin from Uran via a WhatsApp forward.

“The body had swollen and the cousin was confused so he got in touch with the victim’s brother in Mumbai, who identified her. But along with him, came one Mukhtar Hussain, a resident of Shahbaz village, Belapur,” senior police inspector Jagdish Kulkarni from Uran police station said.

Mr. Hussain told the police that his wife and daughter had killed Ghanekar as he had an affair with the woman.

On the evening of February 23, the woman (42), her daughter (20), and her boyfriend, Hassan Hussain Shaikh (24), who is already married and has a two-month-old baby, picked up the victim from her residence in Mansarovar in Mr. Shaikh’s autorickshaw.

They told her that they were taking her to the police station, but after reaching Chirner, they killed her. They stabbed her 32 times and dumped her body in the debris at the forest in Taki village.

Ghanekar was married to an alcoholic whom she abandoned in 2010, and her 12-year-old son is being looked after by her brother. Later in 2011, she met Mr. Hussain and fell in love. Mr. Hussain made arrangements for her to stay in Manasarover and often stayed with her, and also visited his wife and daughter at Shahbaz. Ghanekar worked at Bal Ashram, Sandhurst Road.

“The woman would often fight with Ghanekar since Mr. Hussain used to spend money on her. Her daughter, who works in a beauty parlour, was frustrated with her father’s affair and decided to kill Ghanekar,” Mr. Kulkarni said.

Mr. Shaikh was arrested on Thursday while the mother and daughter were arrested on Tuesday. All the three have been arrested for murder and disappearance of evidence.

While the mother-daughter duo have been remanded in police custody till March 2, Mr. Shaikh will be produced before court on Friday.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/woman-daughter-among-three-held-for-killing-husbands-lover/article30936738.ece

414,2020/02/28,No country for climate refugees,"The climate crisis is uprooting more people than war and it’s time to get serious, says Nidhi Adlakha

Picture this: a decade or so from now, you are forced to leave your country due to recurring floods or air quality so bad you can’t step outdoors. It may seem impossible right now as you read this in the comfort of your home, but for many across the world, this is reality. And it isn’t too far for us either.

It is becoming clear that climate crisis is creating more refugees than war. Instead of focusing on weeding out ‘illegal immigrants’, the government should stress on what is a much larger issue: the irreversible damage we are causing our environment and the rise in climate refugees. Before you roll your eyes at the comparison, you may want to look at these hard-hitting statistics on environmental migrants from the World Migration Report, 2020.

It states that by end-2018, there were a total of 28 million new internal displacements across 148 countries and territories. Nearly 61% (17.2 million) of these new displacements were triggered by disasters, and 39% (10.8 million) were caused by conflict and violence. Brought out by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), the report highlights that, as in previous years, weather-related disasters triggered the vast majority of all new displacements across the world.

No going back

International organisations have called out erring countries. The National Security, Military, and Intelligence Panel on Climate Change’s report this month states that religious extremism in South and Southeast Asian countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, and India has increased, as populations blame governments for protracted poverty, unemployment, and lack of services. These conditions are likely to become more acute with increasingly harsh climate impacts.

Countries need to wake up to the fact that weather-related events are causing the most havoc. Just last month, Filippo Grandi, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, attended the World Economic Forum and said (in an interview to Reuters): ‘The world needs to prepare for millions of people being driven from their homes by the impact of climate change’. How is this not making the headlines and creating social media buzz?

Eyes on Asia

These facts are especially worrying for us in Asia. The IOM report highlights that ‘Southern Asian populations are ‘particularly vulnerable to slow-onset and rapid-onset disasters related to natural hazards and climate change’. The region has the highest number of people at risk of displacement as a result of sudden-onset hazards, with Bangladesh, India and Pakistan having the highest disaster risk. In 2018, India bore most of the brunt of the disasters in the region: over 2.7 million displacements were recorded due to tropical storms and floods.

Rise in sea level is officially the ‘most devastating climate threat’ to the Asia-Pacific region. Reports state that over 37 million people in the East Asian and Pacific regions could be displaced by a one-metre rise and the number would double in the case of a two-metre rise. Coastal cities like Mumbai, Bangkok, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, and Guangzhou are on the firing line and will see huge economic and livelihood losses from rising seas.

Opening borders

But are countries willing to open their borders? Five years ago, Ioane Teitiota from the Republic of Kiribati in the central Pacific Ocean identified himself as a climate refugee and sought asylum in New Zealand. He mentioned violent land disputes, environmental degradation, failing crops and contaminated water as reasons to find safer ground. His application was rejected and he then approached the UN Human Rights Committee. While the Committee couldn’t get him asylum as ‘sufficient protection measures were put in place’ in Kiribati, the case was a starting point for future climate change-related asylum claims.

In a historic ruling on January 21 this year, the United Nations (UN) declared that ‘countries cannot deport people who have sought asylum due to climate-related threats’. But let’s be realistic. A simple declaration isn’t going to get countries to change laws in a matter of days. Take Germany, for instance. Earlier this month, the country denied asylum to climate refugees. Refusing to recognise ‘flight from climatic conditions and changes’ as a viable reason for asylum, the federal government’s official statement said: ‘People in third countries who leave their homes solely because of the negative consequences of climate change are not refugees in the sense of the Geneva Refugee Convention under current international treaty law’.

To conclude

What we need is a clear classification of who qualifies as a climate refugee, plausible causes that grant him/her that status, the countries to approach and assessing their economic and climactic conditions, among several other factors.

The IOM report has analysed that there have been substantial developments in global migration governance in recent years. However, ‘an overarching framework has not yet fully emerged to provide policy guidance where human mobility and environmental stressors, including climate change, intersect’.

415,2020/02/28,"If it’s evil, it’s not us","It is so much easier and happier when everyone else but us is in the wrong

A few days ago, I had an interesting chat with a gentleman; let’s call him H, a huge BJP supporter. H told me he was deeply disappointed with the party; that they had conclusively proven they were clueless about economics, policy or governance. But, said H, he would still vote BJP because, Hindutva. In 2014, I remember the same people insisting they were voting for progress, development and administration. In 2020, it is a relief to see they no longer have to keep up the pretence.

H and his ilk will never forgive corruption or a failing economy or poor administration in any political party that dares to treat all religions as equal. But if the political party’s avowed aim is Hindutva, then suddenly, they don’t really care where the jobs are or if every single high-value contract steadily goes to a single company.

Anyway, a few days ago, I mailed H the names of the 13 Navy personnel, all Hindus, who have been arrested for spying for Pakistan. His response? “They were greedy and stupid. Not evil. This distinction must be made.” I asked if he would make this distinction if the names had been Muslim or Christian. He hasn’t replied yet.

And therein lies the crux. Neither criminality nor evil has a religion, but as long as we convince ourselves that being Hindu somehow absolves us of all criminality but being Muslim makes us intrinsically evil, we will carry the burden of communal bias with us to the grave.

Let us fast forward to the violence that broke out in Delhi this week. Ask yourself why a CAA protest that was peaceful for months would turn into a violent conflagration immediately after a BJP member named Kapil Mishra marched with a mob to a protest site and blatantly declared, with a smiling policeman standing next to him, “After Trump leaves, not even the police can stop us. Either you stop the protest or else.”

The slogans shouted, the colour of the flags raised, the identifying of victims by religion, the religious shrines attacked — there are videos and photos and ground reports that testify to all of this. But none of it will matter. Because if you are Hindu and you commit a crime, you are blinded by passion or you are provoked or you’re angry or it is in self-defence — but you are never communal and you are never biased and you are never, ever evil.

In Delhi this week, both Hindus and Muslims have been killed and injured and had their property destroyed. But as the days and the WhatsApp forwards and the TV programmes unfold, one thing will soon become absolutely clear to all of us. Every Hindu victim we will find was attacked by bloodthirsty, communal, religious bigots whose only aim is to destroy Hindus and break up India. All other victims? Mere collateral damage.

So, what provoked us peaceful Hindus to inflict this erm... collateral damage? The CAA protest. And why should that be? Isn’t Delhi immune to protests by now? Marches for Nirbhaya, vigils for Jessica Lal, millions of farmers squatting, Dalit marches, Section 377 parades… the list is endless. Surely they could have ignored this one, too?

Ah, but you forget. This protest was by Muslims. How dare a minority community that is here on our sufferance protest? How dare they keep it peaceful? How dare their ‘backward’ women find a voice? How dare they sing the national anthem and raise the tricolour? How dare they include inter-faith songs and prayers? How dare their leaders speak like statesmen and advise peace and non-violence?

Every demonising stereotype so carefully cultivated around the community over the last few years was systematically broken by the CAA protests. And that is why Delhi had to burn.

In the ensuing mayhem, we can always get away with murder because we are Hindu (and the cops are with us), but over the coming weeks we will be able to frame a hundred TV programmes that satisfyingly condemn and label everyone else as terrorists, anti-nationals and criminals. Once all the stereotypes are thus re-established, we will be able to happily return to the moribund economy and Melania Trump’s designer sherwani and our morally pure lives, convinced that we can never do wrong.

416,2020/02/28,A cumbersome procedure,"The affordable category has been the saviour of the housing sector, which is experiencing its worst phase in the past five years.

One major hurdle faced by lower middle class and EWS citizens is the cumbersome procedure in getting construction plan approved by local authorities.

Since it is mandatory to have plan approved, banks and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) seek approved plan to provide home loans under PMAY norms and also under their credit norms. Unfortunately, unauthorised local agents, hand-in-glove with plan sanctioning authorities, have established their own agency in getting approval of construction plans. The local agents seek huge sums of money for getting plans approved, and many times, after collecting money, vanish from the scene, leaving the gullible people to face hardships.

Hence it is strongly suggested to remove the plan approval procedure for construction of houses by individuals for houses meeting the affordable housing norms. In such case, people can be guided by government authorities by providing model house plans or issue guidelines to licensed architects/engineers to draw plans.

417,2020/02/28,Making it affordable,"Rationalising stamp duty and increasing FSI can boost State revenues and also help the realty sector. By R.P. Deshpande

On the eve of presentation of the State Budget by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa (on March 5), stakeholders and experts met him and gave suggestions related to the real estate sector in Karnataka.

Presently there is a uniform stamp duty of 5% on immovable property sales/transfers in the State. It is recommended to rationalise the stamp duty, based on the cost of property, with a view to increase the revenue from stamp duty and providing significant relief to EWS, LIG and lower strata of MIG who are desirous of buying their dream homes. The stamp duty recommended for property worth less than ₹50 lakh is 4%; ₹50 lakh-₹100 lakh, 5%; above ₹100 lakh, 6%

Economics of revenue collection in Bengaluru

At present rate of 5% stamp duty, for 100 properties of average cost of ₹50 lakh, the revenue collection is ₹250 lakh at recommended stamp duty rates.

Assumptions: average cost of 60% properties is ₹30 lakh; cost of 30% properties, ₹75 lakh; average cost of 10% properties, ₹150 lakh.

For property cost of ₹30 lakh at stamp duty rate of 4% and number of properties being 60, the revenue collection is ₹72 lakh; for property worth ₹75 lakh, stamp duty of 5% and number being 30, the revenue is ₹112.5 lakh; and for those costing ₹150 lakh and stamp duty of 6% and number of units being 10, the revenue is ₹90 lakh. The total is ₹274.5 lakh. This is slightly higher than the stamp duty collection, as per present system. Once stamp duty is rationalised as suggested, it is most likely that the number of registrations will increase, leading to higher revenue collections.

On a socialistic approach, it is necessary to subsidise the poor and levy a slightly higher stamp duty on the rich. Increasing stamp duty on all commercial properties to 6% will certainly increase the revenue collection.

If implemented, this measure will give the required fillip to the national objective of ‘Housing for all by 2022’ and encourage the ‘affordable housing’ sector.

Increasing FSI in CBD areas

At present, depending on the width of approach road and other parameters, FSI (Floor Space Index) or FAR (Floor Area Ratio) is fixed between 1.75 and 3.25. In most of the areas, the applicable FSI is 1.75 or 2.25.

Due to astronomical increase in land costs, especially in CBD areas, violating the approved plan and constructing more built-up area has become the order of the day, which has led to congestion, putting heavy pressure on civic agencies in providing basic amenities to the residents and it has also encouraged rampant corruption in the system.

In CBD areas with the present FSI norms, a builder cannot make a viable project at all. For example, the market price of an apartment in Basavanagudi is around 10,000 per sft., where land price is around Rs. 20,000 per sft. Say on a plot of 10,000 sft, FSI allowed is 1.75% and hence as per approved plan, builder can construct 17,500 sft. The input costs are as follows:

At a land cost of ₹2,000 lakh, construction cost of built-up area at 2,000 per sft being ₹350.0 lakh, and administrative cost at ₹500 per sft being ₹87.5 lakh, the total is ₹2,437.5 lakh.

At the market sale price of ₹10,000 per sft., the realisation from sale of 17,500 sft is ₹ 1,750 lakh. Thus, if the builder constructs as per approved plan, he stands to lose ₹687.5 lakh.

To make the project viable, builders are constrained to violate the approved plan and increase the area of construction from 17,500 sft to 30,000 to 40,000 sft, thus achieving FSI of 3 to 4. On an average, majority of small builders go for 35,000 sft. Then the input costs and realisation of sales workout as follows:

At land cost of ₹2,000 lakh; construction cost at ₹2,000 per sft working out to ₹700 lakh; and administrative costs at ₹500 per sft coming to ₹175 lakh, the total is ₹2,875 lakh.

Revised realisation

By selling at the same price of ₹10,000 per sft, sales realisation on 35,000 sft is ₹3,500 lakh and gross profit is ₹625 lakh. It is estimated that to manage the violations, a whopping ₹100 lakh is spent! When this kind of development has become almost order of the day and almost all apartments are built using FSI of 3.5 to 4 in CBD areas, it is suggested to increase the FSI officially to 3 and allow proper development and wipe out corruption from the system.

The worst worry is for projects coming up on less than 500 sq. mt plot and have up less than 8 units, which are out of the ambit of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016. While medium-size and large projects coming under RERA will have to construct as per approved plans, the violations in smaller projects will certainly make the CBD areas unliveable.

419,2020/02/28,AIADMK says Puducherry Chief Minister adopted double standards in free rice scheme,"AIADMK Legislature party leader A. Anbalagan said the party would launch a major agitation if the cash equivalent of rice was not credited to the bank accounts of beneficiaries in a month’s time

The Opposition AIADMK has charged Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy with adopting double standards in the implementation of the free rice scheme.

Talking to mediapersons on Friday, AIADMK Legislature party leader A. Anbalagan said that the Chief Minister had unsuccessfully approached the Madras High Court to insist that the government be permitted to distribute rice to cardholders in the Union Territory instead of the cash equivalent.

With the Madras High Court dismissing the writ petition of the Chief Minister, he has now been instigating the DMK and Left parties to stage protests demanding distribution of rice instead of cash.

The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) system of implementation was only introduced by the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government and the then Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram had launched the scheme in Puducherry. “But now Mr. Narayanasamy is urging for distribution of rice in lieu of cash. How can a Congress Chief Minister question a scheme formulated by the UPA?” he asked.

Mr. Anbalagan pointed out that the government should have operated the scheme practically, but because of the tussle the Chief Minister was having with the Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi, the scheme suffered several interruptions.

The government had distributed rice only for 23 months out of the last 45 months. Though funds to the tune of ₹356 crore had been allocated in the budget, it had been diverted for other schemes.

The AIADMK would launch a major agitation if the cash equivalent of rice was not credited to the bank accounts of beneficiaries in a month’s time. The Left parties are also playing second fiddle to the Chief Minister although they could concentrate on various issues concerning the people, he added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/4hw87b/article30942462.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28FEBTH-ANBALAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/aiadmk-says-puducherry-chief-minister-adopted-double-standards-in-free-rice-scheme/article30942464.ece

Inaugurating a two-day international conference, ‘Indo SEA 2020’, organised by the Forum for Awareness of National Security (FANS) here on Thursday, she said that India has had very strong and glorious coastal lines of communication.

She deplored that the nature and core of the glorious history was “misunderstood and deviated from”.

The statue of emperor Rajendra Chola was installed on the premises of the port in Maharashtra as a tribute and honour to him for his coastal lines of communication. Ms. Soundararajan stressed the need for preserving, nourishing and reviving the glorious past to promote brotherhood among the South East Asian nations by sea lines.

She also advocated promotion of medical tourism and medical connections among the South East Asian nations.

421,2020/02/28,Philosophy on stage: Adishakti to host fest from tomorrow,"The event will be staged by baseCollective, a Vienna-based trans-disciplinary centre for artistic research and arts-based philosophy

Blindfolded oracles, Kantian musings about the future of humanity and snatches of instrumental music. As precursors go, there couldn’t be a better initiation of what lies in store than the opening act of a two-day research festival beginning at Adishakti on Saturday.

Hosted by baseCollective, a Vienna-based trans-disciplinary centre for artistic research and arts-based philosophy, which is supported by the Austrian Cultural Forum, a host of universities and the Ministry, the festival will explore a ‘Philosophy on Stage’ format at the edge of philosophy and arts.

‘Philosophy on Stage: The Future Box’, which will set the tone for the event, is a combo of lecture, performance and theatre featuring Nina Bauer, Arno Boehler, Ruchita Buhjbal, Susanne Valerie Granzer.

In a leap of imagination, the artistes will try to paint a future envisaged by Immanuel Kant, especially his cosmopolitan vision for humanity, said Arno Bohler, who founded baseCollective, along with spouse and actor Susanne Valerie Granzer.

“There will be theatrical moments for sure, but the sessions are focused more on the contemplative, and provoking thought and less on entertainment,” he said.

Arno Böhler teaches at the University of Vienna, Department of Philosophy, and at the University of Applied Arts Vienna, in the programme for Cross-Disciplinary-Strategies, while Susanne Valerie Granzer is an actress and professor for acting at the University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna.

The format of Philosophy On Stage developed by the duo has become an internationally recognised model for artistic research and arts-based philosophy.

The events are woven around the theme, “Truth and Lies in Times of Fake News”, the framing of artistic response to the phenomena, and will also mark the theatrical debut of key concepts that crystallised over baseCollective’s three-month residency at Adishakti from December.

The artists, from diverse backgrounds — art, philosophy, music and theatre, also include prominent figures who led some of the residency sessions. As a collective, they investigate the disturbing fact that the distinction between facts, fictions and fakes has blurred in our post-truth times. What does this mean for today’s aesthetic practices? And for a philosophy to come? And for contemporary politics?

In pushing the boundaries of conventional stage performance, the philosophy on stage format is premised on the concept of matter as not only being a necessary condition to actually fulfill an act, but playing a significant role as semantic determinant.

The baseCollective’s residency at Adishakti last year had produced ‘Love Matters’, an ensemble of sonic portraitures, music, short stories and poetry.

This year, the residency programme included readings and discussions on philosophers such as Michel Foucault and classical texts of Abinavagupta, framing an artistic response to the complex concept and finally their adaptation to stage.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/q1a2xo/article30936336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28PONDYADISHAKTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/philosophy-on-stage-adishakti-to-host-fest-from-tomorrow/article30936337.ece
422,2020/02/28,Auroville to celebrate anniversary with meditation and music sessions,"Conversation on urban planning to also feature as part of the event

Auroville celebrates its birth anniversary on Friday with traditional meditation by the bonfire ceremony at the Amphitheatre near the Matrimandir, a conversation on urban planning and a music session.

‘A Body for the Soul’/City The Earth Needs’ is the theme of an exhibition and dialogue at the Unity Pavilion at 4 p.m.

The city conversations will feature Karan Singh, Auroville chairman, B.V. Doshi, former Governing Board member and Pritzker Architecture Prize winner 2018, and others.

The discussion comes against the backdrop of grim forecasts for the planet’s survival if the urban agglomeration continues unmitigated.

Exponential increase in the urban population has doubled cars, congestion, pollution, aggression, anxiety, poverty and alienation through ever-sprawling cities and junk clutter. And, by 2050, about 75 per cent of the planet’s estimated 9 billion is projected to be settled in urban spaces.

Roger Anger, the French architect who designed the galaxy model for the universal township conceptualised by Auroville founder Mirra Alfassa, spiritual associate of Sri Aurobindo — The Mother to her followers — had proposed that Aurovilians reclaim and recreate the freedom of ancient urban settlements “before the disease of ill-understood urbanism imposes its laws”.

Celebrations

Later, Aurelio and Nadaka will offer music. The ceremonies at the Matrimandir Amphitheatre begin with the dawn fire at 5 a.m. According to Auroville, the bonfire meditation “is an opportunity for individuals to experience inner silence in a unique collective setting” and has issued an advisory for visitors on do’s and don’ts.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/95vxj3/article30936270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27FEBTHAUROVILLEBONFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/auroville-to-celebrate-anniversary-with-meditation-and-music-sessions/article30936271.ece

The Centre is keen to operate ferry services between Karaikal port in the Union Territory and Jaffna port in Sri Lanka as part of its efforts to promote tourism, said Union Minister of State for Shipping Mansukh Mandaviya.

He told reporters after chairing a review meeting here on Thursday that a committee headed by the Chief Secretary of the Union Territory and comprising the Secretaries to Port and Tourism would be constituted to prepare a blueprint for the project. “The Centre would take a decision once the proposal is submitted,” he said.

Mr. Mandaviya said the Centre would extend full support for the project, which would be implemented on a public private partnership (PPP) mode. Karaikal port would be the facilitator and both the Centre and Puducherry governments would extend their support.

The ferry services would primarily facilitate tourism. “It will help Sri Lankan Tamils and Buddhists in the island nation to visit Tamil Nadu and the Buddhist circuit in the country.”

Boost for tourism

Tourism Minister Malladi Krishna Rao said that initiative to operate ferry services between Karaikal port and Jaffna had been on for the last four years and the Puducherry government had been repeatedly persuading the Centre for its sanction. “Now a positive response has come from the Centre and the project wll go on stream without any financial burden on the territorial government,” he said.

Mr. Rao said the fare would be in the range of $90 to $100 and the project would facilitate tourism and development of Karaikal region. Social Welfare Minister M.

424,2020/02/28,Stray cattle a menace on several roads,"‘Sight of herds in areas like Lawspet reflect poorly on civic authorities’

The problem of stray cattle is nothing new to road users in Puducherry, but in the last few months it has reached alarming proportions.

Herds of stray cows and buffaloes roam freely on the thoroughfares and interior roads causing hindrance to traffic. Many people riding two-wheelers have been injured after the vehicles skidded because of cow dung on the road. At night, vehicle users cannot spot the vehicles, especially on streets with poor illumination. “Our roads are congested. Stray cattle add to the traffic woes. Sometime ago, the civic bodies used to continuously impound roaming animals and put them in a shelter. The menace is more serious than one imagines. Free-roaming cattle is a threat to two-wheeler riders as animals run on the middle of the road and all of a sudden move sideways causing road accidents. I was witness to such an accident on Kamaraj Salai,” said Resha Benny, a resident of Third Cross, Venketa Nagar.

The pictures of herds of cattle along the main thoroughfares, especially in Lawspet, speak volumes about the problem, said T.V. Sreekumar, 2nd Main Road Extension, Avvai Nagar. “Some are let out by owners at night and these animals return home at daybreak. They not only cause traffic snarls but also spoil the roads. Have seen people stepping on dung unknowingly and slipping,” he added.

R. Ravindran, a shop owner on 45-feet road, said the animals eat vegetables kept outside.

Allowing cattle to roam on the roads is dangerous for the animal as well, said S. Ramkumar, Dean of Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Veterinary Education and Research

Injurious to animals

“Many end up with fatal injuries. Since these animals eat garbage containing plastic bags, indigestible materials and sharp objects they develop complicated health conditions. In the last six months, the hospital attended to around 100 cases of bloat, fractures, horn avulsion, acidosis and impaction of rumen. Free roaming on streets is a threat to humans as well as to the animals” he added.

The municipalities have constraints in impounding all stray animals. Absence of proper shelter homes and lack of adequate staff to maintain the animals are the two main issues in dealing with stray cattle problem, said a senior official in the Local Administration Department.

Commissioner of Oulgaret Municipality M. Kandasamy said the municipality had impounded 21 stray cattle last year. The municipality does not have tractor-trolleys to impound and transport the animal to a vacant place. “We have to depend on the Pondicherry municipality vehicles,” he said.

The municipality was planning to make amendments to the Pondicherry Municipalities (Cattle Pound ) Rules, 1979 to increase the fine amount on those who set free their cattle on the streets.

As per the existing provisions, the civic body could only charge ₹1 as fine, he said and added that the Pondicherry Municipality had amended the sections.

“We will be doing it very soon,” said Mr. Kandasamy.

Commissioner of Pondicherry Municipality S. Sivakumar said the civic body had impounded 88 heads of stray cattle last year. It has collected ₹2.15 lakh as fine from cattle owners, he said and added that maintaining the shelter home was a challenge.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/8tmb85/article30936237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THUTSTRAYCATTLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/stray-cattle-a-menace-on-several-roads/article30936238.ece
425,2020/02/28,Equestrian challenge begins at Auroville today,"Competition will be a combination of dressage and show jumping events

About 60 horses and their riders will take the field to showcase their equestrian skills at the Auroville Horse Tournament (AHT) 2020, hosted by the Red Earth Riding School (RERS) in Auroville, starting on Friday.

The three-day event will feature international and national riders from clubs across South India in dressage and show jumping, Jacqueline Kapur, founder of RERS, told a press conference on Thursday.

The RERS is part of the South India Equestrian Association, an affiliate of the Equestrian Federation of India.

The teams hail from Bengaluru, Chennai, Udhagamandalam, Coimbatore, Ambur and Puducherry.

Riders will demonstrate their precision and finesse by executing complex dressage moves involving figures, transitions and lateral movements and jumping hurdles with varying heights ranging from the introductory 60 cm course to the 130 cm course.

The bar will literally be raised for show jumpers on Day Two.

The weekend will culminate with a 105 cm and 120-130 cm course in the morning and a fast-paced 85 cm relay for the young and adult riders and a four-bar jumping event where the heights will be phasedly increased by round until the winner is the last man standing.

If classical dressage is to develop through standardised progressive training methods, a horse’s natural ability to perform, show jumping packs drama as it involves clearing an obstacle course of fences and walls. The stamina, speed and flexibility of the horse come under test along with the relationship between rider and the beast. Competition rankings are determined by a combination of fewer faults and overall speed in round completion. Three-day eventing is another category of the equestrian sport.

“Interestingly enough, the three disciplines of dressage, show jumping and three-day eventing are the only Olympic sports in which men and women compete with each other on equal terms,” Ms. Jacqueline said.

The jumping events will be overseen by Lt. General R. K. Swamy, while dressage rounds will be scored by international judge Col. Sunil Shivdas.

Arrangements are in place at RERS campus to house the horses with extra stables built.

Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi is among the dignitaries expected to attend the event.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/e9rh2m/article30936167.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27FEBTHHORSEPY27AUROVILLEHORSETOURNAMENT1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/equestrian-challenge-begins-at-auroville-today/article30936168.ece
426,2020/02/28,Journey of discovery,"Today marks a big day in history. November 28 is ‘National Science Day’. What is the story behind it?

Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman, popularly known as C.V. Raman, was born in Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu in 1888. He was no ordinary boy. He finished his matriculation at the age of 11 and at the age of 15, he earned his BA degree as well, all the while being a class topper and receiving medals for English and Physics. He always had a curious mind about the world around him and how it worked.

In 1921, as a professor at the University of Calcutta he was sent as a delegate to the International Universities Congress in London. His journey back home however, is what changed his future.

Setting sail

On his 15-day return trip back home, while aboard the SS Narkunda, his restless and probing mind became fascinated with the deep blue colour of the Mediterranean sea. He asked himself, “A glass of water does not have any colour of its own. But the same water in the deep sea appears a brilliant blue. Why is this so?” He found from his readings that the previous theory was that the sea looked blue because it reflected the colour of the sky. He was unconvinced by this theory so he began carrying out basic experiments on board the ship using the simple instruments he had with him. Through this he found that the sea looked blue for pretty much the same reason the sky looks blue — the water was causing blue light to scatter more than other colours in the light. Excited by this realisation, Raman wrote to Nature, a science journal, as soon as he arrived in India.

In the years that followed, Raman became engrossed with the ‘scattering question’. He began conducting many experiments to observe how light behaved while it passed through different types of substances.

428,2020/02/28,‘Green army’ ready for Pongala,"Volunteers will convey to people the need for waste reduction

The city Corporation’s ‘green army’ will lead the green protocol campaign activities for Attukal Pongala.

The protocol, observed during the festival for the past four years, had led to a significant drop in the amount of waste generated from 350 tonnes to 67 tonnes. Awareness generation by the city Corporation, Haritha Keralam Mission, and the Suchitwa Mission had led to the achievement, a statement from the city Corporation said.

The green army volunteers would stress the importance of the protocol when they meet people living near the temple, those running commercial establishments, and people conducting ‘annadanam’ and distributing water, the statement said.

Power of steel

Those offering pongala should carry steel glass, plates, and other utensils. Those distributing food and water should serve these in utensils brought by the devotees. They should also keep extra steel utensils handy.

Arrangements have been made to take on rent 10,000 steel glasses and 2,500 steel utensils through the Corporation’s sanitation committee. Those willing to donate steel utensils for observance of green protocol should entrust these with the Mayor’s office.

Registration

Those bringing water and food from outside for distribution in the festival area should register with the Corporation. Without registration, distribution of food and water will not be allowed. Registration can be done on the Smart Trivandrum app.

Awards instituted

Awards have been instituted for individuals and establishments that distribute food and water as per the green protocol.

Arrangements have also been made to reuse bricks used for the Pongala hearths for housing. Those interested in receiving the bricks should submit application in the Mayor’s office with recommendation from the ward councillor concerned. Bricks from the festival the past two years were made available to 23 beneficiaries of the Corporation’s or government’s housing schemes.

Corporation health wing employees have been directed to ensure the green protocol is being followed, especially in the wake of the ban on single-use plastics. Use of disposable products should be completely avoided.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/t3lj8g/article30939566.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TVTVGODESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/green-army-ready-for-pongala/article30939567.ece

430,2020/02/28,Literacy Mission sets up library in city,"Facility in Pettah has 9,525 books

The Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority has set up an informal education study centre and library at its headquarters at Pettah.

This is the first study centre and library to be set up under the State government in the informal education sector.

Minister for General Education C. Ravindranath inaugurated the study centre and library on Wednesday.

The library has 9,525 books. These were collected by literacy ‘preraks,’ learners, and literacy activists under the umbrella of the district literacy missions from publishers and writers for free. Works on informal education, articles, novels, children’s books, those on science and mathematics have been arranged in the library.

Literacy Mission director P.S. Sreekala said more books would be added to the collection in the days to come. The library was a good resource for those who wanted to know more about the informal education sector.

Prize for Kozhikode

The prize for the district that collected the most books was given away by the Minister to Kozhikode project coordinator Abdul Rashid.

He also presented prizes to 14 ‘preraks’ who collected the maximum number of books for the library.

431,2020/02/28,All classrooms have a library in Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat,"Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat sets up facility in 10,681 classrooms in 958 govt. and aided schools

Libraries in some schools are often a namesake room designated for the purpose, with students hardly ever having any incentive to visit these.

But, the Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat has ensured that a library relevant to the students would be set up in each classroom in all public schools under it. Over the past six months, it has set up classroom libraries in all of the 10,681 classrooms across the 958 government and aided schools in the district, becoming the first district panchayat in the State to achieve this.

The project began around six months ago as part of the General Education Protection Mission of the State government. The Kerala State Library Council, school Parent-Teacher Association, alumni associations and above all, the students, became part of a grassroots-level movement to collect books to set up such a large number of libraries.

Many campaigns

One campaign was titled ‘Pusthaka vandi’, wherein students and teachers from schools would go around the locality in a vehicle, visit houses and request books. Other campaigns included ‘a book on the birthday’, with students contributing books on their birthdays. The district panchayat too organised a book collection campaign. One school managed to collect as many as 20,000 books.

“We started with the aim of collecting 5 lakh books. We ended up collecting more than 8 lakh books. This is a major achievement, thanks to the participation of the public,” says V.K. Madhu, president of the Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat.

The panchayat has provided ₹1,000 for each classroom for setting up bookshelves. This was the first time that a district panchayat was providing such funds to aided schools too. Teachers and students have been trained in running the libraries. From each class, two librarians, one boy and a girl, have been selected. They would issue the books, using the stock register and the distribution register.

At least a 100 books

“Each class will have a minimum of hundred books, including reference books related to their syllabus as well as fiction and other books. Each student is supposed to read one book each week. They have to write short notes on each book they read in a notebook. One period per week is set aside to share these readings. Soon, we will be launching reading festivals at the class, school, panchayat and district levels,” says S. Javad, district coordinator of the General Education Protection Mission.

The aim of the project is not just to inculcate reading habit in students, but also to contribute to their all-round development as individuals with independent opinions. The State government has decided to take this project to the next level, by allocating funds to set up classroom libraries across all public schools in Kerala.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/shk1z0/article30936406.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28tvtvbook,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/all-classrooms-have-a-library-in-this-panchayat/article30936407.ece

434,2020/02/28,‘Let river-linking project cover more areas’,"Bring Manapparai, Marungapuri and Vaiyampatti panchayat unions under the project: farmers

Representatives of various farmers’ organisations and political parties staged a demonstration in front of the Collector’s Office here on Friday urging the government to ensure that the Cauvery-Vaigai-Gundar river linking project canal passed through the Manapparai, Marungapuri and Vaiyampatti panchayat unions in Tiruchi district.

They also demanded that the canal irrigated areas fed by the Cauvery in Tiruchi, Karur and Ariyalur districts be brought under the protected agricultural zone in the State.

While welcoming the allocation of ₹700 crore by the government to implement the river-linking project, the farmers said the Manapparai, Marungapuri and Vaiyampatti areas in Tiruchi district were drought prone and the project should be designed in such a manner that it benefited those areas. As per the original design, the canal which is to be dug for linking the rivers was to pass through the three unions but now its course has been changed, they alleged.

The farmers presented a memorandum to the Collector S.Sivarasu at the grievance meeting. The joint representation said that three panchayat unions were drought prone and the groundwater table has gone down. Residents were facing severe drinking water shortage during summer. However, the region had fertile lands and livelihood of people can be stabilised if the river-linking project canal ran through the areas, the farmers said.

Speaking at the grievance meeting, a cross section of farmers urged the government to ensure release of adequate quantum of water from the Mettur Dam during its closure period to meet the requirements of standing cash crops irrigated through the 17 irrigation canals.

Ayilai Sivasuriyan, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, affiliated to the CPI, said the crops irrigated by the canals, including sugarcane, banana and betelvine were withering for want of water and demanded release of adequate water in the canals during the non-Mettur season.

Responding to a query from Koundampatti R.Subramanian, deputy secretary, Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, Collector said modernization of the Kattalai High Level Canal is likely to begin by March 15. He assured farmers that the TKM9 variety paddy would be procured at the the direct purchase centres.

Responding to complaints of demands for bribe at the DPCs, Mr.Sivarasu promised stern action against erring staff.

R.Chidambaram, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, affiliated to the CPI(M), alleged irregularities in implementing drip irrigation scheme and charged that farmers were being asked to give bribe.

435,2020/02/28,Focus on reducing retinopathy of prematurity,"The Department of Ophthalmology, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, attached to K.A.P. Viswanatham Government Medical College organised a continuing medical education (CME) programme on Friday to create awareness of retinopathy of prematurity.

The programme was meant to discuss possibilities of reducing the incidence of retinopathy without causing any harm to the health of pre term babies.

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding disease caused by abnormal development of retinal blood vessels in premature infants. ‘Studies say that the cause for ROP is an increased supply of oxygen to premature babies. While focussing on saving the newborn, we do not focus on their eyes, ears, brain,’ said S.Srinivasan , State Child Health Nodal Officer. ‘We must work on preventing pre-term births and provide quality neonatal care,’ he said.

Despite risks, Special Newborn Care Units (SNCU) set up across the state have better survival rates in comparison to any other such units across the country. There are 73 SNCUs across Tamil Nadu. In 2019, 1.18 lakh babies were admitted. Of them, 47,000 were underweight. Of them, 31,563 received oxygen, which means the majority did not need it,’ he said.

He said the state average of survival rate of pre-term babies who are ventilated is 30%. However, in Tiruchi and Coimbatore, at least 70% of babies survive. It goes to show the skill and effort of the doctors here, he said.

Collector S. Sivarasu, who inaugurated the programme, said the facilities at the MGMGH will soon improve as a proposal to make it a multi-speciality hospital has been submitted to the health minister and health secretary. ‘Our aim is to provide quality healthcare to all. The Department of Ophthalmology had asked for a larger ward, which will soon be fulfilled,’ he said.

K. Vanitha, Dean, MGMGH said to avoid ROP, district-level coordination among taluk level hospitals, Primary Healthcare Centres is required. The MGMGH organises free eye screenings every Wednesday. The public must make use of it. The Department of Neonatology and Department of Ophthalmology is working in perfect coordination, she said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/focus-on-reducing-retinopathy-of-prematurity/article30944820.ece

Addressing a public meeting organised by his party in Tiruchi, he said that there was hardly any opposition to the CAA immediately after the amendment was passed in both the Houses of the Parliament.

But Muslims started hitting the streets against the CAA after “a well-calculated misinformation campaign” by a few political parties. It was unfortunate that Muslim women, along with children and elders, were brought to the streets by spreading rumours that they would be kept in camps if the CAA was implemented.

“Ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power, he is taking a number of steps to strengthen the country on all aspects. His actions are aimed at making the country strong. He is not for putting citizens of the country in camps,” Mr. Krishnaswamy felt.

443,2020/02/28,Demand for arrack on the rise in Vizag Agency,"Increase in IMFL prices is driving people towards the illicitly distilled beverage, say police

There has been a steady rise in demand for illicit distilled (ID) arrack in many parts of Visakhapatnam district post the implementation of the new liquor policy in Andhra Pradesh.

Officials of the Excise and Prohibition Department said that they are witnessing a rise in demand, supply and consumption of arrack after a gap of many years.

Sources said that prior to the implementation of the new excise policy, there were not many takers for arrack as cheap liquor was available at the IMFL (Indian-made Foreign Liquor) shops located all over the district. However, with almost 60% of the IMFL shops closing down in recent months, coupled with a sharp hike in liquor prices, a large number of people are shifting towards arrack.

Cashing in on the situation are a number of gangs who specialise in manufacturing and distributing arrack.

Sources said that these gangs are mushrooming in areas like Narsipatnam (Rural), Chintapalle, Koyyuru, Pedabayalu, Araku, Payakaraopeta, Paderu, Araku, V. Madugula and Dumbriguda.

“Earlier, wine shop owners would tip us off regarding the illegal manufacturing units in order to safeguard their business. Now, since the shops are owned by the government, we have lost those sources. But we are trying our best to penetrate the network,” said a senior police officer from the district.

Arrack is much cheaper than liquor, which is luring more people to go for it, the police officer said, adding that people living in AOB (Andhra Odisha Border) area are procuring arrack from Odisha, where it is easily available.

Staff crunch

The Excise and Prohibition Department in Anakapalle sub- division covers all the nine mandals in the Agency areas, apart from several others in the rural parts. The sub-division has nine stations under its control.

According to sources, the division is reeling under a severe staff shortage with almost 50% vacant posts.

Keeping in view the increasing number of gangs selling arrack, teams of Excise officials have been conducting surprise raids at many places in the district for the past one week.

Anakapalle Excise and Prohibition Inspector K. Kameswara Rao said that the department has been conducting raids since February 18.The department has so far booked about 26 cases in which 17 persons were arrested. About 163 litres of arrack and 6,450 litres of fermented jaggery was seized from them, he said.

Mr. Kameswara Rao said with 10 litres of fermented jaggery, one litre of arrack can be produced. Among the cases booked, five each were registered at Araku and Payakaraopeta, while four were registered in Chodavaram. The other cases were from Chintapalle, Paderu, V. Madugula, Narsipatnam, Yelamanchili and a few other places, he said.

The raids would continue, excise officials said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/o47qso/article30936644.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28VZ2DESTROYINGAIDARRACK1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/demand-for-arrack-on-the-rise-in-vizag-agency/article30936645.ece

A surprise inspection conducted by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials at N.T.R government hospital at Anakapalle brought to the fore the sad state of affairs and irregularities.

According to ACB officials, following the instructions from their higher officials, the raids have been conducted in all parts of State including the city.

During their inspection, the ACB teams found that the kitchen room of the hospital was functioning out of a room besides the mortuary room.

The maintenance of the kitchen was also very poor. The ACB officials also noticed the presence of rats inside the kitchen.

Poor quality food

The head nurse reportedly told the ACB teams that there were 81 inpatients, but the teams found only 72 when they assessed the ground reality.

They also found that staff had prepared food for only 27 patients and just 40 eggs were boiled during the raid.

Samples collected

“The the quality of the food was very poor and the prescribed menu was not being followed. Food samples have been collected from the kitchen of the hospital and those will be sent to Food Laboratory, Hyderabad for analysis,” a senior ACB official said.

The ACB officials also said that on verification of the biometric attendance, it was found that some medical officers and staff reported to their duties late.

Moreover, the stock and balance of medicines were not being maintained properly, the ACB officials pointed out.

One driver for two ambulances

“Only one driver was available for two ambulances. The hospital staff had shown trips of both the ambulances on same days by the single driver. There are large-scale irregularities in this regard ,” the ACB official added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/acb-raid-reveals-sad-state-of-affairs-at-anakapalle-hospital/article30936617.ece
445,2020/02/28,"2,238 kg ganja worth ₹2.6 crore recovered in 24 hours in Vizag","Two Bihar men among six persons arrested in separate incidents

In a major haul, the enforcement agencies have seized 2,238 kg ganja with an estimated market value of ₹2.60 crore in Visakhapatnam district in two separate incidents in the past 24 hours.

The officials of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) nabbed four persons when they were transporting around 1,638 kg ganja in a four-wheeler at NAD Junction on Wednesday.

The estimated market value of the seized contraband would be around ₹2.5 crore, a release issued by the DRI officials said on Thursday.

Acting on intelligence put that prohibited narcotic drugs were being illegally transported, the DRI officials intercepted a goods carriage and a car which was being used as a pilot near the NAD Junction. During the search, the DRI officials found ganja stuffed in 40 bags which were hidden under a load of banana stalks.

“Around 800 ganja packets weighing 1,638 kg were found in the vehicle. The contraband was reportedly procured from the interior areas of Vishakapatnam Agency and the consignment was being transported to Bhubaneshwar in Odisha,” the release said.

The vehicle and the contraband were seized and cases have been registered under the provisions of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985. Further investigation is on.

‘Contraband bound for Patna’

Meanwhile, the officials of Excise and Prohibition Department, Narsipatnam, arrested two persons and seized 600 kg dry ganja from a van at Dabbada village in Visakhapatnam district on Thursday.

Both the accused are natives of Bihar and the estimated market value of the seized contraband would be around ₹70 lakh, said Excise & Prohibition Superintendent S.K.D.V. Prasad.

Acting on a tip-off, a mobile team of excise officials from Narsipatnam intercepted a van at Dabbada village. The accused reportedly had procured the ganja from the interior areas of G. Madugula mandal and were transporting it to Patna, he said.

“In an attempt to evade checking by the enforcement agencies, the accused had packed the contraband in 60 bags of 10 kg each and hidden it under a load of vegetables,” said Mr. Prasad. Cases have been registered and investigation is on.

Special drive on

The excise and prohibition officials have been conducting a special drive against the ganja smuggling in the rural areas and tribal pockets in the district from February 18.

According to the officials, around 920 kg ganja have been seized in five cases between February 18 to 24.

447,2020/02/28,"Clive Cussler, million-selling adventure writer, dies at 88","The best-selling author of the Dirk Pitt-series died at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Clive Cussler, the million-selling adventure writer and real-life thrill-seeker who wove personal details and spectacular fantasies into his page-turning novels about underwater explorer Dirk Pitt, has died, his publisher said on Wednesday.

Cussler died on Monday at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona, said Alexis Welby, spokesperson for publisher Penguin Random House. He was 88. The cause was not disclosed.

Cussler dispatched Pitt and pal Al Giordino on exotic missions highlighted by shipwrecks, treachery, espionage and beautiful women, in popular works including Cyclops, Night Probe! and his commercial breakthrough, Raise the Titanic!

Cussler was an Illinois native who was raised in Southern California and lived in Arizona for most of his final years, but he sent Pitt around the globe in plots that ranged from the bold to the incredible. The Treasure features an aspiring Aztec despot who murders an American envoy, the hijacking of a plane carrying the United Nations secretary-general and soldiers from ancient Rome looting the Library of Alexandria. In Iceberg, the presidents of French Guiana and the Dominican Republic are the ones in danger, during a visit to Disneyland. In Sahara, a race across the desert somehow leads to new information about the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.

“Again and again, Dirk Pitt, working for the fictional National Underwater and Marine Agency, must find a sunken vessel and retrieve some artifact,” Mark Schone, summarizing Cussler’s novels, wrote in The New York Times in 2004. “Evil forces, be they Commies or Blofeldian madmen, try to stop him. Along the way Pitt saves himself, the world and the damsel of the moment.”

Cussler has a new novel, Journey of the Pharaohs, set to be released March 10, with several more awaiting posthumous publication.

In real life, Cussler founded his own National Underwater and Marine Agency and participated in dozens of searches for old ships, including one that turned up a steamship belonging to Cornelius Vanderbilt. He also had a long history of questionable claims — some admitted, some denied.

“He can definitely spin the tall tales and is a master of fiction. But that doesn’t mean I buy into his alleged discovery claims,” Dr. E. Lee Spence wrote on his blog in 2011. Spence, a prominent underwater archaeologist feuded with Cussler over which of them recovered a Confederate submarine.

Born an only child in 1931 in Aurora, Illinois, and raised in Alhambra, California, Cussler’s name and writing persona have the air of a pseudonym, but he was born with his moniker, named for the British actor Clive Brook. He studied for two years at Pasadena City College before enlisting in the Air Force and serving as a mechanic and flight engineer during the Korean War.

In 1955, he married Barbara Knight, with whom he had three children. Through much of the 1960s, he worked in advertising, as a copywriter and creative director. Among the better known slogans he helped coin — “It’s stronger than dirt,” for an Ajax laundry detergent campaign.

In his free time, he was writing fiction and moonlighting at a skin-diving equipment shop, where his wife suggested he work to help gather material for his novels.

""When creating advertising, I had always looked at the competition and wondered what I could conceive that was totally different,” Cussler said in an interview included in Dirk Pitt Revealed, a nonfiction book released in 1998. “(James) Bond was becoming incredibly popular through the movies, and I knew I couldn’t match Ian Fleming’s style and prose. So I was determined not to write about a detective, secret agent or undercover investigator or deal in murder mysteries. My hero’s adventures would be based on and under water.”

Cussler finished manuscripts for Mediterranean Caper and Iceberg, but had no literary agent — so he created one. He purchased a thousand sheets of blank letter paper, got a friend in advertising to design a logo for The Charles Winthrop Agency and sent his first inquiry to Peter Lampack of the William Morris Agency. Lampack agreed to take on Cussler and remained with him long after the author confessed his charade.

“I told him the story of Charlie Winthrop with great trepidation,” Cussler explained to the Arizona Republic. “I sat there waiting for the result, and he sat there blank for a minute, and then he laughed himself under the table. And he said, ‘Oh my God. I always thought Charlie Winthrop was some guy I met while I was drunk at a cocktail party.’”

Mediterranean Caper came out in 1973, followed by Iceberg two years later and Raise the Titanic! in 1976. He would turn out more than 20 Dirk Pitt novels and expand into children’s books and such adventure series as The Oregon Files and The Numa Files.

Cussler had claimed his worldwide sales topped 100 million copies, but in a legal battle with Crusader Entertainment, which alleged he had misrepresented his popularity, it was determined the number was closer to 40 million. In 2007, a Los Angeles jury awarded Crusader $5 million but also ordered that Cussler receive $8.5 million because the film company only adapted one (Sahara) of the two books it had agreed to produce.

The film version of Sahara came out in 2005 and starred Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz. An adaptation of Raise the Titanic! – its title the same except for dropping the exclamation point – came out in 1980 and featured Jason Robards and Alec Guinness.

In recent years, Cussler began working with co-authors and collaborated with his son on Poseidon’s Arrow, Crescent Dawn and Arctic Drift. Cussler’s son is Dirk Cussler. Pitt himself had a son, called, of course, Dirk Pitt Jr.

In addition to Dirk Cussler, the author is survived by his second wife, Janet, daughters Teri and Dayna, four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/p9q5er/article30940464.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OBITCLIVECUSSLERTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/clive-cussler-million-selling-adventure-writer-dies-at-88/article30940465.ece
448,2020/02/28,Manohar Devadoss says he owes his Padmashri Award to Madurai,"Artist Manohar Devadoss, who won a Padmashri this year, reminisces the good old times in Madurai, the city of his birth and inspirations

MADURAI: There was a pregnant silence in the LAICO auditorium after the screening of a brief audio-visual tribute to Manohar Devadoss, the artist-writer-scientist who has been awarded the Padmashri this year. The tragedies in his life did not evoke sadness. But a silent strength. And once again, Mano, as he is lovingly called, fortified his bond with the city that nurtured his childhood years. After a pause, there was a standing ovation for the octogenarian.

“I never sought any reward in my life but without my knowledge, some friends recommended my name to the Centre this year. The recognition makes me happy but I am overwhelmed by the continuing love and support of so many friends and well wishers,” he said at the felicitation function organised by the Aravind Eye Care Systems and the Madurai Readers’ Club this week.

He was in the city to attend a series of similar functions to honour him; there were two more by his alma mater — Setupati Higher Secondary School and The American College. And of course, several private meetings with a steady stream of friends and visitors who came to congratulate him. His phone rings continuously now. “I have not attended so many calls in the last five decades as I have in the last five weeks,” he says. With his usual humility, he admits that ever since the announcement came in, his days have not been “typically normal”.

And a self-analysis follows : the last ink sketch he drew was in 2003 — that of Yana Malai near Madurai. The last greeting card he handcrafted was in 2007. The last exhibition of his artworks was held in 2010. And five years ago, he lost his eye sight completely. “Yet, people remember me and my work with so much affection,” is something he is trying to grapple with.

In this moment of his recognition, he, however, misses his wife Mahema the most, whom he lost 12 years ago and his elder brother who died on January 19, just a week before he got the Padmashri. “Both of them would have been very happy today,” he says, as we meet him just before the functions. Wherever he goes, a majority of people are already aware of the challenges he has faced in life. Retinitis pigmentosa weakened his eyesight gradually, till it rendered him visually-challenged. A horrifying accident in the outskirts of Madurai in 1972 resulted in Mahema becoming quadriplegic three days before their ninth wedding anniversary. Yet, nothing could snatch their courage to focus on the good and positive things in life.

When your dreams crumble, it requires extraordinary levels of acceptance and grace to push past your pains. Together, Mahema — who was paralysed neck below at the age of 30 — and Manohar, who was diagnosed with the crippling eye disorder with no cure at the age of 40, only believed in their dreams.

An officer from Delhi took an appointment for 30-minutes to verify his work for the Padma award, he says, but stayed on for more than four hours, baffled by his life story and the flawless ink sketches he made over the years. “I told him I could have looked at my life as one filled with punishments,” says Mano, “but I turned them into rewarding opportunities.”

And how? He wanted to become a scientist and completed his PhD in Chemistry. But his father’s demise forced him to take up a chemist’s job with the British company Oldham in 1958. He quit as its technical director four decades later and believes the job gave him ample time and opportunity to be creative. “Had I become a scientist, I would not have met Mahema either,” he quips. It was because of her encouragement that he started writing his first book Green Well Years in 1982. “I also started drawing with a vengeance because I realised time and my eyes were not on my side. Only my photographic memory stayed with me as a sort of talisman.”

It took Mano 15 years of writing and 14 years of art work to weave the affectionate tribute chronicling the adventures of his boyhood days. Against the beguiling charm of old Madurai, he painstakingly sketched landmarks and heritage buildings and monuments, important festivals and events with keen attention to detail. His sharp pen strokes of the chariot procession during the Chithrai festival, the image of the ther and the crowd, the paddy fields and the bridge over the Vaigai, the chapel in his college, are some images difficult to forget.

Only thing Mano regrets is losing many of his original drawings. Had they been there, his books An Artist’s Perspective and Multiple Facets of My Madurai would have contained more illustrations, he says. Published in 2003, the latter has gone for seven reprints.

Mano recalls a life filled with laughter and belief with Mahema. Together, they hand-made 33,000 greeting cards. Combining his art work with her writing skills, they used their talent and skills for charity. Mahema passed away more than a decade ago but continues to be his muse. He has poignantly written about her in his books, A Poem to Courage and Dreams, Seasons and Promises.

Mano lives alone in Chennai now but refuses to rest. At present, he is working on a book with his illustrations that capture the historic, social and cultural heritage of Chennai. Called Madras Inked, it could become and remain, like his books on Madurai, a vital documentary of times gone by. He is also working on another one on his life, which however, will not contain drawings, he says. For the past four years, he has been learning Carnatic music and dreams of holding one more exhibition of his watercolour paintings themed on butterflies.

It is no wonder that the government officer was at a loss to decide the category of Padma Award for Mano. Finally, he chose art, and rightfully so.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/wlifht/article30943652.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MANOHARDEVADOSS-a,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/artist-manohar-devadoss-who-won-a-padmashri-this-year-reminisces-the-good-old-times-spent-in-madurai-the-city-of-his-birth-and-inspirations/article30943660.ece
449,2020/02/28,Age is not a factor for this group of women from Thrissur who are having a ball with volleyball,"The team triumphed at the National Masters Games held in Vadodara recently

“Who would’ve thought that I would wear shorts for the first time at the age of 47 and win a gold medal?” Sajitha Rahman says with a hearty laugh. She is a member of the volleyball team that came up trumps at the third National Masters Games held earlier this month at Vadodara in Gujarat.

The win is special for 47-year-old Sajitha and other players in her team from Pallimoola in Thrissur, all aged 40 and above. They are Royal Angels, comprising homemakers, self-employed entrepreneurs, professionals and government employees. For the last seven years, every evening they have been getting-together at a nearby ground to practise and play a game, mostly against a team comprising their children! And the win at Vadodara was the time for the children to turn cheerleaders for their elders.

They were introduced to the sport through Women Integration & Growth through Sports (WINGS), launched by NA Vinaya, a police officer at the Thrissur Police Academy. “Several women’s teams were formed in Thrissur through this initiative. However, some of the teams got disbanded. But we were in no mood to wind it up. Except on Sundays, we are out on the ground by 4.30-5 in the evening and play till it gets dark,” says 51-year-old Sheela Varghese, a nurse at a Public Health Centre.

Except for occasional guidance from a male coach, the team has been on its own since its formation. “Initially there were 20 of us. But some of them dropped out due to personal reasons. Now seven to 10 of us regularly practise at the ground,” Sajitha adds. None of them had played volleyball till WINGS introduced them to the game.

“We were looking forward for some sort of exercise to keep ourselves physically and mentally active. That’s when volleyball was suggested. Even though we had no clue about the game, gradually it became a part of our lives,” says Sindhu Prakashan, 42, a tailor by profession. Sajitha remembers that initially they used to come home in pain after the training sessions.

Challenges off the field

“But we never gave up and it eventually became a passion. We felt young, playing in T-shirts and track suits! With a ground all to ourselves, we were in a different world altogether. The game brought in discipline into our lives. We took part in contests organised by the Corporation and each game boosted our confidence,” she says.

All of them highlight the support of their families. While many in the neighbourhood were doubtful whether they would stick to the game for long, their spouses and children never gave up on them. “There were people who thought that injuries might persuade us to stay away. Some others wondered what we were going to gain by playing at this age,” Sajitha elaborates.

And there were quite a few who ridiculed the players saying they had not lost weight in spite of sweating it out. “We tell them that we are not in it to shed calories. This is to keep ourselves mentally and physically active. It keeps us connected and happy because we have so much fun and laughter during the training. I am healthier than many women of my age!” Sheela chuckles. Now young girls and boys in the area also join them during the practice sessions.

Talking about their win at Vadodara, the team says that they weren’t prepared for the big game. “We have played only in and around Thrissur and our first game outside the district was the state-level competition in Thiruvananthapuram. And when we were chosen to represent the state at the national level, initially, we were nervous. Later, we trained with some of the former players who played with us at the championship as well. The opportunity meant so much that we didn’t feel awkward about replacing our track suits with shorts,” says Sajitha.

All of them plan to play the game as long as they can. Lijisha Anand, currently working in Thiruvananthapuram, is looking forward to take lessons from professional trainers in the capital city since she is missing out on the training sessions with her teammates. “The time we have on the ground is precious for us. It is better than spending hours in front of the television,” Sajitha insists.

450,2020/02/28,"Ideate about everything sustainable at Future Collective, a design fair at New Delhi’s Bikaner House","Leading designers, artists and musicians come together at a two-day sustainable fair in the capital’s Bikaner House

Weekend event calendars in almost every city feature one mainstay event: the ‘sustainable’ pop-up. These are no doubt a great way to get consumers to make the shift to local brands and handmade products, but there is now a surfeit of similar brands at every fair. This is where Future Collective — opening on February 29 in the capital — aims to be different. Set in the backdrop of the heritage Bikaner House’s recently-opened Centre for Contemporary Art, the two-day event will push you to think about how and why you shop.

“We don’t need a handful of people doing it perfectly, but millions doing it their way and making that effort,” says jewellery designer Roma Narsinghani, who put together the Conscious Culture Design Fair along with business partner Asha Kochhar and Vidyun M Singh, Director Programmes, India Habitat Centre. “We’re showcasing and starting a dialogue with the artists, with a focus on sustainability and innovation that is also commercially viable,” she says.

Audiences can choose to attend a food workshop, participate in a creative think tank about hazards and origins of toxic indoor air, watch a lineup of panellists (Shilpa Sharma of Jaypore, authors Mala Barua and Vasudha Rai, architect Martand Khosla, etc), ideate about everything from sustainable textiles to building materials and future-conscious food. There are also art installations, exhibitions, musicians and a puppet show for children.

Check out The event features collaborations with Altered nozzles [that save 30% of water], Cupable for recyclable cups, waste management company Chintan, Ruby Organics for salon showings, etc. Participating designers will use QR Codes for lookbooks and visiting cards.

Narsinghani explains how the Sunday Markets at Bikaner House — featuring Himalayan cheese, Assamese tea, and Bengali and South Indian delicacies — are beautiful, and the sentiment when putting together Future Collective was the same. And then there’s the food. Look forward to global plates with seasonal dishes like shroom buns, charred broccoli and mojo roast cubanos, Asian bowls and avocado parcels. “There is also a Zero Waste Bar with recipes created by mixologist Yangdup Lama.”

Slow route with Mora

Narsinghani leads her list of top five must-attend events at the fair with Evelyn Mora’s talk. The founder of the climate-positive Helsinki Fashion Week (HFW) will address how brands can avoid greenwashing. “At the end of the day, brands produce and are responsible for their own individual shows, so for them to take these aspects into account would be fairly doable, especially in the big capitals like New York, London, Milan and Paris,” says Mora, who is wrapping up her first book, The Troublemaker, by the end of 2020. “It is an exposé of the fashion industry and sustainability.”

As for the environmental impact of fashion shows — now doing the rounds on social media, she says, “Currently, the fashion world is introducing many sustainable ways. But unfortunately, I currently see a lot of greenwashing even from the ‘sustainability advocates’.” At Future Collective, the Paris-based entrepreneur wants to meet people who “act more than they talk”, and is looking forward to the work of Mumbai-based vintage label Bodements, Naushad Ali from Puducherry and New Delhi’s agender apparel brand, Two Point Two.

The shape of green

For Narsinghani, Stefano Funari’s Sari Swap is a personal favourite. Funari, founder of Mumbai-based fashion label, I was a Sari, brings to the event his “first experiment to customise for the conscious consumer”. “Every time we are at events, people have asked if they could get their saris turned into one of the ‘I was a Sari’ pieces. They can now bring in their pre-loved saris and get them customised into accessories,” says the Italian designer known to craft everything from bags and beaded jewellery to scarves and resort wear collections with the six yard garment. According to him, Indian culture is very much rooted in sustainability as people use and reuse items in their daily lives. “But the modern Indian fashion industry, much like global fashion, is far away from sustainable practices”. His latest additions — pleated skirts, shirts, duster jackets and kimonos — are quite popular.

Shani Himanshu, co-founder of 11:11 — known for experiments with denim and khadi — will be presenting his SS20 ‘Indigo Flower’ collection. The garments are hand-painted with natural dyes, and use hand-spun indigenous cotton along with Indigo colour blocking in different shades. Along with co-founder Mia Morikawa, he is also developing a technology “where the wearer of the garment can use a smartphone to know a garment’s entire lifecycle from seed-to-stitch”. The duo is also in the process of building a cooperative of 500+ artisans through the seed-to-stitch approach.

451,2020/02/28,How Visakhapatnam is redefining dining with cafés and restaurants built from shipping containers,"Ditching the conventional brick and mortar kind of architecture, several restaurant-building projects in Visakhapatnam are using re-purposed shipping containers

Low cost, modern and funky. This was the three-word brief Ravi Teja gave hisarchitect and designer Santosh Reddy for the cafe he proposed to set up. The result was four shipping containers sliced and put together to look like a hashtag when viewed from top. Painted in vibrant yellow, red and orange, Hashtag Resto Cafe stands out in Lawson’s Bay.

“I have always believed in the power of the first impression. So, when I wanted to come up with a cafe, I was sure that I did not want to go with the conventional methods. That is when Santosh, a long-time friend and architect of the cafe suggested that we use shipping containers,” says Ravi Teja, owner of the restaurant.

Opened in August this year, the cafe has joined a list of a few others who have seen merit in using shipping containers to set up restaurants . “They are easy to play around with. They are portable, so in case we want to move all we have to do is to disassemble and relocate. Speed of installation, cost saving on material and the capacity to re-use these units make them a serious option for housing, cafes and office space,” says Santosh who started practising architecture in 2018.

For both Ravi Teja and Santosh it was the first time that they were experimenting with cargo containers. “I had been to a pub called Dock 45 in Hyderabad which is made of these containers. I really liked the concept and how they had been refurbished. ,” says Santosh. Hashtag Resto Cafe is built from two containers that are eight feet wide and 20 feet long and two more that are eight feet wide and 40 feet long. “We had to procure these containers from Chennai despite having a port in Visakhapatnam because the local authorities were selling these containers for almost double the price that was offered to us in Chennai,” says Ravi Teja. The insides of the container are decked with paintings.

While stacking the containers like Lego blocks would have been cheaper, the team shelled out more money to for the hashtag shape it wanted.”We had to build bridges and stairs to connect all the four containers.Skilled labour that knows its way around shipping containers is an expensive affair,” adds Santosh.

While the cool sea breeze will make evenings pleasant at the cafe, one wonders what will happen in the hot Visakhapatnam summers. Imagine eating in a steel box on hot afternoons. That has been taken into account, assures Ravi Teja. “ We have installed insulated panels on the roof of each container which helps in reducing the temperature by at least two or three degrees. Keeping in mind the fact that Visakhapatnam is hot for at least six months a year, we planned the interiors in a way that there is maximum ventilation,” he says.

Lego-like

Not just cafés but even hoteliers have joined the bandwagon of using refurbished containers. In the bustling Suryabagh, the Port Hotel serves as a landmark. Standing tall among other conventional brick and mortar buildings, is the hotel looks like a Jenga tower built as it is by stacking cargo containers. The interiors of the 31-room hotel are created around the theme of the port.

“It was to pay homage to the city and its rich port culture. The interiors have been decorated with artefacts that showcase ships and naval life,” says Nirmal Parma, the general manager . Recalling the days of building the hotel, Nirmal says that procuring the containers was not a problem, but getting a crane and placing them one on top of the other was a huge task. “Placing the containers while making the third-storey was a huge task . Since we are located in a busy market area we had to do most of the work at night ,” he adds. However, once built not much has to be done for the upkeep of the containers. “Every alternate year we touch it up with a coat of anti-corrosion paint on the containers to prevent rusting,” he says.

Stationed at the shore

Amongst the many eateries that line the coast at Sagar Nagar, The Anchor restaurant stands out. Brightly coloured in hues of red, green and blue, the restaurant is built using shipping containers.

452,2020/02/28,Lancet retracts letter about the plight of nurses treating COVID-19 patients,": On February 26, The Lancet Global Health retracted a letter by two nurses from Guangzhou province just two days after it was published in the journal. In the letter, the two nurses describe their plight treating COVID-19 patients in Wuhan.

In the letter entitled, “Chinese medical staff request international medical assistance in fighting against COVID-19”, the two nurses claim that “the conditions and environment here in Wuhan are more difficult and extreme than we could ever have imagined. There is a severe shortage of protective equipment…”

The nurses claim in the letter that they belong to the “first batch of medical aid workers from Guangdong Province” who came to Wuhan to provide support to local nurses in their fight against the disease.

They then add: “In addition to the physical exhaustion, we are also suffering psychologically. While we are professional nurses, we are also human. Like everyone else, we feel helplessness, anxiety, and fear. Experienced nurses occasionally find the time to comfort colleagues and try to relieve our anxiety. But even experienced nurses may also cry, possibly because we do not know how long we need to stay here and we are the highest-risk group for COVID-19 infection.”

The retraction note says: “On Feb 26, 2020, we were informed by the authors of this Correspondence that the account described therein was not a first-hand account, as the authors had claimed, and that they wished to withdraw the piece.”

About the retraction, a spokesperson for The Lancet told Retraction Watch: “Questions regarding the validity of this correspondence were brought to our attention by a number of readers. In addition, we received a direct communication from the authors of this correspondence on 26 February, 2020, stating that the account they described was not first-hand, as they had originally claimed in the correspondence, and that they wished to withdraw the piece. Following due process according to the COPE retraction guidelines, we determined that it was our duty to retract this correspondence.”

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, researchers from across the world, particularly the Chinese researchers, have published numerous papers. These have been published both in peer-reviewed journals as well as preprint servers such bioRxiv and medRxiv.

Preprints, as the name denotes, are not peer-reviewed and are typically posted by authors to quickly communicate the findings to the research and medical community. The quick dissemination of information has particularly been helpful during the current outbreak, which has been declared a “Public health emergency of international concern” by the WHO on January 30.

As a February 19 report by Reuters points out, 153 articles have been published on COVID-19 and the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Of them, 93 have been published in preprint repositories.

While retractions are quite normal in scientific publishing and is in fact a welcome measure to clean the literature of wrong or misleading information, what stands out is the stand taken by Richard Horton, editor-in-Chief of The Lancet group in an article in the Reuters report.

He had said that “some of the material that’s been put out — on pre-print servers for example — clearly has been… unhelpful”. He then added: “Whether it's fake news or misinformation or rumour-mongering, it's certainly contributed to fear and panic.”

Dr. Horton was referring to a preprint posted in bioRxiv on January 27 by researchers from IIT Delhi and Acharya Narendra Dev College, University of Delhi who claimed “uncanny” similarities between the new coronavirus and HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.

Scientists were quick to point out the glaring mistakes in the preprint and the authors withdrew the manuscript.

Soon thereafter, bioRxiv added a banner on top of each coronavirus preprint clearly stating that these are “preliminary reports that have not been peer-reviewed. They should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behaviour, or be reported in news media as established information”.

Ironically, hundreds of papers published in peer-reviewed journals are retracted each year.

Of course, letters published in journals are not peer-reviewed. But not everyone outside the scientific community, particularly journalists, is aware of this home truth. So the question before editors of peer-reviewed journals is, like bioRxiv, should they also not alert readers that letters published in their journals do not undergo peer-reviewing?

This is not the first time that letters about COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 virus published in peer-reviewed journals has had a problem. A letter published on January 30 in The New England Journal of Medicine about a Chinese woman transmitting the virus to a German colleague during the incubation period (and therefore before symptoms could show up) was found to be wrong. The researchers who wrote the letter had had not confirmed with the Chinese woman her true health status before sending in their letter to the journal. One of the authors told Science the reason they went wrong was because “the woman could not be reached at first and people felt this had to be communicated quickly.”

The journal has corrected it by adding supplementary information detailing her health condition even during her stay in Germany and on the days she interacted with her German colleagues.

That is not all. A research paper published on January 22 in the Journal of Medical Virology claimed that snakes had acted as intermediary hosts that spread the novel coronavirus to humans. Unlike letters, this research published post peer-reviewing was heavily criticised and debunked by other researchers. Till date, the paper has not been retracted or corrected.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/ukuvho/article30813031.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXCHINAOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/lancet-retracts-letter-about-the-plight-of-nurses-treating-covid-19-patients/article30942678.ece
453,2020/02/28,Only 15% R&D workforce are women: President Kovind,"The President was addressing scientists on the occasion of National Science Day.

President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday rued the lower number of women in the area of science and technology, and said they comprise only 15% of the workforce in research and development.

Mr. Kovind recalled how women scientists played a critical role in the ISRO’s Mars orbiter mission, known as Mangalyaan.

“Despite presence of highly-motivated women scientists, India’s R&D workforce has less than 15% women compared to the global average of 30%, according our National Task Force report,” Mr. Kovind said.

The President was addressing scientists on the occasion of National Science Day.

“Numbers are no different in science and technology teaching institutions,” he said. “Only a small percentage of women who study science go on to make a successful career and continue with this field.”

Mr. Kovind added that in order to encourage women to take to higher studies in science, he had substantially enhanced the representation of women in central universities.

454,2020/02/28,Biggest explosion seen in universe came from black hole,"The explosion was so large it carved out a crater in the hot gas that could hold 15 Milky Ways, says scientist.

Astronomers have discovered the biggest explosion seen in the universe, originating from a super-massive black hole.

Scientists reported on Thursday that the blast came from a black hole in a cluster of galaxies 390 million light-years away.

The explosion was so large it carved out a crater in the hot gas that could hold 15 Milky Ways, said lead author Simona Giacintucci of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington.

It’s five times bigger than the previous record-holder.

Astronomers used NASA’s Chandra X-Ray Observatory to make the discovery, along with a European space observatory and ground telescopes. They believe the explosion came from the heart of the Ophiuchus cluster of thousands of galaxies — a large galaxy at the center contains a colossal black hole.

Black holes don’t just draw matter in. They also blast out jets of material and energy.

The first hint of this giant explosion actually came in 2016. Chandra images of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster revealed an unusual curved edge, but scientists ruled out an eruption given the amount of energy that would have been needed to carve out such a large cavity in the gas.

The two space observatories, along with radio data from telescopes in Australia and India, confirmed that the curvature was, indeed, part of a cavity.

“The radio data fit inside the X-rays like a hand in a glove,” co-author Maxim Markevitch of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in a statement. “This is the clincher that tells us an eruption of unprecedented size occurred here.”

The blast is believed to be over by now. There are no signs of jets currently shooting from the black hole.

More observations are needed in other wavelengths to better understand what occurred, according to the team.

The findings appeared in the Astrophysical Journal.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/cl0zir/article30939424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/image1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/biggest-explosion-seen-in-universe-came-from-black-hole/article30939425.ece
455,2020/02/28,"National Science Day: India’s women scientists stress on better support, fair policies in research","National Science Day is celebrated on February 28 each year commemorating Indian physicist C V Raman’s discovery in 1928 of the Raman effect, the scattering of photons or light particles by matter.

As the country marks the National Science Day on Friday, many leading Indian women scientists have stressed on the need for the right kind of support, equality, and gender-fair policies in the field of research.

National Science Day is celebrated on February 28 each year commemorating Indian physicist C V Raman’s discovery in 1928 of the Raman effect, the scattering of photons or light particles by matter.

Raman received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930.

National Science Day is an occasion to salute the talent and tenacity of our scientists. Their innovative zeal and pioneering research has helped India and the world. May Indian science continue to thrive and may our young minds develop even greater curiosity towards science. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 28, 2020

Of the 607 Nobel medals awarded so far in scientific disciplines globally, just 20 have gone to women.

Noting that a career in science is a demanding and tough option, Rupamanjari Ghosh, Vice-Chancellor, Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida said there are additional barriers, often unintentional and unconscious ones, which are put up along the career path of women in science.

“When such a career demands long hours, there are issues of lack of security and basic amenities that affect women more adversely than men in this society. We need to pay active attention to these preventable problems, Ms. Ghosh, a Professor of Physics, told PTI.

G Geetha, Professor and Head, Division of Research and Development at Lovely Professional University (LPU) in Punjab, emphasised on closing the gender gap, and moving towards women-led projects in science.

She noted that out of the 560 awardees of Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, only 18 recipients have been women.

The prize is one of the highest multidisciplinary science awards in India.

According to Ms. Geetha, women represent only about a fifth of senior authors in all published research.

A study, published in the journal PLOS One in 2018, assessed 293,557 research articles from 54 journals, and found that “29.8 per cent of all research authors, and 33.1 per cent of the first, 31.8 per cent of the co-, and 18.1 per cent of the last authors were women.”

Another study by the UK’s Intellectual Property Office (IPO) noted that women inventors account for just under 13 per cent of patent applications globally.

For society to evolve with equality, Ms. Geetha feels the state and union governments should provide women grants for startups, core research, travel, and prototype development.

“Universities should preferentially encourage women entrepreneurs and women startups. A survey has to be conducted on participation of women as chairpersons or committee member in policy making, Ms. Geetha added.

Professor Manjula Reddy, Chief Scientist, Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad believes that science in India is progressing at a rapid pace since the last decade, thanks to the focus and initiatives on education and research.

“Setting up new educational and research institutions across India has contributed to this cause, she said.

However, Reddy, who won the Infosys Prize 2019, thinks India is lagging behind in basic sciences as compared to developed countries, and needs to make serious efforts to fill the gap.

“This can be achieved with structured funding, more focus on education and research activities.

“Basic research is a developmental activity; it may not have immediate tangible benefit, but has long-term sustainability and is the bedrock for future technological advances,” she explained.

Gagandeep Kang, Professor in the Department of Gastrointestinal Sciences at the Christian Medical College in Tamil Nadu believes that there is a lot of work to be done to build an understanding of the process and outputs of science -- a spirit of inquiry, and a deep trust in science and scientists.

“As scientists, some are doing reasonably well in many fields, but there are many areas where both quality people and skills are limited or lacking,” said Kang, who was awarded the prestigious Infosys Prize in Life Sciences in 2016.

Kang feels India does not have sufficient researchers working across various disciplines.

“That means we are unable to grow up to global standards, and there are few areas that I am aware of where an Indian group is among the world leaders,” she added.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/6p02n7/article30939405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WOMENINLAB,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/national-science-day-indias-women-scientists-stress-on-better-support-fair-policies-in-research/article30939406.ece
