But for the outside world, they were only friends. In the run-up to the film’s release, though, Krishna was often heard speaking at length about Milana’s involvement in its making, which extended way beyond her roles as actor and producer. Naturally, it got people wondering why she would show so much interest in the film. And now, they have decided to come clean.At a recent press meet about their film, Krishna and Milana finally spilt the beans about their relationship. “Milana and I have been together for five and a half years. Our families are aware of our relationship and have given us their blessings. We were waiting for the right time to make the announcement. In fact, before the release, friends suggested that we open up about our relationship, but we did not want that to become the talking point instead of our film. Milana has stood by me through thick and thin, something that I value greatly,” he says.Milana adds, “We have not set a date for our big date. There is pressure from both families, but Krishna and I are busy with our film commitments.”",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74117246,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-197999/74117246.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/milana-and-i-have-been-together-for-over-five-years-says-krishna/articleshow/74117246.cms

It was the first time he was at the event and because she seemed a veteran here, he used to call her chechi, though she was actually younger to him.

Small things matter to her and I try to do them right,” says Siddharth, who has Malayalam-film Kolaambi set for release and is in the final stages of signing a musical theatre show. “I don’t have formal training in singing, but Tanvi, who has learnt classical arts, loves the raw nature of my voice.

That’s when a group of carollers, all wearing Santa masks, walked in to their courtyard, singing. When Aileena came out with the money to tip them, one among them removed his mask.She says, “To my surprise, it was Balu! And he proposed to me, then and there. And what’s more, the rest of the carollers were his family and friends, dressed up as Santa Claus ! I was really amazed. I had shared a story on my social media page, tagging Balu invisibly to the song ‘All I want for Christmas is you.’ Only he could see and it gave him such an idea,” she says. Apparently, this is the reason why Balu tried to pull off such a proposal.The duo became friends during the shoot of the film Hi I am Tony, in 2014. Gradually, they realised they have the same wavelength. Balu says, “When were got into a relationship and I revealed it at home, my amma told me that when she had met Aileena during the puja function, she had felt she wanted such a daughter-in-law.” The couple, who got married recently, has not yet planned anything for their maiden Valentine's Day.

While Kannada TV’s Bharath makes his big screen debut, veteran actress Rekha fills in as his onscreen mom and Sonal as his romantic interest. But that apart, the film’s biggest USP, says Vivek, is that it will strike a chord with audiences across age groups. “Demo Piece revolves around the protagonist, Harsha, played by Bharath. In most families, you will come across a situation of parents doing their best to send their ward to college, only to have them fool around and not make the most of that opportunity. This is an aspect that we have explored in the film, apart from gambling, which is also a big draw for youngsters. Most importantly, though, on this day of love, what Demo Piece will remind everyone is just how valuable their parents really are to them and they will walk out of the theatre with a renewed urge to give them their due,” says Vivek, who has also produced the film along with Rekha, under the Raykha Movies banner.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74116768,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-149275/74116768.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/kannada/movies/news/demo-piece-will-make-you-value-your-parents-vivek-a/articleshow/74116768.cms

8,['14/02/2020'],"I’m the better kisser; that’s proven, says Mahat","Newlyweds, Mahat and Prachi Mishra , were all upbeat about doing an early-morning Valentine’s Day shoot with us on the beach. February is a big month for them — it’s not just their birth months, but now also the month that brought them together as husband and wife. The just-married couple opens up to us on their love, courtship, cuddles, and kisses....We never plan anything for Valentine’s Day celebration. We keep saying ‘love you’ every other day. Also, her birthday is on February 11 and mine is on the 18th of this month. We reserve all the romantic things for our birthdays. From this year, February 1 is also special as we got married on that day. I guess we will face budget problems from next year as February is going to be a big month for us (laughs).Yes, our birthdays overshadow Valentine’s Day. But we go out for dinner. This year, maybe, we will head out to party as it’s been a while since we partied.Every birthday, we do something special for each other. But more than giving surprises, it is just the thought of her being with me during testing times is the best feeling ever. I feel special when she comforts me when I am down. I have been in the industry for 11 years and there was a moment in 2017 when I almost gave up on the film industry. Acting has been my dream and everyone around me knows how passionate I am about it. I was in a low phase at that time and that’s when I met Prachi. She encouraged me and gave me the confidence that I would make it big. That’s when I felt that she was the right girl for me. That apart, we have done a lot of things… this birthday, I set up the room with 200 balloons, with 200 pictures of us. Needless to say, she was impressed (smiles).Oh yes, Mahat is the romantic person in our relationship. After all, he’s the ‘hero’, right? Even during our sangeet, he performed with 10 other dancers. I feel overshadowed by these… but that’s cute. During the initial few months of our courtship, he went out of the way to buy me stationery from a particular shop in Dubai as I love them. He gave me a handwritten note and card, too. I thought that was romantic as he was thoughtful in picking up something that I really liked.And she has done a lot of things, too. I broke my phone once and she got a phone for me almost immediately. It was packed cutely and she had attached a note, too.: Well, I have done a lot more (laughs). When he was in the Bigg Boss house, I used to shop a lot for him as I wanted him to look good on screen. I bought them in Dubai, and sent them via cargo. That’s romantic, right?I am a home-bird. I like to sit at home, watch a movie and have pizza. I like to converse with my partner and in a cozy environment.I am more of an outgoing person. I’d like to go to a nice couple’s spa, get some nice lunch or dinner, do stargazing, eat unhealthy food and have a glass of wine, maybe?Well, lots of lies (laughs).Yes, he promised to take me to different places and said that he would cook for me.I cooked for you once, I think (laughs).Ours was a long-distance relationship, so we used to surprise each other often by taking short trips. Whenever we get time, we go on long drives. I cook for him. He also makes the best paneer butter masala.Any relationship, be it a long-distance or otherwise, will work only when the couple doesn’t give up on each other. She stood by my side and vice versa.Watching movies!We also love to travel together. He clicks amazing pictures of me. He’s a cleanliness freak… so we enjoy cleaning the house together.I get angry, but my anger lasts for five minutes. And Prachi’s will go on for five hours. That’s the after-effect of my anger. She will make me apologise for five hours.He’s the first person to apologise as he’s wrong most of the time. When I am wrong, I will act innocent and sweet. Usually, Coco (our Beagle) comes and saves us. She’s the pacifier.Oh yes. No matter how mad we are at each other, she will sit between us and ease off the temper.Coco!Prachi, I am the better kisser. That’s proven.Ok, fine. Mahat is!When there is love, you will keep it alive. Yes, it might get monotonous and boring, but you will ensure you do something to keep your partner happy. We get bored with our work, but don’t we dress up and go to work since we love our job? It’s the same thing.I think it’s important for a couple to stay friends in a relationship.Yes, Prachi is more of a friend than my lover. We could be in bed for an entire day having random conversations.I was shivering when I tied the knot. I’d spent two whole months planning the wedding to get to that moment. So, it was special. Also, I got emotional when my mother performed nalungu for me. I got emotional after seeing her so happy.For me, it was the sangeet. He’s an actor, but he took efforts to dance to the songs I liked, and put up a spectacular show for me. He made his entire family give me roses. I felt special, alive and was mesmerised.I am still the third wheel in their relationship. We got a new bed for her, but she likes to sleep between us. At night, I would feel a warm breath near my cheeks. But it is not Mahat, it will always be Coco (laughs).Before marriage, I used to hug Coco and sleep. Both of us felt very bad when we bought her her bed. But she literally pushes us and sleeps in the centre. Coco is the best (laughs).",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74117708,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-1089376/74117708.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/tamil/movies/news/im-the-better-kisser-thats-proven-says-mahat/articleshow/74117708.cms
9,['14/02/2020'],"Sangeeth Sivan: As soon as the boy smiled, I knew he was the right one to play Unnikuttan","The film Yodha was born out of a wish on the part of myself and brother Santhosh to make a movie based on martial arts. We were inspired by those like The 36th Chamber of Shaolin. However, at that time, the farthest place that Malayalam could afford to place it outside of the State, was Nepal.Once there, we saw a girl who was supposed to have special powers. The Hinduism practised over there was very tantric, with sacrifices, black magic and the like. We also learnt about an evil group named Boksha and wanted to introduce it in some way into our story. The girl became a boy in our story and we also borrowed the Buddhist concept of incarnation. We had in our mind the film called Crocodile Dundee, which tells the story of a local Australian bushman, who goes to the US and becomes a hero there with his native skills. We thought, why not make our character go from Kerala to Nepal, to become a hero?Many who heard our story were not convinced that it would work as they felt that the the Kerala connection wasn’t strong. We approached many scriptwriters but it was Sasidharan Arattuvazhi who took just a week to incorporate the Kerala elements into the story!We took in all actors who were willing to shave their heads, to become monks (laughs). We cast a karate practitioner who was also an expert in Buddhist customs as the villain. While searching for a suitable boy who can play Rimpoche aka Unnikuttan, I asked our villain, ‘Do you have sons?’ He said, ‘I have two sons.’We were impressed with the photo of one of them, Sidharth Lama, who had this enviable mop of thick hair! When I met the boy and he smiled, I knew he was the one. He was smart and agreed to shave his head too! That’s how we zeroed in on Rimpoche aka Unnikuttan. His famous line Akosutto was Santhosh’s contribution.Yet another addition from Roja’s team was A R Rahman , who was at that time, Dileep. We had done a few jingles with him. However, after hearing his scores for Roja, Santhosh said he was definitely the next big thing. He came on board and put together some interesting scores like Padakali.When you have actors like Mohanlal and Jagathy Sreekumar on screen, one needs to think of situations that would do justice to their calibre. So, for the music competition, we thought of an idea based on tongue twister songs. Bichu Thirumala, our lyricist, had a good knowledge of folk songs. He sang a basic form of this for Rahman, who asked for references to create such a track. Yesudas and M G Sreekumar sang it, and it was not easy to record. Bichu offered to change the lyrics, if the singers found it too hard to mouth. However, Dasettan was like, ‘No no, it’s a competition, right? Let’s not change it.’We originally titled the film Buddha, but changed it to Yodha, as we didn’t want to ruffle any feathers. I remember that while the film was getting censored, they checked to see if there were any references to Buddha or his teachings in the film.The movie released with Mammootty’s Pappayude Swantham Appoos, which ran for around 150 days. Yodha was in theatres for around 100 days, and didn’t do as well as we expected. But all we wanted to do was make a martial arts movie based in Kerala. Whether it worked or not did not matter.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74117751,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-509444/74117751.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/sangeeth-sivan-as-soon-as-the-boy-smiled-i-knew-he-was-the-right-one-to-play-unnikuttan/articleshow/74117772.cms
10,['14/02/2020'],"Surabhi Lakshmi: For a while after National Awards, filmmakers didn’t know where to place me","After she brought National Award for the Best Actress to Kerala post a gap of 14 years in 2017, Surabhi Lakshmi had said, ‘My schedule is packed now with interviews, but what I actually wish for is to stay busy doing good characters in films.’ Three years later, we now see the actress in many commercial as well as critically acclaimed movies. She also has quite a few interesting projects coming up in Malayalam, including Dulquer Salmaan starrer Kurup Poriveyil with Indrans, Kallan Dsouza as Soubin Shahir’s heroine, director K Harikumar’s Jwalamukhi and more. Alongside speaking about her movies, Surabhi tells us how it wasn’t an easy road for her even after winning the prestigious award:While I was acting in director Jayaraj’s film Gulmohar, Srinath Rajendran was an assistant director in it. He was on the set soon after completing his engineering. He had called me to act in his directorial debut Second Show. However, the role was that of a very modern woman who wears sleeveless dresses and also smokes. At that time, for a kulipinnalkaari from Narikkuni village in Kozhikode, it was hard to imagine doing something of the sort. At that time, I only used to wear salwars, not even jeans. I told him I have no confidence or experience to pull it off at that point, and probably I might do something like that in a few years down the lane. There were no other roles that I could take up too, in it. So, he said we can work together in my next, and that’s how Kurup came along. I play DQ’s Kunjammayi, who is from Mumbai.It is my third film with Dulquer, after doing one combination scene each in the films ABCD and CIA. He has been an extremely humble man, who heartily laughs even for silly jokes, and makes everyone comfortable.It’s the second movie from the director of State Award winning film Kaliyachan. I play Indrans’ wife, who is bedridden being paralysed from waist below. All the performance is to be done, lying down. As Indrans is an actor who serves a good give and take platform, it is easy to act with those like him. Director Farooq Abdul Rahman is also great to work with.While studying for M A Theatre in Kalady Sri Sankara University, where those like Dileesh Pothen were my batch mate, I have directed about 26 plays as part of the curriculum. Direction of the music video Kaumaram wasn’t a planned one. The lyrics is by my friend Shyla chechi, its sung by Dr Shani and composed by Gayathri Iyer. The project shows five stages in a woman’s life, and what I directed is Kaumaram, which shows the feelings of a 16-year-old girl. It was produced by a group of friends, and as we aren’t high end professionals, we got a taste of all departments. I could also see how much pressure a director takes. As an actor, I think only about my performance, but that isn’t the case of a director.Will I direct movies? Well, filmmaking is in my mind, however, I don’t know how or when it will happen. I also think I should do my current job, acting, properly, first.I was predominantly a TV actress when I got it. I feel, if someone who was a mainstream actress would have got the award, movies and stories would have been made for them. Soon after I got the award, there was a phase in which filmmakers didn’t know where to place me. Can I be a heroine, mom, lover… they didn’t know. After I repeatedly made it clear that I am ready to take up any role, regardless of its size and after doing a few such roles, people started calling me. On the whole, I can’t claim to have had major changes in the way roles were offered to me, though small movies and good character roles are coming my way.Chachaji is a small movie that’s coming up. Kallan Dsouza by Jithu K Jayan has me as Soubin’s pair, and it also has Dileesh Pothen and Hareesh Kanaran as part of cast. I am currently shooting for K Harikumar’s film Jwalamukhi, which is about a woman who burns corpses. In India there are only three or four women doing that, including one woman from Thrikkakkara, named Saleena. However, the story isn’t based on their individual lives.",entertainment,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74117364,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-360610/74117364.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//entertainment/malayalam/movies/news/surabhi-lakshmi-for-a-while-after-national-awards-filmmakers-didnt-know-where-to-place-me/articleshow/74117382.cms

15,['14/02/2020'],Mike Pompeo: Four US Senators write to Pompeo seeking assessment on Kashmir and minority rights,"This story is from February 14, 2020

The US Seantors in their letter to Pompeo cited the Internet restrictions in the Valley

WASHINGTON: A bipartisan group of four US Senators have written a letter to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo requesting an assessment of the human rights situation in Kashmir and of the rights of religious minorities in India.

The letter, coming ten days before President Trump’s two-day state visit to India, is seen by some quarters as an effort to embarrass New Delhi, which is making strenuous efforts to show the situation in Kashmir is returning to normal by taking a second group of foreign envoys to the region this week.

Claiming to be “longtime friends of India,” the Senators wrote: “More than six months after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government unilaterally revoked the autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir, the government continues to block most internet in the region. India has now imposed the longest-ever internet shut down by a democracy, disrupting access to medical care, business, and education for seven million people. Hundreds of Kashmiris remain in ‘preventive detention,’ including key political figures.”

“In addition, the Indian government has taken other troubling steps that threaten the rights of certain religious minorities and the secular character of the state. This includes the passage of the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act, which is being challenged in India’s Supreme Court,” they added, seeking a State Department assessment of a number of issues within India including: the number of individuals detained by the government for political purposes and the treatment of those individuals; current restrictions on communications in Jammu and Kashmir; the current accessibility of Jammu and Kashmir; and restrictions on religious freedoms in Jammu and Kashmir.

The Trump administration has been extremely circumspect about the Modi government’s actions with regards to Jammu and Kashmir and CAA/MRC issues, largely treating it as a domestic matter for New Delhi to sort out while expressing concern about human rights and civil liberties aspects.

Signatories to the letter are Republicans Lindsey Graham and Todd Young, and Democrats Chris Van Hollen and Dick Durbin.

(Interestingly the number 4 has a special significance in their life, as they started dating on February 4). It will be a Catholic wedding facing the beach at a Juhu restaurant, followed by a Hindu shaadi on April 8.What sets this couple apart is the fact that they played siblings on the show, ' Ek Aastha Aisi Bhee ' and fell in love, eventually. Tina shares, “I have always dreamt of a wedding on or near the beach because I wanted the ceremony to take place at the meeting point of sky, sea and land. So, I have zeroed in on a restaurant that faces the beach. My family priest from Bengaluru will solemnise the wedding at 5 pm.” She adds, “I have also incorporated certain Hindu traditions for a beautiful cross-culture wedding. The priest will use the holy water from the Ganges to bless us at the end of the ceremony. We will also light the unity candle together to signify the coming together of two individuals from different regions and religions. A reception will be held after the wedding ceremony and there will also be a few games.”For the beach wedding, the actress will wear a white ballroom gown and Nikhil will don a grey tuxedo. For the Hindu ceremony, Tina has chosen a red lehenga, while Nikhil will wear a sherwani. She shares, “Nikhil wants the Hindu wedding to take place at Haridwar’s Ganga Ghat , according to the Vedic rituals, early in the morning. He is currently in Haridwar to sort the formalities and seek permission. We are keeping our fingers crossed for it to happen. If it doesn’t work out, we will have the Hindu wedding in either Delhi — Nikhil’s hometown — or Mumbai, the city where we realised our dreams and met each other.”",tv,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74118340,width-1070,height-580,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40,resizemode-75,imgsize-96120/74118340.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//tv/news/hindi/a-white-wedding-for-tina-philip-and-nikhil-sharma-on-april-4/articleshow/74118338.cms

Gulki Joshi is one of those few television actresses who isn’t afraid of making her own path and following it despite all odds. A big fan of Sushmita Sen , the television actress not only idolises the dusky beauty but draws inspiration from her as well.Right from her first show Phir Subah Hogi, Gulki has taken up different kinds of roles and tried to portray challenging characters. She said, “So far I’ve done shows which are different from each other and very challenging. I’m very thankful to the industry for offering me a variety of characters to play on screen.”Gulki revealed the reason why she got inclined towards acting. “Acting and doing different roles is a way of extending and expressing myself,” said the actress. Talking about it further, Gulki professed, “I participated in a lot of plays right from college days. Theatre is a very rigorous training and I’ve learnt a lot from theatre. Right from a strand of your hair to how you twist your shoes. Everything conveys something about you, your story, your experiences.

I’m very independent, emotionally as well as financially. Also, I’m not a romantic person by nature.

And when it comes to work, kabhi na kabhi it takes a toll on your relationship. So right now, I’m concentrating purely on work. When the time is right, a right partner might also come into the picture.”Gulki, who was in Lucknow to shoot for her show Maddam Sir - Kuch Baat Hai Kyunki Jazbaat Hai, also shed some light on the kind of partner she would like to spend her life with. The actress said, “I want my man to be happy with himself. There aren’t many people who know how to be happy with oneself. They seek approval in others, in others opinion and approval of them. I’m very independent and well aware of my strengths and weaknesses. I’m very self-aware so the main criteria for my partner would be that he’s self- aware.

24,['14/02/2020'],"Vodafone Idea Q3 revenue up 2%, but loss at Rs 6,439 crore","This story is from February 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: After reporting the biggest quarterly loss in Indian corporate history in second quarter of 2019-20 (at Rs 50,922 crore), Vodafone Idea said on Thursday its loss in the third quarter stood at Rs 6,439 crore. The telco saw steep competition, high costs and large debt-servicing depressing earnings.

The massive loss in the second quarter was mainly on account of the provisions that the company had made towards the heavy dues that it needs to pay to the government — estimated at over Rs 53,000 crore — following the October 23 Supreme Court order regarding Adjusted Gross Revenues (AGR).

Vodafone Idea said while profitability remains elusive by a large distance, the company managed to grow its revenues in the third quarter by 2.3%. The upward movement came after 14 consecutive quarters of declines. Revenues for the company stood at Rs 11,089 crore.

The company said as it works on improving operational efficiencies and taming costs, it is also taking steps to seek a relief on the AGR order. “We continue to actively engage with the government seeking relief on AGR and other matters. After dismissal of our review petition, we have filed for modification of the supplementary order with the Supreme Court,” Vodafone Idea MD & CEO Ravinder Takkar said.

SC will soon be hearing an appeal where the aggrieved telecom companies — mainly Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea — seek a relief in the payment schedule according to which the court had ordered them to pay.

25,['14/02/2020'],Mosques may verify ‘ethnicity’ claims of Assamese Muslims,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Representative image

GUWAHATI: Neighbourhood mosque committees across Assam could be officially tasked with verifying the ""ethnicity"" of Assamese-speaking Muslims during the state's first census to distinguish “native” Muslim communities from “immigrant” ones.

The Assam Minorities Development Board's proposal to make mosques the official verification authority comes on the heels of a campaign by the Janagosthiya Samannay Parishad to get the state's 40 lakh Assamese-speaking Muslims to file affidavits to add an ancestral or ethnic surname to their Muslim names.

Board chairman Mominul Awal has already filed an affidavit to change his name to Mominul Awal Goria, the surname representing the ethnic community he belongs to. While adopting a new surname is a personal choice that many Assamese-speaking Muslims might not want to exercise, there is no escaping the census to establish their ethnicity.

Most native Muslims trace their ancestry to the 15th century, but don't have any legacy documents stretching so far back. ""The government has yet to finalise the modalities for the census. We know there will be challenges, which is why the practical option is identification and verification by the local mosque jamats in the presence of enumerators from the revenue department,"" Awal said. ""If an immigrant Muslim tries to pass off as a native just by adding an ethnic surname, the local mosque committee will surely be able to call that bluff.""

Once the census exercise is notified, Assamese-speaking Muslims wanting to be enumerated would be required to apply online. These applications would be verified by the jamats and officials of the revenue department, Awal said.

The minorities development board has proposed categorising native Muslims into four groups —Goria, Moria, Desi and the Jolha tea tribe. This recommendation has been submitted to the high-powered committee set up by ministry of home affairs to recommend measures to implement Clause 6 of the Assam Accord of 1985.

""Constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people,"" the clause states.

The committee's brief is to also define who is an ""indigenous Assamese"", a nomenclature that has been the bone of contention in a state inhabited by a large number of disparate ethnic communities.

The proposed census for now will be limited to the Brahmaputra Valley, which is where the Goria, Moria, Desi and Jolha communities are concentrated. The Barak Valley in south Assam has other Muslim communities that claim to be ""native"" but speak Bengali and other languages.

NEW DELHI: RK Pachauri , 79, founder director of New Delhi-based think tank The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) and former chairman of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), passed away on Thursday.

He was battling cardiac ailments and was put on life support in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday. He had undergone open heart surgery at Fortis Escorts Heart Institute after suffering a stroke in Mexico in July last year.

Under his leadership, IPCC got the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with former US vice-president Al Gore. The prize recognised IPCC for its ""efforts to build and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for measures needed to counteract such change."" He headed the body from 2002 to 2015.

Pachauri resigned from Teri in 2015 in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment.

Pachauri had multiple cardiac issues and doctors at Fortis Escorts Heart Institute said he had been put on life support three days ago. ""Pachauri had also undergone an open heart surgery but his condition didn't improve,"" said a source, adding that Pachauri was taken home around 7pm on Thursday, where he breathed his last.

Pachauri became chief executive of Teri in 1981 and headed the institute for more than three decades. He had to quit his post of executive vice-chairman in 2015 in the wake of allegations of sexual harassment, stalking and criminal intimidation. In October 2018, a Delhi court had framed molestation charges against Pachauri, who had denied the charges. The court had given him anticipatory bail in 2015.

""Teri is what it is because of Pachauri's untiring perseverance. He played a pivotal role in growing this institution, and making it a premier global organisation in the sustainability space,"" said Ajay Mathur, director general, Teri, who succeeded Pachauri in 2015.

Pachauri was honoured with Padma Bhushan in 2001 and Padma Vibhushan in 2008.

""Pachauri's contribution to global sustainable development is unparalleled. His leadership of the IPCC laid the ground for climate change conversations today,"" Teri chairman Nitin Desai said.

An alumnus of the Indian Railways Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering in Jamalpur, Bihar, Pachauri served in various positions in the Indian Railways, including at the Diesel Locomotive Works in Varanasi.

He had served in several organisations in different positions before founding Teri.

But, there is willingness to improve the situation; authorities are eager to make it happen,"" said FS Lotfe, ambassador of Mexico to India.Hans Dannenberg Castellanos, dean of diplomatic corps in India, added, ""Today we had very good meetings with chief justice of J&K HC, chief secretary & LG. All three of them were very thorough in explaining to us the road map on how things would progress.""Given the lack of development in J&K, other diplomatic sources felt that the removal of Art 370 was necessary.

29,['14/02/2020'],Uddhav Thackeray overrules NCP on Elgar Parishad case,"This story is from February 14, 2020

A Maharashtra NCP minister said he was overruled by CM Thackeray in handing the Elgar Parishad case to NIA

MUMBAI: Shiv Sena and NCP appear to be on a collision course over entrusting the Elgar Parishad probe to the National Investigation Agency (NIA). ""The CM has the powers,"" Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, who is from NCP, said on Thursday. ""He overruled my proposal and granted consent to the NIA to take over the probe.""

Deshmukh said that before taking a major ""policy decision"", the state government should have told the Union ministry that there was a need to reconsider its decision. ""We should have consulted the advocate general,"" he said, adding, ""I was overruled by the CM.""

The Elgar Parishad was a gathering held by Dalit groups and others at Shaniwar Wada in Pune on December 31, 2017, a day before violence broke out between Dalits attending the annual Koregaon Bhima battle commemoration in Shirur taluka of Pune district and villagers from the area.

While the then BJP-Sena government blamed and arrested some ""Naxal sympathisers"" who had supported the Elgar Parishad, NCP, Congress and some Dalit groups blamed Hindutva forces for the violence.

After coming to office in alliance with Sena, NCP suggested that the Elgar Parishad case built by BJP was false. On January 10, Sharad Pawar wrote to Thackeray saying prominent citizens and innocent persons had been arrested by the Pune police in the case and the investigation should now be entrusted to an SIT headed by a senior IPS officer. The Union government acted swiftly to quash that possibility and issued an order for the NIA to take over the investigation.

NCP lodged a protest against the move. Even the Pune police challenged the proposal before the Pune special court which is hearing the case. The court is expected to pass an order on Friday.

A bureaucrat said that when MHA issued its notification on January 24, the home department submitted it to the law and judiciary department for opinion in view of Pawar and Deshmukh's reservations. The law and judiciary department replied that it was well within the powers of the Union ministry to entrust the investigation to the NIA in view of the gravity of the offence. The file, along with the opinion of the law and judiciary department, was then submitted to Deshmukh, who was not keen to entrust the inquiry to the NIA.

The file, along with the views expressed by Deshmukh, was submitted to the CM, who upheld the opinion given by the law and judiciary department. Accordingly, the home department on Wednesday issued an order saying it had no objection to the NIA talking over the inquiry.

However, the propaganda was effectively countered with statements issued by Geelani's own family, his doctor as well as local administration and police denying the rumours of his death and clarifying that he was stable,"" Singh said.Geelani has been ailing for several years now and has been mostly confined to his home. After speculation was rife on Wednesday evening, authorities discontinued mobile services, which were only resumed on Thursday afternoon when statements were released by Geelani's family members that he was stable.While authorities in J&K told TOI that Geelani was now ""fine"" after a health emergency, the local administration appears to have prepared for all scenarios, including his death, given his advanced age and medical condition.

32,['14/02/2020'],Sanjeev Chawla: From garment seller to betting badshah,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Sanjeev Chawla (in mask) in Delhi, after his extradition from UK (ANI)

NEW DELHI: Twenty-five years ago, Sanjeev Chawla sold garments in south-east Delhi’s Jangpura market. It took just a few chance meetings with some punters placing and accepting bets on cricket matches for Chawla to change tracks.

For the son of a cloth seller, Chawla’s fortunes witnessed a meteoric rise in the betting business and he began to visit foreign countries with other bookies on business trips. It did not take him long to be introduced to cricketers at parties. A smooth talker, Chawla soon struck up friendships with the who’s who of cricket at the time. By 1998-1999, he was busy changing the outcomes of major cricket tournaments, including the famous 1999 series in Sharjah, investigators claim.

Chawla’s father was a small-time garments businessman and owned a shop in Bhogal market. Later, he and his brother had taken over the business and expanded it, after which the family shifted from their house in Jangpura to a three-storey bungalow in Noida in the 1990s.

A known face at business gatherings in five-star hotels in south Delhi, Chawla was allegedly introduced to the bigwigs of the match-fixing syndicate by an old friend who owned a well-known cassette company at the time. After a few meetings, Chawla started calling the shots in the betting syndicates based in India. He was soon termed the “god” of cricket betting in India, the police claimed.

A few years into the syndicate and Chawla had bought a house in Greater Kailash-II and rented a sprawling bungalow in London. His wife started a designer clothes brand based out of London. He kept travelling back and forth between UK and India between 1996 and 2000 until his passport was cancelled by the Indian government after he was found to be allegedly involved in match-fixing. However, the UK authorities gave him permission to remain in London till 2003 and, in 2005, he was granted UK citizenship.

Chawla took up a property at Kennington, southeast London, and moved with wife and children into a £1 million rented six-bedroom property in Temple Fortune.

Investigators add that in one of the after-match parties, Chawla was introduced to Rajesh Kalra, the other accused charged by the Delhi Police in the case. After his arrest in 2000, Kalra has been out of the public’s gaze, except for a big incident in 2014 when a criminal gang from south Delhi intercepted a vehicle moving around Rs 14 crore of cash, allegedly Kalra’s, and stole the money. The police recovered most of the money and Kalra has been under the income tax scanner since then.

Kalra had told the cops during interrogation that he had parted ways with Chawla in late 2000 after the ODI match between India and South Africa did not go according to plan, leading to discord between the two.

However, he alleged that Chawla controlled the Indian syndicate from London. Despite Interpol having issued a red corner notice against Chawla on the request of the CBI way back in 2001, he was only arrested in 2016 in London after repeated requests from the Indian government. In between, Scotland Yard had only questioned him about his alleged involvement in a match-fixing deal involving England players.

NEW DELHI: Foreign minister S Jaishankar and historian Ramachandra Guha engaged in a war of tweets, spread out over two days, on whether Jawaharlal Nehru had included the name of Vallabhbhai Patel in his initial list of Cabinet members. Both asked the other to read books on the subject.On Wednesday, the foreign minister had released a biography of V P Menon, a senior civil servant who worked closely with Lord Mountbatten and Patel. He later tweeted in the evening, “Learnt from the book that Nehru did not want Patel in the Cabinet in 1947 and omitted him from the initial Cabinet list. Clearly, a subject for much debate.” He followed it with another tweet: “Exercise of writing history for politics in the past needs honest treatment.”“When Sardar died, a deliberate campaign was begun to efface his memory. I know this, because I have seen it, and at times, I fell victim to it myself,” he wrote while quoting Menon from the biography.Replying to foreign minister S Jaishankar’s tweet on Thursday morning, Guha presented an opposite view. “This is a myth that has been comprehensively demolished by Professor Srinath Raghavan... Besides, promoting fake news about, and false rivalries between, the builders of modern India is not the job of the foreign minister. He should leave this to the BJP’s IT cell,” he tweeted on Thursday morning.Jaishankar responded within two hours, writing, “Some foreign ministers do read books. May be a good habit for some professors too. In that case, strongly recommend the one I released yesterday.”The historian then shared a picture of the letter Nehru wrote to Patel, inviting him to join the first Cabinet of free India, calling him the “strongest pillar” of that Cabinet. “Can someone show this to @DrSJaishankar please?” he wrote around 1pm, also tagging the foreign minister’s verified handle. He also asked the minister to “consult” more books.“Sir, since you have a Ph D from JNU you must surely have read more books than me. Among them must have been the published correspondence of Nehru and Patel which documents how Nehru wanted Patel as the ‘strongest pillar’ of his first Cabinet. Do consult those books again,” he tweeted around 2.30pm.The biography is authored by historian Narayani Basu, who later tweeted, “We could sit around & debate this Cabinet list deal all day. At this point, I’m dropping out of it. It is no use fuelling a political fire, simply to hijack the story of a man who played a key role in modern Indian history & deserves his day in the sun.”",india,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74126267,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-41993,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/nehru-didnt-want-patel-in-govt-jaishankar-guha-spar/articleshow/74126268.cms

35,['14/02/2020'],Govt disagrees with SC’s quota verdict,"This story is from February 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: Union social justice ministry has come out against the Supreme Court order that reservation for SC/ST in jobs and promotions is at the discretion of state governments, saying they are constitutional provisions which cannot be trifled with.

At the heart of the debate triggered by the apex court judgement are Articles 16 (4) and 16 (4A). The Uttarakhand government of BJP argued they are “enabling” clause and cannot be termed a fundamental right, and the top court agreed that they empower the states to provide for twin quotas if they feel SCs/STs are “not adequately represented”.

Disagreeing with the interpretation, Union social justice secretary R Subrahmanyam told TOI, “When enabling provision is put in the Constitution, it reflects the national will. So, they cannot be trivialised by saying that it is up to the state to implement them or not.”

The remarks from the top bureaucrat manning the social justice ministry constitute the first government dissent against the court’s latest comment on the twin constitutional provisions and their scope.

When the judgement came out and triggered an uproar this week, Modi government chose to tread a safe line by telling the Parliament that the Centre was “committed and dedicated to the welfare of SC/ST/OBC” and that “appropriate steps on the issue will be taken after discussion at the highest level”.

The proponents of social justice believe that the judgement will have a debilitating effect on the rights of marginalised classes as leaving the implementation of quotas to the discretion of states could encourage debate on the “inviolability” of quotas which has been a settled issue till now.

It is felt the judgement can easily trigger political lobbying from anti-quota classes which can put under pressure even the most amenable political parties. They cite the example of Madhya Pradesh where upper castes launched a political party SAPAKs ahead of December 2018 assembly elections in protest against the provisions introduced by the Centre to undo the dilution of SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act.

Political sources in the government agree with the implications of the judgement and say that a remedy would have to be found.

While a review petition is the likely course of action since the Centre was not a party to the case which resulted in the recent judgement, the Jarnail Singh case, which is at the heart of “reservation in promotions”, is still pending in the apex court.

A strong possibility exists that the Centre may seek a review of “quotas not a fundamental right” judgement as part of the Jarnail case – in which the court introduced “creamy layer” in promotion quotas for SC/ST.

Recently, the Centre asked the court to refer its 2018 verdict to a seven-judge bench for review, disagreeing with introduction of exclusionary “creamy layer” for SC/ST.

Till now, the concept of “creamy layer” – which declares the well-off as ineligible for quotas -- has been limited to OBCs and not been part of the SC/ST quota dispensation.

36,['14/02/2020'],Govt defends LPG price rise after row,"This story is from February 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: Amid continued Congress jibes and criticism from other parties, the government on Thursday defended the sharp increase in domestic LPG prices and said households will not be affected due to a matching increase in subsidy.

Explaining the math, a government statement said LPG price is determined on the basis of the fuel’s international price in the previous month. In January, the global price had shot up from $448 per tonne to $567, necessitating an increase of Rs 144.50 in the price of a 14.2-kg. cylinder in Delhi, the benchmark domestic market.

As a result, the statement said, the price of domestic non-subsidised LPG cylinder has increased from Rs 714 per cylinder to Rs 858.50. Simultaneously, domestic consumers availing subsidy has been cushioned by increasing the government support from Rs 153.86 per cylinder to Rs 291.48.

“Therefore, out of about 27.76 crore LPG consumers, in respect of about 26.12 crore consumers (who avail subsidy) the increase in price is borne by the government through enhanced subsidy,” the statement said.

Similarly for Ujjwala consumers, the subsidy has been increased from Rs 174.86 per cylinder to Rs 312.48. Here too the impact of price hike is mostly borne by the government.

The price hike, sharpest since January 2014 on Wednesday, had drawn sharp criticism from the Congress, TMC and the BSP. The Congress kept up the pressure on Thursday by demanding a roll-back and wondered if the price revision was “revenge” for the BJP’s defeat in the Delhi polls.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted a UPA-era picture of BJP leaders, including Smriti Irani, protesting against an increase in LPG price at the time. “I agree with these members of the BJP as they protest the astronomical 150 (sic!) Rs price hike in LPG cylinders,” Gandhi tweeted.

The Mahila Congress held a protest against the steep LPG price hike and submitted a memorandum to the government demanding a roll-back of the increased prices.

37,['14/02/2020'],Govt readies to implement new transgender law by March 31,"This story is from February 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: The government has set in motion the ground work to implement the law that came into effect on January 10 to protect the rights of transgender persons. The ministry of social justice and empowerment has set March 31 as the deadline to frame rules and consultations are at an advanced stage. The ministry has also assigned Tata Institute of Social Sciences the task of preparing a draft scheme for welfare of transgender persons in consultation with stakeholders by mid March.

Aware of the anxiety of the transgender community members pertaining to certain provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights ) Law, the ministry is now working on rules to address concerns like putting in place the process for identity certification based on the right of every transgender person to “self perceived identity” as per the new law.

When asked about the status of rules, Union social justice secretary, R Subrahmanyam told TOI, “We have held consultations and work is on to put in place the rules by March 31. The attempt is that implementation should be smooth and care will be taken that no transgender person faces any kind of distress while seeking identity certification.” Subrahmanyam said he was of the view that since the law provides for the right to self perceived identity, a self certification by a person who identifies as transgender should be good enough for issuing identity certificates.

The law states that a person shall have a right to self-perceived gender identity and transgender person may make an application to the district magistrate for issuing a certificate of identity as a transgender person, in such form and manner, and accompanied with such documents, as may be prescribed. The rules will now prescribe the process to enable implementation.

On the status of the the National Council for Transgender Persons to be set-up under the chairmanship of minister for social justice and empowerment to monitor the implementation of the law, the Subrahmanyam said, “First the rules will be framed and the scheme for welfare of transgender persons will be rolled out and then the council as stipulated under the law will follow.”

The new law gives makes room for protection of transgender persons against offences including physical and sexual abuse by providing for penalties ranging from imprisonment of 6 months to two years and a fine. It also introduces a provision for coverage of medical expenses through a comprehensive insurance scheme for sex reassignment surgery, hormonal therapy and other health issues.

In the budget for 2020-21, Rs 10 crore has been allocated for schemes pertaining to transgender persons. This amount was Rs 5 crore in 2019-20 and Rs 1 crore in 2018-19. The law got the Parliament’s assent in November and was notified in December. While all MPs welcomed the legislation in principle, the opposition raised concerns over lack of clarity in definitions and usages like “self perceived identity”, clauses pertaining to penalty and fine and issuance of certificates of identity.

SBI managing director Arijit Basu (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The worst is over as far as non-performing assets (NPAs) are concerned, a top official of the country’s largest lender said on Thursday. He added overreach by investigative agencies must be avoided.

“When you are working with public money, you need to be overseen and you have to have a Central Vigilance Commission or a CBI, but there should not be overreach. I think the government also in the recent past has taken a lot of measures to assure bankers,” said SBI ( State Bank of India ) managing director Arijit Basu . He said banks are ready to support credit growth in the country.

“Credit growth has slowed down, but on the retail side, which is the individual home loans and personal loans, we are growing at around 18%. Even in corporate loans and SME loans, we find that we have been able to sanction a large number of new term loans, which are getting disbursed,” he said at the Times Now Summit .

He said working capital loans have witnessed moderation, which is a reflection of a certain amount of slowdown but was confident the situation will improve soon. “It is not only the government, but we in the bank management also have given this assurance. There may have been some hesitation but we have passed that and we are now definitely ready to continue to support the credit growth in the country.”

Basu said going forward the sector will see a much better quarter. “There will be one or two cases that will come up here and there, but I think banks will be able to deal with them.” He said the steps undertaken by the government to repair the banking sector and legislations, such as Insolvency and Bankruptcy code (IBC,) have helped immensely.

“It is not all gloom. The measures that have been taken by the government in the last few years, many of them may not be coming out in the economic data as of now, but we understand that they have been for a good cause. The way in which IBC has empowered the banks, the attitude certain promoters had on how they will deal with the banks has completely changed. So, it has become much easier for us to go forward.”

Basu said for SBI and most other banks, the retail sector is doing very well. Personal loans are growing, services sector is doing well. NPA ratios are very low. In the corporate sector also, industries like steel have done well, he said.

Political posters are put up in the city on every consecutive day with pun intended cartoons and slogans.

PATNA: Assembly election in Bihar is at least six months away but the ruling as well as opposition parties are already busy training their guns on each other through posters.

For over a month now, new political posters are put up in the city on every consecutive day with pun intended cartoons and slogans. Latest in the series was a poster with a punchline, ‘Thugs of Bihar’ with cartoon of incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad as lead. The latest poster reads, ‘Lara Film Presents — Thugs of Bihar’ and shows a reel with illustrations of kidnappings and murders among other crimes, possibly pointing towards the RJD regime (1990-2005). It also has a one-liner — ‘Zara Yaad Karo, Wo Kahani Purani (Try to remember the old story)’. The poster incidentally has no individual or party’s name as its propagator.

The ‘Thugs of Bihar’ appeared two days after the RJD poster put up near Income Tax roundabout on Monday with the punchline —’Do Hazar Bees, Nitish Kumar Finish’. The poster mentions the name of Bhai Arun Kumar, general secretary of RJD (Bihar) and Umesh Yadav, another party functionary from Kumhrar in Patna.

Another RJD’s poster with a photograph of Tejashwi Prasad Yadav shows CM Nitish Kumar sitting on a chair with a caption — ‘Kursi Pujari (worshipper of chair)’. The poster tries to attack the Nitish government on health, education and unemployment issues. It further says that youth will get jobs, migration will stop, people will get proper health and education facilities if Tejashwi comes to power.

RJD spokesperson Mrityunjay Tiwari said the poster war started by JD(U). “They started with ‘Theekey To hai Nitish Kumar (Nitish Kumar is fine)’. We have given a befitting reply by saying that 2020, Nitish Kumar finish,” he said.

Earlier, big hoardings with Nitish’s face and slogans like ‘Kyun Kare Vichar, Thike To Hai Nitish Kumar (Why should I rethink, Nitish Kumar is perfect (as CM)’ were put up by JD(U). Later, RJD responded with ‘Jhooth ki tokri, ghotalo ka dhanda’ and ‘Trouble Engine, Ek Jhooth Express’ posters.

Posters attacking RJD have also been put up in the state capital showing Lalu-Rabri era with broken roads, bloodshed, people holding guns, students studying under lantern and buffaloes in the background while Nitish era was shown with smooth roads and flyovers, girls cycling to school and women switching on the light.

JD(U) functionary and state IPRD minister Neeraj Kumar said the posters were being put not by JD(U) but its sympathizers and common people, who don’t want the return of lawlessness and lack of development they had witnessed during RJD regime.

PATNA: Magsaysay Award winner Rajendra Singh said on Thursday that water can be conserved by adopting traditional methods in the country.

Water is climate and climate is water, said Singh, while addressing the sixth symposium on ‘Water governance: Issues and Challenges’ organized by Development Management Institute (DMI) at Bihar Museum here on Thursday.

Singh, also known as the ‘Waterman of India’, said the world might face the wrath of third world war for water and natural resources. He stressed upon the need and urgency of water management across the world. “There is a need of dialogue between environmentalists and the policymakers to find a solution to the emerging water crisis,” he said.

In the context of ‘Jal-Jevan-Hariyali’ project in the state, the waterman said the Bihar government should focus on water literacy movement similar to the model adopted by the Maharashtra. He also shared his experience when Rajasthan was facing water crisis due to encroachment of farmland. “For sustainable watershed management, we need to recharge groundwater and make efficient use of water,” he said.

Singh also released his book ‘Main Hi Jal Hoon’ on the occasion.

DMI director Hemanth Rao talked about the relevance of the symposium theme. “The institute has taken the opportunity to bring environmentalists, experts, government officials and policymakers on a single platform to discuss water crisis and its solution,” he said.

The experts talked about fostering community participation in water governance, issues in groundwater use and availability in two separate technical sessions.

DMI chairman Anup Mukherjee and its dean Niraj Kumar and other members were present on the occasion.

43,['14/02/2020'],‘Boardroom battle with KKR led to Thapar’s exit’,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Mumbai: Private equity firm KKR India may have had a role in the boardroom battle at fraud-hit CG Power and Industrial Solutions that led to the ouster of promoter-chairman Gautam Thapar from the company, proxy advisory firm InGovern said on Thursday.

KKR had a debt exposure to Avantha Holdings, which the Thapar-promoted company failed to repay completely. “This may be why the relations went downhill between KKR and Thapar,” InGovern said. It further said that upon request by Avantha to convert debt into equity, KKR had asked for the appointment of Narayan Seshadri initially as a consultant but later as an independent director on the board of CG Power.

“Seshadri has close business interests with KKR,” the report by InGovern said. Soon thereafter a three-member committee that included Seshadri was formed to investigate certain transactions in CG Power. Law firm Vaish Associates, commissioned by the committee, then came out with a report which showed many contentious transactions. Markets regulator Sebi, acting on the Vaish report, barred Thapar and other senior executives of CG Power from accessing the securities market. Subsequently, the company’s board removed Thapar from the chairman’s post.

KKR became a shareholder of CG Power with a 10% stake after invoking pledged shares of the promoter. “According to Thapar, the events at CG Power have been orchestrated by the lenders as KKR wanted to oust the promoter and take control of the company,” InGovern said. Reacting to the report, KKR said, “We have been a lender to Avantha and not a shareholder of CG Power until we enforced our share pledge on September 16, 2019 as a result of defaults by Avantha. As a result of our enforcement, we now own just under 10% of the equity stake in CG Power.”

KKR further stated that “As a shareholder, it is in our interest to engage constructively with the company, both through its board and shareholders, in order to preserve and enhance the value of the company. The appointment of Seshadri as an independent director predates our share pledge enforcement and in any case, it is entirely within the board’s power to manage the affairs of the company in accordance with its charter”.

Subsequently, the three-member committee was dissolved and a new panel was formed that included Seshadri as its chairman to focus on improving the company’s operations, capital restructuring including raising funds and dealing with regulators.

InGovern said an analysis of the issues at CG Power reveals that the boardroom battle has led to value destruction for minority shareholders of the company.

Narrow lanes of a society in Ghanshyamnagar of Varchha

Surat: Every zone of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has residential areas where it is impossible for fire vehicles to enter in case of emergency.

There are at least 20-odd residential societies in areas like Varachha where there is no open space for the fire vehicles to enter in case of emergency due to unplanned development. For the first time, the SMC commissioner has asked the officials to spot these areas and, if required, take police protection to carry out anti-encroachment drive and make way for the emergency vehicles.

In Karanj area, which falls in Varachha zone, there are societies like Gayatri society, Ambika Nagar, Sitaram Nagar, Hari Iccha Industrial Society, Jawahar Nagar and Rang Nagar where there are concrete jungles criss crossing the way.

“In case of a fire breaking out in any of these places, it is almost impossible for the fire vehicles to enter and rush to the spot. It will take us an hour to take equipment to the spot. And by the time we reach there, things will have been gutted in the fire,” said a senior fire officer who worked in Varaccha zone of the city.

This is not an isolated case, but in many parts of the Diamond City, there are densely populated areas where there is very little space for two-wheelers to pass through. In such areas how can a fire vehicle enter?

After fire incidents at Takshashila arcade in May 2019 and Raghuvir Celeum in January 2020, fire and emergency department has started a survey mainly in commercial areas of the city.

N V Upadhayay, deputy commissioner in-charge of fire department, told TOI: “The city has witnessed all major deadly fires in commercial and industrial segments only. In residential areas, fire incidents are also a cause for concern. We have undertaken a survey across the city and will come up with a list of such areas shortly.”

Upadhayay added, “Once that list is prepared, we will start our work one by one. If required police protection will be taken but such encroachments will be removed which are an obstruction to the fire vehicles.”

Surat: Varachha police detained five women and a man on Thursday after they refused to end their protest at Shreenathji Dwar society on A K Road. The residents of a society started their agitation against a developer who, along with cops had arrived at the society to take possession of its nearly 200 yard plot worth Rs 1 crore.

The society residents claimed that the plot is a common property of the society which is reserved for recreational purposes. However, the developer claimed that they have purchased the land from the previous owner.

On Thursday, the developer went to the spot with police bandobast when residents started to protest. Later additional police force was called and those taking leadership in the agitation were detained. ""Those protesting were detained after argument with police when they tried to stop those who had sought police protection. The developer recently won a case in court after which they wanted possession for which police protection was sought,"" said a police officer.

According to sources in the police, the society was developed in 1992 and the plot was given to the society for recreational activities. In recent past, the developers approached the society to take possession of the plot claiming that they own it but the society residents refused to hand it over and approached the court.

A View of Luxury buses at Mithapur bus stands in Patna on Thursday which runs without following safety measure... Read More

PATNA: The Ferozabad bus accident , in which 14 people were killed on Wednesday night, raised questions about the safety norms being followed by bus operators in Bihar. Most of the victims were from Bihar as the bus was coming from Delhi to Motihari in East Champaran when it met with an accident on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway.

Though state transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said on Thursday that the permits of those buses not following safety norms will be cancelled, most of the private interstate buses under Bihar State Road Transport Corporation (BSRTC) do not have even the emergency gates. “We are going to launch awareness drive for bus drivers in association with Aurangabad’s Institute of Driving Training and Traffic Research (IDTR),” Agarwal said and added: “We will also give Rs250 honorarium to each bus driver and food packets during training about safety measures and precautions.”

Buses, run by the private operators mostly run without following safety measures; like they don’t keep hammer near windshield, fire extinguisher and medical kit. However, some drivers claimed their buses have facilities like CCTV cameras, speed governor, LCD screens and Wi-Fi.

Jhameli Singh, the cleaner of a private bus which plies on Patna-Purnia route, told this newspaper that his bus has one emergency gate “but we do not know how to open it. This has to be done by the engineers. We do not need firs-aid kit and fire extinguisher in our bus as people carry their own stuff which they need”.

Ram Kalraj, a bus driver at Mithapur bus stand, said there is no emergency gate in his double-decker bus for Gorakhpur. “There is no space for emergency gate. People can break the windscreen in case of emergency. We have one hammer that I keep under my seat,” he said and added: “If we put one hammer near every window, passengers will certainly break the glass and it would cost Rs10,000 to replace it. We have fire extinguisher, medical kit and other safety tools.”

Gopal Sharan, an interstate bus driver, said, “I keep the emergency gate locked because passengers often open it. It causes inconvenience to the cleaner.”

Sunil Kumar Singh, another interstate bus driver, said they have all the facilities in their buses except the emergency gate and fire extinguisher. “We had a fire extinguisher which was removed as we didn’t know how to use it,” he said.

Jeevan Kumar, a passenger travelling to Ranchi, said the bus drivers and cleaners need to be sensitized about such accidents. “It is the responsibility of the state government to ensure that those who get bus permits follow the safety norms,” he said.

PATNA: Around 500 sub-inspector (SI) aspirants once again staged a protest near the J P roundabout in the state capital on Thursday. They demanded re-examination as well as CBI inquiry into the alleged leak of question papers of the Bihar police sub-inspector recruitment examination.

The SI aspirants burned an effigy of chief minister Nitish Kumar and raised anti-government slogans. They marched towards the J P roundabout from Patna Science College at 12pm.

One of them, Nitish from Jamui, alleged that many students had received the question papers much before the exam began. He told this newspaper, “We want the Bihar Police Subordinate Services Commission to conduct the exam again.”

Another aspirant, Suraj Kumar Sinha from Samastipur, said, “A candidate, who had not even written the examination, qualified it. How can this be possible?” he asked.

The Gandhi Maidan police lodged an FIR against seven people, who had led the protest. Town DSP Suresh Kumar said, “No water cannons or batons were used against the protesters, a complaint was filed against seven people, who manipulated the SI aspirants.”

50,['14/02/2020'],Electric cars: Electric cars likely to get same power specs,"Chennai: In a bid to standardise the various parts of the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem, several constituents, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), have come together to define standards. The move is primarily aimed at commercial vehicles that will ply with swappable batteries The OEMs — which include Mahindra & Mahindra, Lucas TVS, Okinawa, Kinetic, GEM, Ashok Leyland , Exicom, Amara Raja Batteries and Exide — are involved in preparation of these specifications. “We have coordinated this effort and did iterations in the documents based on feedback from all different stakeholders,” said Prabhjot Kaur , CEO of the Centre for Battery Engineering and EVs (C-BEEV). The centre comes under the department of electrical engineering at IIT-Madras. The project is spearheaded by professor Ashok Jhunjunwala “We don’t want to commit the mistakes of mobile handset companies that did not standardise chargers, etc, when it would have made sense. We will continue to work towards setting up more common standards for the industry,” KaurThe standards are grouped under ‘Lock Smart - Vehicle Battery Charger Cloud Protocol (or LS-VBCC).They will act as the cornerstone for EVs.“The battery-swapping industry standard has been designed with a group coming from different segments — charger manufacturers, vehicle OEMs, battery manufacturers and other stakeholders,” Kaur said.The protocol specifies the communication to be implemented between subsystems that need to interact with each other, be it battery and vehicle, battery and charger, battery and hand-held device or apps and server.The purpose of the standard is to promote interoperability between energy operators, vehicles, batteries and chargers.This would make it agnostic to the make & model of these subsystems for an operator to procure the components. It would also be a great benefit for users to acquire or exchange the batteries and gain from the lower capital expenditure and operating expenditure and be flexible on the location of the operator across the intended area of travel.“Using Esmito’s platform at C-BEEV in IIT-Madras and several other locations, we have done several three-wheeler and two-wheeler pilots using the standard swapping platform. Esmito is now offering this solution as a SaaS platform for energy/fleet operators,” Kaur said.For example, the standards will involve vehicle identification number (VIN) and battery identification number (BIN) in specified formats that will help identify where the parts were produced, including if the batteries are lead acid, lithium ion or cobalt-based batteries, among others.“We need to still have standards on batteries, chargers, in all different segments and BIS is working on these,” she said.India has the potential to become one of the largest EV markets in the world, with the government pushing for the segment in order to curb pollution and reduce reliance on import-dependent fossil fuel, says a World Economic Forum report.The uptake of EVs has been slow in the country due to the high upfront as well as life cycle costs. But long-term investment in research and development (R&D) will create sustained growth.A step towards cheaper EVs is to sell the vehicles without batteries and allow the user to swap drained batteries with fully charged ones at dedicated charging stations.For example, if a conventional EV costs Rs 14 lakh, one without battery will cost only Rs 6.5 lakh and the user can drive into a charging station and swap the batteries in the time it takes to refuel a fossil fuel vehicle.",auto,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74136875,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-81536,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//auto/miscellaneous/electric-cars-likely-to-get-same-power-specs/articleshow/74127459.cms

KOLKATA: As the East-West Metro sets off on its commercial run from Friday, local transporters—buses, autos and even rickshaws—are keeping their fingers crossed. The new alignment, they claim, can help them remain “profitable and relevant,” provided the administration helps them become “the last-mile connecting medium”. Everything depends on whether they would be allowed near the new Metro stations or not.“Delhi Metro stations have several official auto and rickshaw stands around them. There is no reason why that model cannot be repeated here,” said Amit Dolui, an auto operator. As of now, auto operators have decided to keep some “flying” vehicles at four important points: Kadapara, Central Park in the morning, Sector V near Wipro building and City Centre. If the response is good, auto unions plan to set up permanent stands. The same applies for rickshaws, which have apparently promised police to operate on bylanes.“If you see the Metro alignment, not many residential blocks come directly in its path. It caters to the commercial hubs. At the same time, thousands of commuters are not likely to let go of the opportunity to use this Metro just because it’s a bit off their routes. We will become important in ferrying them to and from stations to the main roads and junctions,” said Tarit Das, an auto operator. “We stand to lose a few passengers who usually gets off on Bypass or visit City Centre, but we can gain from the higher number of people travelling from Phoolbagan to Bypass to take the Metro to Sector V.” Das has already shifted to the Karunamoyee-New Town route instead of his earlier route to Phoolbagan, as the former appears to be the “high-passenger” zone.Rickshaw-pullers are hoping for “ready passengers” to Metro stations. “The East-West Metro will benefit us. Everyone travelling within Salt Lake to their workplaces will try to use Metro as a more viable option when compared to an auto. To get to the stations from a short distance, they are likely to avail of rickshaws,” said Prabir Das, a rickshaw-puller.Initial estimates suggest that a large chunk of daily commuters, who earlier alighted at the existing Girish Park Metro station, might get off at MG Road station, take an auto to Kadapara, from where they will take the new Metro to Sector V or Karunamoyee. Similarly, those getting off on the Bypass for office or City Centre might opt for this Metro. A few commuters coming from extreme north and using Ultadanga as the transit point may also change their travel plans, provided the new Metro is viable and helps save commute time.Bus operators, however, said they did not expect too much change, given the “very short” distance of Metro operation, as of now. “But we are keeping an eye on the passenger behaviour, especially to Sector V, who might prefer to travel down to Bypass directly. Given that the East-West Metro work has begun yet again in Bowbazar, we might have to realign a few routes from Ultadanga and Chingrighata in near future. But as of now, we are expecting better footfall at the two Bypass stations,” said a member from the Joint Council of Bus Syndicate. Even several shuttle service operators are keeping an eye out for operations from Bypass.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74128317,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-297785,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/autos-rickshaws-hope-to-turn-into-last-mile-link-for-commuters/articleshow/74125282.cms

(File photo)

BENGALURU/NEW DELHI: The Competition Commission of India ( CCI ) slammed Amazon India in the Karnataka high court (HC) on Thursday, saying its arguments were “mischievous” and that it is not answerable to the Seattle-based technology major before it begins a probe.

CCI has also started its probe even as Amazon is fighting for an interim stay order on the same in the HC. Three sources aware of the matter said members of the Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh had gone to the CCI office on Thursday to make the first deposition in the matter. TOI has seen the CCI notice given to the Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh for this.

CCI’s comments in HC come after Amazon asked why the US e-tailer wasn’t informed about this probe that was announced on January 13. CCI’s advocate said Amazon’s “entitlement” has no legal ground and it is trying to create confusion about the matter being a foreign direct investment (FDI) law violation.

“The CCI is not questioning the source of money or the holding structure, it is probing what happens after the money comes to India and whether that’s anti-competitive,” the advocate said.

After the arguments by lawyers of both CCI and Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, Flipkart’s lawyer will make a case on the matter on Friday along with a legal representative of the Confederation of All India Traders ( CAIT ).

TOI had reported in its February 13 edition that Flipkart has been made a respondent to the petition, which was confirmed by the Walmart-owned Indian e-tailer. To be sure, Flipkart hasn’t made its stance on the matter official yet, but it will face a probe too if Amazon does not get an interim stay in the matter.

CCI’s legal representative also said the e-commerce study released by the regulator cannot be applied to this case as facts differ. CCI’s order to probe Amazon came days before Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos landed in India for a visit last month, where he announced a fresh $1-billion investment.

Right after Bezos’s announcement, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal kicked up a row saying Amazon wasn’t “doing any favour” to India by investing as it was to cover up losses, even questioning how a marketplace could lose so much money.

MUMBAI: The directors & officers’ (D&Os’) insurance policy, which compensates key management personnel of a company against legal actions, is seeing a surge in demand. The cover, which was earlier being purchased by businesses with a global exposure, is now being bought by companies with only domestic stakeholders as well.The trigger for the renewed demand for this cover has been the amendment to the Companies Act last year. Under this, the government can ask the National Company Law Tribunal to hold directors and key management personnel responsible without any limit to liability in the event of fraud .Besides this, there have been several actions by enforcement authorities against directors in recent times, particularly in the financial sector. Insurers say that the regulator’s action against directors of a large private bank have triggered claims under the policy. The regulatory action against IL&FS is also believed to have triggered a claim by the erstwhile management.“Another significant cause for a spike in claims has been in the employment practices coverage afforded to some large IT companies. Many of them have employees in the US, which is a highly litigious geography in this area and the industry has seen many claims coming from this exposure. It has an impact on the pricing of the policy,” said IFFCO Tokio General Insurance EVP (underwriting) Subrata Mondal.According to Praveen Vashista of Howden India Insurance Brokers , there has been a big surge in demand for D&O policies. “We are seeing lots of demand for D&O, which is part of the liabilities business. Because of increased demand, we have enhanced the size of our liability team and now have 55 people,” said Vashista. Insurers say that before joining, directors are asking companies whether they have a policy that will protect them from liability claims.According to Mondal, rates for D&O cover are firming up in sectors like finance, IT and real estate where the industry has seen a spike in regulatory action, financial downturn and consequent claims under D&O. “The claim payouts always start with defence costs and often involve out-of-court settlements. Given the length of the judicial process in many countries and long-tail nature of liability claims, the defence costs are high, and settlement is mostly out of court,” he said.D&O policies cover key officials against legal action from regulators, shareholders or employees. Besides covering the cost of legal fees for the defence, it also pays penalties. If there is a regulatory fine on an individual, which is civil in nature, the D&O cover will get triggered, provided coverage for civil fines and penalties have been granted. If the fine or penalty is criminal in nature or has criminal undertones, the policy will not cover it, but it will allow the insured to defend the imposition of the same.Promoters are also facing regulatory action because of the insolvency process during which violations come to light. The D&O cover can be extended for directors for past actions even after the board is dismissed, provided it has been purchased in advance.“When we underwrite a D&O policy, an important underwriting criterion is the financial health of the company. Most insurers generally frown upon granting a D&O to a company whose finances are distressed or already in the red. Higher claims activity will often see a higher demand for the insurance product from the industry,” said Mondal.",business,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74128986,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-63378,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/directors-feel-heat-seek-cover-against-legal-action/articleshow/74125532.cms

Kochi: Hinting at the need for having more open spaces in the city, Ernakulam MP Hibi Eden said that such places are a requirement for the well-being of both elderly people and youngsters. He said that all modern cities have public plazas where people can gather. He was addressing the gathering at Comfort Plaza in Jos Junction on Friday evening after launching an event to promote cycling. The event is part of the ‘Ease of living Initiatives’ launched by Kochi Metro Rail Ltd ( KMRL ).

Eden along with Ernakulam MLA T J Vinod cycled from MG Road Metro station to Comfort Plaza to promote public transport systems and non-motorized transport systems. “Promotion of public transport and rights of pedestrians should become a big movement. By extending Kochi Metro to Kakkanad, providing last mile connectivity and sufficient parking, KMRL aims to encourage people to use public transport systems,” he said.

The Ernakulam MP also encouraged people to vote in the ‘Ease for living’ contest, which will help to improve Kochi’s ranking. The contest is an indictor to the achievements in basic infrastructure development of the city.

Speaking at the event, Vinod said citizens should bring down the use of private cars. “It is the only way to reduce the number of vehicles operating in the city,” he said. “Buses, auto rickshaws and online taxi operators along with Kochi Metro provide a strong network of public transport system. The city is yet to tap the potential of public transport systems,” he said.

KVP Krishna Kumar, councillor representing Ernakulam South and actor Veena Nandakumar participated in the event to promote cycling along with KMRL. Music band Thekkan Chronicles performed at the plaza.

By organizing such events, KMRL is trying to convey the importance of road safety, usage of public transport, e-mobility, sustainable development and use of non-motorized transport to the public. The metro agency will introduce 1,000 cycles in the city. The cycles will be brought in various phases. With this aim, the metro agency will conduct an event every month at Comfort Plaza.

Chennai: Spurred by mega deals in government-driven education projects and corporates upgrading to Windows 10, personal computer shipments saw a 6-year high in 2019.

A report from global research firm the International Data Corporation shows that 2019 saw a year-on-year growth of 18.5% in the category with a total of 11 million shipments made during the period. The previous year saw 9.3 million units shipped. The October-December quarter saw a 16.5% YoY growth with a total of 2.3 million shipments. While the commercial segment brought volumes to the table, the consumer segment that saw a fall in 5 consecutive quarters grew 4.6% in the quarter, shipping around 9.5 lakh units, the report added.

“While large businesses were the volume driver, vendors invested in building new teams, exploring new channels, and educating the customers to tap the SMB segment,” says Bharath Shenoy, market analyst, PC, IDC India. Among categories, the gaming segment grew at 51.1% YoY. While most of the vendors increased their shipments in the gaming segment, Asus stood out as a leading vendor with one in every four notebooks shipped being a gaming one from the vendor in 2019. Notebook PCs too saw a growth.

Being thinner and lighter with enhanced mobility features, they are increasingly getting preference from the consumers, education sub verticals, and enterprises. The segment saw a 67.7% category share.

All top brands saw a growth in the number of shipments. For the whole year, Lenovo saw an 83% jump in growth to 3.5 million units in 2019.

HP India shipped 2.9 million units with a strong growth in the enterprise segment, the report added. “We have seen growth from all segments including retail, commercial and SMBs. We have seen improved consumer sentiment and that is reflected in overall growth numbers of PCs, said Vickram Bedi, senior director, personal systems, HP Inc. India.

56,['14/02/2020'],"EV makers come together, set up common standards","This story is from February 14, 2020

Chennai: In a bid to standardise the various parts of the electric vehicle (EV) ecosystem, several constituents, including original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), have come together to define standards. The move is primarily aimed at commercial vehicles that will ply with swappable batteries.

The OEMs — which include Mahindra & Mahindra, Lucas TVS, Okinawa, Kinetic, GEM, Ashok Leyland, Exicom, Amara Raja Batteries and Exide — are involved in preparation of these specifications. “We have coordinated this effort and did iterations in the documents based on feedback from all different stakeholders,” said Prabhjot Kaur, CEO of the Centre for Battery Engineering and EVs (C-BEEV). The centre comes under the department of electrical engineering at IIT-Madras. The project is spearheaded by professor Ashok Jhunjunwala.

“We don’t want to commit the mistakes of mobile handset companies that did not standardise chargers, etc, when it would have made sense. We will continue to work towards setting up more common standards for the industry,” Kaur

The standards are grouped under ‘Lock Smart - Vehicle Battery Charger Cloud Protocol (or LS-VBCC).

They will act as the cornerstone for EVs.

“The battery-swapping industry standard has been designed with a group coming from different segments — charger manufacturers, vehicle OEMs, battery manufacturers and other stakeholders,” Kaur said.

The protocol specifies the communication to be implemented between subsystems that need to interact with each other, be it battery and vehicle, battery and charger, battery and hand-held device or apps and server.

The purpose of the standard is to promote interoperability between energy operators, vehicles, batteries and chargers.

This would make it agnostic to the make & model of these subsystems for an operator to procure the components. It would also be a great benefit for users to acquire or exchange the batteries and gain from the lower capital expenditure and operating expenditure and be flexible on the location of the operator across the intended area of travel.

“Using Esmito’s platform at C-BEEV in IIT-Madras and several other locations, we have done several three-wheeler and two-wheeler pilots using the standard swapping platform. Esmito is now offering this solution as a SaaS platform for energy/fleet operators,” Kaur said.

For example, the standards will involve vehicle identification number (VIN) and battery identification number (BIN) in specified formats that will help identify where the parts were produced, including if the batteries are lead acid, lithium ion or cobalt-based batteries, among others.

“We need to still have standards on batteries, chargers, in all different segments and BIS is working on these,” she said.

India has the potential to become one of the largest EV markets in the world, with the government pushing for the segment in order to curb pollution and reduce reliance on import-dependent fossil fuel, says a World Economic Forum report.

The uptake of EVs has been slow in the country due to the high upfront as well as life cycle costs. But long-term investment in research and development (R&D) will create sustained growth.

A step towards cheaper EVs is to sell the vehicles without batteries and allow the user to swap drained batteries with fully charged ones at dedicated charging stations.

For example, if a conventional EV costs Rs 14 lakh, one without battery will cost only Rs 6.5 lakh and the user can drive into a charging station and swap the batteries in the time it takes to refuel a fossil fuel vehicle.

57,['14/02/2020'],Maharashtra govt to spend Rs 28 crore to revamp 28 mantri bungalows,"Uddhav Thackeray

Officials say not all state bungalows need repairs, but netas keen on revamp

MUMBAI: The Maha Vikas Aghadi government has earmarked Rs 28 crore for repairs and renovation of 28 bungalows allotted to ministers . Work has started on most of the bungalows and in some cases is almost complete. Each of four of the top five bungalows on the list (in order of expense) had, according to a 2016 CAG report , incurred a maintenance charge of over Rs 2.5 crore during 2010-15.Royal Stone in Malabar Hill, allotted to revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat, will incur the highest expenditure, Rs 2.3 crore. The amount has been distributed over two tenders—Rs 1.8 crore for renovation of the main bungalow, and Rs 44 lakh for guest room extension and renovation.The second highest expenditure, Rs 1.5 crore, is being incurred on the renovation of deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar’s Deogiri bungalow, which like many of the bungalows on the list is at or near Malabar Hill. Pawar occupied Deogiri for 15 years during the three successive Congress-NCP governments from 1999 to 2014. The bungalow’s renovation plan includes plastering, terrace waterproofing, fixing of new doors and windows, new flooring, toilet block repairs, and new furniture. On the third to fifth spots are the Ramtek, Satpuda and Jetwan bungalows.Though down on the expenditure list, two bungalows are prominent for their occupants: Sagar bungalow, allotted to leader of the opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis, which is being renovated for Rs 92.7 lakh, and the relatively modest bungalow A-6, allotted to tourism and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, on which the government is spending Rs 74 lakh.The work is being carried out under the public works department (PWD), which maintains government buildings.Senior government officials say some of the bungalows indeed need renovation as they are either sea-facing heritage buildings prone to corrosion or are old-style wooden structures prone to leakage, but the others don’t need any major work to merit a high expenditure. “Repair and renovation in some cases is just unnecessary,” said an official. “Some ministers follow Vastu seriously and ask to change the direction of their office or kitchen or bedroom. Some ministers don’t like furniture placed by their bungalows’ previous occupants and put in demands for changing them.”Extensive changes are not only being carried out at ministers’ bungalows, but also their offices in Mantralaya. A 2016 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had flagged off “huge and unnecessary expenses” incurred by the state on renovation and maintenance of government bungalows. The CAG report said that during 2010-15, Rs 52 crore had been spent on ministers’ bungalows. The distribution for each was six to 20 times above prescribed norms, the report said, adding that in some cases, new bungalows could have been constructed for less than the renovation amounts. During the period under CAG’s consideration, the highest “maintenance and repair” expenditure was incurred on Puratan (Rs 3.5 crore), followed by Meghdoot (Rs 3.3 crore), Parnakuty (Rs 3.2 crore), Satpuda (Rs 3 crore), Sewasadan (Rs 3.1 crore), Chitrakut (Rs 2.5 crore), Ramtek (Rs 2.7 crore), Jetwan (Rs 2.77 crore) and Deogiri (Rs 2.5 crore).“The government is amidst a financial crisis, and yet they are making such wasteful expenditure. It is time ministers treated official bungalows as government accommodation and not holiday homes,” said Anjali Patil, an Aurangabad activist who works for the welfare of farm widows.A civil contractor who works with PWD said, “In many cases, tiles that were in a good condition were replaced and even doors that were fine were replaced.”Though low on the expenditure list, two bungalows are prominent for their occupants: Sagar bungalow, allotted to leader of the opposition in the state assembly Devendra Fadnavis, which is being renovated for Rs 92.7 lakh, and the relatively modest bungalow A-6, allotted to tourism and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, on which the government is spending Rs 74 lakh.

India is a largely small car market and these vehicles find a market in emerging countries in Africa and Latin America for example,” said R C Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki That Africa-and-Latin America focus is true for both car as well two wheeler shipments. Take Nissan for e.g. which has been focusing on newer markets to grow its exports. “In the case of Nissan we have been able to explore newer opportunities in markets like South Africa for our exports. Exports have been doing well because of newer markets for existing products as well as a better and newer product pipeline. Globally some markets in Africa, Middle East and South East Asia are doing very well and we have been able to capitalize on such opportunities specially with our GO and GO + and Sunny models,” said Rakesh Srivastava , MD, Nissan Motor India.Same is true for Hero Motocorp which has been pushing its presence in Latin America. “The bulk of the growth in two-wheeler exports over the past 10 months has come from the Africa market. Some of the key markets in Latin America have also seen growth during the same period. We expect the trend to continue for the rest of the months in this fiscal,” said Rajat Bhargava , head of global business at Hero MotoCorp. Consultants say the export game not only uses up capacity but also offers companies some margin comfort in a lean year. “When domestic sales are down, exports is a better margin business on the balance sheet.

Nand Kishore Yadav

PATNA: State road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav said on Thursday that construction work on a new bridge parallel to Mahatma Gandhi Setu in Patna will start this year.

Chairing a meeting to review the ongoing national highways projects in Bihar, he said bids have been submitted by seven firms for construction of the new bridge. “The bidding process is likely to be completed by the end of this month. We are expecting the work to commence this year itself,” Nand Kishore told TOI.

The total length of the new bridge from Zero Miles in Patna to Ramashish Chowk in Hajipur is 14.5 kilometres. However, the length of superstructure of the bridge, excluding the approach road, is 5.63km.

The bridge over river Ganga is proposed to be constructed by utilizing funds to the tune of Rs2,900 crore over a period of 48 months. It is a part of PM Narendra Modi’s special package for Bihar, which he had announced prior to state assembly elections in 2015.

The minister reviewed the progress of Patna ring road, another component of the PM’s special package. “The DPR for a four-lane bridge over the Ganga along Patna under the ring road project is ready and officials of National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) have been asked to commence the bidding process for the same,” he said.

The proposed alignment of the 65km-long Patna ring road is Bihta-Naubatpur-Dumri- Daniyawa-Kachchi Dargah-Bidupur- Hajipur-Sonepur-Digha-Bihta. “The work on ring road project is being taken in different segments for which DPR has been prepared and bidding process will commence soon,” Nand Kishore said.

The minister also claimed that officials concerned have been asked to get the approval for commencing construction of a new bridge parallel to Vikramshila Setu on river Ganga in Bhagalpur. “The work on the bridge parallel to Vikramshila Setu is also targeted to commence this year,” he said.

Sources said the length of the new bridge will be 4.367km, while that of its approach road will be 0.969km from Bhagalpur-end and 8.964km from Naugachia side. It is proposed to be constructed utilizing funds to the tune of Rs1726 crore.

The RCD minister also said bids have been received for reconstruction of much-delayed Patna-Gaya-Dobhi NH-83 in three phases.

61,['14/02/2020'],Patna University may sign MoU with IIPS to study Bihar’s demography,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Patna University

PATNA: The Population Research Centre (PRC) of Patna University (PU) is likely to sign an MoU with the International Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, for undertaking collaborative studies on demography. A proposal to this effect was advanced by PU vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh while addressing a three-day national seminar on ‘Population, health and sustainable development goals: performance and prioritizing policies’ jointly organized by IIPS and PU at Wheeler Senate House here on Thursday.

Singh said population issues assume greater significance to the modern societal development as the demography is likely to set the destiny of the 21st century India. Ever-increasing population along with the rising greed of human beings is creating imbalances in nature. Consequently, nature has started reacting adversely. We have already started facing the vagaries of nature in the shape of global warming, climate change, sea level rise, droughts and floods, he said.

Inaugurating the seminar, state education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said population explosion is proving to be the biggest bottleneck in way of national development and pleaded for effective steps to check its exponential growth. He said that even though Bihar was considered to be an educationally backward state, the Nitish government has, of late, initiated several steps to improve the literacy rate and bring back the dropouts to schools. Incentives were being provided to unmarried girls who pass Intermediate or graduation examination.

The minister said it has been observed that late marriage by educated boys and girls leads to family welfare and population control. The minister released the fact sheet of IIPS-sponsored project on ‘Cause and consequences of out migration from middle Ganga plain’.

IIPS director K S James said the seminar would discuss among other issues the migration of people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and find ways to stop this ever-increasing problem. The seminar would also have a special session on health and environment wherein the experts would discuss in detail the effects of deteriorating environment on human health.

PU pro-VC Dolly Sinha said India’s economy is heavily burdened with the mounting pressure of population explosion and no positive development is possible without have a check on population growth. It is a paradox that even though our country accounts for only 2.4% of the world’s surface area, it has to support world’s 17.5% population, she added.

Seminar coordinator D A Nagadeva presented the details of technical sessions to be held in three days. PRC joint director Dilip Kumar proposed a vote of thanks.

62,['14/02/2020'],"Futab writes to I-T dept, clarifies on PF deductions in colleges and universities","This story is from February 14, 2020

PATNA: The reported dispute over the validity of Provident Fund accounts of universities and colleges, as raised recently by the Income Tax department, is likely to be resolved soon.

In a rejoinder to the letter of I-T department, the Federation of University Teachers Associations of Bihar (Futab) on Thursday submitted that the teachers and non-teaching staff of universities and colleges are governed by two Acts — Patna University Act, 1976 and Bihar State Universities Act, 1976 — and almost common service statutes, including the retirement benefit statute.

Referring to the demand for the government gazette notification, Futab working president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar Singh, MLC, said these provisions are in operation since 1960 with amendment in 1976 and certain changes thereafter. They further said as the grants are released to the universities from the consolidated fund of the state government, the PF contributions are from these funds only.

They urged the I-T authorities to procure a copy of the Manual of University Laws for referring to all these issues concerning PF, etc as that is also relied upon by the Patna high court and the Supreme Court.

Earlier, a letter from the I-T department to colleges had refused to entertain the PF deductions being made for teachers and non-teaching staff and disallowed any relief under Section 80C of the I-T Act, 1960. It had also disallowed any claim made by the university and college staff under Section 10 of the I-T Act on the interest earned on PF.

The letter created a flutter in the academic circles which has been enjoying this benefit for the last several decades.

Under the existing practice, the college opens a separate joint savings bank account of each employee with the head of the institution, where 10% of the employee’s salary and 10% of the employer’s contribution are deposited as PF contributions. The interest earned on the savings bank account is earned by the respective employee for the said PF deposit.

Futab leaders had written to the I-T authorities that there was nothing wrong with the PF deductions in colleges and universities, as all these accounts were with nationalized banks and have been declared equivalent to government PF accounts as per the provisions of university Acts and statutes.

63,['14/02/2020'],Radio waves continue to woo city residents,"This story is from February 14, 2020

PATNA: As the UN-designated World Radio Day was celebrated globally on Thursday, Patna affirmed its faith on the good old radio, which has not faded away even in the age of internet, television and artificial intelligence-based Alexa.

The waves are now alive with a different kind of sound that the young generation can identify with. Youngsters in the city claimed that they mostly listen to new FM channels, while middle-aged and senior citizens expressed their love for Vividh Bharti and other traditional radio channels.

Old-timers in the city mourned the end of a service that had become almost a habit over the decades. “I was an avid listener of BBC Hindi radio for over 50 years. Its sudden shut has left me disappointed,” said 65-year-old Manorma Devi, a resident of Saguna Mor.

Seema Roy, a professor of media education at a private college, said, radio connects people in a way other media cannot. “New radio stations may be liked by youngsters, but for me the old channels will remain evergreen. They are so soothing that I go back to the old times,” she added.

A large section of youngsters, on the other hand, claimed they aren't much interested in listening to traditional radio anymore. “Radio is out of style now. From news to songs and comedy shows to movies, almost everything is visually available on television and mobile phones,” said Komal Sharma, a resident of Danapur.

Saguna More resident Amit Kumar said, “When I was growing up, I used to listen to Vividh Bharti and several other radio channels. However, after a certain point of time the programmes and songs became quite boring for me.”

Experts on the other hand, claimed that radio continues to be reach more audience than social media and other modes of mass media. “As per a survey conducted by a private agency in 2018, around 86% of people in metro cities listened to radio, while 83% preferred social media,” said an executive at a private radio FM channel in the city wishing anonymity.

Officials at Akashvani, Patna, said the number of their listeners has remained largely unaffected despite the advent of new technologies. “Radio services like Akashvani and Vividh Bharti understand the needs of the audience unlike the new stations, who are more into marketing and publicity.

Rajkot: Krantiguru Shyamji Krishna Varma Kutch University is on a Mars Mission of its own. In association of many institutes of higher learning, including renowned universities across the world that have links with NASA, the Kutch University is undertaking various research on the red planet.

The varsity got this out-of-the-universe chance, thanks to the scientists who discovered similarities in soil, rocks and mountains of Kutch with that of Mars.

A team of Canada’s University of New Brunswick’s earth science department, under the leadership of Prof John Spray, visited the Kutch University recently. Spray, who had developed the Apex particle that had been fitted on NASA’s Mars rover, was working for NASA’s Jet propulsion laboratory.

Spray’s instrument was used to capture images of Martian soil and rocks and also analyze its chemical formation on the spot.

Talking to TOI, professor M G Thakkar, HoD, earth and environmental science in Kutch University said: “The students of our department will benefit in the future from the research done by NASA and it’s associate institutes in various countries about Mars. Based on the satellite images, we believe that the same kind of soil and rocks exist on Mars too which will prove useful for analysis.”

According to the varsity, the students get assignments to find out sites in Kutch that are topographically similar to that of Mars and thereafter do geological analysis of its geological components. According to the scientists, sites like the Great Rann of Kutch are similar to Mars. They are also studying the salinity of these sites in comparison with Mars.

A few other universities which are part of the research project, have also visited Kutch University in the last few years.

The varsity has also got a project of ISRO to do research on NASA’s geography.

Elaborating on it, Thakkar said, “A student of our department is researching on the ISRO project that includes geographical research of Mars-like sites in Kutch.”

The study includes similar river system, gorges, mountains, volcanic mountains among others. ISRO is providing us satellite images for this study, he added.

Bengaluru: Uber India aims to start its own advertising and branding wing, so that it can better monetise users and show them ads. Uber’s move parallels that of e-tailers Amazon and Flipkart, which have started monetising their web traffic through digital advertising.

To start its own advertising line, Uber India’s board met on January 29 in Noida and passed a resolution to the same effect. Uber India said in filings, sourced by Paper.vc , that it intends to have an omni-channel approach and advertise through electronic display boards in cabs, the internet, television and other means.

“Currently advertising opportunities are being offered only on cars,’’ said an Uber spokesperson. “Uber India is set to become yet another marketplace for media buying and selling as the ride-hailing company opens itself and its collaterals up to advertising. The Uber app and other digital properties owned by Uber could be monetised for marketing activities, since the brand has a significant digital footprint,” said Paper.vc analyst Nikhil Kanekal.

MUMBAI: Care Ratings chairman S B Mainak has stepped down after the markets regulator sought his removal.

The rating agency in a stock exchange filing said Mainak, independent director of the company, resigned with effect from February 11 due to personal reasons. On Wednesday, ET had reported that Sebi had asked Care Ratings in a letter to sack chairman Mainak after a forensic report said he asked staff to hold back ratings.

The rating agency’s share price fell nearly 7% to Rs 543 on Thursday. The Sebi investigation is understood to have been undertaken following complaints by a whistleblower. The complaint and the subsequent investigation is understood to have gone beyond IL&FS and covered other rating actions.

Mainak was inducted on to the board of the company and elected chairman when he was still managing director of LIC in August 2015. LIC is also the single largest shareholder in CARE Ratings. He was part of the government-appointed board for restructuring of Satyam.

In December 2019, Sebi had slapped a penalty of Rs 25 lakh each on Care Ratings, ICRA and India Ratings for “lethargic indifference and needless procrastination and laxity.” Subsequently, the rating agencies informed the stock exchange they had received show-cause notices from the regulator seeking reasons why the penalty should not be enhanced.

KOLKATA: The East-West Metro will run the entire 16.6km stretch from Sector V to Howrah Maidan in two years, said Railway minister Piyush Goyal after flagging off the first train for the truncated 5km section on Thursday. Another 1km will be added in three-four months when services get extended to Phoolbagan. The commercial services on the new line will begin at 8am on Valentine’s Day. Keeping the occasion in mind, Metro officials, led by principal chief operations manager (PCOM) Satyaki Nath, will distribute rose buds to the first 50 commuters. The passenger count, however, is likely to be in the thousands.Salt Lake residents were excited to finally be on the Metro map and some managed to take the inaugural ride on Thursday. Over the next few days, rail officials expect a decent turnout. The commuter count, though, will reach its full potential only when the entire line becomes operational. That, Goyal said, would happen in two years.“I think we can start the Howrah end in two years. If we get local support, the entire 16km line can be dedicated to Kolkata’s service. Babul Supriyo has inspected the tunnel under the river and I am authorizing him to review the project on my behalf. He and Metro GM Manoj Joshi will review the project every month and we shall drive it ahead with full vigour,” he said.The minister also spoke on how crucial the state’s cooperation was to expedite the four other Metro lines that are under construction. “I have been handed a huge list of bottlenecks, land logjams and issues with the state coming in the way of these projects. I hope we get full cooperation from the state in completing the other Metro projects,” he said.Mayor Firhad Hakim said the state had always extended help in resolving land issues related to Metro with chief minister Mamata Banerjee stepping in to fast-track the projects she had initiated as Railway minister a decade ago.Aprita Bhuniya was one of the few who hopped on for the inaugural ride. “For now, it will be a fun ride. But I’m glad the services are starting,” she said.KMRC MD Manas Sarkar believes this Metro line, when fully operational, will change the lives of lakhs. “Some 36 years after the country’s first Metro line, Kolkata has got the second one.

PATNA: Enraged over his elder sister’s intercaste marriage, a 20-year-old youth shot dead his two-year-old niece and critically injured his sister in Kaimur district on Wednesday evening.

The victim, Santoshi Devi (22), is battling for her life in a trauma centre in Varanasi. The assailant, Chakra Sen, a resident of Madurna village under the Chainpur police station area in Kaimur district, is absconding after the incident.

The incident took place around 5.30 pm at Okhra Chowk under the Chainpur police station area when Santoshi along with her minor daughter was returning home from Chainpur market. Chakra accosted his sister and fired at her. The bullet hit the minor girl who died on the spot. Chakra then pumped a bullet into Santoshi’s body and fled the spot on his motorbike. “The assailant left the site of occurrence in a huff thinking that she might have died,” Chainpur police station SHO Santosh Kumar told this newspaper on Thursday.

The injured was rushed to the local primary health centre from where she was referred to Varanasi, where her condition is stated to be critical. “She is undergoing treatment at a trauma centre. We are trying our level-best to save her life,” the SHO said adding that the accused is at large.

In her statement, Santoshi said that her younger brother was not happy with her marriage to Birju Kushwaha, who is from a different caste. “He had earlier threatened me with dire consequences. My husband is a resident of the same village, which I belong,” the SHO quoted the survivor as saying.

Santoshi, who owns a beauty parlour at Chainpur Bazaar, used to return home after closing her shop everyday. “On finding her alone at a deserted place, Chakra fired at her causing grievous injuries and killing her minor daughter. While the girl died on the spot, her mother is struggling for her life in the hospital,” the SHO added.

Earlier, Kaimur SP Dilnawaz Ahmad said raids have been intensified to arrest the accused.

PATNA: RJD seems to have started playing its caste card before the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar . Incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Thursday asked his party functionaries to break their image of a party associated with ‘Muslims and Yadavs’ and focus on other castes as well.

He was addressing the newly elected state executive members at 10, Circular Road bungalow. In a first, RJD introduced 27% quota for extremely backward caste candidates (EBCs) and 18% for the Dalits in the selection of district presidents and state executive members. Political observers claimed that such moves can be seen as a tactics to woo Dalit and EBC voters from the ruling NDA.

“Our image has been made as if we are party of only Muslims and Yadavs. But Tejashwi ji has asked to break this stereotype and tell people that we are party of A to Z and not M-Y,” said an RJD functionary.

Tejashwi was also particular about his party members’ behaviour in public and cautioned them to be disciplined and respect each other.

Total 22 vice-presidents, 102 general secretaries, 75 secretaries, one treasurer and one secretary general have recently been inducted in the state executive committee of RJD. Party’s spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari, after attending the meeting, said: “Our team headed by Tejashwi ji is ready. We have been given the responsibility and will start the work at booth level.”

While the meeting was going on for around four hours, many old RJD functionaries were creating ruckus outside the venue for not been inducting them into the new team.

One such functionary, Arun Kumar Purbey from Madhubani said: “We have not got any place, even though we are associated with RJD since the beginning.”

Ajay Chopra said he was dedicated to the party, still he was not called for the meeting. “Even today, I am not being allowed to enter inside,” he said.

Sources said to avoid any embarrassment, newly elected members were informed personally about their selection on Thursday night. However, party state general secretary Chirtanjan Gagan said: “RJD is a big party and when new people are given chance, old ones will definitely be upset. But still many of the old functionaries will be included in different cells of the party.”

Dipak Kumar in the first East-West Metro rake that made the 5km run

KOLKATA: The first East-West Metro train that rolled out of the Sector V station at 5.10pm on Thursday was driven by 32-year-old Dipak Kumar — a resident of Lakkhisarai in Bihar — who has been a mortorman for more than a decade. He helmed a rake along the full 5km stretch from Sector V to Salt Lake stadium, while railway minister Piyush Goyal followed in another rake.

“I am proud to be a part of this landmark journey,” Kumar said at the end of the ride.

In May 2018, Kumar, along with four others, were taken out of the North-South services and inducted into a training programme for the East-West Metro. The team went through extensive training — organized by the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation and the Hyderabad Metro Rail Corporation — to get acquainted with the new BEML trains. Along with S A Ansari — also from Kolkata — Kumar emerged as one of the best.

For Thursday’s inauguration, two rakes were kept ready. Kumar started the day at 6.19pm by driving the inaugural rake from the Central Park depot to the Sector V station, where it was flagged off by Goyal. His colleague Ansari drove the second rake that carried Goyal till the City Centre station. “My parents were anxiously waiting for this day. They know that I am among the first batch of drivers who will run the East-West Metro rakes. They are proud and excited,” Kumar told TOI.

East-West Metro trains run on a communication-based train control and signalling system. The latter has no posts or fixed blocks. The running trains pick up signals from the tracks, which open for a train only after the earlier train has moved. If the tracks ahead are clogged, the train will automatically come to a halt.

Trains on the North-South route run on a protection and warning system that makes them stop only if the signal is red.

MALAPPURAM: Kottakkal police on Thursday seized Rs 3.25 crore of unaccounted money from an autorickshaw and arrested two members of a quotation gang. The money was recovered after the auto overturned while a quotation gang was attempting to loot the hawala money transported in the vehicle at Valiyaparamba.

The arrested were identified as Shafeeq, 20, and Ismail, 26, natives of Ottumpuram near Tanur in Malappuram district. The search for the auto driver is on.

According to police, the incident occurred around 8am on Thursday. The hawala money was being transported from Perinthalmanna to Kottakkal in an autorickshaw. The quotation gang in a car waylaid the auto at Padapparambu near Kottakal and bundled off the auto driver into the car. Two of the gang members took over the control of the auto, the rest drove away with the car.

After a short distance, the speeding auto overturned at Valiyaparamba. Local residents noticed the cash kept in a hidden chamber under the rear seat of the overturned autorickshaw and informed police.

C Yusuf, circle inspector of Kottakkal police, said the gang might have had links with those transporting hawala money. The gang had a credible piece of information regarding the transportation of money and conspired to loot the money after abducting the auto driver. “The accused who have been arrested and those who transported money in the auto are members of hawala money-distribution rackets which are active in the district. We have started a detailed investigation on the source of such a huge amount of money and the role of the similar financial dealings of the gang,” the inspector said.

The government is planning ‘Namaste Orchha’ to attract touruists in the holy city.

BHOPAL: As the state government develops Orchha — famous for its Ram Raja temple — into a big religious and heritage destination, a Congress minister on Wednesday said the BJP government “ignored” the city of Ram and His legend for 15 years.

With barely one month left for ‘Namaste Orchha’, an event planed by the government to attract people in the holy city situated on the banks of river Betwa, commercial tax minister Brijendra Singh Rathore inaugurated development projects and criticised the erstwhile BJP government.

Rathore, who is also the Prithvipur MLA, said BJP indulges in “double talk and duplicity”. He said BJP on one hand plays politics using the name of Lord Ram but when it comes to serving the God, it ignores Him.

BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agrawal said, “Our party had worked a lot on the tourist centres of Bundelkhand, including Orchha, making MP a tourist hub. I will ask the government to carry forward these works and not indulge in politics.”

“Look at the works done by our government in the past one year”, Rathore said, highlighting the state of the road and renovation of temples among others.

The minister performed ‘bhumi pujan’ for the construction of a road worth Rs8 crore in Orchha.

Besides its ambitious Ram Van Gaman Path project to push its soft Hindutva agenda, the Kamal Nath government plans to turn Orchha into a major tourist destination.

The government will start Betwa Aarti — on the lines of the famous Ganga Aarti in Varanasi — and develop the Ram Raja temple as well.

Situated in Niwari district, temple town Orchha is about 320 kilometres from Bhopal and is known as the ‘second Ayodhya’. A guard of honour is accorded every day to the deity by police personnel deputed at the temple for this one-of-a-kind ritual. The legend in Orchha is that Lord Ram comes here in the morning and goes back to Ayodhya at night.

Chief secretary S R Mohanty visited Orchha twice recently and reviewed plans for its development.

The DM referred to unprecedented rainfall last year and told PMC to enhance the capacity of existing drains by clearing and repairing them properly. When PMC commissioner Amit Kumar Pandey said the civic body was constructing additional 73 drains to avoid waterlogging in the city, Ravi asked him to get those ready by May-end.

BUIDCO managing director Chandrashekhar Singh said they were procuring 12 additional diesel pumps to be used in the DPS. Presently there are 39 DPS with 134 functional pumps with total capacity of 22,135hp. Chandrashakhar further said a consultant will be roped in to prepare drainage plan of areas falling in the PMC, Phulwarisharif, Danapur and Khagaul areas.

Ravi asked the managing director of Patna Electricity Supply Undertaking to ensure dedicated transformer at all the DPSs by February-end. The high-level committee formed by the government previous year to review the then waterlogging issue had advised for uninterrupted power supply at DPSs and better voltage.

It was also discussed to prepare a detailed project report of renovation of the 3km-long drain from Danapur Sainik Colony to Ghurdaur Road. It has been found that half the drain has been encroached by road and the rest half has not been cleared. The new DPR will be made in such a way that it connects this drain with another reinforced cement concrete (RCC) drain in Danapur.

Ravi said magistrates will inspect the work done in May and action will be taken against those who do not carry out their duty properly.

PATNA: Speculations continue over the role of poll strategist Prashant Kishor in the upcoming assembly elections in Bihar, following the success of his poll management firm I-PAC in New Delhi elections.

Kishor’s political advocacy group I- PAC, which handled Narendra Modi’s campaign in 2014 Lok Sabha elections and Nitish Kumar’s candidature while working for Grand Alliance in Bihar in 2015 assembly elections, has a fully-functional office in Patna. He is scheduled to arrive here on February 18, a day after formation of Kejriwal government in New Delhi for the third term.

While Congress and RJD functionaries have claimed they are not in talks with Kishor, who was recently expelled from the JD (U), Vikassheel Insan Party (VIP) founder Mukesh Sahni said, “Most of the opposition parties in Bihar are in contact with Kishor.”

“Kishor and Mahagathbandhan, both have a common aim that is to defeat the NDA. Whether it is Tejashwiji, Kushwahaji, Manjhiji or I, we all are talking to him. A blue print is being prepared and it depends on Kishor whether he will join any of the GA parties, AAP or float his own party or manage our election campaign,” Sahni said.

When asked whether Kishor will be helping Congress in Bihar for the upcoming assembly election or will join the party, state Congress incharge Shaktisingh Gohil said on Wednesday: “Till date there has been no discussion in this regard. However, our party is open to all and we welcome each and every one.”

Similar views were expressed by Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Wednesday. “Why should we talk about any particular person? There are hundreds such agencies. Moreover, we do not hire professionals,” he told reporters.

However, just a couple of week ago, Tej Pratap welcomed Kishor, who was expelled from JD (U) on January 29.

Kiran Bedi

PUDUCHERRY: Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi said she was not surprised at the outburst of chief minister V Narayanasamy , his cabinet colleagues and MLAs against her during the special session of the legislative assembly.

Stating that it’s a daily challenge to keep the government machinery on the track of financial prudence Bedi said relaxing the laws, rules and regulations may be easy and will get many friends but will be harmful in the long run.

“All that can be said is that it is a daily challenge here to keep Puducherry government running on the track of financial prudence, due diligence and maintaining and enforcing rule of law. (preventing debt traps, rowdyism, land grabs, indecisions in loss-making PSUs and registrar-run coop societies in violation of the laws and rules, and more). Relaxing these is easy and shall get us many more friends (sic). But very harmful in the long run. It may have short-term gains but will bear legal consequences later for successors to bear with,” she said in a WhatsApp post.

She warned that public servants will be held responsible for violation of laws, rules and regulations and objections raised during financial audit even after their assignments or retire as they draw pension from the government.

“Civil service officers are appointed for ensuring professional rule-based advice and accountability, as they are in long-term service of the country. Appointed administrators (like me) are not here for easy ways out and narrow interests. But for largest good while abiding by due process and functioning with accessibility and transparency. However, civility in utterances and correctness in facts publicly stated by those occupying public space would help in making Puducherry citizens more aware and participative to correct serious deficiencies being encountered,” she said.

Varanasi: One of the members of the newly formed Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust, Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati said that the Ram Temple in Ayodhya would be built as per the model approved by the Trust only, though, he wished that the temple is built as per the model of Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas .

“In my opinion the temple should be built as per the model presented by Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas which travelled across the country. And people have donated Rs 8.25 crore for it,” said the seer while talking to reporters here on Thursday. He said that the stone work worth Rs 30 crore has been completed, and the work is still in progress.

“However, I don’t know what type of model has been presented by the Ramalaya Nyas,” he said on being asked about his view on the model of Ramalaya Trust headed by the Shankaracharya Swami Swaroopanad Saraswati.

On the opposition of the Trust by Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati, he said, “Sawmi is elderly and disciple of my peeth, hence I would not counter him. But the Trust has been formed by the government on the direction of Supreme Court.”

Just after the formation of the Trust, the Ramalaya Nyas secretary Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati announced that the Nyas would move court to challenge it alleging that the Central government did not follow the directive of the Supreme Court in true spirit in forming the trust. The Supreme Court had directed the Central government to formulate a scheme, not a trust for the construction of Ram temple, said the seer. He had also objected to the inclusion of Swami Vasudevanand as the Shankaracharya of Jyotishpeeth in the Trust.

88,['14/02/2020'],"227 killed in 2,368 road accidents on Agra-Lko eway in 20 months","This story is from February 14, 2020

Agra: In 20 months between August 2017 and March 2019, a total of 227 people lost their lives in 2,368 road accidents on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway, an RTI reply revealed recently.

Krishan Chand Jain, the lawyer who filed the query, said, “Among the prime reasons behind the number of accidents on the expressway, were overspeeding, unauthorised parking on road side, stationary vehicles in middle of road for longer time or delay in arrival of crane and rescue to remove the vehicle from road and others.”

Sirsaganj circle officer Iraj Raja, under whose jurisdiction the Wednesday’s horrific road accident occurred, killing 14 people, said, “The private bus was moving at over 100kmph. The speed limit for heavy vehicles is 80 kmph. Since the bus was overspeeding, we suspect the driver couldn’t control his vehicle when he saw a stationary truck on the extreme right lane. Only the left lane is allotted for heavy commercial vehicles. Both the drivers of the truck and bus were at fault.”

Following the accident, additional director general (Agra zone) Ajay Anand has written a letter to the Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) authorities urging them to ban the entry of commercial vehicles without reflective tapes or blinkers.

He said, “We have also asked the authorities to revise their patrolling measures to ensure that no vehicle is stationary on the expressway. Further, I have also asked them to emphasis on response time and better coordination among dial 112 team and UPEIDA patrolling team.”

Meanwhile, Agra-Lucknow Expressway security head Jagdish Singh said, “Our initial probe suggested that the truck driver was changing a flat tyre in the extreme right lane. It’s not clear whether the bus driver had spotted the reflective tapes of the truck or not. However, both the vehicles should not have been driving on the extreme right lane of the expressway.”

K P Singh, the private concessionaire for the Expressway, said, “We don’t allow commercial vehicles without proper blinkers or reflective tapes on them, as traveling at night without precautionary measures is dangerous. But we will comply with the recommendations of ADG.”

The 302 km six-lane expressway inaugurated on November 21, 2016 by then UP CM Akhilesh Yadav is the longest expressway in India.

Agra: Fourteen people were killed and 31 passengers were injured, many of them seriously, after a private bus hit a stationary truck on Agra-Lucknow Expressway late on Wednesday night.

Firozabad superintendent of police (rural) Rajesh Kumar said the accident took place around 10 pm in the Nagla Khanagar police station area when the double-decker bus carrying 61 passengers from Delhi to Motihari, in north Bihar, crashed into the stationary truck from behind.

The injured were rushed to Saifai medical college. Drivers of both the heavy vehicles, which were in the wrong late, were killed on the spot.

Jagdish Singh, chief security officer of Agra-Lucknow Expressway, Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), said, “The driver of the truck halted the vehicle on the extreme right lane of the expressway to change a flat tyre. The bus, which is registered with Gorakhpur RTO and was coming from the national capital, hit the truck from behind.”

“The impact of the accident was so severe that the bus was crushed to half its length,” said inspector general of police (Agra range) Satish Ganesh.

“It took us over three hours to evacuate the injured and retrieve bodies from the mangled bus. The victims were hanging from the window in an unconscious state,” said a team member of UPEIDA’s patrol party.

According to the district administration, most of the dead hailed from Bihar and Delhi. The deceased were identified as Mukesh Kumar (26), Vinod Kumar (25), Kalimuddin (45), Bhagwan Chaubey (54), Harender (44), Chandan Mahto (24), Nageshwar Shah (42), Gulshan (21), Anil Shah (50), Rakesh Kumar (35), Raghuvansh Yadav (30), Ishtiaq (30), Zafarullah Haq and truck driver Bhura Khan (45), who hailed from Nighaniya Rampur village of Allahabad district.

Sirsaganj circle officer Iraj Raja said, “Our preliminary investigation suggests both the truck and bus drivers were at fault. The truck driver had halted his truck with a deflated tyre in the extreme lane, while the bus driver was probably overspeeding in the same lane. Both the drivers, who were killed on the spot, should have used the extreme left lane dedicated to only heavy and slow-moving vehicles.”

He said, “An FIR is yet to be lodged.”

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed district officials to ensure proper treatment of the injured while Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased and wished the injured a speedy recovery.

“The road accident on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway in Uttar Pradesh has caused deep grief. Many passengers have lost their lives ... My condolences to the families of the victims in this hour of grief. I wish those injured recovers soon,” the Prime Minister's Office said in a tweet quoting Modi.

90,['14/02/2020'],Ambedkar bridge to be closed for 15 days for repair,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Agra: Ambedkar bridge will be closed for 15 days for repair work. Much to the relief of the citizens, the Uttar Pradesh State Bridge Corporation Limited (UPSBCL) has finally taken cognizance of the poor condition of the bridge which is across the river Yamuna. In this regard, UPSBCL has sought permission from the police and district administration. The date to start the repair work is yet to be finalised.

According to sources, closing of the bridge is likely to cause traffic jam at Rambagh and waterworks crossing. In the past one year, the Ambedkar bridge suffered major damages. Locals alleged that it was a result of poor quality repair and maintenance work.

Potholes spanning several feet can be seen on the bridge that witnesses heavy traffic throughout the day. There is also a gap, around 8cm in width, which has developed between the joints of the bridge. The rods and steel framework of the bridge is exposed at several places where the concrete has fallen off.

Local resident Ramesh Kushwah said, “The bridge is in poor condition and needs urgent repairing. The 10-year-old bridge has been repaired several times earlier, but quality of the work has always been sub-standard.”

Heavy vehicles are prohibited on the bridge between 6am to 9pm. Locals, however, claim that overloaded trucks are allowed to pass through it and that too during the no-entry period by traffic police allegedly after taking bribe.

The bridge was built during BSP chief Mayawati’s regime. On October 9, 2008, the then chief minister had laid its foundation stone. Two years later, the Rs 30 crore bridge was opened to traffic, however, within a year, it developed its first major crack. UPSBCL had to close it for seven days to fix the damage. In 2016, a 6x6 feet section of the bridge collapsed for which the bridge was again closed down for 10 days.

As per sources, every day around 15,000 vehicles cross Ambedkar Bridge which also connects Yamuna Expressway with the city. Tourists use this bridge to visit Taj Mahal and other destinations in the city. Vehicles going towards Gwalior Road also pass through it.

UPSBCL deputy project manager Vikram Singh said, “Permission has been sought for repairing of Ambedkar bridge. It will take 15 days to complete the repair work. The date to start the repair work will be finalized by the traffic police as they have to make arrangements to manage traffic in the area after closing the bridge.”

Agra: Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) students, including women, on Thursday demanded release of anti-CAA activist Sharjeel Imam who was arrested by Delhi police in a sedition case last month.

Shouting slogans, the protesting students demanded that Sharjeel Imam be released. They took out a protest march against CAA/NRC/NPR from Maulana Azad library to Bab-E-Syed inside the campus.

Speaking to the media, one of the protesting women students said that they will not stop their movement against the alleged police brutality at Jamia, JNU and AMU. She said that no one can suppress the voice of students. “Sharjeel’s speech was not wrong. It was misinterpreted,” the protestors said.

Another woman protestor said, Sharjeel was wrongly implicated and the charges imposed against him should be withdrawn. She said that he should get justice and all those who have been wrongly put behind the bars during anti-CAA protests across the state should be released.

Sharjeel, a PhD scholar at the Jawaharlal Nehru University’s Centre for Historical Studies, was booked for sedition and under other charges in several states after purported videos of his alleged inflammatory speeches at the AMU and Jamia Milia Islamia University in Delhi, were circulated on social media.

In the video, which has gone viral on social media, Imam can be purportedly heard saying that if he can organise five lakh people, it is possible to ‘permanently cut off Assam with the rest of India...if not permanently, then at least for a few months’.

Aligarh police registered the FIR against him under sections 124 A (sedition), 153 A (provocation with intent to cause riots), 153 B (whoever by words either spoken or written or by signs makes or publishes any imputation, assertions prejudicial to national-integration or may cause disharmony) and 505 (2) of the IPC at the Civil Lines police station.

92,['14/02/2020'],CAA protests: 13 get Rs 22 lakh recovery notices for damages,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Lucknow: Issuing its first such recovery order, Lucknow district administration on Thursday directed 13 accused to pay Rs 22 lakh as compensation for damaging public property in violence during anti-CAA protests in Khadra locality under Hasanganj police station in the city on December 19, 2019.

The administration also pulled up police for not putting up required efforts in identifying all the culprits.

The order comes nearly two months after chief minister Yogi Adityanath had declared that government will recover damages from protesters. ADM (trans-Gomti) Vishwa Bushan Mishra said the administration can issue recovery order as per an Allahabad high court order of December 2, 2010, in Mohammad Shujauddin vs State of Uttar Pradesh.

On December 23, 2019, ADM (trans-Gomti) had issued show cause notices to 20 persons, identified from CCTV footage, photographs and videos of violence and arson besides report of the local intelligence unit (LIU), seeking reply on why money should not be recovered from them for damage caused to public property in December 19 protest.

Lucknow DM Abhishek Prakash had constituted a four-member panel comprising (ADM) (East), ADM (West), ADM (trans-Gomti) and ADM (administration) to assess the damage caused to property and fix responsibility. Among the 20 accused, seven submitted evidence to claim they were not present at the spot nor responsible in any other way. Police could not counter their evidence, it said.

“It is important to mention here that police did not take assistance from any competent legal consultant or government counsel for its submissions,” the order added. The seven accused will still face criminal proceedings in court.

Among the remaining 13 from whom damages will be recovered, six did not reply to the notice, hence were considered guilty, while seven could not provide sufficient evidence to prove their innocence, the order stated. The 13 accused are collectively and individually responsible for paying damages, it added. In a dig at police, the order says, “Over 10,000 persons were involved in the anti-CAA protests during which violence broke out, but police could identify only a few. As a result, responsibility of many others involved in violence could not be fixed.”

The 13 accused include Osama Siddiqui, Mohammed Hashim, Dharamvir Singh, Mohammed Kalim of Jankipuram and another Mohammed Kalim of Hasanganj, Mukhtar Ahmad, Mohammed Zakir, Mohammed Mubeen, Wasim, Mohammed Shafiuddin, Mahenoor Chaudhary, Hafiz-ur- Rehman, and Salman.

They have been given 30 days to pay the damages failing which their property will be seized.

BHOPAL: Forty passengers were hurt when a college bus collided head-on with a passenger bus on Bhojpur Road on Thursday evening. Among the injured are 14 college students and two minor boys.

The condition of four college students is said to be critical and they are admitted in the ICU. Misrod police had not filed a case till the time of filing this report. The impact of the collision was such that the college bus broke into two, near the door. The students and teachers were trapped inside as the entrance was jammed by a tree.

SHO Misrod, Niranjan Sharma said, “Around 5pm, a speeding passenger bus on way to Bhojpur from Bhopal collided head-on with a college bus coming from the opposite side. The college bus was on way to drop students home.” The bus was badly damaged. One of the professor’s leg got stuck in a broken part of the bus. The metal around the leg had to be cut to rescue him, said police.

“Police rushed the injured students to a nearby private hospital where four students including Neelesh, Shubham, Neetu, and Sanjay Kumar Pal were admitted to ICU. Neelesh and Shubham are on ventilator and their condition is reported to be critical. Two minor boys from other passenger bus — Ayan Ali, 11, and Lalik Arib, 11, were also admitted to the private hospital. Six girl students sustained injuries on their face and head. 12 passengers were rushed to another private hospital where they are undergoing treatment,” added Sharma. Police will register a case after investigation, said Sharma. Prima facie the eyewitnesses told police that the college bus driver was driving rashly.

Hyderabad: After spending a harrowing three years in Iraq with their world turned upside down and having been duped by illegal agents who promised to get them jobs, 16 workers from Telangana are returning home on Saturday.

But, the workers’ return would not have been possible had the Kurdistan regional government not waived a penalty of Rs 2 crore, which the workers owe for their overstay and illegal stay in Iraq. The workers belong to Mancherial, Adilabad, Nizamabad, Karimnagar and Jagtial.

With the Consulate General of India (CGI) in Erbil intervening, the workers were able to breathe easy. “This was the only second instance when the waiver was given. The first waiver was granted in 2016. We kept pursuing the matter with the Kurdistan authorities,” consul general, CGI, Erbil, Chandramouli K Kern said.

NRI affairs minister KT Rama Rao also took up the issue with the CGI. General administration (NRI) department official Chitti Babu received the news from Chandramouli, who also told him that Kurdistan regional government does not waive penalty in normal course.

The workers, who took the flight in Iraq on Friday, will reach Hyderabad on Saturday. Before they set out, they posted a video thanking chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and KTR. The video was shared by Murthi Alagonda, a social worker and president of Telugu Gulf Welfare Association, Erbil.

The workers revealed they had a hard time in Iraq with no food, accommodation and no means of livelihood. They also said they had no ‘aqama’ (work permit), which made their stay illegal.

On November 28, 2019, GAD, Telangana, wrote to CGI, Erbil, and gave names of the 17 workers who pleaded for help. One of them returned to the state on February 3 after his employer paid penalty on his behalf and bailed him out.

Panaji: Days after the Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) announced that they would not permit tableaus depicting CAA/NRC, the corporation has decided to beef up security on the day of the parade to remove even spot entries showcasing the subject.

“We will have a meeting with the participants prior to the festival to explain the rules to them. Floats depicting CAA will not be permitted. We have a screening team in the Panaji carnival committee that will look into this,” Panaji mayor Uday Madkaikar said.

“If there is such a float at the carnival, we will immediately remove them from there. We have scheduled a meeting with the Goa police, traffic cell and the collector on Monday to work out the final strategy,” Madkaikar said.

He said that the parade will be flagged off at 4 pm but float entries will be accepted only till 1pm. “The screening committee will be present from morning onwards to check the theme of the floats,” he said. The carnival parade will be held in Panaji on February 22.

He urged participants to make efforts to depict Goa’s culture instead.

“This time we have requested participants to stage theme-based floats, and not just people dancing on small floats. What we want participants to showcase are the stories of Goa’s village life and scenic surroundings so that domestic and international tourists can see Goa’s culture through these floats,” he said.

This year, the fee for spot registrations has been increased to Rs 5,000 and registration forms will cost Rs 1,000. They used to only cost Rs 100 in the previous years.

Hyderabad: The forest department cracked the whip on a contractor for uprooting trees in Gachibowli following a TOI report. A fine of Rs 1 lakh was imposed for the loss of 20 trees in the area.

The fine was imposed on contractor Rajashekhar Reddy for the felling of trees at Rolling Hills in Gachibowli.

The felling was done to carry out underground cabling work.

A case was booked by the forest department on February 10 after residents raised an issue about chopping of trees in the middle of the night. The case was booked under section 29-2(b) of TS Forest Act 1967.

The weight of the wood chopped was pegged at 11.02 tonnes, costing approximately Rs 20,000. As per calculations, forest officials charged the contractor five times the amount.

“Any tree felling requires permission from forest authorities concerned. Any illegal action will be taken seriously. Penalties will be imposed in case trees are chopped without permission,” said Ch Shivaiah, FDO, Shamshabad division.

Forest department officials said the fine money has already been remitted.

Sumanth P, general secretary, Meenakshi Towers, who first saw the trees chopped down, reacted positively. “This is a good step taken by the forest department. Once people realise there is a cost to cutting even one tree illegally, the amount of felling will reduce.”

98,['14/02/2020'],"Raj needs more solar capacity, better ecosystem to cement its edge","This story is from February 14, 2020

Jaipur: In the past one year, Rajasthan has regained some of the lost ground to become the second largest producer of solar power in the country, but to reclaim the top position, the state needs to have an investor-friendly tariff and policy regime.

In its budget recommendations to the state government, Rajasthan Solar Association (RSA) drew attention to a number of areas, focusing not only on adding more generation capacity but also building an entire solar power ecosystem that would yield multiple benefits for the state.

The industry body urged the government to bring in provisions in the budget to list solar street lights, lanterns, heaters and other items in the Rajasthan Transparency in Public Procurement Act and mandate the government departments to source only from the state’s MSMEs.

To make Kusum scheme a success, it said the current tariff of Rs 3.14 per unit, which was fixed on Thursday, should be increased to attract investors. Kusum scheme allows farmers to set up solar plants to run pumps for irrigating their fields. Under the scheme, farmers can also lease their unutilized land to developers and earn fees.

Sunil Bansal, general secretary of RSA, said, “So far, the applications from developers are less than the land offered by farmers. This shows the developers feel that the return on investment is not adequate. We want the government to recognize the trends and raise the tariffs. These projects offer great hope to farmers for getting day power which will change their social life.”

Since Rajasthan has been at the centre of solar revolution in the country, the industry body wants the government to develop capacity building institutions like research and development centres and skills training facilities.

“As a leader, we have to be at the forefront of building all the necessary ecosystem and infrastructure . The RRDEF (Rajasthan Renewable Energy Development Fund) has the resources and that should be utilised for capacity building and promoting the sector,” added Bansal.

For commercial and industrial consumers, net metering cap of 1 megawatt has been a concern. The industry body said that since the dynamics of the industry has changed with bigger projects being set up, the cap of 1 MW should now be increased to 2 MW. Bansal said that Haryana has already raised the cap and Rajasthan should also follow suit.

Karnataka 7274 MW

Rajasthan 4844 MW

Tamil Nadu 3788 MW

JAIPUR: Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria attacked the government on increasing crime and power tariff hike announced recently.

He was participating in a debate on the governor’s address in the assembly on Thursday.

He said under the Congress rule all kinds of crimes had increased manifold. Crimes against SCs registered an 81% growth, while ST is 60. He alleged that the Thanagazi gangrape case was covered up till the elections were over.

Chief minister Ashok Gehlot later in his reply defended the increase in FIRs by saying that his government’s directive of allowing districts SPs to register FIRs had resulted in such a growth in criminal complaints.

The opposition leader said the discoms had become white elephants with the recent power hike the common people were not able to pay bills and there are chances of people adopting illegal means.

He said a family consuming just 150 units of power in a month has to shell out Rs 1,380 per year after tariff hike while 300 units had an additional burden of Rs 3,390. Similarly, a consumer using 500 units of power a month has been put an additional annual burden of Rs 6000 a year.

He asked the government to address the issues of contractual employees. Kataria said the issue had to be settled once and for all as the contract employees are continuing with the hope of regularisation. He also asked the chief minister to take action against rampant adulteration.

CHENNAI: In a setback to the Tamil Nadu government, the expert appraisal committee of the Union environment ministry has deferred environmental clearances to two industrial parks for not meeting statutory requirements.While Manallur in Gummidipoondi in Tiruvallur district failed to address issues raised during the public hearing and fulfill commitments, Therkuveerapandiyapuram and Meelavitan villages in Tuticorin district did not adhere to environment guidelines.The Manallur park is proposed on a location 47.5km north of Chennai, an initiative of the state to support an industrial cluster as an environmentally balanced industrial complex (EBIC). The project proponent, State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (SIPCOT), has said the Manallur park, costing Rs 250 crore, would complement the growth of the nearby port and upcoming power plants. It has been designed to accommodate industries that fall under 5f (synthetic organic chemicals industry) and 5h (integrated paint industry) categories as per environmental norms.In its 230th meeting in New Delhi, the committee deliberated the project in detail and issued a slew of directions.The SIPCOT mentioned that there is no protected area within 10km radius of the proposed site. As per the environment ministry’s decision support system, however, the Pulicat lake wildlife sanctuary is located 5.5km from the project site.“The SIPCOT has not addressed the issues raised during the public hearing and kept the commitments made along with fund provisions in environment impact assessment/environment management plan report,” the committee said.As the water table is shallow in the area and soil formation is predominantly red clay and coastal sand, the site is not suitable for chemical industries. The groundwater and surface water have to be protected.The Tuticorin industrial park is envisaged for petroleum refining industry and petro-chemical complex at a cost of Rs 250 crore.The state government in December 1996 gave administrative sanction for the proposal to acquire land to set up an industrial complex in Meelavitan and Therkuveerapandiapuram in Tuticorin district. “The SIPCOT has not given three alternative sites for the proposed industrial activities that are highly polluting,” the committee said.Interestingly, the SIPCOT has pointed to more oil well exploration projects in the state that would benefit the project.In both cases, the committee said the site selection for the proposed industrial estates should be planned according to guidelines of the Central Pollution Control Board’s programme on zoning atlas for locating industries. The planning should be based on the criteria mentioned in the ministry’s Technical EIA Guidance Manual for Industrial Estate (2009). The SIPCOT should work on revised environment impact assessment/environment management plan report for both industrial parks to seek environment clearance.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74132258,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-586140,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/centre-defers-clearances-for-two-tn-industrial-parks/articleshow/74125119.cms

Anup Sai

RAIPUR/BHUBANESWAR: Chhattisgarh police on Wednesday night arrested BJD leader Anup Kumar Sai for the 2016 double murder of a woman and her 14-year-old daughter.

An embarrassed BJD sacked Sai (59) from the party on Thursday and he was also removed as chairman of the state warehousing corporation by the Odisha government.

A three-time Congress MLA from Brajrajnagar , Sai was summoned several times by Raigarh (Chhattisgarh) police but he didn’t respond to any of them, leading to his arrest.

Raigarh SP Santosh Singh told TOI, “Chakradhar Nagar police have picked up former MLA Anup Sai for interrogation in connection with the double murder case of two women in May 2016. Sai has admitted that he was involved in the murder with some of his aides. He has been arrested under IPC Sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) and 120B (criminal conspiracy).”

The mutilated bodies of a woman and young girl were found in the forests of Raigarh, bordering Jharsuguda district . Their faces were crushed beyond recognition. It took eight months for the police to identify them as Kalpana Das (35) and her 14-year-old daughter Pravati, residents of Brajarajnagar.

During investigation, police found some clues in 2018 that indicated Sai was a close acquaintance of Kalpana, say sources. Chhattisgarh police repeatedly summoned Sai on the basis of evidence but he ignored them. “He was picked up for interrogation when police found substantial evidence,” the SP added.

Singh said that the woman had been Sai’s live-in partner for several years. “Sai is the prime accused in the murder of his live-in partner. In his confession, he said that the woman was blackmailing him and was insisting on marriage. Though her daughter was from her previous husband, both mother and daughter were killed in cold blood with a sharp-edged weapon,” the SP said.

“We had issued him summons to appear before us for interrogation, but he dodged them. On Wednesday night, we went to Jharsuguda and brought him in for questioning. We arested him after interrogation. Sai killed the woman and her daughter and tried to destroy evidence,” said an officer of Chakradhar Nagar police.

“We had formed several teams to solve this case. Later, we found Sai’s complicity,” said Raigarh additional SP Abhishek Verma. Family members of Sai and Kalpana were unavailable for comment.

Sai represented Brajarajnagar assembly constituency for the Congress from 2000 to 2014. He switched to BJD in 2014 but lost the election and was denied a ticket in 2019. In August 2019, chief minister Naveen Patnaik appointed him as chairperson of Odisha state warehousing corporation, a state-owned public sector undertaking.

Jaipur: Speaker C P Joshi has begun cracking the whip on ministers and MLAs.

Joshi, a stricter for rules on Thursday warned the ministers that he would order to lock up ministers’ chambers in the assembly if they entertain MLAs in the House during the session.

He directed the ministers to be present in the House during Zero Hour as well after the Opposition complained that ministers and officials leave the House once the Question Hour is over and no one listens to issues raised during the rest of the day.

As soon as Question Hour ended and speaker announced Zero Hour business, the MLAs began to rush to the ministers in the front row in the House to get their works done.

Then, the speaker said, “If the ministers attend to the grievances of the MLAs in the House itself what is the use of their chambers.”

He directed the MLAs to approach the ministers in their chamber so that the House proceedings are not disturbed.

The speaker gave the direction after deputy opposition leader Rajendra Rathore complained that the ministers are not attentive to the issues raised by the MLAs for Zero Hour. The speaker also said the ministers should be present in the House for Zero Hour also though they are not mandated to reply to the issues raised during this period.

Later, Rathore said speaker’s directive came as slap to the government as the ministers were not serious on their duties.

Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao offers flowers to Godavari on Thursday

HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Thursday directed irrigation officials to gear up to lift 530 tmcft from Godavari river and fill all the lakes.

Asking the officials to prepare an action plan in this regard, the chief minister said the irrigation department would be reorganised soon, indicating his plans to bring in reforms on the lines of the revenue department.

He said this was to ensure effective functioning of the department by bringing all engineering wings under one umbrella. He said the department would be divided into 11 circles. Each circle will be headed by a chief engineer.

The chief minister held a review meeting with senior irrigation officials along with ministers — Eatala Rajender, Gangula Kamalakar and Koppula Eshwar — and chief secretary Somesh Kumar in Karimnagar after visiting Medigadda barrage of Kaleshwaram project.

KCR said there was no dearth of funds and asked the officials to complete repairs of irrigation canals by May-end this year.

He wanted residential quarters completed by April for irrigation officials and staffers and asked the chief secretary to come up with proposals for construction of new collectorates in Nizamabad and Karimnagar.

Earlier in the day, KCR performed pujas at Kaleswaram-Mukteswaram temple and Triveni Sangam (confluence of Godavari, Pranahita and Saraswati rivers).

He made an aerial tour of Laxmi barrage (Medigadda) and dropped coins into the Godavari thereby fulfilling his Telangana statehood movement vows.

KCR instructed officials to ensure that floodwaters should be lifted from the Laxmi barrage during the monsoon season.

He also explained to irrigation principal secretary and former chief electoral officer Rajat Kumar on what he intends to do on various irrigation projects. Sources said KCR was trying to ease Rajat Kumar in his new role. Rajat was shifted to the irrigation wing in the recent reshuffle of IAS officers.

“From Sri Ram Sagar Project to Kaleswaram project barrages, reservoirs, lift irrigation pumps, canals and to the last acre in the ayacut, irrigated water should wet the land and they should be monitored. Division work should be done at every stage by strengthening the engineering network. If need be, use wireless network like police do,” he said.

109,['14/02/2020'],Former Odisha MLA held in 2016 double-murder case in Chhattisgarh,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Anup Sai

RAIPUR/BHUBANESWAR: Chhattisgarh police on Wednesday night arrested BJD leader Anup Kumar Sai for the 2016 double murder of a woman and her 14-year-old daughter.

An embarrassed BJD sacked Sai (59) from the party on Thursday and he was also removed as chairman of the state warehousing corporation by the Odisha government.

A three-time Congress MLA from Brajrajnagar , Sai was summoned several times by Raigarh (Chhattisgarh) police but he didn’t respond to any of them, leading to his arrest.

Raigarh SP Santosh Singh told TOI, “Chakradhar Nagar police have picked up former MLA Anup Sai for interrogation in connection with the double murder case of two women in May 2016. Sai has admitted that he was involved in the murder with some of his aides. He has been arrested under IPC Sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) and 120B (criminal conspiracy).”

The mutilated bodies of a woman and young girl were found in the forests of Raigarh, bordering Jharsuguda district . Their faces were crushed beyond recognition. It took eight months for the police to identify them as Kalpana Das (35) and her 14-year-old daughter Pravati, residents of Brajarajnagar.

During investigation, police found some clues in 2018 that indicated Sai was a close acquaintance of Kalpana, say sources. Chhattisgarh police repeatedly summoned Sai on the basis of evidence but he ignored them. “He was picked up for interrogation when police found substantial evidence,” the SP added.

Singh said that the woman had been Sai’s live-in partner for several years. “Sai is the prime accused in the murder of his live-in partner. In his confession, he said that the woman was blackmailing him and was insisting on marriage. Though her daughter was from her previous husband, both mother and daughter were killed in cold blood with a sharp-edged weapon,” the SP said.

“We had issued him summons to appear before us for interrogation, but he dodged them. On Wednesday night, we went to Jharsuguda and brought him in for questioning. We arested him after interrogation. Sai killed the woman and her daughter and tried to destroy evidence,” said an officer of Chakradhar Nagar police.

“We had formed several teams to solve this case. Later, we found Sai’s complicity,” said Raigarh additional SP Abhishek Verma. Family members of Sai and Kalpana were unavailable for comment.

Sai represented Brajarajnagar assembly constituency for the Congress from 2000 to 2014. He switched to BJD in 2014 but lost the election and was denied a ticket in 2019. In August 2019, chief minister Naveen Patnaik appointed him as chairperson of Odisha state warehousing corporation, a state-owned public sector undertaking.

Surat: A city-based science researcher has made it to the list of top 50 teachers in the world under the dedicated teachers’ award-2020 by the Cambridge University press.

Nitesh Pandey, a researcher with the Indian Astrobiology Research Centre in Mumbai, has figured in the Dedicated Teachers’ Award Shortlist-2020 released by the Cambridge University Press. Pandey (30), a native of Vesu locality in Surat, is the lone candidate from the city, whereas there are other seven teachers from India, who have been celebrated for their vital role played in the lives of their students.

Pandey told TOI: “Being a scientist, I am always passionate about science promotion as well as teaching. I was the first to start Open Science Forum (OSF) in 2013 to teach students chemistry and biology.”

Since the inception of the OSF institute, Pandey has done multiple experiments to make chemistry more fun and accessible to students. He used games like crosswords to make his students learn chemistry with fun. Also, he wrote a song on ‘structure of atom’ so that students could remember all the atomic models in one go.

“We have organized 35 workshops on astrobiology all across the country since 2017. The series of workshops started from Surat in 2017,” said Pandey.

About his achievements, Pandey said, “I have been working on a new type of curriculum that is based on the extensive research done on the way our brain stores information and learn new things. This is going to be a game changer for those who are looking to explore new things with their brains.”

CHANDIGARH: Miffed with the municipal corporation for increasing water tariff by more than double, residents have filed 110 objections, calling it unjustified in the absence of 24x7 supply.

Of these objections, 100 are on a single paper, signed by people from the housing societies of southern sectors 49 to 51. The MC will put these before the municipal commissioner and the home secretary of the local government for their comments before a final notification. “The officers’ comments will be meant to satisfy the objections,” a source in the civic body said. The MC will comment first and then the home secretary.

The civic body had given the general public 15 days to submit objections and suggestions on the issue of water tariff increase that has the consent of the UT administrator. Sources in the MC said the chances of complete rollback of the hike were negligible but there might be minor chances based on the stakeholders’ views. Since the authority increased the tariff after almost 10 years, it backs its decision firmly.

A senior MC official dealing with the case said: “The hike was a unanimous decision of the general house, biggest body of the MC, so the question of complete reversal doesn’t arise.”

CHANDIGARH: Taking suo motu cognizance of the accident in which two fighting bulls had claimed the life of a 22-year-old biker near Nada Sahib Gurdwara on February 8, the Haryana State Human Rights Commission has sought a report from the Panchkula municipal corporation.

“Let a report be requisitioned from the commissioner, municipal corporation, Panchkula, regarding the menace of stray cattle, which has taken the life of one Shahbaj, who was the only earning member of his family,” the commission observed in its order. The matter will come up for hearing on April 21.

On the night of February 8, Shahbaj Khan, a resident of Ramgarh in Panchkula district, was on way home on his motorcycle when the accident took place.

Shahbaj, a private firm employee, fell on the road and suffered a head injury. He was rushed to a nearby private hospital, from where he was referred to PGIMER, Chandigarh. But he succumbed during treatment. His friends informed his family about the incident.

The new outlet on Mambalam High Road, T Nagar

CHENNAI: T Nagar residents have condemned a state government agency for shifting ration shop to new location without prior announcement.

The shop, run by Triplicane Urban Co-operative Society (TUCS), was functioning at Rameshwaram Road for over 50 years. It has been shifted to newly-built structure on Mambalam High Road last week.

The shifting of the shops would mean that the cardholders of over 15 streets, who include senior citizens, to walk a long distance,"" said B Kannan, secretary of T Nagar Residents' Welfare Association. The new location is 2km far from the old site.

“There was no reason for shifting since there was no complaint whatsoever from the residents,” he said. Also, the newly built shops are clear encroachments on public space and safety of residents who queue up on road is at risk as Mambalam High Road always witnesses heavy traffic,” he added, requesting TUCS to shift the shop back to the old location.

Chandrasekar, managing director of TUCS, said the ration shop was functioning from an old and dilapidated structure and it was shifted to new building following T Nagar MLA Sathyanarayanan’s effort. It was becoming difficult to unload stocks there (on interior road) and now the shop is on the main road thereby making operations convenient. Though the MLA assured to get back regarding this, he didn't. Residents, however, complain that they weren’t consulted before any decision on shifting and the new building is situated at an unhygienic location with dust from road settling on food items. Workers can be seen wearing masks to avoid breathing trouble.

“The old building at Rameshwaram Street will be demolished and a super market will come up at the site. Tenders will be floated next week,” Chandrasekar added.

Allahabad: Congress members reached the district collectorate on Thursday with LPG cylinders to protest against the hike in price of cooking gas. The protesters demanded that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government roll back its decision to hike LPG prices.

Congress leader Mukund Tiwari said, “Congress has planned a series of protests to be staged from streets to the UP assembly. The Union government’s decision to increase LPG prices has hit citizens’ budgets at a time when the public was already reeling under the impact of inflation.” Congress leaders also brought along LPG cylinders and even performed a puja much to the fascination of onlookers.

MOHALI: A 28-year-old man, who was hooked to alcohol as well as drugs, killed his father here on Wednesday night when the 50-year-old refused to give him money for his addictions.

The accused, Rinku, was unemployed and unmarried, said the police.

The deceased, Hansraj, a resident of Mundi Kharar, used to work as a daily-wage labourer. Police officials said around 9.30pm, the duo had a quarrel over Rinku’s drinking habit. “Infuriated, Rinku picked up bricks kept outside his house. After closing the door of the house, he smashed his father’s face with around 20-25 bricks,” said a cop, adding that around 12 bricks were recovered from the spot.

At 10pm, when Hansraj’s younger son, Sonu, came home and opened the door, he saw Rinku with a brick in his hand and his father lying in a pool of blood. “Sonu, who also works as a daily-wage labourer, cried for help and called his neighbour Harmanpreet, who informed us,” said the police.

Hansraj was rushed to Kharar civil hospital with the help of neighbours, but doctors declared him dead. According to the police officials, Sonu and Rinku’s mother had died around 14 years ago and they had two married sisters.

Hansraj was so brutally hit that his face had become unidentifiable.

“Father and son used to quarrel often, as Hansraj would ask the accused to find a job,” said a source.

Sonu said, “Rinku was unemployed and took drugs, for which my father would scold him. This was the reason he killed him.”

A case under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at City Kharar police station. SHO inspector Bhagwant Singh said, “The accused was arrested on Thursday evening from near Mundi Kharar when we received a tip-off that he was trying to flee. He will be produced in the court on Friday. The post-mortem of the deceased has been conducted.”

UDAIPUR: Arthur and Celia, a couple from Strasbourg, France, are in the City of Lakes on a romantic holiday. Walking through the heritage streets they come across a bridge at Chandpole and are surprised to see young couples clipping locks on the metal grate.

Reminded of the famous Love Bridge in their country, they too get a lock, clip it to the railing, kiss the key which is flung into the waters of Lake Pichola.

Chandpole Pulia is a new destination discovered in recent times by love birds who throng here in good numbers, especially around February which is the valentine month. “It is just a cute romantic gesture by sweethearts to proclaim their love and intentions to remain together for the rest of their lives,” says Himanshi, a college student who scribbled her boyfriend’s name and abandoned the key in the waters.

“It felt like one of the most romantic things we have ever done. This bridge is a treasure for its serenity and one of the most romantic places in Udaipur ,” say Priyamvada and Varun Raj, a couple from Bengaluru.

Some college youths were seen clipping a big lock to commemorate their bond. “Friendship is precious, and we have clipped the padlock praying for an everlasting bond between us, there is nothing romantic in this gesture, but it is exciting,” say Ankit, Kartik, Saumya and Sushmita, pursuing MBA from a college in Ahmedabad.

However, historians and heritage activists are not so happy with the new trend. “This display of love or romantic gesture can be harmful in the long term and may cause heritage degradation. The city of Paris has removed padlocks from the famous Pont des Arts ending the tourist tradition of attaching ‘love locks’ to the bridge. Here the trend is new, and the locks are in countable numbers today, but when they multiply, it may create problems and the railings would look ugly,” Mahesh Sharma, a retired professor and activist, said.

Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project’s Unit 2, which had stopped power generation in December last, is yet to res... Read More

CHENNAI: Both units at Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project have come to a stand-still, resulting in a shortfall of 1,000MW for Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation ( Tangedco ).

Unit 2, which had stopped power generation in December last, is yet to resume.

The first unit was stopped on Tuesday night owing to a technical snag. About 50% of power generated at Kudankulam power plant is supplied to Tamil Nadu.

“We were getting around 300MW from Unit 1 till a few days ago. As there is no communication from the plant as to what is the real issue and when generation will resume, we are not taking supply from Kudankulam into consideration for our planning,” said a senior Tangedco official.

As per Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) website, Unit 2 generated 3,641 million units of power in 2019-20 and Unit 1 generated 5,586 million units. Efforts to seek response from NPCIL officials were in vain.

Compared to other nuclear power units in the country, the Kudankulam units have been performing below par. For example, four units in Kaiga have a capacity factor of not less than 90%. Some have crossed 100%. In comparison, the capacity factor of Kudankulam Unit 1 is 80% and Unit 2 is only 50%. Since February 1, power demand has been surging in the state. The peak demand is around 14,500MW, which is a new high for February. “All our thermal units are working at full capacity. Beyond that, we are purchasing power from central thermal and nuclear units as well as from the market to meet the peak demand,” said the official. At times, wind power is available, but it is restricted to evening time.

“Till wind power season begins, we have to depend on thermal and nuclear units for power supply. That explains our dependence on Kudankulam,” said the official.

122,['14/02/2020'],India to lead global fight against drug trafficking: Shah,"This story is from February 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: Resolving not to allow illicit trade of narcotics within India’s boundaries, home minister Amit Shah on Thursday stressed on the need for all countries, particularly the Bay of Bengal littoral states, to combat the global menace by engaging with one another on exchange of ideas, policies and best practices.

Addressing the two-day Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (Bimstec) conference on ‘combating drug trafficking” organised by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) here, Shah said India had adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards narcotics and the country’s measures to control it were being overhauled to ensure that smuggling and trade of drugs was completely stopped.

The event was attended by Bimstec secretary-general Shahid-ul-Islam, junior foreign minister V Muraleedharan, visiting representatives of Bimstec member nations Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand, home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and NCB DG Rakesh Asthana, among others.

Shah said the “dirty money” obtained from narcotics trade was being used to fund global terrorism and other transnational crimes and it was the need of the hour for all countries to join hands and fight the problem.

“We will not allow drugs from any country of the world to enter into our country nor will we allow them to go out of the country... I want to assure that India is committed to end the drug menace and will take the lead role to check narcotics trade in the world,” he said.

According to an official statement, Asian countries are increasingly being affected by drug trafficking and Bimstec, being the key link between South Asian and South-East Asian nations, was one of the most effective platforms to tackle this global threat.

Shah said Manipur and Mizoram, which shared borders with Myanmar, and some coastal states were sensitive and may become a gateway for illicit drugs entering India, which must be prevented.

The minister expressed concern over the increasing rate of drug addiction — a 30% rise in the last 10 years — and termed the menace a “curse for mankind” as it not only killed an addict but also destroyed families and society. He said an estimated $400 billion worth of illicit drug trade happened globally every year, giving an idea of the size of challenge facing humanity.

Quoting PM Narendra Modi, Shah said there was no nation in the world that was not affected by global terrorism, transnational crimes and illicit drug trafficking. He assured the delegates that in line with the PM’s vision of a drug-free India, the government had devised a strategy to ensure inter-agency coordination and revamp the prosecution mechanism to end drug trafficking.

Agra: Gorakhpur paediatrician Dr Kafeel Khan, who was granted bail by an Aligarh court in a hate speech case on Monday, is likely to be released from Mathura jail on Friday, after a delay of three days. Chief judicial magistrate (CJM), Aligarh sent a special messenger to the jail with Khan’s release order and directed the jailor to expedite the release process.

The CJM passed the orders on an application filed by Khan’s lawyer, Irfan Ghazi, who alleged that police and jail authorities were unnecessarily harassing his client by detaining him illegally, even after the bail. Ghazi told TOI, “The release order was sent in person to Mathura jail from the court, but they refused to accept it on the plea they the same needed to be verified”.

In his application before the CJM, Ghazi said that his 38-year-old client, who is a heart patient, had illegally been detained in the jail even after bail by the court and verification of the guarantors. The application stated that this is the contempt of court and also the violation of human rights of his client.

The lawyer also urged the CJM to send a “special” messenger to Mathura jail for the release of his client.

After hearing the plea, the CJM Aligarh ordered Mathura jail superintendent to release Kafeel Khan. The order also said that Khan’s release order is being sent through a special messenger, Parmeet Kumar.

The CJM court also ordered Aligarh jail superintendent to expedite the process.

Ghazi said that Khan was not released even after sending the special messenger on Thursday evening. He said jail authorities may release him on Friday morning.

Khan was arrested by UP police’s special task force from Mumbai on January 29, when he reached the city to attend a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

He was then arrested in connection with a case registered against him in Aligarh under section 153-A (Promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion), 153 B, 109 of IPC at civil lines police station on December 13 for disturbing communal harmony by delivering a provocative speech at Aligarh Muslim University (AMU).

Eateries infront of Shilparamam yet to open, in Madhapur Pic:P Ajikumar

Hyderabad: The inauguration of Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation’s street-vending zone near Shilparamam, which was to be inaugurated on February 3, was postponed allegedly owing to protocol issues.

According to sources, Mayor Bonthu Rammohan was reportedly upset over his name being mentioned below the name of TRS MLA from Seriligampally and government whip Arekapudi Gandhi on an invitation for the inaugural of the vending zone. As per the general administration protocol, the Mayor’s name is supposed to be mentioned below the government whip’s name on plaques and invitations. However, speaking to TOI, both Rammohan and Gandhi denied the allegations. “I was not at all offended, as MA&UD minister KT Rama Rao was not attending the function, my schedule for the day changed,” said Rammohan.

Speaking about the event, Gandhi said, “I am on good terms with the Mayor. I wanted KTR to inaugurate it.”

GHMC officials also denied the allegations stating that the inauguration was postponed as zonal commissioners were transferred just a day before the inauguration.

Meanwhile, a private individual has claimed ownership of the land where the street-vending zone has been set up. He alleged that the TDR (Transfer of Development Rights) certificate was not issued to him after his land was acquired.

GHMC said that the alleged land owner has approached the court and may collect rent from stall owners after obtaining a stay order, till the issue is resolved. “Before the underpass was constructed, the zone was a part of a road that was fully operational, so how could the land be a private individual’s property?” the GHMC said over the allegations.

MYSURU: Muzrai temples here have been in the news recently for all the wrong reasons.

Lack of transparency in temple affairs has caused a loss to the exchequer, claim devotees who make offerings through various sevas and hundis. Authorities are trying to rectify it but keeping a round-the-clock vigil on all temples is challenging.

The authorities of Sri Chamundeshwari Temple atop Chamundi Hills suspended three employees for manipulating software at the special entry counter and swindled over Rs 7 lakh. They entered the date as 2008 instead of 2018 while issuing a few special entry tickets priced at Rs 100 and Rs 30 and pocketed the money. The temple gets over 4,000 devotees on normal days and the number goes up ten-folds on special occasions. The crime came to light only after new software was installed. It’s still not known how much money was swindled and it’s suspected to have been going on for the past eight years.

Three employees of Srikanteshwara Temple in Nanjangud were booked for depositing less money than was collected from devotees performing thulabara and others sevas.

These are the two major muzrai temples among five in Mysuru district. They earn high revenue through offering and other special sevas. These two temples get over Rs 1 crore each once every 45 days from the offerings alone. Money through other sevas is collected separately. There are 18 offering boxes in the Chamundi temple.

BN Nagendra, a 50-year-old devotee, said the root cause for misappropriation is because the employees aren’t transferred. Once appointed, they serve for many years and this enables them find loopholes and siphon off money. “At least now the authorities must make transfers compulsory for all temple employees,” he said.

Mysuru assistant commissioner NC Venkataraju said prima facie Srikanteshwara Temple money received in the form of offerings by devotees was misused. There’s a record for misappropriation of over Rs 17 lakh and those involved have been transferred, said the official conducting a departmental inquiry.

Every temple is managed by an executive officer and directly accountable to the muzrai department. Mysuru muzrai tahsildar Yathiraju told TOI that after misappropriation of money came to light at Sri Chamundeshwari Temple, more CCTV cameras were installed, records checked and all activities monitored.

127,['14/02/2020'],Tumakuru scores 113 out of 100 on rating ease of living,"This story is from February 14, 2020

MANGALURU: Tumakuru ranked 70 out of 111 on ease of living in 2018 but the city scored 113% on ease of filling up the Citizen Perception Survey (CPS) for 2019, overshooting its target in just a fortnight. Seven Karnataka cities that were part of the national index in 2018 continue to be in contention; there will be 114 cities in all this time around.

The CPS was launched online on February 1 by the Union housing and urban affairs ministry to gauge citizens’ responses to 22 questions related to ease of living in their city, including education, healthcare, housing, drinking water, safety of women, commuting, green spaces, adequacy of household income and efficiency of emergency services.

While the CPS set a target of 3,181 respondents for Tumakuru, 3,588 citizens had completed the survey by Thursday. The CPS will be available online (at http://eol2019.org/citizenfeedback) till February 29.

Shivamogga came second, with 76% of the target met already. In contrast, only 5% of the target responses have come in from Bengaluru -- 4,381 people took the survey against an expected 90,266.

Karnataka fared poorly on ease of living in 2018, with Mangaluru opening the account at 41st position. The coastal city was followed by Belagavi (ranked 52) while Bengaluru ranked 58. The saving grace for the capital city was that it ranked 16 overall on public open spaces.

Mangaluru, which emerged the most livable city in the state, has not shown much enthusiasm this time around. Only 25% of the target has been met, with over 3,800 responses to go.

Surat: With the arrest of a man travelling from Sharjah with 200 grams of gold worth Rs 9 lakh at Surat airport on late Tuesday night, the lone international flight between Surat and Sharjah has earned a bad name of being the ‘smuggling flight’.

Since it has started its commercial operations from February, 2019, the flight operated by Air India Express, has become favourite for gold smugglers. In the last one year, the air intelligence unit of customs department has seized about six kilograms of smuggled gold worth over Rs 4 crore.

In October, 2019, the air intelligence unit had arrested a man hailing from Valsad with gold bars and bracelets valued at over Rs 90 lakh. The accused had hidden the gold bars and bracelets, stitched in his trousers and shoes to escape the preying eyes of the customs officials.

Nainesh Pachchigar, member of All India Gems and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJF) said, “Gold smuggling has increased as the customs duty on gold has not been reduced by the government. Surat is the hub of jewellery manufacturing and people are trying to get gold through illegal channels to escape paying 12.5% customs duty on gold.”

In many smuggling cases, persons involved in smuggling of gold were residents of Mumbai and they used innovative ways to smuggle the contraband into the diamond city.

While some brought the gold capsules hidden in the rectum, other brought the gold paste stitched in the clothes and shoes.

According to the figures available from Airports Authority of India (AAI), about 4,000 passengers per month use Surat airport to travel to Sharjah. In December last year, the number of passengers from the airport has gone up to about 5,500 per month.

Customs officials stated that the smugglers are aware of the loopholes in the customs laws and they smuggle gold less than Rs 20 lakh value to avoid arrest. The customs rules related to gold import had been changed in 2013. Earlier, passengers with imported gold with less than Rs 5 lakh value allowed to go with a penalty. Customs officials had to file criminal case against the passengers only if imported gold valued at above Rs 5 lakh.

130,['14/02/2020'],"Mathura SHO suspended, another cop removed for not taking FIR of doc’s kidnapping","This story is from February 14, 2020

Agra: Mathura police on Thursday suspended an SHO and transferred a circle officer (CO) — the first for not registering an FIR in the two-month-old case of kidnapping of a doctor for ransom, the last for letting off one of the four kidnappers without registering a case against him. Police have also registered a case against the four suspects allegedly involved in the kidnapping.

ADG (Agra) Ajay Anand said that besides suspending SHO inspector Jagdamba Singh of Highway police station, they have removed CO (Refinery) Jagveer Singh for dereliction of duty. He added that though the doctor had refused to lodge a kidnapping complaint, the concerned police officers should have taken cognizance of the crime and registered a case on their own. Moreover, they let-off one of the kidnapping suspects, who they had tracked down by then. He said the department took action once senior officials became aware of the matter.

Police has also announced a reward of Rs 50,000 each to anyone providing information on the suspects, said IG (Agra) A Satish Ganesh. He told TOI the case has been transferred from Highway PS to the crime branch, with additional SP (crime) given charge of monitoring the case.

According to police, Dr Nirvikalp Agarwal, an orthopedic, was kidnapped on December 10 and later released, after receiving a ransom amount of Rs 52 lakh.

The kidnappers again called him on January 19 to demand another Rs 50 lakh. The terrified doctor, who had refused to lodge a complaint earlier, called police and told them about the extortion call. Highway police worked out the case, nabbed one of the kidnappers from Meerut and recovered of Rs 15 lakh from him, which they reportedly handed over to the doctor. During interrogation, the suspect revealed the names of his three accomplices in the crime, said police.

However, police released the kidnapper after three days of detention without registering an FIR or entering his arrest in the books. When the matter came to the notice of senior officials, they inquired further and took action against the cops who allowed the kidnapper to go scot free.

The FIR was registered on February 11 against four people — Sani Malik, Mahesh, Anoop and Nitesh — under Section 364A (kidnapping for ransom) of IPC, at Highway PS.

131,['14/02/2020'],"Drafting unified Revenue Act will take years, say officials","This story is from February 14, 2020

Hyderabad: The Telangana government may have initiated moves on a new unified Revenue Act to bring in revolutionary changes in the revenue department, but senior officials and legal experts say that it could take several years before it is made into a law.

The state government is planning to repeal nearly 124 Acts, which are redundant and obsolete, and draft the new Act. Officials said the law department had been asked to do look into existing laws, rules and Acts pertaining to the revenue department, including the old draft which was prepared by then Andhra Pradesh government when the state was united. The government is mainly studying the revenue code being implemented by Uttar Pradesh since 2016.

“Though the government is keen on the Act immediately, it is a laborious exercise. The UP government had begun the exercise on revenue code in 2002 and a draft was readied only in 2006 and the assembly passed the bill. But, it took 10 years for sending it to the Centre and and finally getting a presidential assent for the Act,” a senior government official explained.

The officials recalled that a similar effort was made by then TDP government in 1999 but it could not go ahead with it as the then central government had raised 140 queries. Finally, the draft was spiked.

Explaining the long exercise involved in this, land laws’ expert and advocate M Sunil Kumar said there are civic codes, revenue codes and state and central Acts on land revenue issues.

“The previous governments had issued about 2,000 to 3,000 GOs which need to be looked into. Various state government departments like revenue, forest, panchayat raj, municipal administration, survey and settlement need to be consulted as there should not be any contradiction and overlapping with their own Acts and rules. Apart from this, various judgments of the Supreme Court and high courts need to be incorporated in the Act,” Sunil said.

He said the role of the central government would arise in tenancy reforms, registration, land acquisition, ceiling issues and succession.

“The government should simultaneously bring the Title Guarantee Act as the present laws give farmers and owners only presumptive title and not a conclusive one. The title guarantee can be given to the farmers after conducting land survey. This can be done as the model law has already been circulated by the government of India,” advocate Ramesh Nagul said.

Representative image

CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Thursday ordered notice to the state government on a PIL seeking to release Rs 40 crore for the construction of an eight-storey building in Saidapet government hospital as announced in 2017.

A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice R Hemalatha passed the order on a plea moved by a person called R Viswanathan alias MGR Viswanathan and directed the state to file its response by March 13.

According to the petitioner, the government hospital, established in 1920, is under severe space crunch.

Though it is functioning as a 24/7 facility with in-house laboratory, it only has a 50-bed capacity.

The hospital which caters to people from Saidapet, Nandanam, Guindy, Velachery, Alandur, Taramani, Adyar, Thoraipakkam and Sholinganallur has no adequate space to fully function, the petitioner said.

Therefore, in a bid to develop the infrastructure of the hospital the state government announced that it would allot Rs 40 crore for the construction of an eight-storey building. However, the announcement has been put in cold storage due to political and administrative reasons, he said.

Claiming further that staff strength of the hospital is the same as it was in 1970, the petitioner said that the strength was not increased in line with the increase in population in the above areas.

Since the government has failed to respond to his representation dated August 8, 2019, he approached the high court.

There is no check on the ingredients or water used and the cleanliness of the kitchens and cooking staff, they pointed out. Many of the joints operate near drains and public urinals and don’t have running water for washing or cleaning utensils, they said. Besides, the vends dump unsegregated garbage and compromise pedestrian safety by blocking pavements, they alleged.“As this involves the livelihood of the vendors, I will take a decision after discussions with the commissioner and elected representatives,” the mayor said while pointing out that MCC had issued identity cards to the vendors after collecting details about them and their stalls. She said the health and education standing committees would also be consulted.Commissioner Hegde said MCC was planning to move the vendors to designated hawking zones to ensure their livelihood was not affected.

Agra: A body of a 70-year-old priest of Prithvinath Mahadev Temple in Peepal Mandi locality was found at the basement of the education block of SN Medical College (SNMC) on Wednesday. The priest was suffering from tuberculosis and was receiving treatment at the SNMC for past two years.

Identified as Devchand Jha, the priest had visited the SNMC on February 7 for a check-up and reportedly went missing. A missing case was then registered at the MM Gate police station on the complaint of his family. The SNMC administration has now constituted a three-member committee to conduct a probe.

Devchand’s son Babu Kant Jha said, “My father was suffering from tuberculosis. He was receiving treatment at SNMC for past two years. On February 7, he along with my mother Urmila Devi went for tests at the seven-storey building. My mother went to do some paperwork on the second floor after making my father wait in the gallery. On her return after 10 minutes, she could not find my father. We searched for him extensively but were not able to find him. Hospital staff didn’t help us. So, we filed a missing complaint at the MM gate police station on February 8.”

On Wednesday, Devchand’s relatives – after searching for him everywhere for the past few days – went to the building’s basement and found his body in a room.

A postmortem report suggests the main cause of his death was septicaemia. Devchand’s relatives, however, want the SNMC’s administration to show them footage of the building’s CCTV cameras.

SNMC principal GK Aneja said, “In the case related to a patient’s body found in the basement, a three-member committee has been constituted to conduct a probe. The panel will submit its report within three days. Suitable action will be taken on the basis of the probe report.”

Mysuru: Summer is here as are challenges for fire and emergency service personnel as well as forest officers.

The departments have geared up by taking precautions and conducting awareness programmes. The fire department has roped in Home Guards to tackle fire emergencies. Fire department personnel have been instructed not to take long leave during summer as that there’s no manpower shortage.

On an average, the fire department receives at least three calls and the number goes up several-fold in summer. Grass fires in forest areas are common. The forest department has stationed fire engines at vulnerable points.

Chief Fire Officer (in-charge) C Gurulingaiah confirmed to TOI that ten vehicles have been spared for the forest department. They have been sent to all reserve forest areas including Bandipur Tiger Reserve and Nagarahole National Park. These two tiger habitats have witnessed the worst fires in summer.

He said: “Special teams have been formed to attend to any emergencies. As dried grass catches fire and spreads fast, we face difficulties in dousing due to various factors including lack of access routes to the spot.” He’s in charge of five districts in southern Karnataka.

KC Prashanth Kumar, deputy conservator of forests, Mysuru, said all the fires reported in Mysuru forests, including Chamundi Hills last year, had spread from outside. He said: “One fire destroyed vast tracts of grass on the hill shrine in 2019, but all others were small. Utmost precaution is being taken this year to prevent fires. Fire lines have been created and there’s round-the-clock vigil, especially on Chamudi Hills, besides creating awareness on protecting the forest.”

138,['14/02/2020'],Notification for land acquisition issued,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: A year after the previously-issued notification for land acquisition lapsed, the national highway authority of India (NHAI) has issued another gazette notification for the acquisition of land in the Kadambattukonam–Kazhakkoottam stretch for the Cherthala–Thiruvananthapuram NH stretch widening project.

The 3 (A) notification was issued to announce the plan to acquire around 93 hectares. NHAI has issued 3 (A) notification for the 29-km Kazhakkoottam-Kadambattukonam stretch in the last week of January. Sources in NHAI said that they are expecting to complete the process for 3 (D) notification, which is publication of survey numbers and other details of the land after conducting a detailed survey. “Though the 3 (A) notification announces need to acquire 93 hectares, the actual area will be less after survey,” said sources.

NHAI has set a July target for issuing 3 (D) notification. It is also planning to float tender for the construction after publishing 3 (D) notification.

Already, land acquisition has made progress in remaining stretches in districts such as Alappuzha and Kollam. In Kollam, the land acquisition has made significant progress that NHAI is gearing up to publish 3 (D) notification. In Alappuzha, NHAI has completed 3 (A) proceedings.

If 3 (D) notification is not issued within one year after publishing 3 (A), the first notification will not have validity. This has happened to the Kazhakkoottam-Kadambattukonam stretch after ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) removed national highway projects in the state from ‘priority I list’ last year.

Sources in district administration said that though they had uploaded details in NHAI’s online site for publication of 3 (D) notification, it lapsed due to the exclusion of the project from the priority I list. The issue was resolved after the intervention of state government, which agreed to fund 25% of the land acquisition cost for widening of the national highway stretch.

As per the agreement with MoRTH, the 526-km national highway stretch from Thalappady to Kazhakkoottam will be widened in 45 metres.

It will be divided into 13 stretches, including the 29-km Kazhakkoottam–Kadambattukonam stretch. The remaining stretches are 39-km Thalapady–Chengala stretch, 37-km Chengala-Neeleshwaram ROB, 40-km Perole–Thalipparamba stretch, 36-km Thalipparamba–Muzhappilangadu stretch, 39-km Azhiyur–Vengalam stretch, 53-km Ramanattukara–Kuttuppuram stretch, 24-km Kuttippuram–Kappirikkad stretch, 89-km Kappirikkadu–Edappally stretch, 38-km Thuravoor–Paravoor stretch, 38-km Paravoor–Kottankulangara stretch, 32-km Kottankulangara–Kollam bypass stretch and 32-km Kollam bypass–Kadambattukonam stretch.

Allahabad: It was a bizarre turn of events as law enforcers out on a rescue mission ended up themselves needing help, after a group of villagers allegedly manhandled and locked up three policemen for over an hour in Baharia area of the city on Wednesday night.

On Thursday, 23 persons, including seven women, were arrested for allegedly locking up three policemen in a room for over an hour in Karniapur village, under the limits of Baharia police station.

According to police, a police response vehicle (PRV) team was alerted about two rival groups allegedly clashing over illegal construction on a disputed piece of land in Karniapur village around 11pm on Wednesday.

Baharia police said the two groups were led by Ram Prasad and Ram Kumar, who have been at loggerheads over a property since the past two years.

Police also said that Ram Kumar’s son Manoj was supposed to get married on February 16. “However, when the policemen reached the spot, they saw the women from Ram Kumar’s family singing in celebration.

SSP (Allahabad) Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said, “As police started inquiring about the allegations, some of the women got agitated and manhandled the cops. They were later joined by the he rest of the family members and they locked the three policemen in a room.”

The policemen tried to assure the women that they were just trying to find out who called them with the fake information, but the latter were not ready to listen them.

Police said that the person who called them on Wednesday night had claimed that he/she was from Ram Prasad’s family. However, police are still verifying the details of the call.

Meanwhile, local villagers alerted Baharia police that the family had locked up three policemen. The policemen were rescued after more cops from other thanas rushed to their help.

The arrested persons include the groom Manoj. The driver of the PRV Lal Chandra lodged a case under sections 147, 148, 149, 341, 342, 332, 353, 323, 504, and 506 of the Indian Penal Code and section 7 of CLA Act.

killer roads

Allahabad: Promised efforts of the traffic police to curb accidents notwithstanding, there has been no let-up in bloodspill on city roads this year. In fact, the numbers have only gone up, even if marginally.

As many as 45 people lost their lives and 53 were injured in 109 road accidents in January. Most of the victims who died were in the 18-35 age group. During the corresponding period in 2019, there were 103 accidents, which claimed 42 lives and left 68 injured.

The graph is curiously going north at a time city police say they are analysing each and every accident to find out how and why it happened and whether it could have been averted.

Allahabad SSP Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj said speeding was the single largest factor behind majority of accidents. “We are focussed on checking reckless driving. Three police teams equipped with speed guns are manning 22 streets identified as accident-prone. Police stations are also tightening the noose around speed limit violators,” he said.

To make their plan foolproof, the SSP said, traffic police had decided to rope in educational institutions to spread the message of road safety. “Safe driving practices are no secret, but people choose to ignore them all the time. By roping in students to spread the word, we hope to make city streets safer,” he added.

Despite having the lowest number of black spots — only 10 on national highways, state highways and major city arteries combined — among districts, as many as 570 people lost their lives and over 900 were injured in 1,365 road accidents in Allahabad last year.

The summer of 2019 recorded the maximum bloodspill. June saw 71 fatal accidents, followed by March with 68 and May with 59. December, on the other hand, saw 33 deaths and November 43.

DEHRADUN: Uttarakhand cabinet , which met late on Thursday evening at chief minister ’s residence, amended the definition of deemed forest. Now, the state definition of a deemed forest is “a land patch of 5 hectares or more with 40 per cent canopy density”.

In November last year, the government had defined a deemed forest as “a land patch of 10 hectare or above with 60% canopy density and 75% native plant species”. This definition had raised the heckles of environmentalist who had accused the government of “favouring the builder lobby by defining deemed forests in such a manner that many actual forests will not be recognised officially as forests and therefore not require clearance by forest department for commercial activity.”

The matter had also reached the high court which had put a stay on the definition.

The employees would gather at the Parade Ground and thereafter, stage a march towards the secretariat. Earlier too, the General and OBC employees have held a number of protests to push their demands.

Deepak Joshi, the president of state secretariat association told TOI, ""We are expecting presence of over 1.5 lakh employees. Many employees have retired without getting a promotion and we cannot wait any longer. Justice should not be delayed.""

We will not stop till the time justice is delivered. We are also opposing any change in the reservation roster for direct recruitment in government jobs.""

CHENNAI: Southern Railway and Chennai Metro Rail Ltd ( CMRL ) are locked in yet another dispute.

In a letter on February 8, the Tamil Nadu government agency accused the central government department of encroaching 2,680sqft of its land on Tiruvottiyur High Road near Wimco Nagar playground . This comes two months after Southern Railway issued a notice to CMRL over taking control of railway land beside Egmore station.

Railway officials, who requested anonymity, said the latest action of CMRL appeared similar to a tit-for-tat battle between both transportation agencies.

In the letter to the chief administrative officer (CAO), construction, CMRL alleged that Southern Railway has unauthorizedly occupied its land by laying a track foundation and erecting an overhead electric line post in block number 14, ward-C, in Tiruvottiyur town.

The letter written by the estate officer and joint general manager (JGM) of CMRL, is a notice under Section (4) of Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1971, which has asked the railway to explain its stand on or before February 24 and threatened to evict it.

The encroachment is 3.6 metres on the north side, 2.2 metres on the south and 35.8, 28.2 and 22.6 metres on the east and the west side. The total area is 240sqm or 2,680sqft.

Chennai divisional railway manager (DRM) P Mahesh did not respond to calls from TOI for a response.

A highly placed source in Southern Railway told TOI that in railway circles, this was being viewed as a counter-attack from CMRL. “In the Egmore issue in December, railways had publicly pasted a notice for everyone to see,” the source said.

Earlier also, Southern Railway and CMRL have had issues over payment of dues with regard to their lines criss-crossing each other’s property. In fact, a retired top SR official was appointed by CMRL as a consultant to iron out differences with his erstwhile department, said railway sources.

Surat: With the arrest of a man travelling from Sharjah with 200 grams of gold worth Rs 9 lakh at Surat airport on late Tuesday night, the lone international flight between Surat and Sharjah has earned a bad name of being the ‘smuggling flight’.

Since it has started its commercial operations from February, 2019, the flight operated by Air India Express, has become favourite for gold smugglers. In the last one year, the air intelligence unit of customs department has seized about six kilograms of smuggled gold worth over Rs 4 crore.

In October, 2019, the air intelligence unit had arrested a man hailing from Valsad with gold bars and bracelets valued at over Rs 90 lakh. The accused had hidden the gold bars and bracelets, stitched in his trousers and shoes to escape the preying eyes of the customs officials.

Nainesh Pachchigar, member of All India Gems and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJF) said, “Gold smuggling has increased as the customs duty on gold has not been reduced by the government. Surat is the hub of jewellery manufacturing and people are trying to get gold through illegal channels to escape paying 12.5% customs duty on gold.”

In many smuggling cases, persons involved in smuggling of gold were residents of Mumbai and they used innovative ways to smuggle the contraband into the diamond city.

While some brought the gold capsules hidden in the rectum, other brought the gold paste stitched in the clothes and shoes.

According to the figures available from Airports Authority of India (AAI), about 4,000 passengers per month use Surat airport to travel to Sharjah. In December last year, the number of passengers from the airport has gone up to about 5,500 per month.

Customs officials stated that the smugglers are aware of the loopholes in the customs laws and they smuggle gold less than Rs 20 lakh value to avoid arrest. The customs rules related to gold import had been changed in 2013. Earlier, passengers with imported gold with less than Rs 5 lakh value allowed to go with a penalty. Customs officials had to file criminal case against the passengers only if imported gold valued at above Rs 5 lakh.

HASSAN: The attempt of a woman and her boyfriend to kill her husband went horribly wrong with the latter successfully resisting it at Maragondanahalli village in Arasikere Rural police limits.

The incident happened around midnight on Monday, after which the woman, Ramya, 24, and her unidentified lover have gone underground.

It is said Ramya laced poison with food and fed dinner to her husband Anand, 34, a farmer. She and her lover had planned to strangulate Anand when he was fast asleep after dinner that would induce him sound sleep.

With the help of her boyfriend, Ramya allegedly tied her husband’s hands and legs to the cot using veils. But when the lovers tried strangulating Anand using another veil, he woke up and screamed. Hearing his SOS calls, his mother Nanjundamma too woke up and cried for help. Convinced that their game was up, the lovers fled the spot on a motorbike.

After preliminary treatment at the taluk hospital, Anand was referred to the district hospital, where is recovering.

A case was registered on Tuesday evening under IPC sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 34 (criminal act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).

CHENNAI: As many as 2,000 people with disabilities in the state will be provided new battery-operated wheelchairs by April, said V Saroja, minister of social welfare and nutritious meal programme. She made the announcement at an event on Thursday. “The 2,000 people we have on the list are in dire need and they will be given the wheelchairs first,” said the minister. “Later, we will distribute the chairs to others depending on their medical need,” she said and added that the chairs cost Rs 72,000 each.

The government made the announcement regarding this last year but was criticised by activists and people with disabilities after it allegedly failed to fulfill its promise. In 2017 too the government said it would provide 1,000 motorised wheelchairs , but less than 200 people received it. Some beneficiaries claimed they were damaged.

Johny Tom Varghese, commissioner of department of welfare of differently abled persons, said the wheelchairs have a 3-year guarantee and people can approach the distributing agency in case of repairs. “As many as 872 people have been provided with the automated wheelchairs. They had severe spinal disorders. Five thousand more are in the pipeline and they will be distributed soon.”

Saroja announced that they will also implement home-based intervention programmes in 23 blocks in Tirunelveli and Tuticorin districts. As part this, an early intervention specialist will visit the child and its family at home and provide comprehensive services. It is meant to serve children aged under five with developmental delays and disabilities and help address their unique needs. “A child responds better when he/she is at home with their families. This pilot project was successful, hence we decided to expand it to other rural areas. But, we are also looking at expanding the services across the state,” said Saroja. A sum of Rs 2.37 crore has been sanctioned for the project.

Indore: Smart solutions for Smart City. Roadside haat bazaars and vegetable markets will soon disappear to ensure free flow of traffic in Indore. Nine hawker zones are being developed by Indore Municipal Corporation to accommodate vendors of 11 bazaars to end roadside clutter and chaos. This is a fresh plan by civic officials to set up hawker zones across city as earlier plans could not materialize due to lack of intent, execution plans and resistance from vendors.

The list includes markets of areas like Luv Kush Mandi, Barla Khajrana, Malwa Mill, Itwariya Bazaar among others. Three more such markets have earlier been shifted by civic body from Pipliyahana, Navlakha and Patnipura.

Civic body’s public works department officials said that an independent survey was conducted to identify vegetable markets or haat bazaars obstructing free flow of traffic and ascertain number of vendors or shopkeepers in each one of these markets.

“Work on developing alternate space as hawker zones by providing basic facilities to vendors like water, lights etc are on. Once it gets done, corporation will start shifting these markets to hawker zones,” Tomar added.

These markets were identified on basis of a list prepared by city traffic police, where people have to search for parking space and get stuck in long traffic jams.

BHUBANESWAR: Mismanagement in paddy procurement, law and order, corruption, unemployment and irregularities in implementation of rural housing schemes are some on the issues on which the opposition parties are planning to corner the government when the budget session of the assembly kicks off on Friday.

The ruling BJD has also chalked out its strategy to counter the opposition attack with chief minister Naveen Patnaik chairing a meeting of the legislature party members on Thursday.

“The important budget session of the assembly begins on Friday. As far as the opposition parties are concerned, we are ready to face any question on the floor of the house,” Naveen told reporters after the meeting. Naveen also asked his party MLAs to be present in the house during key businesses like question hour, zero-hour, adjournment debates, budget discussion and during discussion on issues related to the state’s interest. The MLAs have been asked to inform government chief whip Pramila Mallik in case they are on leave. The BJP and the Congress too held legislature party meetings on the eve of the budget session. Briefing reporters, BJP chief whip Mohan Majhi said, “The state government has deprived the backward classes in providing their constitutional rights. There has been gross irregularities in selection of beneficiaries under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. The mandi system has collapsed while farmers are facing a tough time. Crime against women are also increasing. All these issues will be raised by our party to corner the government during the session.” Congress legislature party leader Narasingha Mishra said farmers are under distress as they are not able to sell their paddy because of the discrepancies in the paddy procurement system. “Law and order situation has collapsed in the state. Incidents like robbery, murder and rape has increased in Odisha . Corruption is at its peak. Other issues like failure in implementation of state government schemes and unemployment issues will also be raised by the Congress party,” said Mishra.

Indore: Times change. Arrival of new fancy gifts like stuffed toys, greeting cards, imported chocolates and mirror based digital photo-frames has changed the trend of Valentine’s Day gift making this ‘the best of times’ for florists turn into an era, where survival is considered an existential win.

“It’s only on Rose day of Valentine’s week that flower business flourishes since it’s a mandatory custom followed by the cupid-struck. Earlier, people used to propose by just offering a rose bouquet, when sales were constant and monetary losses incurred were less,” said florist Anil Agrawal.

Another cause for decline in business of floral industry is large influx of artificial flowers, which is hampering livelihood of local and small florists. People are lured towards artificial flowers because of its durability and constant freshness. “This year, business has seen a decline of 35-40% compared to last year’s Valentine’s week sale. The new age couples are inclined towards exchange of gifts and purchase flowers only as a symbolic gesture,” said another florist Akash Limbodiya.

Lifespan of flowers is two weeks at the most but gift items stay intact for a longer duration thereby making it more preferable.

“Without a flower bouquet, my Valentine’s Day would be incomplete, but now the prices of rose bouquets are sky high. I only buy a pair of rose to keep with the spirit of Valentine’s Day,” said Ushma Upadhayaya.

The Uttarakhand high court

NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) on Thursday ordered the state government to look into the allegations of atrocities committed by the chief warder of Chamoli Jail .

The high court has taken suo motu cognizance of a letter written by a group of prisoners who alleged that warder of the jail has brutally beaten up several prisoners and in some cases even draped them in blanket and then used a stick to deal severe blows on the feet. “The court has taken a stern view on these allegations and has asked us to check the veracity of the allegations and respond within a week,” said Paresh Tripathi, chief standing counsel for the Uttarakhand government.

The letter has also alleged that warder doesn’t even allow inmates basic activities and if his orders are not followed, the inmates are again harassed. The inmates alleged that the harassment and physical torture are very common in the jail but the authorities have taken no action against the warder

Tripathi, meanwhile, added that they will look into the serious allegations and file a response on the next date of hearing.

The condition of jails and the lack of even basic facilities have been an issue in Uttarakhand. The court had earlier taken cognizance of another letter written by the inmates who had said that jail didn’t even have telephones for inmates to call their families.

The government, meanwhile, has now said that it will install calling facilities in jails across the state in collaboration with the BSNL and the inmates will be allowed to talk to their families for a limited time.

Slow progress of land acquisition and lack of adequate funds are some of the reasons behind delay in implementation of the project, an official said. “I reviewed the progress of the Khurda Road-Balangir rail project. Instruction has been issued to expedite the land acquisition process,” said state commerce and transport minister Padmanabha Behera.

An official said the Prime Minister’s Office has been reviewing progress of the major infrastructure project.

Responding to queries on delay in land acquisition, Behera said, the delay in land acquisition is because of hurdles in acquisition of forest land. As the project is set to pass through some of the economically-backward and less-rail connected districts like Nayagarh, Boudh, Sonepur and Balangir, completion of the project is one of the priorities of both the state government and railways.

An official source said land acquisition for the project in Sonepur and Nayagarh district is in the final stage while that in Balangir has been completed. Land acquisition is mostly incomplete in Boudh district.

“Of around 2,050 acres of private land, we have so far acquired around 200 acres for the project. The process has been expedited to acquire the remaining land. In Boudh, around 500 acres of forest land will be acquired,” said a senior government official.

In Sonepur, the government has so far acquired over 400 acres of private land of the total requirement of 522 acres. Acquisition of 80 acres of total 105 acres of government land has been completed. All private land in Nayagarh district has been acquired except land in two villages, an official said.

The government and rail ministry had signed an MoU in July 2015 to jointly develop the Daspalla-Balangir (177km) stretch. According to the MoU, the state government commits to provide land free of cost and bear 50% of the project cost.

The Centre has also made substantial allocation for the project in last few years. While around Rs 700 crore was allocated in 2017-18, it got Rs 625 crore in 2018-19. It received Rs 350 crore in 2019-20 and Rs 520 crore in 2020-21.

GURUGRAM: A gang that honeytrapped people after luring them on an online dating app for gay , bisexual and transgenders is believed to have targeted at least 50 senior officials employed with multinational and homegrown companies in the city.Inspector Mukesh, the SHO of Badshapur police station whose team arrested five members of the gang, said they had targeted scores of affluent people over the past few months but most had refrained from approaching police for fear of social stigma. That the victims held senior posts in their offices made the job easier for the gang, which worked on the assumption that the targets would not share their ordeal with others.The SHO said the gang’s kingpin, who is from Bhondsi, had told interrogators they got the idea of honeytrapping senior officials from a friend who had targeted gullible people with the same modus operandi. The gang would first trap officials on a dating app for gay and bisexual people, and then one of their members would fix up a meeting. He would then ask the victim to drive him to a secluded place on the highway, where other members of the gang would attack him. The victims, who included even CEOs of private companies, would not only be robbed of valuables but also blackmailed with objectionable pictures. “The kingpin told us he had got the idea from a friend and then formed a gang to execute it. We are sure more people have been targeted by the gang in a similar manner. So far, only one person has forward to lodge a complaint,” said Mukesh.The lone complaint lodged against the gang states, “I got a request on the site and they called me to Southern Peripheral Road. Then, they made me sit in the front seat next to a man who identified himself as Prince. Three men seated themselves in the rear seat and moments later, they snatched my wallet and bag and withdrew money from my bank account.” On the basis of the complaint, an FIR has been registered against the gang under sections 379 A and 34 of the IPC, accounting for theft and acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.Sources said though the gang members were not very educated, they hired engineers with good command over English so that they can cast an impression on their targets over time. Though profiles of members are not mentioned in detail on the app, the gang went for relatively affluent people so that they can exact a good amount.In Video: Gurugram: 50 executives trapped on gay dating app, robbed by gang",gurgaon,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74126413,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-372550,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/50-executives-trapped-on-gay-dating-app-robbed-by-gang/articleshow/74126067.cms

Indore: Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) on Thursday launched an inquiry to identify employees involved in sending a letter with fake signature of an additional commissioner to obtain login id and password of e-nagar palika system.

Sources claimed involvement of four to five employees, but corporation officials said that those involved in the act are yet to be identified.

IMC commissioner Asheesh Singh launched an inquiry into the matter stating that employees found involved in the forgery won’t be spared.

“The matter has come to my knowledge. Thankfully, the matter has come to light before any misconduct or fraud could be committed. An additional commissioner level inquiry has been launched into the matter. Those found involved would not only face departmental inquiry, but police complaint would also be filed against them,” said the commissioner.

Corporation officials said that unidentified employees were found to have used digital image of signature of IMC additional commissioner SK Chaitanya to raise a request for obtaining login id and password of e-NagarPalika.

“The accused sent a letter to e-NagarPalika cell of state urban administration department on February 10 for issuance of fresh login id and password in name of a senior clerk level employee,” they said.

The matter came to light after officials in Bhopal suspected the language in which the letter was written and raised a query with the additional commissioner if he had sent a letter.

The additional commissioner SK Chaitanya said that the matter came to his knowledge when a query was raised by e-palika cell. “I was in Bhopal on the day when this letter was sent to e-nagar palika cell. We found that the letter was not sent from IMC’s revenue department. We are looking into the matter,” Chaitanya told TOI.

“If needed, we would also seek assistance from cyber cell to nab those involved in this act of forgery,” he added. TNN

Indore: Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) on Thursday filed closure report before a special court in case of MBBS student Namrata Damor ’s death, whose body was found in Ujjain near railway tracks in 2012.

Her name had surfaced in Vyapam scam. CBI filed the closure report before a special court concluding that Damor had committed suicide, official sources said.

A similar report was filed by CBI in 2017, but it was rejected by court last year after finding several loopholes. CBI officials claimed that they have recorded fresh statements of witnesses and doctors, who conducted autopsy. Some witnesses featuring in the old report were also re-examined. The suspicion over nature of death grew, when two panels of doctors gave conflicting reports – one suggested it was a murder by smothering while other concluded that it was a suicide by jumping in front of a train. Damor’s case came to limelight following exposure of Vyapam scam in 2013 involving illegal admissions in professional courses. A student of MBBS course in MGM Medical College, Damor was suspected of securing admission through Vyapam racketeers.

Deaths of people known to be associated with the scam raised eyebrows from different quarters. The mysterious death of a TV journalist in Jhabua brought the focus back on to the death. TNN

Parents have also alleged that schools are charging arbitrary fees and that several schools in the district have been forcing parents and students to buy all the school accessories and even help books from shops within schools or designated contractors outside the campus. “These shops sell books as well as uniforms at prices much higher than the market rates and therefore are harassing us. If students choose to buy the items from the market, the schools even harass them,” the parents alleged.

Indore: A joint team of health department, district administration and police raided dispensary of a quack in Banganga on Thursday evening.

The team comprising in charge of PC Sethi Hospital Dr Madhav Hasani and district health officer (second) Dr Praveen Sisodia seized allopathic medicine, syringe and other items.

Hasani said that they had seized allopathic drugs, syringe and injections from shop of one quack with degree of Bachelor of Electro-Homeopathy Medicine and Surgery (BEMS) but prescribing allopathic medicine to patients. “We will issue notice to him as per rules,” said Hasani.

According to a source in health department, there are over 5000 quacks operating in the city. Chief medical and health officer Dr Praveen Jadia said that they had received complaint against one Heeralal Jhade operating allopathic clinic in Kushwaha Nagar without relevant degree.

When a team raided his clinic, they found many allopathic drugs, injection, nebulizer and other things required in allopathic treatment. “We have also seized his document,” said Jadia.

Dr Sanjay Lodhe, vice-president of MP state chapter of IMA said, “There are over 6,000 quacks in district. We have been fighting this for last one decade. The health department has taken a good initiative and this should continue.”

“The problem is that there is no prescribed law under which quacks can be booked. The norms prescribed by MCI only bars ill practice but there are no law to book them neither in IPC nor in health,” added Lodhe.

Thiruvananthapuram: Breaking away from the clichéd love letter writing competition, the students of Kerala University ’s Kariavattom Campus have arranged a special Valentine’s Day celebration on Friday.

The institute has invited lesbian couple Ashitha and Sulfath to the campus to interact with the students. They will be interacting with the students on the topic ‘Love and Boundaries’. The event is organized by departments, students’ union and researchers union at aquatic biology hall at 11am.

Ashitha Dhavanya, is a final year student at School of Drama, Thrissur, while Sulfath A, is a third-year graduation student of Chemistry at Sanatana Dharma College, Alappuzha.

“Every year we organize some activity to mark the Valentine’s Day. While planning the event this year, we thought of making it a platform for people from LGBTIQ community to communicate with the students,” said Ramshad Khan, chairman of departments students’ union.

“When the government supporting them (LGBTIQ) and adopting policy, we as students have some responsibility towards society and those who are part of the society. We believe that love does not have any boundaries. Being a special day, we decided to invite a couple. We reached out to Ashitha and Sulfath through our network of friends,” added Ramshad.

The couple will share their story with the students, which will be followed by the interactive session.

“We (Ashitha and Sulfath) met during queer pride events and later fell in love. Her family was supportive when she came out, but I did not get the same support. Now, I am working with government agencies to meet the expenses of my education. It is our first Valentine’s Day and we are glad to be invited to the University of Kerala campus in our own identity. The campus is always associated with liberals and we are glad to be part of the V-Day event. We both are busy with our studies and research and will be meeting each other after a long time at the programme,” said Sulfath.

177,['14/02/2020'],ISL: Yellow cards can derail FC Goa,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Panaji: When Brandon Fernandes picked up a booking against Mumbai City FC, his seventh yellow card of the season, there was a collective disbelief among FC Goa officials, both on and off the field.

When Seriton Fernandes got booked late in the game, he couldn’t believe what he did. That’s why he pleaded with German referee Dingert Christian and could have made it worse by grabbing his hand, twice. Seriton knows how important it was for him to stay card-free for the last two league games. But his booking, with eight minutes left, means he will now miss the crucial and possibly decisive battle against Jamshedpur FC next week.

Brandon has already missed one game due to suspension. He was out of action against ATK, a match Goa missed him terribly on the wings in Kolkata last month. With seven bookings, he will now miss the Jamshedpur clash, giving technical director Derrick Pereira and interim coach Clifford Miranda plenty to think about.

This is not the time for experimentation so Brandon’s replacement will be a straight-forward one. Seiminlen Doungel will step into his boots, although it remains to be seen whether he can bring the same creativity.

Stepping into the boots of Seriton will be a bigger headache. The right-back has played every game of FC Goa’s campaign in the Indian Super League ( ISL ) this season and to suddenly have a new player – almost certainly Amey Ranawade – fill that void could be a tough ask. Amey has been on the field for just five minutes this season.

Now that Goa have sealed a place in the play-offs, there could be more trouble for them at the most crucial stage. Two of their players – Hugo Boumous and Lenny Rodrigues – are on three bookings and will miss the first leg semifinal if they get into the referee’s book against Jamshedpur.

According to Article 4.8 of the ISL Regulations. “suspension resulting from accumulation of cautions in League matches shall carry over to the respective player’s first playoff match with the effect that the player shall be suspended from playing in such first playoff match.”

All players who have three bookings, or one yellow card away from suspension, at the end of he league stage will start afresh in the playoffs.

For playoff matches, a player who received two cautions in two different matches will automatically be suspended from participating in the final.

178,['14/02/2020'],Panel finds irregularities in fee collected at pvt schools,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Vijayawada: The Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERMC) conducted surprise inspections at 130 schools across the state on Thursday.

The commission paid special attention to schools collecting exorbitant fees, with the body focusing on regulating fees collected.

The state government, which is focusing on streamlining school education, had brought in major reforms in government schools. On the other hand, APSERMC, headed by Justice Kantha Rao, has been focusing on streamlining private schools which are looting parents in the name of being international schools, having a ‘techno curriculum’ and providing their children education which they deem is of international standard.

Several teams, led by district level officials of the education department, conducted inspections in 10 schools in each district on Thursday. While district education officers led these teams and inspected the amenities provided by the private schools, APSERMC members acted as observers during the inspection process.

The schools that were inspected offered CBSE and State syllabi. Officials inspected records and accounts related to fees collected by the school management. They cross-checked the actual fees collected by the schools and found that the schools were giving receipts for a lesser fee than the amount that was collected from the parents.

The APSERMC also observed that most of the schools which claimed to be ‘international schools’ were running their campuses at apartment buildings which were meant for residential purpose. The committee also observed that some schools had poor ventilation, unhygienic toilets, employed improper teaching methods that often induced stress in students.

APSERMC vice-chairperson Vijaya Sharada Reddy was also present during the inspection of some schools in Krishna and Guntur districts and interacted with students.

The committee also found that while the schools were collecting fees exorbitant fees from students, they didn’t provide infrastructure and amenities to the students.

The committee is also considering introducing a grading system for schools from the coming academic year to regulate fees collected by corporate schools.

Deputy CM Nitin Patel held separate meetings with representatives of both sides and both continued to hold on ... Read More

GANDHINAGAR: Even as the Gujarat government is racing against time to complete preparations for the forthcoming high profile visit of US President Donald Trump , it has been caught in a bind over the contentious issue of reservation.

Members of both reserved and unreserved communities are protesting over a government resolution that bars reserved category women from applying for the general category seats in government recruitment examinations.

While women of reserved categories have been protesting against the resolution for over two months, demanding that it be scrapped, members of unreserved communities began protesting from Wednesday after the government announced that it will modify the circular to ensure nobody faces injustice in recruitment.

Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel held separate meetings with representatives of both sides and both continued to hold on to their tough stance. Nitin Patel however, was optimistic that a solution acceptable to both sides could be arrived at. “The CM had directed me and Pradipsinh Jadeja to meet the groups and listen to their demands. We have met different groups of non-reserve caste today and heard their representation over the GR dated August 1, 2018. We will brief the CM on Friday. Government will find a solution which is acceptable to both sides,” Patel said.

The bone of contention is a government resolution passed by Vijay Rupani-led government on August 1, 2018, that barred reserved category women from applying in the general category seats. Trouble started about two months ago, when the government announced results of the Lok Rakshak Dal (LRD) exams and applied the GR in the recruitment process.

Dinesh Bambhania, Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) leader, who led the delegation of the non-reserved caste delegation, said, “We have categorically told the government that if any change is made in the August 1, 2018 GR, we will further intensify our protest. We are not against any community, but we expect the government to follow directions of the Supreme Court.”

Hasmukh Saxsena, Bandharaniya Adhikar Andolan Samiti (BAAS) which is supporting the protest of SC/ST/OBC women LRD aspirants, said “We feel that attempts are being made to create a rift in society by provoking women from non-reserved category to protest.

180,['14/02/2020'],"Building norm violators snub notice, corp gears up for action","This story is from February 14, 2020

Thiruvananthapuram: The town planning committee, which convened the meeting of city corporation’s special squad here on Thursday following detection of parking norms violations, producing of fake building numbers and tax evasion by many commercial buildings in the city, noted that only 10 owners have so far responded to the notice issued by the corporation in this regard.

As many as 32 establishments were inspected and served notices in January.

Almost a month after the notices were served, no response has been reported from 22 establishments. Some of them have communicated that their owners are abroad and that they are not in a position to furnish the original building plan and conditions agreed by them at the time of allocation of building permit and issuance of occupancy certificate.

The committee has now decided to affix notices on these buildings in a visible manner citing that non cooperation from their part and no submission of explanation in response to the notice would lead to cancellation of the building numbers.

The town planning committee has collected details of all the buildings which were inspected from tax assessment registers.

The total area, plinth area, commercial space, number of floors and tax being paid were collected.

The compilation process revealed that some of the building numbers produced by the owners were not recorded in tax assessment register proving that such numbers were fabricated and the building was altered rendering it unauthorized.

The officials said that there were cases in which number was obtained for a small commercial space and a larger area was then used for commercial purpose, without ensuring mandatory parking space and by evading tax.

It was also found that a building which functioned as a hotel in Kuravankonam paid an annual tax of just Rs 46. The revenue wing will take over such cases of tax evasion and penalty will be levied from such buildings quoting relevant sections of Kerala Municipality Act.

The special squad is working on assessing the commercial area of each building based on details garnered from the tax assessment register.

The mandatory parking space for respective commercial area will be calculated and if this area is found inadequate in the buildings for which notices have been served, action will be taken, which will amount to cancellation of building numbers and hefty fines as applicable to unauthorised constructions.

Palayam Rajan, chairman, town planning committee, said that the special squad will do another round of inspection and compile a final report by the end of this month.

The special squad has been constituted comprising executive engineer of central zone, three assistant engineers, assistant revenue officer, two revenue inspectors and bill collectors of the wards where inspection was done.

Pune: Conventional expression of love has taken a back seat for many Puneites this Valentine’s season with them opting for helicopter rides, camping and other out-of-the-box experiences to replace the usual trend of presenting dear ones with bouquets and gifts.

In an unconventional twist, almost 70 couples have booked a special helicopter ride with Vighnahar Aviation on the occasion of Valentine’s Day. “The 8-10 minute ride will offer couples an aerial view of the scenic Pashan Lake, Oxford Golf Course, Pune-Mumbai Expressway and Balewadi stadium. We will provide them with refreshments during the ride,” the owner of Vighnahar Aviation, Saurabh Pol, said.

“Almost 75% of the bookings are surprises. Many people have also asked us to make special arrangements as they plan to propose their partners during or after the helicopter ride,” Pol added.

Pune-based working professional Mona Agarwal has opted for the helicopter ride to surprise her partner Akshay Singhal. She said, “I have asked the company to arrange for a cake as I plan to propose him during the ride. The cake will carry the question ‘Will you marry me?’ and will be accompanied by a small gift.”

To serve lyrical justice to their love, Pune resident Nandita Kulkarni is set to surprise her husband with a special song. “I recorded the song ‘Aaiyein Meherbaan’ from Howrah Bridge in a professional studio with a sound engineer’s assistance,” she said.

Kulkarni opted for the recording on www.wishfunda.com, which has many other unique experiences in store for couples this Valentine’s Day.

“Cooking together under expert guidance, gifting one’s partner a makeover with a celebrity stylist, a mead tasting or sound healing session, and painting together, are some of the other experiences that we are offering,” said an employee working with the website.

Many couples have chosen to ditch the routine parties to spend their V-Day evening under a blanket of stars in the heart of nature.

Mehek Desai, from ‘Into the Wild Camp’ at Bhimashankar, said, “We are offering a special couple’s package, which includes meals, couple games and live music at a campsite themed on Valentine’s Day. We have registered 10 to 12 bookings till Thursday afternoon.”

According to Desai, people are looking to spend quality time with their partners.

“People want a relaxed evening with their partners rather than spending it in clubs,” she explained.

PUNE: The body of a two-year-old boy was recovered by firemen from the Mutha river near the Mhatre bridge on Thursday, a day after he fell into a nullah at Dattawadi while playing near his house, police said.

Sanksar Suryakant Sable of Mhasobanagar in Dattawadi was washed away by the gushing waters after he fell into the nullah around 5.30pm on Wednesday.

Some local people noticed the child being swept away and alerted his parents. The nullah flows into the Mutha river.

After receiving the information, a team from the Pune fire brigade reached the spot and carried out searches in the nullah. The fire brigade had to abandon the search operation on Wednesday night as it was pitch dark.

Rajesh Jagtap, fire officer, Pune fire brigade, told TOI that about 35 firemen and four officers began searching the boy from 7am on Thursday. “Garbage had piled up in the nullah. Three branches of a tree were in the water. We had to use an earthmoving machine to clear the garbage,” Jagtap said.

He said that the firemen checked every nook and corner of the nullah. “We even checked all the gaps in the wall of the nullah, suspecting that the boy may have got stuck in one of the gaps,” Jagtap said.

“Our teams went into the river and carried out searches. Around 2.30pm, we found the body in the river near the Mhatre bridge,” Jagtap said.

Jagtap said that the water level of the nullah increases in the evening after excess water is released into it from a water purification plant at Parvati.

The Dattawadi police said that the boy’s family hails from Beed district. His parents had recently shifted to Pune in search of work. “We have registered a case of accidental death,” said an officer from the Dattawadi police.

Ujjain: Five NRIs from Netherlands have lodged a complaint with Mahakal temple committee alleging that a priest fraudulently took Rs 13,000 from them to procure permission to attend Bhasmaarti ritual at the temple.

The complainants claimed that they became suspicious when they were not allowed to go close to Shivalinga, despite being told that the money was taken by Shri Mahakaleshwar Temple Committee to grant them permission to attend Bhasmaarti and perform special rituals.

NRI Krishna Sharma told the temple assistant administrator and tehsildar Mulchand Junwal that Rs 10,000 was taken for the Bhasmarti permission and Rs 3000 for special Pooja. “The NRIs claimed that the money was taken by priest Gopal Vyas through his son, who reached an Indore hotel to collect it from the complainants,” Junwal said.

The NRIs grew suspicious when they were not granted close access to Shivlinga and approached the temple office, only to find that no fee is charged for Bhasmarti permission. In an initial probe conducted by temple authorities, it was found that the letterhead of the accused priest – who is registered with the temple committee – was used to secure permission for the NRIs.

“We have suspended the priest and a letter has been written to Mahakal police station for lodging a formal FIR against the accused,” Junwal said. Additional SP Rupesh Dwivedi said the police was yet to receive the letter from temple committee. “Appropriate action will be taken once the complaint is received,” he said. Priest Vyas remained incommunicado after the matter came to fore.

Doctors have advised that only one member of the family should engage in taking care of a swine flu patient to prevent everyone from getting infected. One should wash hands frequently, wear a mask when in the vicinity of the patient, take care of cleanliness inside the patient’s room and use separate utensils for the patient, doctors said.

Children below five years of age, the elderly, especially above 65 years old, pregnant women and people with prolonged respiratory disease fall in the high-risk group patients and should exercise more caution.

“Private hospitals have been asked to set up isolation wards for patients of swine flu to ensure that other patients or hospital staff are not infected,” said Dr Raj Kumar, Meerut chief medical officer.

But, the withdrawn amount was not debited from the accounts because of his “pin trick”.A team of the cybercrime police zeroed in on Satyavruta Kaushalprasad Dwivedi (23) on Friday in Allahabad. He made cash withdrawals of Rs10,000 each from 14 ATMs of different banks before he ran out of luck.Dwivedi would put a safety pin in the cash dispenser of the ATM at the time of collecting cash, resulting in an “incomplete transaction” signal going to the bank. The bank would then revert the “incomplete transaction” amount to the account holder despite Dwivedi collecting the cash from the ATM.Senior inspector Rajkumar Wakchaure of the Cybercrime police station said Dwivedi would travel to the city and stay in hotels. He targeted ATMs in Baner, Sangvi, Shivajinagar, Pimpri and Chinchwad over the past few days.The officials of a bank spotted Dwivedi lingering in an ATM kiosk in Baner for a long time. The CCTV footage of the ATM showed him buying time inside the kiosk and the bank concerned receiving an “incomplete transaction” signal at the same time.The officials reported the incident to the Cybercrime police station. The police then studied the CCTV footage and tracked down the details of the bank accounts, leading to the arrest of Dwivedi.Wakchaure said Dwivedi was a graduate and had a good friends’ circle in Allahabad. “His friends would insert a small pin before the flap of the cash dispensing tray of the ATM unit before it completely shut down. This would send a signal to the bank concerned that the transaction was not completed, and the amount withdrawn would be reverted to the account holder.”Dwivedi used the same trick to withdraw cash from some ATMs in Allahabad first.

A farmer from Karjan in his farm of rose plants

Vadodara: Talk about love and the first image that floats in your mind is that of a vibrant red velvety rose. While the flower been synonymous with Valentine’s Day, the Gujarati farmers seem particularly smitten by a sweet smelling variety that comes from the Kashmir Valley. Hundreds of farmers in and around Vadodara have been seen growing this special breed of Kashmiri roses for the past few years.

The roses have not just reduced farmers’ hard labour but also helped them double their income.

“I used to plant ‘desi’ rose varieties for years. But a few years ago, I learnt about the Kashmiri roses that last longer and also fetch almost double the price. So I began growing these roses,” said Vishal Patel, a farmer from Bil village in Padra.

“Over the last five years, my income has gone up considerably. I now sow only Kashmiri roses round the year. Many farmers in my village have also started planting Kashmiri roses after they saw the benefits,” Patel said, adding that he ships his roses to Mumbai and Bengaluru where these are in great demand.

Kashmiri roses are grown mainly in the villages of Karjan taluka including Deroli, Ranapur, Kothiya, Nanikoral and Motikoral.

“Life of a local variety of rose is just 10 to 12 hours but the Kashmiri roses last for two to three days. Also, the growers get almost double the price by selling the Kashmiri roses that require no additional cost,” said Yogesh Patel, horticulture officer, Vadodara.

Local farmers also say that plucking Kashmiri roses is also far easier.

“Desi roses have to be plucked in the night and transported immediately to the markets before dawn. Kashmiri roses can be plucked in the daytime and sent to the markets even on the next day. Unlike the thorny stems of local rose, Kashmiri rose plants are not thorny which makes it easier for plucking,” Patel added.

MEERUT: A 17-year-old rape survivor , a resident of Mawana, allegedly committed suicide on Wednesday. Family of the deceased claimed that she was peeved over “police inaction” in her rape case where the 65-year-old accused is still at large. Though the deceased didn’t leave behind any suicide note, her family stated that their daughter was “receiving repeated threats to settle the case and was very upset”.

Now, Meerut SSP Ajay Sahni has shunted the local SHO to police lines for “dereliction of duty”. But, according to police, the family of the rape survivor initially made conflicting claims. Medical report also didn’t corroborate claims of rape, they said.

Father of the rape survivor said, “The police didn’t take any action against the accused and has instead been harassing us with questions. Earlier, the police didn’t care to probe the rape case and has now been reaching out to us after my daughter committed suicide. My daughter had dropped out of school over threats from the accused who is still absconding.”

The heinous crime took place on January 19, this year, when the 65-year-old accused, Brahmapal, allegedly raped the minor girl at gunpoint when his father, a daily-wage labourer, was out for work.

Family also claimed that the accused was threatening to settle the case and all this while local cops looked the other way. However, SSP Sahni said, “Rape was not corroborated in the medical report. Investigation in the case is pending. It was also brought to our notice that three written complaints with different versions of the crime were given to local police on the day FIR of the rape case was registered. Prima facie, a case of rape has been registered to settle scores in an ongoing village election rivalry.”

Pune: The civic body will seek data of rented residential properties from the city police, based on which tax discounts to such units would be discontinued.

The property tax department of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said there were about 9 lakh residential properties in the city, many of which were rented out by the owners.

“These units are not eligible for the 40% discount in property tax. The administration has already initiated steps to discontinue the discount for such properties,” a senior PMC official said.

“We will now seek data from the Pune police to identify more properties, which are still availing the tax discount despite being put on rent,” the official added.

He said officials from the property tax department were also paying random visits to properties availing the tax discount.

The civic administration said every property owner was expected to inform the civic body if the property had been rented out. “However, it has been observed that the owners are not providing such details as they do not want to lose out on the 40% discount in property tax. This is the primary reason for the civic administration to start door-to-door survey,” another civic official said.

The administration’s steps to identify the rented properties follows the appointment of a committee to propose measures to boost the civic body’s income. The committee had suggested to the PMC to plug loopholes in recovery of property tax arrears and identify rented properties, which are still availing the discount.

“The committee has suggested to identify all the rented properties in the city, which are availing 40% discount,” the official said.

Agra: 15-year-old Dheera (name changed) was studying in class XI when history-sheeter Achman Upadhyay allegedly abducted her from Shikohabad and raped her last August. He had been stalking her for three years. She has quit studies ever since and is trying to recover from the trauma. However, her world came crashing on Monday when the accused shot dead her father for refusing to relent to repeated threats to withdraw the rape case. Now, she wants nothing less than death for the accused.

Dheera said, “I want death for Achman. He destroyed my life and killed my father.” Her 37-year-old father was the sole bread-winner of their family of six. The second eldest among four siblings, the burden of responsibilities is now on her young shoulders. Her elder sister had got married a couple of years ago.

Her septuagenarian grandfather said, “Achman is our neighbour. His father too had a criminal history. While Dheera was in class IX, he started stalking her. Unable to find any way out, we decided to shift her to her maternal grandparents’ home for her to be able to continue her studies. However, on August 26 last year, Achman met the girl while she was heading to school. He lied to her that her father was involved in an accident and took her to his relative’s home in Tilak Nagar. He confined her there and raped her.” “When she resisted the rape, he smashed her head on the wall and even tried to strangulate her. He also made a video of the act. Later, she managed to escape his clutches and reached home,” he added.

The septuagenarian further said, “On learning about her ordeal, we lodged a complaint against Achman, based on which police registered a case against him under IPC section 376 (rape), 363 (kidnapping), 307 (attempt to murder), 342 (wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation) and relevant sections of the Pocso Act. Despite repeated efforts, he was never arrested, until Wednesday night.”

The survivor’s father, who was an electrician and the sole bread earner of the family, was fighting tooth and nail for justice to his daughter. Achman had even threatened him of dire consequences on January 31.

Inspector general of police (Agra range) Satish Ganesh said, “We have built a very strong case against Achman and his accomplice. We won’t leave any stone unturned to get him convicted for the crimes he has committed. I have also recommended for a fast trial in the case with the most stringent punishment.”

Dheera said, “Nothing short of death for Achman will give me peace.”

A group of SB Road residents present a memorandum of demands to civic officials and police

Pune: Residents of Senapati Bapat Road and surrounding areas have criticized the “smart” road infrastructure that causes daily traffic snarls in their localities.

On Wednesday, a group of residents staged an agitation and submitted a memorandum of demands to the civic administration and traffic police. The complaints mainly concerned the width of footpaths and the increased length of road dividers.

Pradeep Deshmukh, a local resident and activist, said they were not against development. He said the work has not proved beneficial to neither pedestrians nor motorists.

“Footpaths have been made too wide, minimizing the carriageway. The available space on footpaths could attract illegal hawkers,” Deshmukh said, adding, “Footpaths should be just wide enough for pedestrians, as PMC doesn’t have an effective mechanism to curb unauthorized hawking,” Deshmukh said.

Residents said the extension of the dividers and wider footpaths have not left adequate space for buses and cars to turn. “This leads to daily chaos. Motorists are forced to spend a lot of time at traffic signals,” a resident said.

Umesh Wagh, another SB Road resident, said many commercial establishments have mushroomed on SB Road over the past few years, increasing its traffic burden. “Civic authorities should take local residents into confidence while preparing plans to deal with traffic management,” Wagh said.

Officials from Pune Smart City Development Corporation said that the redesigned road infrastructure was part of the adaptive traffic management system project, which includes synchronization of traffic signals and pedestrian signals for a better flow of traffic. “The issues raised by the local residents will be reviewed and taken up for discussion,” an official said.

Pune: State housing minister Jitendra Awhad has proposed “prefab technology” for the construction of affordable houses to be undertaken by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority on the Maharashtra government lands in the city, Nashik, Aurangabad, Palghar and Nagpur.

Following complaints over the quality of affordable houses, the minister insisted on using the pre-fab technology to ensure that these houses provided comfortable living.

Collectors would have to allot space for these affordable houses to be provided at a price of Rs3-4 lakh per unit, said a source in the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (Mhada). An international tender would be floated in the next three months for the proposed project, stated officials in the know of the meeting held by the minister.

Mhada would consult experts about the project technology after it was proposed by the minister. Each home would have an area 300-350sqft. According to the minister, this will ensure that the economically weaker class beneficiaries have good houses.

The entire project would be under the affordable housing scheme. The state has set a target of building 19.4 lakh affordable houses. At present, a total of 13.58 lakh units had been approved by the government and 2 lakh tenements had been occupied by the beneficiaries, stated officials.

The affordable housing scheme under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana aims to reach out to the economically weaker section of society. The Centre has proposed 17 new technologies for providing quality housing in less time.

Sources from the housing department stated that the “pre-fab” technology was tested abroad. A private company in Khopoli also tested it.

MUMBAI: Paras Society at Malabar Hill on Thursday called for BMC’s intervention to urgently test a resident it suspected of being infected with coronavirus. The man works in Singapore. Commotion over the matter lasted for over two hours in the building and ended after health volunteers arrived and ruled out any signs of infection. In a first, BMC issued a certificate, stating the 30-year-old resident was asymptomatic.Civic officials said they got a call around 10am from the housing society’s chairman, who told them the 30-year-old was seen “wearing a mask”. The building’s chairman called BMC’s disaster management cell which put him in touch with the ward’s medical officer, Dr Pramod Patil, who sent an assistant, along with an ANM (auxiliary nurse midwife), to check on the man, who was at home with his family. The medical team found that he had no coronavirus symptoms. “The man works in Singapore, and had gone to Sri Lanka to attend a wedding recently. He returned to India on February 10. He didn’t show any flu symptoms. He also didn’t have any signs of fatigue, usually seen when a person is recovering from flu,” said the doctor, adding that the man postponed his return to Singapore where 58 cases of coronavirus have been reported so far.Dr Patil said he issued a certificate to quell the fears of the building’s other residents. “We have certified that he doesn’t have symptoms and he has been screened by us,” the doctor said.The man at the centre of the storm told the BMC team that he was screened at the airport’s international terminal and was cleared. Prashant Gaikwad, assistant municipal commissioner of D-Ward, confirmed Thursday’s sequence of events.Dr Patil said the man was wearing a mask as per guidelines issued in Singapore that say masks are an effective way to prevent the transmission or contraction of the viral infection. Cases of housing societies and even offices demanding health certificates have been reported as the infection continues to spread beyond China.The state government on February 7 issued an advisory saying people should not discriminate against Chinese citizens or those with a travel history to affected areas.State epidemiologist Dr Pradeep Awate said multiple requests have come from corporates wanting to know whether employees who had recently travelled to China for work had tested positive for coronavirus. “We had to tell corporates that medical reports are confidential and cannot be simply distributed,” he said. “People should be assured that the health department is following up with people travelling from affected areas for two weeks.”Dr Patil said a team would be in touch with the Malabar Hill man till he completes 14-day isolation as a precaution.",mumbai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74127243,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-426288,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/after-scare-malabar-hill-man-declared-virus-free/articleshow/74125329.cms

Pune: Three years after a government circular was issued directing departments to update records on land in their possession, the process remains stuck on paper.

The circular was issued following the MIDC land scam case in the Bhosari industrial area. The circular directed government bodies to prepare a detailed report after confirming their entries in property cards and 7/12 extracts within three months.

“While all the departments were asked to carry out the process, it is not yet completed,” a senior official from the revenue department told TOI.

Revenue officials said the process has been bogged down by the sheer volume of data and a shortage of staff to verify documents going back 60 years. “Land has been acquired by the land acquisition officers from the revenue department, but changes in the record of rights has not been carried out. A recheck of all the records is necessary,” officials said.

“While the acquisition process has been completed, the final ownership of the government organization, which should have been recorded, is absent,” an official said.

In 2016, over 500 cases of private land, spread across 10,000 hectares acquired for government purpose in the Pune revenue division, had come under the scanner after names of government organization did not reflect in the record of rights. Various government organizations — public works department, irrigation department, MIDC, municipal corporations and councils had acquired land for various purposes, but their records do not show ownership. “Another factor in play could be that, while the due process of acquisition has been completed, disputes arise in many cases in the final stage of updating records,” he said.

Another official blamed laxity or negligence on the part of the parties involved.

212,['14/02/2020'],Hour-long surgery cures baby of rare birth defect,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Pune: Timely diagnosis and an hour-long complex surgery helped doctors of a city hospital to give a fresh lease of life to a newborn detected with a rare birth defect.

The baby was diagnosed with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) during the mother’s sonography scan in the 25th week of pregnancy. “There was an absence of some part of the muscles (diaphragm) that separate the chest from the abdomen,” Jehangir hospital’s senior obstetrician and gynaecologist Vandana Khanijo said.

Since such a life-threatening congenital anomaly needs concerted management, Khanijo referred the mother to the hospital’s paediatric surgeon to plan and discuss the outcome of the pregnancy.

“Diaphragm is a partition in the body that separates the chest contents from the abdominal contents. This partition also helps a person to breathe. Due to the absence of the diaphragm, the abdominal contents like intestines, and organs like spleen and stomach were occupying the baby’s chest. The lungs in such babies are abnormally small and, in addition, they get compressed by the abdominal organs. The baby’s heart had also shifted to the right side of the chest,” senior paediatric surgeon Dasmit Singh said.

Neonatologist Sagar Lad explained to the parents the need for ventilatory care soon after birth, along with careful management of the immature lungs. “It is imperative to control the blood pressure of circulation in the lungs, along with low pressure ventilation, to prevent any damage to the immature lungs,” Lad said.

After assurance and support from the doctors, the parents took the decision to continue the pregnancy. When doctors were convinced of the baby’s maturity, labour was induced, following which the child was born through C-section on January 13.

The baby was immediately intubated, put on a ventilator and stabilised before performing the surgery. “That part of coordination was difficult, but we managed it with precision,” Khanijo said. After stabilisation, the baby was operated by Singh and anaesthetist Avantika Bhat.

“During the hour-long surgery, it was found that the stomach, spleen, part of the liver, and intestines were occupying the baby’s chest. We restored them to their rightful places in the abdominal cavity and fixed the diaphragmatic partition. To complicate the issue, the baby’s abdominal cavity was quite small. So, additional space had to be created by stretching out the abdominal muscles,” Singh said.

After the surgery, it took some time to settle various systems of the baby’s body. The newborn’s lungs expanded over the next few days and other vital parameters normalised. The baby was put off ventilator after 72 hours post surgery. Initially, the baby was fed through a tube placed into the stomach and subsequently the baby tolerated oral feeds. The baby was discharged on January 27.

The baby’s survival highlights the importance of antenatal check-up during pregnancy. “Early diagnosis, meticulous preparation and perfect execution ensured the survival of this baby,” healthcare expert Satyajit Gill, medical director of Jehangir Hospital, said.

When contacted, the parents said the baby was doing well.

Har-ki -pauri

HARIDWAR: Ahead of the 2021 Kumbh Mela to be hosted at Haridwar , priests are angry at the government for not having undone a government order (GO) inadvertently passed by the previous Congress government of chief minister Harish Rawat in 2016, which the current BJP chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat had promised to remedy within a month of assuming office in 2017.

Waters of the holy Ganga is divided into several man-made channels along with the natural river bed, as it enters the plains at Haridwar. As chief minister, Harish Rawat had issued a GO declaring the stream passing through Har-ki-Pauri — the designated holy spot — as an “escape channel”, which priests claimed had hurt their religious sentiments. Under the banner of Ganga Sabha — an apex body of priests in the country — they had then organized a protest against the decision.

Former Ganga Sabha president Ashok Tripathi reignited the issue, when on Thursday, he asked, “Will Kumbh pilgrims be taking a dip in the holy Ganga or in a canal?” He threatened to launch an agitation if the stream passing by Har-ki-Pauri is not declared the main river.

Current Ganga Sabha president Pradeep Jha said they were willing to wait as the CM had assured them that the matter will be sorted before the Mela.

Raju Odedara and Sagar Patel

Vadodara: The man, who abused Waghodia BJP MLA, Madhu Srivastava, was remanded to one day of police custody on Thursday. Raju Odedara and co-accused Sagar Patel were produced before the court which sent the duo to police custody.

Both Odedara and Patel were nabbed on Wednesday by the detection of crime branch (DCB) from Ahmedabad.

The duo was earlier booked for hurting religious sentiments and threats to kill the complainant Vijay Yadav over phone. Odedara, who works as a security guard, had also called up Srivastava on February 5 and abused him during a heated exchange. The next day, Yadav, a sympathiser of Srivastava, called up Odedara who again threatened the complainant and also abused the gods.

While Raju originally belongs to Porbandar, Patel is a resident of Ahmedabad. On February 5, Raju had called up Srivastava to discuss his works being ignored by the state government. The conversation soon turned ugly and both started abusing each other. Both Srivastava and Odedara had claimed on the call that they were drunk. Audio of the call went viral on social media the very next day.

Indore: In the third attack of bees in a fortnight reported in rural area of Mandsaur, at least 10 villagers were stung on Thursday. In similar attacks, an elderly man had lost his life while around 50 persons had suffered injuries.

“On the death of an elderly of Barkhedaloya village, around 200 villagers had gone to perform his last rites at a crematorium. Thick smoke emanating from the burning pyre would have enraged bees on the nearby trees following which they attacked the people there,” sarpanch Balkrishna Patidar told TOI.

He said that while most of the people managed to escape, at least 10 got trapped and were stung. “One of the victims has been hospitalized while remaining were being treated in a hospital of Garoth tehsil,” Patidar said.

A similar incident had occurred on Saturday when as many as 50 people, who had gone to perform the last rites of a villager, were attacked by bees at the crematorium of Titrod village in Sitamau, Mandsaur. Six people were taken to hospital as they were received grievous injured while remaining were sent home after preliminary treatment.

In the recent past, multiple bee attacks have been reported in rural areas of the district. In one such incident, an elderly person who had taken his goats for grazing had died after being attacked by bees at Bholamagra in Garoth.

“We have recorded the death of the elderly by bee attack,” said Garoth police station in charge Narendra Kumar Yadav, adding that as incidents of bee attacks are increasing, they would approach the forest department to shift beehives to a safe distance from the human settlements or take other appropriate steps, if any, to help avert such situations.

T’puram: Renowned snake catcher Vava Suresh suffered a snakebite and was subsequently hospitalised on Thursday. Suresh was bitten by a pit viper he was trying to catch.

According to sources, the incident occurred at Pathanapuram while Suresh was trying to catch the viper. The snake bit him on the middle finger of his right hand. He was rushed to Government Medical College Hospital, Kollam, and from there to the Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram.

Thiruvananthapuram MCH superintendent Dr M S Sharmad said that Suresh was admitted to the multidisciplinary intensive care unit immediately around 1.30pm and was administered anti-venom.

“At present, his condition is stable. But, we will have to keep him under observation for 72 hours,” Dr Sharmad said.

The main concern of the doctors is the history of Suresh facing numerous snakebites in the past. In all those cases, anti-venom was administered to his body. The doctors worry that anti-bodies that counter the anti-venom might have formed in his body during those instances. If so, the anti-venom administered in the latest case would have minimal impact.

Viper venom affects coagulation of blood and would cause excessive bleeding internally, especially in lungs. It also affects renal functions of the body. Dr Sharmad said that at present Suresh’s body has not displayed any such effects. But, there is a chance that adverse reactions may take place again. Hence, he is kept under 72-hour observation. Just over a year ago, Suresh had suffered a snakebite.

(Photo by Sadanand Godse)

Pune: President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday emphasized on greater vigilance in the Indo-Pacific region while observing that high quality training of marine engineers was crucial for sustained deployment and presence of the Navy in the country’s areas of interest.

“The geopolitical situation in the world, and in the Indo-Pacific in particular, demands greater vigilance. I am aware that the Navy has adopted mission-based deployments in the Indian Ocean region,” he said.

Kovind was speaking at a ceremony to mark the presentation of the coveted President’s Colours to INS Shivaji, a premier naval college of engineering which trains officers from the Navy and the Indian Coast Guards, among others, at Lonavla, about 74km from the city.

The institute, established in 1945 as HMIS Shivaji, is celebrating 2019-20 as the Platinum Jubilee year and the President’s Colours marks the highest honour in recognition of its exceptional service, in peace and war.

“The future will also see great diversity in the propulsion systems, ranging from conventional to nuclear and electric and hybrid propulsion. Concepts of maintenance will also undergo a paradigm shift with increased requirements on operational availability of platforms. INS Shivaji will need to impart the requisite skills to all trainees to prepare them to meet future challenges,” Kovind said.

“The training of marine engineers will also need to be tailored to train them to work with evolving technologies, while maintaining competence in the core engineering profession,” he said, observing that technology was leapfrogging to produce autonomous vessels.

“Artificial Intelligence and machine learning are being deployed for decision-making and war-fighting. I am confident that INS Shivaji would impart the skillset required in the future to all trainees passing out through its portals,” he said.

“A nation’s maritime interests are usually also linked to its economy and the well-being of its people. I am told about 90% of our trade, by volume, is handled by sea routes. This enhances the role of the Indian Navy not just in national security but also in economic security, and thus in the wider process of nation building,” The President said.

“The Navy is India’s chief instrument of its sea power. It is also the guardian of the nation’s maritime interests, both military and civilian. The nation is proud of the Navy’s commitment in protecting our maritime frontiers, securing our trade routes, and extending a helping hand in times of civil emergencies,” he said, highlighting the Indian Navy’s role in providing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to the affected people of Madagascar following the devastation caused by Cyclone Diane.

Coimbatore: The father of a Class V student of a government elementary school in Pudhupalayam near Narasimhanaickenpalayam in the district on Thursday lodged a police complaint against the headmistress for making his daughter clean the school toilets and making caste slurs against her. He was accompanied by members of the Students Federation of India (SFI) and Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front.

On its part, the school education department has warned the HM and sent her on leave, as higher officials were not available to take action.

In his complaint to the Perianaickenpalayam police, M Parthiban, 34, of Maniyakarampalayam near Idikarai, said they belonged to the Arundhathiyar (dalit) community. The complaint said earlier this week his 10-year-old daughter had refused to go to school and take food. “When inquired, she said headmistress Kumareswari had forced her to clean toilets for two weeks. When she refused to clean them on February 11, the headmistress hit her and made caste slurs against her,” it said.

He sought action against the headmistress under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. “Police have not yet formally registered a case. They said they would do it on Friday,” said Dhinesh Raja, SFI .

School education department officials, meanwhile, denied the allegation that the headmistress had made the student to clean the toilets. A school education department source, however, said the headmistress was known to be rude and used to scold students. “Earlier, she had created problems at the government elementary school in Goundampalayam, following which she was transferred to this school.”

Perianaickenpalayam block education officer Krishnamoorthy said the headmistress had asked the students to use water to keep the toilet clean and that might have been misunderstood by the students. “However, we learn that she has behaved rudely to the students.” tnn

Representative image

COIMBATORE: Three weeks after the Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu (Transtan) permitted the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital ( CMCH ) to perform liver transplants, the hospital is in the process of putting three patients on the waiting list.

The patients have a good chance of receiving a liver if a government hospital harvests an organ that matches their blood type. CMCH had performed the first cadaver kidney transplant a week ago.

The hospital, which began constituting a team and facilities to perform liver transplants a year ago, now has two surgical gastroenterologists trained to perform liver transplants. “We have three patients who need to undergo transplant and are fit enough to undergo the surgery,” said a senior CMCH official.

“We are in the process of completing all our assessments and sending them to Transtan. Once the liver transplant committee approves it, we will arrange for them to benefit from the comprehensive health insurance scheme. Once those two steps are fulfilled, they will be on the waiting list,” hospital dean Dr B Ashokan said during an earlier interaction with TOI.

If any of the government hospitals in the region announces a brain death and the blood group matches with those on the wait list, the patients have a strong chance of receiving a liver soon.

Salem GH had declared a brain death and arranged for organ harvesting for the first time on January 21 and CMCH had the first organ harvest on February 5. CMCH gets 10 to 12 patients declared brain dead in a month. However, they usually pass away before they can be put on ventilator or maintained.

So far, the liver failure patients that CMCH receives are medically managed with drugs. “In acute cases, they are sent to the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, which performs many cadaver liver transplants,” said an official. “Some patients go to CMCH, while the others end up going to private hospitals if they can afford it. Others manage on medications as long as possible.”

However, the poor are severely affected because private hospitals charge a minimum of Rs 32 lakh for a transplant, including investigations and medications.

Ahmedabad: The Indian government needs to allocate more funds for research and development in the Indian Space Programme, says Kamal Thakore, a Gujarati and a scientist at NASA. He was in Ahmedabad on Thursday to interact with students at Chimanbhai Patel Institute of Journalism and Communications.

Thakore is part of the team working on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter project and others at NASA. “India is doing well in its space programme but the Indian government’s budget for the space programme is not big. Research and development (R&D) is very important and thus the government must focus on it aggressively and not rely on private companies which will only do R&D for their own benefit.”

Thakore also hailed the Indian government’s focus on defence, in context of its space programme. “India is in a hostile territory with China and Pakistan being on either sides of the northern border. We will face trouble if we don’t make our defence strong. To curb terror activities, we must have a strong hand,” he said. tnn

224,['14/02/2020'],Special cell to monitor work of third-party hires,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Pune: The civic body has set up a separate cell to monitor the work of administration-appointed third-party auditors and consultants.

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad recently issued an order for setting up a separate cell, which includes an officer of the rank of an executive engineer, a deputy engineer and three junior engineers.

The cell will report to the vigilance department of the civic body and will be responsible for assessing the reports generated by the third-party auditors.

The move comes after the elected representatives of the civic administration raised issue of inconsistencies in the reports of the audit agencies and consultants.

The representatives claimed that the performance of the third-party appointments was not up to the mark and the lethargic approach of the consultants had hampered the execution of several projects. They then suggested the appointment of a team of officers to monitor the third-party hires’ undertakings.

“The appointment of the special cell is to plug the loopholes in the reports generated by the third-party audit agencies. It would ensure that the civic administration spends realistically and avoids wastage of funds. In recent cases, it was observed that the reports of consultants lacked many vital details that were intrumental to the projects. The civic body should cease to accept such reports,” standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne said.

A senior corporator from the Nationalist Congress Party said the cell should also check the credibility and eligibility of the third-party auditors and consultants before finalising their appointments.

“The civic administration should not entertain blacklisted audit firms or those known for flouting norms. The special cell should also table the assessment reports before the PMC at regular intervals,” the corporator said.

The PMC undertakes developmental projects proposed by various departments and zonal offices within its limits. These projects include construction of roads, development of gardens, laying of pipelines and drainage lines, among others.

Ahmedabad: Three persons from Gomtipur area have approached the Gujarat high court complaining that they have not been allotted houses as promised in the rehabilitation package while evicting them for the metro rail project.

The petitioners are Nathiben Solanki, Dineshbhai Jadav and Vijaybhai Makwana. They have said that they had non-titled houses in Gomtipur area. While asking them to vacate the place, the Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC) offered a resettlement and rehabilitation package for squatters or non-title holder families. There was a scheme of compensation to the tune of Rs 3,000 per month and one-time compensation of Rs 50,000 to the affected for transportation and a tenement of 36.5 square metre in areas like Chandkheda, Bodakdev, Thaltej, Raipur, Saraspur or Vastral. This was provided in a resolution issued by GMRC, they claimed.

The petitioners have submitted that they had to vacate their houses and thus they are project-affected persons. In case of Solani, who is 66 years old, she was granted compensation of Rs 1.06 lakh only, but the authorities did not give her the promised tenement.

The petitioners claimed that after their houses were taken away in July 2016, they made representations that they should be treated as project-affected people and should be given alternate houses in accordance with the rehabilitation policy.

The GMRC replied to these petitioners’ representations on June 20, 2019 that there was no file pending as of now for grant of house or compensation.

226,['14/02/2020'],Passengers beat up man to death in crowded express train coach; 12 detained,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Pune: A 26-year-old man was brutally beaten to death by 13 ticketless travellers, including seven women, following a quarrel over seat-sharing in a crowded general compartment of the Mumbai-Latur-Beed Express, in the early hours of Thursday. The incident took place between Pune and Daund railway stations.

The Government Railway Police (GRP) in Daund later detained 12 people, including the seven women and a minor boy. Senior inspector Sureshsingh Gaud of the GRP, Pune, said, “The 12 detained people are being brought back to Pune.”

Police said victim Sagar Janardan Markad, an autorickshaw driver from Kalyan in Thane district, was travelling with his wife, Jyoti, his mother and two-year-old daughter to Kurduwadi to attend the funeral of Jyoti’s relative. The Markad family hails from Markadwada in Madha tehsil of Solapur district.

The family had started from Karjat in the Dadar-Chennai Express but got down at Pune station because the train does not stop at Kurduwadi. Around 12.45am, they boarded the crowded general coach of the Mumbai-Latur-Beed Express, which stops at Kurduwadi. They had to stand in the coach as there was barely any space to sit, police said.

Since Jyoti was carrying her sleeping daughter in her arms, Sagar requested a woman occupying a seat near the entrance of the coach to make some space for his wife. The woman picked up an altercation with him and started verbally abusing him, the police said.

In her statement recorded with the Daund railway police, Jyoti said that when Sagar asked the woman not to use foul language, she flew into a rage. She and other passengers started raining kicks and blows on Sagar. Some of them also hit him with sticks, the police said.

Jyoti told the police that she and her mother-in-law tried in vain to stop the assault on Sagar, who had collapsed on the floor of the coach. In desperation, she pulled the chain thrice to stop the train. However, the train stopped for a while but began moving again, she said.

None of the other passengers in the coach came to the family’s rescue although one of them alerted the railway police about the incident over cellphone. There was no patrolling in the coach.

A team of the Daund railway police moved into the coach after the train halted at Daund station and rushed Sagar to a private hospital, where the doctors declared him brought dead.

The Daund GRP registered a case under sections 302 (murder), 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting with deadly weapon), 323 (causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and section 137 (ticketless travel) of the Indian Railways Act. The case has been transferred to the GRP in Pune.

Ahmedabad: The Gujarat high court is set to get four new judges with the Supreme Court approving the proposal for promotion of four judicial officers to the HC bench.

During its meeting on Wednesday, the SC collegium has approved the names of judges – Ilesh Vora, Gita Gopi, A C Joshi and R M Sareen – as proposed for elevation to the Gujarat HC, the apex court said in a statement issued on Thursday. They are currently working as district judges in Gujarat’s lower judiciary.

At present, Gujarat high court has got 27 judges as against the sanctioned strength of 52 judges. The last appointment took place in the high court in March 2019 when Justice B D Karia and Justice Sangeeta Vishen joined the higher judiciary.

The promotions of Gujarat-cadre judges in higher judiciary drew controversies in the last couple of years. The transfer of Justice (retd) Jayant Patel, when he became the senior most judge of Karnataka HC, to the Allahabad HC led to his resignation. Similarly, the issue of transfer of Justice Akil Kureshi to the Bombay HC and later his promotion as chief justice of Tripura HC after the SC’s recommendation to make him the Madhya Pradesh HC chief justice gathered controversy. The Gujarat HC’s Bar approached the apex court against the alleged denial of promotion to Justice Kureshi.

Vadodara: A resident of Panigate area of the city has approached the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) food safety department with a complaint that he was sold a synthetic egg by a local vendor. While they didn’t buy his claim, the food safety officials may check egg suppliers in the city in the coming days.

The man opened an egg and found a film inside it which was hard to break and looked like plastic. A video, claimed to be of the ‘plastic’ egg also started making rounds in the social media. While the incident is said to be of Wednesday night, VMC officials received a formal complaint from the man only on Thursday evening.

“Our officials will check the quality of eggs that are being sold in the area. The complainant can also get the eggs he bought to be checked in our laboratory,” said an official of the food safety department. The official, however, added that they had not heard of any such incident in the city earlier.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has in the past clarified that it was highly unlikely that such eggs were being sold in the country. FSSAI has also circulated a detailed note in this regard. Sources said that a concern could be the freshness of the eggs that were sold to the complainant.

Ahmedabad: The state government on Thursday told the Gujarat high court that it intends to run the Delhi Public School (East) in Hathijan till March 31. The judges inquired how the administration will help parents to get children admitted in other schools.

The government said that it will run the school till the end of current academic session in response to a petition filed by parents of 369 students questioning the decision to abruptly close down the school.

The school management submitted that it has approached the Delhi HC against the cancellation of CBSE affiliation and the decision to close down the school and the issue is pending. Till the Delhi HC takes a final decision on the subject, the Gujarat HC was requested to adjourn the proceeding on this petition. The HC has deferred the hearing till March 9.

The school gathered controversy after its management gave space to godman Nithyananda for setting up an ashram in the school campus at Hathijan. The alleged irregularity came to the fore after a person lodged an FIR that Nithyananda and ashram management had illegally detained his minor kids and were involved in disappearance of his two daughters.

COIMBATORE: Tamil Puligal , a dalit outfit has claimed that several arunthathiyars, a scheduled caste community, have converted to Islam in the past month and a half across Coimbatore district .

“We had been subjected to caste discrimination of the worst kind for ages. We decided that conversion to Islam would free us from the clutches of caste hegemony,” said 28-year-old V Marx who has changed his name to Mohamed Abubacker after conversion. Abubacker, hailing from Kallipalayam village near Thondamuthur In Coimbatore, said five of his family members, including parents, have converted to Islam on January 11.

Ravanan, 32, from Saibaba Colony in Coimbatore said he converted on January 5. “There are several more dalits from our locality who want to convert to Islam. In the coming days a lot more of them will convert,” he said.

However, in the identical affidavits they filed seeking to convert to Islam, the dalits had declared that they were drawn to principles of Islam and hence chose to convert. “Everyone in our families were following Hinduism till date. We have no ill will towards Hinduism,” the affidavits said.

M Ilavenil, general secretary of Tamil Puligal, a dalit outfit, said that though they had been suffering caste discrimination for long, the tipping point was the Mettupalayam wall collapse tragedy where 17 dalits perished under the debris. “There was government apathy since the deceased were dalits,’’ he said. He claimed that 400 arunthathiyars have converted to Islam in Coimbatore since January. TOI could not independently verify the claim, but spoke to a few who got converted.

Incidentally, none of the dalits from Nadoor village where the wall collapse happened has converted.

“We are staunch believers of Lord Perumal. We will never leave Hinduism,” said Nadoor Muruganantham.

Ilavenil said there was huge political and police pressure to prevent the conversion, particularly in Mettupalayam, and hence dalits of Nadoor stayed away from converting.

“Hence, we kept the conversion move under wraps. Even now, most of the converted do not want to be identified for fear of a backlash,” he said.

236,['14/02/2020'],District collectors struggling to provide house sites for all,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Amaravati: In a move that could hurt the state government ’s image, collectors in many districts have directed field-level staff to obtain satisfaction letters from beneficiaries of house-sites even before the sites are distributed.

Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy had asked the collectors to show the plots to beneficiaries before the distribution and hand over the pattas only if the beneficiary was satisfied.

Sources said many districts do not have vacant government land. For example, the Prakasam district administration could ready only 1,485 acres against the requirement of 2,319 acres. The land available is around 65% of the requirement. The story is the same in almost all districts. The shortage of land is severe in towns and cities where eligible beneficiaries are in thousands.

Struggling to find sufficient suitable land for distribution of house sites due to shortage of government land, the collectors have decided to ready the layouts in wherever land is available and distribute the plots.

In this context, there is a possibility of beneficiaries raising objection after seeing the plots. This might have led to the district administration obtaining ‘satisfaction’ letters from the beneficiaries before the site distribution.

Sources said some collectors were chasing tehsildars to acquire land required for house sites programme. In some places, farmers are refusing to hand over land due to paltry compensation offered by the district administration. Sources said the collectors are yet acquire at least 30% land required for the programme.

Since satisfaction of beneficiaries is mandatory as per the chief minister’s instructions, the collectors have decided to obtain the consent letters in advance.

If the beneficiaries found the land identified for house-sites was not suitable for construction, it may have an adverse impact. Sources said that in a hurry to meet the target, some tehsildars were acquiring agriculture land where construction of the house would not be practical.

Neerabh Kumar Prasad, chief commissioner, land administration (CCLA), has directed the collectors to complete land acquisition by February 28 and ready the layouts by March 15.

“It is the chief minister’s wish to see that no one in the state shall be seen without a house site after Ugadi (March 25). We are working overtime to give house sites to all,” said Prasad.

Coimbatore: The district industries centre (DIC), Coimbatore, has received 43 applications from MSMEs for energy audit subsidies under the Promotion of Energy Audit and Conservation of Energy (Peace) scheme this year.

Of this, 13 applications have been filed and four of them have been given subsidies, officials said.

This was higher than last year, when only nine MSME units had filed and got the subsidy.

The ‘Peace’ scheme offers MSMEs 50% of the cost or Rs 75,000 as subsidy to conduct detailed energy audit. If the unit implements suggestions put forth by the energy auditing committee and shows 15% energy savings, they are eligible for getting 25% of the cost of the components or Rs 2lakh as subsidy.

General manager of DIC, Coimbatore, B Karthigaivasan said their target for the Peace scheme this year was to give subsidies to 60 MSME units and the target subsidy amount was Rs 30lakh. So far this year, Rs 1.7lakh has been given as subsidy for four units and nine subsidy applications were under process, he said. A total of 30 applications would be processed and filed soon, he said. “We eye to cross the target this year,” he said.

The DIC along with Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises (TACT) had conducted two awareness programmes on the Peace scheme at Velandipalayam and Ondipudur in the past weeks in the district.

District president of TACT J James said around 120 micro enterprise owners participated in each of the sessions. “Micro industrialists have said they would conduct energy audits at their units. A total of 17 people from both places have shown interest to apply for subsidy under the scheme,” he said.

He said based on how these units save energy and subsequently expenses, others too might take up energy auditing.

Red carnations cultivated in the district are in demand next to red roses, said Kishore, a cut flower dealer. “February has always been a month of demand for cut flowers. Red carnations are in great demand to substitute the red roses in bouquets,” he told TOI.

A red carnation fetches farmers Rs 13 to Rs 16, Kishore, who sends cut flowers to Bengaluru, Chennai and Cochin, said. “Over six lakh cut flowers including carnations, gerbera and liliums were sent from the district for export in the last couple of weeks.”

The district does not produce cut rose varieties, said Samraj. “The climatic condition in the Nilgiris favours only roses of hybrid, shrub and climbing varieties. Long-stemmed roses used by florists require humid weather condition such in Krishnagiri and Hosur.”

Cut flowers are mainly procured by flower agents in Bengaluru through local agents and then exported mainly to Egypt, Germany and the United States.

Meanwhile, couples, especially the newly-wed, are flocking to Ooty to celebrate the special day. The weather gods are favouring the love-struck with moderated wintry sun during the day and mildly chilly evenings.

K Kishan and R Manisha, a newly-married couple from Secunderabad, said they came to Ooty just to spend the day in each other's arms.

ERODE: The residents of Gandhi Nagar near Thalavadi in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve were sent into widespread panic on Wednesday evening after a tiger on the prowl killed a cow in their locality. While the search for the big cat that was launched the previous night continued on Thursday, the combined team of villagers and forest officials didn’t make any headway.

The forest department is expected to set up a cage with a bait in it to trap the animal that is wandering near the village.

According to P Nagendra, 28, of Gandhi Nagar, who reared the cow that was killed, the tiger came out of the STR around 6pm on Wednesday. “I had left my seven cows on a farmland near the reserve forest for grazing. When I heard them cry and reached the spot, I found the tiger pouncing on one of the cows and trying to drag it into the forest,” he said.

Nagendra rushed back to his hamlet and alerted the fellow villagers, who rushed to the farmland. However, the tiger had left the place leaving the dead cow behind.

The villagers informed forest officials, who joined them in the search for the tiger. Though the search continued till Thursday, they couldn’t trace the animal.

The villagers have appealed the forest officials to trace the tiger at the earliest. A forest official said, “We will set up a cage to capture the tiger.”

The official said the dairy farmer would be compensated for his loss.

ERODE: The maternity scan centre at the Andhiyur government hospital had turned into a dance floor recently as the medical staff organized a farewell party there for their retiring colleague. The issue came to light on Thursday when the video of some of doctors and nurses dancing to some popular movie songs surfaced on social media.

TOI found that the incident had taken place on January 31, when chief doctor Dr S Kavitha and other medical staff threw a farewell party for Dr S N Sampath Kumar, who was retiring from service on that day. They had decked up the scan centre and nearby areas with colourful balloons and other items for the occasion. The event was held in the evening.

“During the event, a few doctors and danced to popular movie numbers, while some others sang songs. This was when more than 50 inpatients were undergoing treatment at the hospital. They were not bothered about whether the noise would cause disturbance to the patients,” said a doctor, requesting anonymity.

242,['14/02/2020'],Retain original expansion plan of airport: Minister,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Coimbatore: Local administration minister S P Velumani has requested Union minister for civil aviation Hardeep Singh Puri to retain the original plan for expansion of the Coimbatore airport.

In a letter handed over to Puri on Thursday, Velumani said that the state government has already initiated the acquisition process for 627.89 acres as per the notification issued during 2010-11.

Rs 2,64.47 crore was allotted during 2018-19 and 2019-20, and the disbursement process to the landowners has commenced, the minister said. In this backdrop, chairman of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) informed that AAI has reworked the land requirement to an extent of 605. 67 acres (541.89 acre for airport development and 63.78 acres for 60 metre-wide approach road) as per the revised master plan to make the airport suitable for operation of wide-bodied aircraft.

“As seen in the revised master plan, about 5.76 acres of extended area does not come under the already notified area of 627.89 acres and about 27.98 acres of land already notified for the acquisition process. It is now subtracted from the original plan of 627.89 acres,’’ Velumani said.

“If the area is revised now, the landowners might seek compensation under the New Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act 2013, resulting in additional burden on the state exchequer. This could halt the expansion process,” the minister said.

Pointing out that in addition to additional expenditure, the land acquisition under revised plan would consume more time, Velumani requested the Union minister to allow completion of airport expansion as per the original schedule.

Velumani also met Union minister for rural development and panchayati raj Narendra Singh Tomar and requested him to release Rs 2,939 crore towards the second instalment of wages, material and administrative cost under MGNREGS for the year 2019-20 and an additional Rs 609.18 crore for wages, material and administrative cost till February 10.

AHMEDABAD: In a garb of updating KYC (know your customer) information, online fraudsters duped two Naranpura residents of lakhs using the same modus operandi. Two complaints have been filed with Naranpura police on Thursday.

In the first FIR with Naranpura police, Dharmesh Shah, 55, resident of the Naranpura area who works as development manager with LIC, said that he had lost Rs three lakh to online fraudsters on December 22.

Shah states in the FIR that he had received a call on December 22 from a man, introducing him as employee of Paytm, and asked him to update KYC (know your customer) details. The man told Shah to download an app called ‘quick support’ and add Rs 10 to it.

Shah paid Rs 10 in the new app wallet and after that his phone got hanged and Rs three lakh were deducted from his bank account, states the FIR. The man then approached cyber cell of the crime branch and filed an application to probe about the fraud. A month later, cyber cell sleuths called him up and informed that Rs one lakh out of the Rs three lakh were freezed.

Later, cyber cell officials told him to file a complaint with concerned police station. Shah approached Naranpura police and filed a complaint of cheating along with charges of Information Technology act.

In another FIR with the Naranpura police, Amit Shah, 41, a resident of Naranpura who runs a business of packaging materials, said that an unknown man called him and told him to update KYC details.

This unknown man had also asked Amit to download quick support application and add Rs 10 money in it. After that, Rs 1.09 lakh were debited from his bank account.

He had also first approached the cyber cell and finally his complaint was lodged at Naranpura police.

According to the Act, all written communications and records should be in Tamil

COIMBATORE: While 92% of government departments in the district are adhering to the Tamil official language norms laid down by the Tamil Nadu Official Language Act, 1956, the rest, including the health department and the electricity board, continue to use technical terms in English extensively, officials of the Tamil development department, who are attending the two-day annual official language workshop for government officials that began in the city on Thursday, said.

According to the Act, all written communications and records should be in Tamil. “Signatures, nameplates, circulars and word processors in computers should be in Tamil,” said an official.

In order to implement the rule in the departments that are still lagging, the officials have been conducting annual workshops and gathering technical terms for which there are no proper Tamil equivalents. “From time to time, we represent these terms to a team of scholars, who come up with Tamil equivalents,” he said.

While the initiative is antagonistic to English, it aims to make government circulars and communications accessible even to people from the lowest rungs of society, the official said. “If a person, who doesn’t know English, gives a petition or a representation, he should be able to comprehend the reply given by a government office in return.”

The officials also inspect government offices twice a year to check whether the circulars, forms and records are in Tamil and whether the officials are signing in Tamil. “If we find violations, we would warn them. If it is repeated, we would record it,” the official added.

As many as 140 officials from various government departments and boards are attending the workshop.

246,['14/02/2020'],YS Jaganmohan Reddy: CM Jagan to meet Amit Shah in Delhi today,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Vijayawada: Chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy is scheduled to visit the national capital for a second time this week on Friday. He would be meeting Union home minister Amit Shah this time in the evening.

Jaganmohan Reddy had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday and submitted a charter of demands which included abolition of the AP Legislative Council and shifting of the High Court to Kurnool besides other issues related to AP Reorganization Act, 2014.

The chief minister is very particular on the decentralisation of administration by shifting judiciary to Kurnool and executive to Visakhapatnam at the earliest. As the Legislative Council, where the opposition TDP has majority, referred the related bills to select committees, the chief minister is now insisting upon its abolition to avoid delay.

The AP assembly had passed a unanimous resolution on January 27 seeking abolition of the Legislative Council. The resolution was sent to the Union Home Ministry for further action. The Union Home Ministry had referred the resolution to the Law Department for its review.

The chief minister is likely to request Home minister Amit Shah to speed up the process so as to avoid delay in shifting the High Court to Kurnool and secretariat to Visakhapatnam while retaining assembly in Amaravati. The resolution is to be cleared by the cabinet and Parliament for the President to issue notification to dissolve the Upper House in the State.

Meanwhile, the TDP-led Legislative Council is making all out efforts to move forward on its decision to refer two crucial bills to the select committees. Chairman, M A Shariff, had already announced the names of the members for the two committees and named ministers Botcha Satyanarayana and Buggana Rajendranath.

However, YSRC, including the ministers, has refused to be part of the select committees alleging that the council chairman did not follow the rules while referring the bills to the select committees.

TDP MLCs are planning to lead a delegation to meet the central minister’s against the chief minister’s decision to abolish the Council. The TDP MLC delegation is likely to meet Union ministers of law and parliamentary affairs and lobby against the dissolution of the Legislative Council.

In this backdrop, the second visit of the chief minister to Delhi to meet the home minister assumes significance. Besides the Legislative Council, the chief minister is also insisting on shifting the high court to Kurnool. As the court is already dealing with a case relating to the decentralisation move of the government, the chief minister wants the central government to make its moves fast to preempt the TDP on both the issues.

AHMEDABAD: A 43-year-old woman from the Ghatlodia on Wednesday filed a complaint under the domestic violence act against her five in-laws alleging that she was harassed and tortured as she demanded hereditary rights for her son. But her in-laws allegedly changed her husband’s name in documents related to hereditary rights to devoid the complainant’s son to get the hereditary property.

The woman stated in her FIR that her in-laws began harassing her and thrashed her soon after their marriage in December 1996. In 2006, her husband suffered paralytic attack and gradually his condition worsened. As her husband was not able work, her in-laws allegedly did not help her financially.

Her husband fell down on July 14, 2015 and after spending 20 days on ventilator, he passed away. During this period also, her in-laws did not help her and she had to spend her entire earning that she gathered through embroidery work on his treatment.

The woman states that she had finally succeeded to send her son, 21, to Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)- Kharagpur. She said that her father-in-law had hereditary land in Mahuva in Bhavnagar. But when she enquired about it to transfer the land to her son’s name, she found that her husband’s name was wrongly written.

Even though she constantly urged her in-laws to change the name, they denied it and also thrashed the woman. She finally approached the Vastrapur police on Wednesday and filed a complaint.

AHMEDABAD: Love for majority of teens aaj-kal, is an emotionless highway, where hook-ups and break-ups are like changing attire. Blame it to peer pressure, instant gratification, loneliness , low emotional quotient, immaturity or hormonal changes, but this is the trend fast spreading.

Radhika Singh, a class XI student, always had a new boyfriend in three-four months. None of her relation stretched beyond that. On deeper probe by the psychologist, it was found that her control freak and possessive behaviour was reason behind her past seven break-ups. To avoid loneliness, she jumped to another relation immediately with no regrets of past.

Case is no different for Ankit Parikh, a class X student, who has one girl friend and four platonic relations. He said, “Break-up is common these days, so I always keep my back-up plan ready. It is uncool not to have girlfriend and I have a social image to maintain, who cares about emotions as they change automatically.” Adds Samir, another X grader, “It’s not fair to keep relationship going when you have no charm left, so it’s better to break up and move on.”

Sujata Tiwari, parent of a teen said, “I was shocked when my daughter asked me whether she is ugly and unattractive. Then she revealed that everyone in her class calls her ‘behanji’ as she does not have a boyfriend.”

(Names have been changed to protect the identities.)

Guna and Koyamozhi were transferred because they were questioning the management on bad vehicle maintenance, said a protester. “They were also at the forefront of our earlier protests,” he said.

Several ambulances are badly maintained and are now being sent to Tirupur for maintenance, said a driver. “Vehicles that used to be maintained at workshops in the district are now being sent to Tirupur. This is because the establishment failed to pay the workshops here. The two drivers were transferred, because they asked questions.”

Women paramedics lack proper toilet facilities wherever they are stationed, the protesters said.

Meanwhile, 108 ambulance manager Muthukrishnan said the two drivers were transferred for violating the company policy by going to the media first regarding the issues, instead of the organization.

Representative image

COIMBATORE: Twenty-seven farmer producer groups (FPG) in the district will be given Rs 5lakh each to buy farm implements and other equipment under the collective farming scheme this year.

Of this, 19 FPGs come under the agriculture department and eight, under the horticulture department. The departments have approached the collector for approval and are expecting it within next week.

Each group comprises 100 farmers. Earlier, 20 farmers were grouped into farmer interest groups (FIGs). Five of those groups were clubbed to form one FPG.

Agriculture department officials said with the fund, each FPG can buy farm implements or machinery they need. “They can use them among themselves or lease them to make money for the group,” said an agriculture department official.

The groups are spread across 12 blocks of the district. “The farmers can be cultivating any crop. They have to be from the same area,” said the official.

The scheme was started during 2017-2018. In the first year, 21 FPGs under the agriculture department were given Rs 5lakh each. Last year, 19 FPGs were given the fund.

Horticulture officials said they have been giving the funds to eight FPGs from 2017-2018.

While some groups are performing well under the collective farming scheme, some needed frequent impetus, the official said. “If the farmers take up the initiative and perform well, the scheme would be very profitable for them.”

The initial steps to form the FPGs are taken up by the agriculture and horticulture departments. The next step of forming farmer producer companies (FPCs) clubbing 10 FPGs would be taken up by the agriculture marketing department. The produce of the members will be packed or value-added and marketed directly without the involvement of middlemen.

When the rural local body elections were held, and village panchayats got their presidents after a gap of three years, the residents hoped that civic works would pick pace.

But the villagers as well as panchayat presidents are disappointed as they are staring at near empty coffers in the local bodies. Even in panchayats that have funds, the panchayat presidents are stuck as they could not access the funds due to a new rule that all money transfers should be done through the National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) system.

R Pandiammal, the panchayat president of the Siruvalai panchayat in Madurai district, is a AIADMK member. “I was told that the coffers of my panchayat were almost empty, when I assumed charge. To ensure that the people are not affected we carry out small works, like motor repairs and water supply from my own money. When the funds are accessible, we intend to bring about big changes in the panchayat,” she said.

Many of the elected panchayat presidents have been given bank passbooks with less than a lakh in the panchayat account. This is insufficient to carry out developmental work, they said.

First time president A Angusamy, of Chinnakannanur village panchayat in Manamadurai union in Sivaganga district says that there is about Rs 6 lakh in the panchayat account, according to the bank statement given to him. But he couldn’t utilize the funds so far due to the new rule mandating NEFT transactions. “As of now I’m spending from my own funds to fix lights and repair taps,’’ he said.

K Aruchamy of Kolapratti panchayat near Pollachi said that he wanted to construct a community hall at a cost of Rs 4 lakh for his village. “But there are no funds,’’ he said.

The newly elected panchayat presidents said that they are yet to work out the specifics on fund requirement. For now, they are studying the financial discipline of the village, revenue and expenditure over past few years, and the requirements of the village. “Once we prepare a list of requirements, we will arrive at an estimated budget for the projects and approach the government for the fund,’’ said P Ranganathan, president of Kalangal panchayat near Sulur in Coimbatore.

B Thangavel, president of Odanthurai panchayat in Coimbatore said he has approached Nilgiris DMK MP A Raja for funds. Odanthurai near Mettupalayam falls in Nilgiris Lok Sabha segment. “He has agreed to provide Rs 13 lakh for a construction of an intake well to augment drinking water supply to our village. I am also planning to request him for funds for building a subway at a railway crossing,’’ Thangavel said.

In Mukkudi panchayat in Thirupuvanam union in Sivaganga district the newly elected panchayat president P Muthiah has set right faulty streetlights with his own funds to the tune of Rs 1.75 lakh.

However, panchayat presidents are hopeful that soon the government would release funds. “For an efficient president, paucity of funds would not be a problem at all. There are multiple sources. We must work closely with MLAs, MPs, government officers as well as industrialists and charity organisations to raise funds for the sake of public welfare,’’ said Ranganathan.

A senior government officer said that funds would be released soon. “Funds are being released for ongoing schemes like MGNREGS. We will soon release funds for village specific projects,’’ he said.

The CM also declared that separate departments will soon be made to boost reverse migration besides announcing the ‘CM Vatsalya Yojna’ for orphans, road to each village by 2022 and designated land as ‘samadhi-sthal’ of saints in Haridwar. In order to boost tree plantation, the CM said that a massive tree-planting drive will be carried out across the state on July 16.

“In the long marathon session, many points were brought to the fore. We have decided to form a separate department for people of the state who have migrated to other locations and want to invest in Uttarakhand. This department will aim to promote reverse migration, especially in the hills,” said the CM. He added that the migration commission formed by his government had “carried out elaborate research that will encourage people hailing from the state and settled outside, to return back or invest in the state.”

Pointing out that many seers come to Haridwar and take ‘samadhi’ here, the CM said, “The body of such saints used to get released in Ganga. With Kumbh coming up, many saints are expected to visit Haridwar. Therefore, we have decided to give land to saints for constructing ‘samadhi sthal’. Now, the bodies would not be released in Ganga.”

The CM also announced a ‘Vatsalya Yojna’ for the welfare of orphans. Although he did not divulge the details of the project, the CM said that it aims to help the orphans when they grow up and are ready to take up job opportunities.

Another big announcement was regarding road connectivity to villages. “We have decided that by 2022, all villages of the state will be connected with roads ,” said the CM.

During the meet, BJP legislators underscored different issues of their respective constituencies that require attention. Bageshwar MLA Chandan Ram Das suggested that the condition and infrastructure of government rest houses in his district needs to be improved. Salt MLA Surendra Singh Jeena highlighted the need of mobile medical vans in the hills.

Similarly, Nainital MLA Sanjeev Arya suggested the use of forest department’s barren land for afforestation work. Harbhajan Singh Cheema, legislator from Udham Singh Nagar district, was in favour of holding a similar review meeting after every three months. Rudraprayag MLA Bharat Singh Chaudhary advocated the need for early construction of Sainik School. Yamkeshwar MLA Ritu Bhushan Khanduri stressed on providing job opportunities to the youths of the state.

Meanwhile, Congress MLAs strongly criticised the review meeting asking as to why Congress MLAs were not invited. “Is he the CM of only 57 constituencies or the entire state? If it was a programme to discuss the projects of the entire state, then why were the Congress MLAs not called? I heard that the BJP was calling it a party event. If it is a party event, what were the bureaucrats and top officials doing in it?” asked Manoj Rawat, Congress MLA from Kedarnath.

Workers processing the biodegradable waste in Kulimikkarai road MCC in trichy

TRICHY: The Trichy Corporation has sanctioned Rs 2.9 crore to construct seven more micro compost centres (MCC), for collecting, processing and recycling the waste generated within a ward. Work on the new MCCs will start from March and will be completed in four months, an official said.

Already, 31 MCCs are functioning in various parts of the city, due to which the quantum of waste heading to the Ariyamangalam dump yard has drastically reduced, the civic body has said. However, as the existing MCCs lack infrastructure to cover all the 65 wards, the corporation has proposed to establish 17 more MCCs.

As part of the proposal, the local body has initially sanctioned the Rs 2.90 crore to install seven new MCCs in six wards of K Abishekapuram zone, including Pirattiyur, Crawford, Puthur and Fathima Nagar.

The proposed MCCs will cover the wards that were so far covered by the existing MCCs in nearby wards. The MCCs will receive waste from the mini-trucks that collects waste at doorsteps from houses.

MCCs will segregate the waste further through women self-help groups (SHG) and process the biodegradable waste into manure within 45 days by decomposing the waste and applying micro-organism solution.

Non-biodegradable waste will be sold to scrap dealers for a price while combustible waste such as leather and rexine will be transported to cement factories as fuel.

“We have opted our own office space to establish the new MCCs. They will lessen the burden of the existing MCCs that additionally cover another ward,” a senior corporation official said.

The new MCCs predominantly will cover the entire ward in which they are located and additionally the nearby wards.

The corporation said that transport cost and time involved in moving the waste will come down.

Hyderabad: The Telangana high court on Wednesday directed the state government to not demolish the existing Secretariat building till the cabinet decides the plan and design of new Secretariat complex and till the HC adjudicates the pleas filed against demolition.

The bench of Chief Justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A Abhishek Reddy gave this interim direction while hearing two PILs filed by Congress MP A Revanth Reddy and Professor P L Visweswara Rao.

Responding to a contention of additional advocate general J Ramachandra Rao that the designs have not been finalised yet, the bench wondered as to why the state is taking so much time to finalise the design. The bench also expressed doubts as to how the construction of a new structure would commence without design and directed the government not to go ahead with the demolition process till it decides about the new structure.

The government has been contending that it wants to build a world-class Secretariat in the place of the existing Secretariat. The state counsel said that the existing Secretariat is beset with many problems and the offices in it were scattered.

He said that the proposed new structure would be built with Rs 400 crore and urged HC to allow them to go ahead with any plan that suits the government.

Kolkata: Three days after a middle-aged Baranagar homemaker ran in a ball of fire and collapsed in front of a neighbour’s door on Sunday, she died at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital on Thursday.

Cops on Thursday arrested the victim’s sister-in-law for allegedly setting the victim , Shyamali Das, on fire with kerosene and burning her to death during an argument. Cops are looking for others family members of the accused, Smita Das, who had gone into hiding after the news of Shyamali’s death arrived.

According to locals, the two Das brothers own an ancestral house on a three-cottah plot at Baranagar’s Lakeview Park. “Both families used to engage in bitter battle over property dispute. Sometimes, neighbours, too, intervened to settle the matter,” said a local.

“Both the families also complained to police against each other but they continued with the brawl till late at night,” a local woman said.

The situation took a turn for the worse on Sunday when the two got into an argument. “Both the husbands weren’t at the home when the two homemakers scuffled with each other during an altercation over property dispute. Suddenly, we saw the eldest housewife running on the street in a ball of fire,” a neighbour said.

BENGALURU: The high court on Thursday directed the Centre to appoint a higher-ranking officer to inspect whether BMRCL has complied with terms of the memorandums of understating (MOUs) pertaining to Phases 1 and 2 of the Namma Metro project .

Acting on a PIL filed by DT Devare and Bangalore Environment Trust, a division bench headed by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka also directed the central government to specify whether the Metro policy envisaged is enforceable or not.

The bench orally indicated that in case the policy and associated norms are found to be binding in nature and the project is not being implemented in accordance with them, the court will not hesitate to stop the ongoing Phase 2 project.

The petitioners have claimed that despite the agreement between the state and Centre with long-term perspectives for Bengaluru, the authorities are continuing with implementation of the Metro project without adhering to Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) and Integrated Traffic Ratio Rationalization Plan (ITRRP).

Th petitioners have also cited example of authorities leaving out two important stretches, Marathahalli to Hosakerehalli and Iblur to Hebbal, due to the possibility of overlap with the elevated corridor project. According to them, a huge amount of public money is being wasted on ad-hoc and stopgap projects.

Sanction for Phase 1 was accorded on May 11, 2006 and a tripartite MOU was signed on December 24, 2010, as per which the state was under obligation to created an ITRRP or CMP. Phase 2 was approved on February 21, 2014 and an MOU was signed on February 24, 2017.

Safe shelter for inter-caste couple in Trichy

TRICHY: A year after its inauguration, the state’s first exclusive safe shelter for inter-caste couples in Trichy has accommodated and saved several couples hounded by their families for marrying outside their caste. On the occasion of Valentine ’s Day, about 10 couples who benefited from the facility were profusely thankful to it for safeguarding them from the hostility they faced.

The shelter built by Adhalinaal Kadhal Seiveer (Therefore, fall in love) trust near police colony in Anna Nagar for about Rs 10 lakh was opened in the Valentine’s Day week last year. Couples marrying outside their caste who approach the trust can be accommodated in the 345 square feet facility for one week. The time should be used to register their marriage and find employment to lead an independent life. “A week after the inter-caste marriage is crucial for the two adults. We help them in this critical period by providing them shelter and food,” Se Gunasekar, managing trustee of the trust, said.

Though inter-caste couples can approach the police station, they will not be allowed to stay there during the night. Thus, very often they are orphaned on the streets and it is for such people that the shelters will be a safe haven, Gunasekar said. According to him, the shelter which completes a year on February 14 has saved 10 inter-caste couples from violent opposition from their families.

“For a week, my family was hounding us because I married a person of another caste. We felt very safe in the shelter. It will surely help similar couples to evade the threats,” said a 24-year-old woman. The trust said that police colony was chosen for the shelter as it is located close to the Navalpattu police training institute. “We have applied for recognition from the district social welfare department. However, they have been hesitating to recognize the shelter saying there is no precedent,” Gunasekar said. If the department rendered recognition, police stations would direct inter-caste couples seeking refuge to stay at the shelter, he added. Efforts to contact the district social welfare department officer went in vain.

NAINITAL: A 29-year-old TV actor from Punjab, whose charred body was found in Nainital’s Kaladhungi area, was allegedly killed by her husband and his friend on suspicion of an extra-marital affair, police said on Wednesday.

Nainital SSP Sunil Kumar Meena told TOI that the actor, identified as Anita Singh, had come to Kaladhungi with her husband Ravinder Pal Singh.

The police official said that Ravinder suspected that Anita was involved in an extra-marital affair which is why he conspired with his friend Kuldeep to kill her. “Ravinder told his wife that his friend Kuldeep has some contacts in Mumbai who can help her get acting roles in Bollywood. The couple travelled from Ferozepur in Punjab to Kaladhungi on January 30 and met Kuldeep at an eatery. Kuldeep had laced Anita’s tea with sedatives and as she lost consciousness, the duo strangled her using a rope, took her to a field and set her body on fire after midnight. They then fled the spot,” Meena said.

After committing the crime, Kuldeep went to his home and Ravinder escaped to Delhi. The day after, local residents discovered the charred body and informed police.

Meena added that footages from over 110 CCTV cameras were scanned to nab the accused. “We scanned the CCTV footage and found the car in which Anita was carried. The owner of the car was soon located and he said that his relative, Kuldeep, had borrowed the car,” Meena said.

Representative image

TRICHY: The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC), Karur region has launched two air-conditioned (AC) buses on town routes in Karur. State transport minister M R Vijayabhaskar inaugurated the buses on Thursday.

This is the first time after the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) in Chennai, AC buses on town routes are launched outside the state capital. TNSTC said they have attempted to operate the AC town bus for the first time in the state in Karur, a facility that is not available even in large cities like Coimbatore, Madurai and Trichy .

The two AC buses will connect Karur town with Kulithalai and Velur (near Velayuthampalayam) towns. Velur is located about 21km from Karur town while Kulithalai is located between Trichy and Karur Road. “Both routes are high-demanding stretches. Operating AC bus in the Velur destination is an appropriate choice as people near Velayuthampalayam visit Karur for work on a daily basis,” said K Manohar, a Karur-based businessman. Fare for the AC bus will 10-20% higher than the normal bus fare, officials said.

“Minimum ticket fare will be Rs 10, and will go up to Rs 30. Based on the response, we will increase the number of AC buses,” an official with the TNSTC said.

The AC bus has a seating capacity for 40 passengers and can accommodate 20 standees.

Since Coimbatore, Madurai and Trichy are sanctioned electric buses under Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric (FAME) II scheme, it is said that Karur was allotted the AC buses.

271,['14/02/2020'],Namma Metro News: Trains may run at 2-minutes frequency on 3 upcoming Namma Metro corridors,"Representative image

Times View Speed, affordability and ease of travel have led to a surge in Namma Metro’s popularity. So have six-coach trains, which made commutes a tad more comfortable. With ridership steadily climbing, it’s prudent on the part of BMRCL to embrace new technologies and upgrade its systems. Increasing train frequency will not only reduce waiting time at stations, but may also get more passengers on board. However, BMRCL has a bigger task at hand: expediting work on the upcoming corridors. Phase 1 missed multiple deadlines and the same story should not be repeated this time around.

BENGALURU: Passengers travelling on three upcoming Namma Metro lines — Electronics City, IIMB and ORR-airport — needn’t have to wait long for the next train. The corridors may see trains running every two minutes, thanks to the advanced communications-based train control (CBTC) system.In existing corridors, peak-hour frequency is four minutes and for non-peak hours, it’s 10 minutes. The distance-to-go (DTG) signalling system is used at present, in which the minimum time between two trains is two-and-a-half minutes.“The newer standalone lines like Electronics City, IIMB and ORR-airport are being designed for CBTC from the beginning,” said BMRCL managing director Ajay Seth.CBTC can reduce train headway to less than 90 seconds.“The present signalling system can handle three minutes’ frequency. With CBTC, two-minute frequency is feasible, but reducing it to 1.5 minutes will require other operational improvements. Frequency doesn’t depend only on signalling, but also civil design, location of turn backs and length of underground sections,” he said.BMRCL is also planning to upgrade signalling system of the existing Purple and Green lines. “The present systems are designed for 120-second frequency. Upgradation of existing lines will be necessary after 10 years once the ridership reaches 40,000 passengers per hour per direction (PPHPD). At present, it’s about 22,500,” Seth explained.Officials said frequency of trains will depend on actual requirement and Phase 2 platform lengths will be designed to accommodate only six-car trains. The maximum length will be 150 metre for elevated stations and 192m (platform and system rooms) for underground stations.The state-of-the art signalling system has already been implemented in new Metro systems like Kochi and Nagpur. While RV Road-Bommasandra (Electronics City) line will be functional by November 2021, the other two corridors Gottigere-Nagawara (IIMB) and Silk Board-KR Puram-Kempegowda International Airport (ORR-airport) will be operational by 2024.Driverless trains will have to waitAn official said: “CBTC allows operation of trains without drivers but people are not ready to accept driverless trains. We have to instil confidence in passengers.”CBTC will help maintain a safe distance between trains with the help of sensors on the track and other systems.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74126618,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-665922,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/trains-may-run-at-2-min-frequency-on-3-upcoming-metro-corridors/articleshow/74124860.cms

HYDERABAD: In their attempts to keep employees safe, IT companies are discouraging travel to China and other countries affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), which has reportedly claimed nearly 1,200 lives in the neighbouring country.Even employees working for companies with Chinese clients have refused to take on-site postings in Hong Kong. In many cases, these on-site postings offer employees three times their current salary.While most IT companies in the state do not have business ties in China, the alerts are also meant to discourage employees from taking leisure trips to the country. “We are being told to name the destination of travel while making leave applications. The grapevine says that the human resource team is keeping track of all leaves being sought which are over three to four days. They are even trying to find out from other teams if a member has plans to travel abroad. Although our company does not cater to China or Singapore, many employees travel abroad for vacations,” said a software engineer working with an IT firm in the city.Meanwhile, some companies which have on-site opportunities are finding it increasingly difficult to find interested employees for such postings. However, employees are playing it safe be it for personal or professional reasons. “In our office, an informal chat by a senior supervisor about a posting in Hong Kong resulted in five people calling in sick the very next day,” said a techie under the condition of anonymity.While on-site offers are the creme-de-la-creme when it comes to opportunities with postings generally meaning higher pay, IT professionals have declined several such lucrative offers in a bid to avoid being affected by the virus. “While IT companies in Hyderabad have very few clients in China, most of the on-site postings are in Hong Kong and these have been declined outright.

The Times of India’s unique initiative, ‘Times Hyderabad Heroes ’, launched to honour the city’s do-gooders has received overwhelming response. To evaluate these entries and draw a final list of Good Samaritans, who will be featured in these columns, TOI has put together an eminent jury comprising four prominent citizens from Hyderabad.

On this panel are: BVR Mohan Reddy, executive chairman of Cyient and chairman of the board of governors at IIT-Hyderabad; Sangita Reddy, joint managing director of Apollo Hospitals Group; Pullela Gopichand, chief national coach of the Indian Badminton team and Swati Lakra, inspector general of police (women’s safety), Telangana. Apart from being celebrated professionals, each of these jury members are known for their contribution to society in the field of education, healthcare, sports and women’s safety.

Mohan Reddy’s Cyient Foundation that runs an Adopt-a-School programme, extends financial, infrastructural and social support to over 18,500 children in 28 government schools. The foundation also imparts digital literacy in India through 67 Cyient Digital Centres.

Committed to building an inclusive and sustainable healthcare ecosystem in the country, Sangita Reddy launched Apollo Reach, which aims to build a string of secondary care hospitals in rural areas across India. Her Apollo Philanthropy arm encompasses multiple programmes: Save a Child’s Heart Initiative, SAHI, CURE and the Billion Hearts Beating Foundation.

Alongside churning world champions from his own academy, Gopichand also plays an active role in the Gopichand-Mytrah initiative – a collaboration between Pullela Gopichand Badminton Foundation and Mytrah Foundation – that extends training facilities to aspiring athletes from economically weaker sections. It takes care of 32 athletes apart from other sportspersons in various disciplines.

Known for a force to reckon with, within the police department, it was during Lakra’s regime as ACP (Crime) that two major initiatives for women’s safety were rolled out: SheTeams and Bharosa Centre. Thousands of women and children — victims of sexual assault and domestic violence – find legal and social support through these platforms. Given its success, the Supreme Court even suggested that the Bharosa Centre be replicated across the country.

275,['14/02/2020'],Wrong catch: Fish nets in city lakes harming birds,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Hyderabad: Just a year after two incidents — a fishing hook piercing the neck of a flamingo and a darter’s beak getting entangled in a cloth at Ameenpur lake — a spoonbill was spotted with a plastic rope from a fishing net tangled around its beak at Osmansagar. Wildlife teams are currently on the lookout for the bird after a photographer posted the picture of the spoonbill on social media seeking its rescue.

Lakes and other water bodies in the city, over the past few years, are becoming increasingly hazardous for birds and other marine lifeforms due to the presence of ghost nets and other fishing gear. This, besides the rampant pollution.

“I have spotted a group of spoonbills during one of my photo expeditions to the backwaters of Osmansagar lake. Among them was this bird which looked as if something was stuck on its beak. After taking a closer look, I saw that a plastic rope from a fishing net got entangled to its beak,” said wildlife photographer and conservationist IS Hariharan. “The rope was so badly entangled that the bird was not even able to open its beak to eat. It was as if someone had tied it shut...,” he added.

Following this, environmentalists and members of the rescue team who formed a search party to find the bird have warned that such leftover fishing gear could threaten wildlife if not removed or disposed properly. “Our team is trying to track the bird...This is happening despite us cleaning the lake regularly and fishing out huge quantities of ghost nets,”,” said founder of Animal Warriors India (AWI),Pradeep Nair.

The AWI has reached out to the forest department asking them to intimate the concerned authorities and sensitise the fishing community about the dangers of such unattended fishing gear in water bodies. “We will write to the concerned authority as lakes do not come under our jurisdiction. We will attach photographs of such birds and other animals which are suffering due to these nets and ask them to sanitise such lakes,” said senior forest department official, A Shankaran.

276,['14/02/2020'],Teacher advice: Stick to revision of basics for last-minute studies,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Hyderabad: With the commencement of CBSE board exams just a day away, teachers have urged students to avoid studying till the last minute and instead use that time for revision of basics. Over 10,000 students from 167 schools across the city are set to sit for their Class 10 and Class 12 exams from February 15. The exams will begin with skill-based subjects followed by core subjects on February 21.

Given a slew of changes introduced by the CBSE for this year’s exams, teachers have discouraged students from rote learning. Students have been told to not worry about the “type of questions” as the board has reduced the number of questions for major subjects and has focussed on objective-type questions. “

There are students who try to mug up on the last day. They should instead strengthen areas which they are confident about and leave behind their weaknesses on the last day,” said principal of Chirec International School, Iffat Ibrahim. “Making notes of key topics will help them fare better,” the principal advised.

From revising chemical names to formulae and theories, teachers recommend that students should stick to the simple things and not exert themselves too much on the last day. “Many students believe in solving as many problems as possible till the last minute. Instead of solving problems, students should focus on remembering the procedures and formulas that will ultimately help them draw solutions,” said Raghavan Badrinath, mathematics teacher at Geetanjali School.

Apart from counselling students on managing stress, many teachers have formed Whatsapp groups to help students clear doubts.

Margosa road at Malleshwaram dug up by BBMP on tender sure project (File Photo)

BENGALURU: Traffic police have joined motorists and Malleswaram residents in expressing concern over the snail’s pace of redevelopment work on Margosa Road , a lifeline of the locality.

The work, taken up under the TenderSURE model, began on January 5, 2019 and was to be completed by the yearend. However, the slow progress has forced motorists to endure nightmarish crawls. Dust kicked up by the work is leaving locals and traders exasperated.

Considering that it’s a one-way stretch, it’s difficult to divert traffic and reduce congestion on the road, say traffic police. Joint commissioner of police (traffic) BR Ravikanthe Gowda said no work happens on the road at night, hence the delay. “They (workers) bring the material only by 3.30 or 4am,” he pointed out.

According to the officer, the contractor has listed out several reasons for the delay. The presence of nearly 75 trees on the stretch is among the major concerns as work has to be carried out in such a way that they aren’t damaged.

Rekha Chari, a member of the ward committee, said, “We had a panel meeting on February 6 and our corporator assured us the work would be completed by March 31.”

Srinivas KN, a senior citizen and resident of Margosa Road, said: “I leave for morning walk at 5am but it’s very dark as they have removed all streetlights. I can’t walk on the road any more as construction material takes up half the space.”

Amaravati: The stand-off over the constitution of the select committee in legislative council is heading for a showdown between YSRC and TDP as council chairman MA Shariff warned legislative assembly secretary of serious consequences if the committee was not constituted as per his instructions.

Taking legislature secretary Balakrishnamacharyulu’s decision to return the file with a serious note, the chairman asked the secretary to follow his instructions.

The chairman expressed his displeasure at the secretary for not obeying his directive. According to sources the chairman has told the secretary to face the consequences if he did not to comply with his directive.

Earlier this week, the legislature secretary Balakrishnamacharyulu had returned the file to the chairman stating it was not possible to constitute the select committee under Rule 154. Sources said the chairman sent the names for two select committees to the secretary with a directive to issue formal orders and send the notification to all the members.

The chairman named finance minister Buggana Rajendranth as chairman of the select committee to oversee the three capital cities bill and municipal administration minister Botcha Satyanarayana as chairman for the committee to scrutiny CRDA repeal bill. He also named five MLCs from TDP, one each from YSRC, BJP and PDF in the two committees.

Leader of the Council and deputy chief minister Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose and YSRC chief whip Ummareddi Venkateswarlu wrote separate letters to the chairman and legislature secretary raising objection over the constitution of the select committees.

They said the formation of the select committees without voting on the bill was against the rules and there was no need to follow the chairman’s instructions. Bose said the chairman’s discretionary powers were very limited and he could not do whatever he desires.

Sensing trouble, TDP MLCs met the secretary and asked him to expedite the process of constituting the select committees as the chairman had taken the decision. Similarly, ministers Botcha, Bose and other senior YSRC leaders held discussions with the secretary and asked him not to constitute the panels as it was against the rules.

“The chairman’s directive is not a fatwa to be translated into orders immediately. The secretary too has a job to go through the rules and take a decision,” said legislative affairs and finance minister Buggana.

After going through the arguments of both the sides, the secretary returned the file to the chairman stating that the constitution of select committees under Rule 154 was not possible.

Vijayawada: Despite completing two decades of cell phone revolution, the latest data collected from telecom service providers (TSPs) and Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) in 2019 showed that 2,095 inhabited villages in the state do not have mobile services.

In Telangana, 110 villages are without mobile services.

Overall, AP accounts over 7% in terms of having inhabited villages without mobile services in India. Overall, India has 27,721 inhabited villages that are still waiting for a mobile service let alone internet penetration. However, BSNL boasts of having connectivity even in areas affected by Maoists in the state.

Going by census 2011, there are 16,158 inhabited villages in Andhra Pradesh which means that 12% of entire rural AP do not have mobile services while the remaining 14,068 villages have mobile services. The IT ministry attributed lack of mobile services in rural areas due to tough terrain, diverse locations, scattered population and commercially non-viable.

Interestingly, the data showed that the percentage share of BSNL to total subscribers in Andhra Pradesh was 11.31% and of private TSPs, 88.69%. One of the fundamental reasons for this is that BSNL migrated to 4G in Andhra Pradesh only in August 2019.

Whereas other private operators had already migrated and also brought out attractive unlimited plans under 4G scheme. Also, there are a total of 10,3365 4G base transceiver stations in the two Telugu states as of January, 2020.

Hyderabad: A mechanic who attempted suicide due to his debts, was saved by a police patrol party of Amberpet at the nick of time when he was hanging from the ceiling at his shop on Thursday morning.

Amberpet police said they got a call from 50-year-old Subhramanyam informing them that he was committing suicide and disconnected the phone call. Police claim the patrol team reached Subhramanyam’s mechanic shop at Patel Nagar in three minutes. They opened the shop’s shutter and found Subhramanyam hanging from the ceiling with a chunni (stole).

On seeing him struggling, the patrol team — constables K Raghu Kumar, Vinod Kumar and home guard Gangachalam — rescued him by removing the chunni and immediately shifted him to a local hospital, and his life was saved.

“As part of community policing, generally the locals and police patrol teams exchange their numbers and be in touch with each other. Subhramanyam, who too has patrolling party number, directly called our patrolling staff and informed that he decided to end his life. Patrolling team tried to counsel him over the phone but he disconnected the call,’’ Amberpet inspector B Mohan Kumar told TOI.

He said that since the patrolling staff knew Subhramanyam they rushed to his shop. Police said that if there was a delay of even a few seconds, the mechanic would have died. ``Subhramanyam decided to take the extreme step due to financial problems,’’ the inspector said. However, no case was registered by police and his condition was said to be stable.

Though the mother and the baby had minor injuries, they were admitted to Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) and both were safe. Fire service personnel said the woman had jumped into the well 15 minutes before the cry of the baby reached the neighbours. All women police station (AWPS), Cantonment which took up the investigation found that she decided to end her life due to a family dispute.

The police were yet to decide on registering a case of attempt to suicide. The fire service personnel said it was a miraculous escape for the woman and the baby as the water level was 5 feet and the well was also free from any poisonous gas as it was in use.

Representative image

NAGPUR: On the backdrop of rising unemployment and concerns over economy, joint director of technical education at Amravati division, DV Jadhav, raised several eyebrows when he said no government can provide jobs to every graduate.

He was speaking at the 22nd convocation of Government Polytechnic, Nagpur, on Thursday.

Speaking to TOI on the sidelines, Jadhav said by saying so, he meant that it is difficult to provide direct jobs. “No government can give jobs to 100% graduates. There are several schemes through District Industries Center (DICT) under the micro, small, medium enterprises (MSME) initiatives to provide funding worth lakhs. Graduates need to initiate startups so that they become job givers and not seekers,” he said.

Asked about largescale vacancies in government sectors, including education where qualified candidates are forced to take up odd jobs, Jadhav said it was up to the government. “I can’t comment on that as it is a policy matter,” he said.

On the manifestos of each party and successive government’s attempt to lure youth on job promise, Jadhav said, “Graduates shouldn’t wait for the governments to create jobs for them. They can innovate using their imagination and take benefit of schemes,” he said.

Jadhav delivered the 22nd convocation speech in the capacity of chairman, Board of Governors. This was the first time a joint director from a neighbouring division donned the role in the absence of a full-time joint director at Nagpur. The temporary charge is held by Ram Nibudey at Nagpur.

Addressing the students, their parents, and teachers, Jadhav said, “Now, you have achieved a major milestone in your career and you have an opportunity to choose either a graduation course or appear in competitive exam or may be opt for a job in industry. Even as you enter your working life, many good things are happening around.”

“But we are facing several challenges too. The first good thing is that you are entering your practical life when the Indian economy is getting integrated with the global economy through the process of globalization,” he said.

“Instead of becoming job seeker, can we become job provider by becoming an entrepreneur? You have different ideas. Incubate them, go for patent and being you own startup,” he said.

TCS Mihan center head Arvind Kumar, officiating principal Deepak Kulkarni, controller of examinations Milind Deshpande, ceremony in-charge NV Raut and heads of all 12 branches were present.

Amaravati: TDP MLCs have decided to move privilege motion against chief minister YS Jaganmohan Reddy in the next session for disrespecting the council chairman MA Shareef and other members.

They will visit Delhi to apprise the central government about the alleged undemocratic actions of the chief minister.

These were revealed by MLCs P Ashokbabu, AS Ramakrishna and BT Naidu, who spoke to the media at the party office on Thursday.

They criticised the chief minister for insulting members of the Upper House. Ramakrishna said the Upper House has several intellectuals, including teachers, doctors and advocates, and it was unbecoming of the way the chief minister spoke. “The CM said MLCs entered the council from the backdoor. He has not right to humiliate the members who entered the portals through election in a democratic way,” said Ramakrishna.

Speaking on similar lines, Ashokbabu said the chief minister met Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the abolition of legislative council and three-capital proposal but failed to make public the memorandum submitted to the PM.

He accused the chief minister of deciding to abolish the council out of grudge against TDP MLCs. tnn

NASHIK: Two people have been booked by the police for allegedly cheating a gym owner of Rs 6 lakh on the pretext of running the facility on rental basis.

Nishikant Suryawanshi (53), a resident of Bali Mandir, Panchavati, has a gymnasium at Sitaram Chambers on Peth Road. Two people, hailing from Wadala village in Nashik city, approached him to take the gym on lease.

Suryawanshi rented out the gym in March 2019, along with equipment worth Rs 6 lakh. The business at the gym was going on smoothly for quite some time.

However, tensions started brewing between Suryawanshi and the two suspects over the conduct of the gym over the past few days. Suryawanshi said when the two suspects started defaulting on payment of dues, he asked them to honour the agreement he had signed with them.

A few days later, Suryawanshi learnt that some of the equipment had gone missing from the gym. When he asked them about the missing equipment, they made excuses claiming that the equipment was sent for repairs. Later, Suryawanshi learnt that the two suspects had allegedly sold the equipment to a person in Bhiwandi. He then lodged a complaint at Panchavati police station.

Police said they have launched a manhunt for the suspects. They have also searched their residences but the suspects were not there. “We have booked the suspects under section 420 (cheating) and 406 (breach of trust) of the IPC,” said a police officer attached with Panchavati police.

KOLKATA: After waiting for 10 years, people got to see the inside of the Temple of the Vedic Planetarium (TOVP) at Mayapur — headquarters of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness ( Iskcon ) — on Thursday when the first floor of the temple was inaugurated.

Nearly 10,000 devotees can assemble together on the ‘ pujari floor ’, spread over 2.5 acres or 400,000 square feet. Iskcon authorities claimed that it’s the biggest single floor for religious congregation. The floor has a central hall and 20 mammoth rooms, each of which will be designated for some service.

The temple will be inaugurated in 2022 and devotees from across the globe, who are engineers, have designed its dome. This is the second largest temple in the world with 113 metres height, next to St Peter’s Basilica that is 138-metre high.

The temple is being built at a cost of Rs 700 crore, while Ambarish Das or Alfred Ford, a scion of the American Ford family owning the automobile giant, has taken a lead role in this project.

Three principal deities of the temple are Radha Madhava, Pancha Tattva and Narasimha. Perhaps for the first time, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, founder of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, will be addressed as the Prince of Nabadwip in this temple.

Trichy: Trichy is the number one market for Air India Express (AIE) in Tamil Nadu and the airline wishes to add more capacity in this sector. However, as the company is in disinvestment mode, they are unable to augment the capacity as of now, said the budget carrier’s chief executive officer K Shyam Sundar.

He was speaking to reporters here on Thursday while announcing the airline’s maiden non-stop flights on the Trichy-Abu Dhabi and Trichy-Doha sectors from March 28. New services to Delhi and Madurai will also commence on the day. “With this, AIE will be offering Trichy passengers a total of 35 flights per week”, he added.

AIE has been operating flights to Dubai and Singapore for years while Sharjah was also added a few years ago. When asked about more domestic services, Shyam Sundar said though Air India Express is not much into domestic operations, they were introducing a direct flight from Trichy to Delhi via Madurai starting March 28.

Elaborating on AIE’s performance, he said the airline has been registering profit continuously for the last few years. “We expect a record profit of more than Rs 500 crore in 2019-20. Air India Express (AIE) has registered a 40% increase in operating revenue in the first half of the financial year compared to the corresponding period of last year,” he said. He added that the net profit earned by AIE had also gone up by 26%.

“Already we have attained Rs 4,235 crore as operating revenue at the end of December 2019. For the first time, AIE will touch Rs 5,000 crore operating revenue at the end of this current fiscal year since the airline's inception”, he said.

Vijayawada: The high court on Thursday heard petitions filed by former minister Y S Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter seeking a CBI inquiry into his death.

The petition was heard by a high court bench led by Justice U Durga Prasada Rao. Among the petitioners were YS Vivekananda Reddy’s daughter Sunitha Narreddy, his wife Soubhagyamma, MLC BTech Ravi, and former minister Adinarayana Reddy. The petitioners’ counsel expressed dissatisfaction over the investigation taken up by the state police. They argued that the special investigation team (SIT) deployed by the government was not effective. They said the police had arrested only three suspects in the case.

The counsel argued that Viveka’s suicide letter was misleading. “Despite allegations against the driver, the police still have not arrested him and this is raising doubts about the investigation,” the counsel said. Petitioners also argued that the then opposition leader YS Jaganmohan Reddy, who demanded a CBI inquiry into Vivekananda’s murder , had withdrawn the petition after becoming the chief minister.

When asked by the court whether they have any objections, counsels for CBI said they do not have any.

Former Union minister Salman Khursheed argued on behalf of MLC BTech Ravi. The court has posted the case to February 20 for further hearing.

Trichy: A section of employees in the office of the regional joint director of collegiate education in Trichy on Thursday accused RJDCE S Usha of physically assaulting two of them and sought action against her. The employees have written to the director of collegiate education in this regard.

One of the victims, Rajeswari, a stenographer in the office, was admitted to hospital after she allegedly fell unconscious following the trauma. Sources said the assault began on Wednesday evening when office superintendent Savariyammal Brisca Mary came out weeping from Usha’s cabin. “Mary told us that she was slapped by Usha when she had requested her to process a file that had come from one of the aided colleges in the city,” said a male staff member in the office.

On Thursday morning, Rajeswari herself was slapped by her on her back for “committing a simple spelling mistake”. She said she was so traumatised that she had to be admitted to hospital. Director of collegiate education, Chennai C Jothi Venkateswaran confirmed to TOI that he has received complaints from the staff and that he would forward them to the higher education secretary recommending action against Usha.

Saying that this was not the first time that the RJDCE has been accused of such action, former BDU syndicate member D Muthuramakrishnan said that last year she was accused of abusing staff in filthy language and the issue was taken up with the district collector. She went on medical leave, but was reinstated after a few days.

Following the incident, employees of the RJDCE office, a majority of whom are female, gathered in front of the office in protest against Usha’s abuse. “Physical assault of subordinate staff invites suspension with immediate effect. Therefore, we urge the higher education secretary to suspend her and order an inquiry into the whole controversy,” said former AUT president K Pandiyan. Higher education secretary Apoorva said she has not yet been informed about the incident but promised to take necessary steps after a detailed inquiry into the matter.

296,['14/02/2020'],7cr litre of treated water goes down drain daily,"This story is from February 14, 2020

(done)

Aurangabad: In drought-prone Aurangabad , which invariably faces water scarcity, a whopping seven crore litres of treated water generated from sewage treatment plants (STPs) is wasted almost on a daily basis.

The Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) operates four STPs, which generate 75 MLD treated water, said the civic authorities.

While the civic body is ready to offer this water at a meagre price of Rs 25 per thousand litre for construction purpose, individuals as well builders continue to use either tap water or groundwater for building houses.

“The water generated from STPs cannot be used for drinking purpose, but it can be safely used for construction among other limited purposes. Out of 75 MLD water generated from STPs, only 2 MLD to 3 MLD is utilised towards the intended purpose. It is negligible use considering the huge amount of total treated water generated from STPs,” said Anil Tanpure, AMC deputy engineer with the drainage department.

“While one MLD corresponds to around 10 lakh litres of water, 70 MLD water in question that remains unutilised comes out to be huge seven crore litres, which is discharged into nullahs.”

Incidentally, the amount is close to half the water drawn by AMC from Jayakwadi dam over a period of 24 hours towards supply to Aurangabad. The civic body draws around 160 MLD to 170 MLD water from the dam

The AMC has STPs operational each at Kanchanwadi, Zalta T-point, Padegaon and near Salim Ali Lake with varying installed and operational capacities.

Civic authorities said that only National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has been procuring water from STPs for the ongoing construction work of Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway that passes through Aurangabad among other sporadic demands.

“The civic body has fixed a reasonable rate for the treated water from STPs. We do not want to earn any profit from the selling from treated water, but the only intension is to ensure judicious use of water in the city like Aurangabad where water-scarcity has almost become a norm,” Tanpure said.

As building construction activities are rampant in the city and outskirts, civic activists have called for an official crackdown to ensure mandatory use of treated water.

Civic activist Rajendra Datey-Patil said the AMC must crack down against the construction activities that found using tap water or groundwater for construction purposes. “It is a scientifically proven fact that the treated water from STPs can be safely used for construction activities. The local civic body must issue orders for imperative use of such water for building homes and those using other sources must face punitive action,” he said.

As per official data available with MahaRERA, the regulatory body in the field of real estate, around 860 registered housing construction projects are on in Aurangabad district with a majority of them being taking place in and around the city.

Besides, the period between two successive monsoons is used by many households for carrying out an extension of their existing homes. While the latest number of building permissions issued by the local civic body could not be ascertained, construction activities in the range of 500 to 700 were on within AMC limits.

297,['14/02/2020'],NMC special general body not in favour of NIT’s restoration,"This story is from February 14, 2020

NAGPUR: The city Congress is divided over the fate of local urban development authority — Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT). This came to the fore during the special general body meeting convened by mayor Sandip Joshi , which was aimed at countering the move on NIT’s restoration.

A section of party leaders, including guardian and energy minister Nitin Raut, demanded restoration of NIT. But most of the 29 Congress corporators, including leader of opposition Tanaji Wanve, favoured scrapping of the civic agency.

On Thursday, the BJP-ruled NMC passed a resolution stating that the city should have only one planning authority. Now, the civic administration will submit its say to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, who on January 10 had sought NMC’s stand over Raut’s demand.

“Nagpur should have only one planning authority. As per the state government’s old order, NIT along with Gunthewari and other schemes should be handed over to the NMC. Excess NIT employees and officials should be absorbed in NMC and if they are not interested to join the civic body, then the NMC should take nod from the state government to appoint staff,” the mayor said while giving ruling after the marathon meeting.

As many as 34 corporators, including Congress corporators Darshani Dhawad, Manoj Sangole, Sanjay Mahakalkar, along with BSP and BJP corporators, participated in the discussion and all of them opposed restoration of NIT. Joshi said the minutes of the special general body meeting will be sent to the state government.

The mayor also directed the administration to form a special cell to resolve cases related to the Gunthewari Act by February 29. “A meeting of former trustees, senior corporators and all party leaders along with NIT chairman should be convened soon,” the mayor said.

“Nagpur should have only one development agency like any other city in the country or state,” was the general observation of corporators, who expressed concern over how two developing agencies are adversely affecting the city’s development.

Earlier, senior Congress corporator Sandeep Sahare informed the mayor that the special general body meeting over NIT could not be held as the dissolution issue remains sub-judice. It prompted the mayor to sought legal opinion and the administration clarified that the house can continue.

Former mayor and city BJP president Pravin Datke blamed NIT for destroying city’s planning by carrying out large-scale unplanned development works. “On the backdrop of this, it is the citizens who are forced to suffer haphazard development,” said Datke.

Endorsing that the city should have only one planning and development authority, senior Congress corproators, including Wanve and Praful Gudadhe, blamed the Devendra Fadnavis-led BJP government for the mess. Wanve justified Raut’s move as many citizens had approached him over pending works in the NIT and it forced him to approach the state government to restore the civic agency.

Gudadhe said the past BJP-led state government’s move to dissolve the NIT was just to garner votes in civic and state assembly elections.

Senior BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari defended the past government’s move and succeeded in cornering Gudadhe. He said the NMC has received CM Uddhav Thackeray’s letter seeking corporation’s opinion over restoration of NIT with missing pages. He demanded the mayor not to give ruling until the NMC receives the full letter.

Senior independent corporator Abha Pande informed the house that issuing just a government resolution cannot dissolve the NIT.

The first announcement to dissolve NIT was made in December 2016, just two months ahead of the NMC elections that were held in February 2017. The second announcement was made in August 2019 ahead of the state elections.

MADURAI: Gold jewels weighing around 23,872 grams were looted in 135 reported house break-in incidents in Madurai city police limits in 2019, reveals an RTI filed by TOI. The quantity of the loot in 2019 equals the quantity of gold jewels looted in 2017 and 2018 put together.

About 11,600 grams of gold jewels were looted in 2017, whereas in 2018, it has increased to 14,800 grams. With the quantity of gold jewels stolen has been on the rise, the city police are clearly struggling to crack cases and put the burglars behind the bars.

However, in terms of the number of incidents reported, house break-in incidents have come down quite well. In 2019, the reported number of cases has dropped to 136 from 185 in 2018, a dip by 26%.

Madurai city police commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham attributed the increased quantity of looted gold jewels to one incident, which was reported in mid-February last year in Tallakulam police limit. About 11,930 grams of gold jewels were stolen in that particular incident alone.

The commissioner said that some of the police stations such as Anna Nagar and Thilagar Thidal worked well and brought down house break-in incidents in the last year. however, he was not satisfied with the performance of the police stations in Tallakulam range, which consists of Tallakulam, Sellur, and Koodal Pudur, in terms of prevention and detection, he said. He has formed special teams to work on crime detection and increased vigilance in Tallakulam and Koodalpudur station limits to check the crime incidents, he said.

The recovery of gold jewels has also been on the lower side in 2019. Against 36% of recovery shown in 2018, the city police have managed to recover only 17% of the looted gold jewels.

Police officials from Koodal Pudur and Tallakulam police stations, where more number of house break-in incidents are reported, say that the area to be covered by them is vast. A police officer from Koodal Pudur station said that they have increased the beat system at night and introduced additional patrol teams. Detection in a few incidents leading to the arrest of criminals is the only way to bring down the theft cases, they said. “We are working on prevention of crime and detection. We are hopeful of cracking a few incidents and bringing down the numbers,” a police officer said.

299,['14/02/2020'],"Woman doc, minor injured in acid attack at Saoner , Nagpur","This story is from February 14, 2020

Nagpur: ‘Tumhara aisa chehra bigad du, toh tum kya kar loge?’ (What will you do if I spoil your face like this?) Thus saying, a 22-year-old man hurled acid on a lecturer of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) and another two girls, including a 14-year-old, at Pehlapar ward of Saoner tehsil on Thursday.

Sources said the attacker Nilesh Kanhere went close to the woman doctor-cum-lecturer, in her 20s, and passed an objectionable remark. As she retorted strongly and started walking away, the man followed and threw acid aiming at her face from a plastic bottle. The woman managed to dodge in time but still got some acid on her right hand elbow that got burnt. She is a lecturer of preventive science medicine and also completing her MD.

Police claimed the acid appeared to be the one used for cleaning bathroom but it is being examined. The injured were rushed to a local hospital in Saoner before being shifted to Mayo hospital in the city.

The three suffered minor burns on their face and other parts of the body. A patient accompanying the woman doctor too was injured on her lips in the attack. At least another four were lucky to escape unhurt.

The incident took place while a five-member team of GMCH doctors was carrying out a survey and screening project work on Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) and Reproductive Tract Infection (RTI) among rural and suburban women in Saoner tehsil, around 40-km from Nagpur.

The team of five doctors had been camping at Saoner for screening women, especially the under-privileged ones. This programme is learnt to be carried out by the GMCH’s satellite wing at Saoner as part of National AIDS Control Organization.

Minister Sunil Kedar, also Congress MLA from Saoner, rushed to meet the victims. Terming the incident unfortunate, Kedar said he was looking into the issue.

Collector Ravindra Thakre said he was set to enforce strict regulation of availability and transportation of acid and petrol. “We will also undertake awareness campaigns against such attacks,” he said.

Attacker Kanhere, who was overpowered and apprehended by the onlookers, was beaten up before being handed over to Saoner police. He was apparently drunk. Police are now trying to ascertain whether he has any criminal background too.

Kanhere, a vagabond, was learnt to be working at a butcher’s shop but was fired from the job. A resident of Telangkhedi in Kelvad, he had been staying at different places and was seen at Pehlapar since for the last couple of days. He had worked at a cinema hall in the morning where he and his friend cleaned toilet with acid. Kanhere had apparently saved some acid from work. Police said he wanted to damage two-wheeler of a person under whom he worked but saw the doctors on way and attacked them instead.

The minor and her neighbour said they were stunned by the attack. “I was not able to gauge what was happening when he threw acid towards me. I realized something was wrong when I felt burning on the skin,” said the minor now being treated at Mayo hospital. “The acid hit my mouth. I felt burning sensation on my lips,’ said her neighbour.

It is learnt Kanhere had first targeted three other women doctors of the team standing beside their vehicle near a temple at Pehlapar. After threatening them, Kanhere had hurled some acid on them too. Though they escaped, the acid fell on the vehicle. As they raised an alarm, Kanhere fled and entered the lane in which the woman lecturer was carrying out her work.

She had been to the home of an unwell woman with the teenager and her mother showing her the way. After taking the patient with her, they were returning through the same lane towards the vehicle parked near the temple when Kanhere came from behind and attacked them.

Addl SP Monica Raut, who is camping at Saoner police station, said Kanhere was being quizzed but his changing statements are posing a hurdle. “We are trying to ascertain from where he got the acid and reason for his attack. He has named different persons as the ones who supplied him with the acid and all have turned out to be fake,” she said.

Senior PI Ashok Koli of Saoner police station said the situation was under control and citizens were co-operating in keeping peace.

Madurai: Taking a serious view for wasting the court’s time, the Madras high court has imposed a cost of Rs 10 ,000 on a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought to release the names of corporate companies who have not repaid bank loans and to waive Rs 55,000 crores of educational loans across the country.

In his petition, A M Sundaravel, a resident of Tirunelveli district, moved the high court Madurai bench seeking for a direction to publish the name list of multinational corporate and private companies who have not repaid bank loans in all the media, newspapers and websites for public view.

When the petition was taken up for hearing on Thursday, a division bench of justice M Duraiswamy and justice T Ravindran took a serious view for wasting the court’s time and dismissed the petition. The judges imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 to the petitioner and directed him to pay the same to the Chief Justice Relief Fund within one week’s time. tnn

Amaravati: Former minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said chief minister Y S Jaganmohan Reddy’s New Delhi visits were not helping the state.

He said the chief minister’s in getting additional funds from the Centre clearly showed he was not keen on fighting for the state’s interests. “It is a clear case that the CM is only lobbying for favourable orders in his cases,” said Yanamala.

Speaking to reporters here on Thursday, Yanamala said that the chief minister had visited New Delhi seven times in the last seven months and met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah. Although the CM is contending that he had been submitting representations seeking funds and projects for the state, the Centre had not spared even a single rupee after YSRC came to power, said Yanamala. He said that the Centre would normally oblige at least a few of the CM’s requests when he met the PM and other Union ministers several times.

“The centre has neither sanctioned funds nor alloted schemes to the state as requested by the CM. It means that the CM had not submitted the representations that are being leaked to the public. He must be batting for something else,” said Yanamala.

Trichy: While welcoming chief minister Edapaddi K Palaniswami’s announcement on declaring delta region as protected agriculture zone, the Movement Against Destruction has urged the government to take necessary steps to stop ongoing hydrocarbon projects in the region immediately.

“The Tamil Nadu government must take immediate steps to enable its implementation and must pass an ordinance in the assembly. The foremost requirement is to urge the union government to publish it in the gazette,” said K K R Lenin, founder and president of the movement.

“Not only hydrocarbon projects, no corporates would be allowed to launch any kind of projects in delta any more. Agro based project and activities should only be allowed,” he said.

Lenin urged the state government to do the needful to wind up ongoing hydrocarbon projects in delta region. “Oil wells occupying agriculture lands should be evacuated immediately,” he added.

“ONGC is extracting oil and gas from fertile lands after taking them on lease. Though ONGC has been stating that no other new projects were taken for exploration, many projects are continuing for many decades,” he said.

Lenin also urged the government not to allow anyone to convert fertile lands into housing sites. There are several hectares of empty lands which remain unutilized for years. The government should take steps to convert unutilized lands to construct house.

“Thermal power projects should not be allowed to execute along the shore in Tamil Nadu. Sagar Mala projects should also be abandoned without any hesitation,” he added.

303,['14/02/2020'],Kolkata airport domestic wing gets inline bag scan,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Screening of a bag at Kolkata airport after the roll-out of ILBS

KOLKATA: Authorities at Kolkata airport kicked off the soft launch of inline baggage screening system (ILBS) in the domestic wing on Thursday with Air India getting the checked-in bags of six flights screened by the new system. With three portals in the international wing already in use, the addition of portal E in the domestic wing meant more than half of the portals that are to be commissioned between February 18 and 28 are currently undergoing live trials.

“The E portal that is reserved for Air India was put into use on Thursday. The shift went glitch-free and for Friday, we have planned to put one more domestic portal into use,” said a senior official at the airport. This is likely to be portal D used by SpiceJet and Vistara. IndiGo that operates over 100 flights daily uses two portals — B and C. Portal A used by AirAsia India and GoAir will get the ILBS system later.

While the soft launches have been glitch-free till now, four passengers had to be escorted to the ILBS area in the terminal basement to remove power banks from their checked-in baggage. Three of these passengers were travelling to Dubai on Wednesday evening and one by an Air India flight on Thursday. “Six flights with 820 passengers availed of ILBS on Wednesday. Altogether, 1,145 checked-in bags were screened on portal G and H. Of them, only three went to level 4 check requiring passengers to be summoned to remove restricted items from bags. All other bags were cleared at either level 2 where the screener checks the 3D image of the bag and its contents generated by the CTX machine or in level 3 where screeners get more time to review the image or use standalone X-ray and explosive trace detector to clear the bags,” said airport director Kaushik Bhattacharjee. He added that one passenger, who had travelled by an AI flight on Thursday, also made the mistake. Airlines do not allow power banks inside checked-in baggage for safety. Power banks are essentially batteries that utilise lithium cells that catch fire in some situations. If they are taken on board as hand baggage, in case they catch fire, it can be doused with fire extinguishers in the cabin.

The power banks in the checked-in bags did not pose a problem because the numbers were few. But the count may shoot up once ILBS goes live in all the four domestic portals. That is not only due to the large number of flights that screeners have to handle, but it is also because the number of first time and infrequent flyers who are not conversant with the rules. So, they are more likely to leave their power banks in checked-in bags, despite the reminder at check-in counters.

306,['14/02/2020'],Nagpur: Cash crunch makes civic chief stop all development works,"This story is from February 14, 2020

NMC cash crunch

NAGPUR: With the Nagpur Municipal Corporation experiencing severe financial crisis, municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe told the special general body meeting he had restricted civic administration from floating new tenders for development works until the condition improved. ""I have also issued instructions to stop all works, whether work orders were issued or not,"" said Mundhe.

Replying to a query raised by former mayor and BJP corporator Pravin Datke, the civic chief said, “I found the NMC was not even paying income tax and provident fund contribution though it was deducting them from employees' salary. Besides, NMC was yet to pay Rs400 crore outstanding to contractors for various works.""

Like elected members, civic administration too wanted development works in the city. But we have to carry them out as per priority, he said. Mundhe also appealed to the corporators that they should propose development works as per its priority.

The civic body has failed to contribute its share in many projects funded by state government. Mundhe cited example of cement road projects. The other partners — state government and Nagpur Improvement Trust— had contributed Rs100 crore each for the cement road projects. “We have not contributed our share so we could not issue work orders for conversion of tar roads into cement roads,” Mundhe explained.

In Rs2,412.64 crore Nag River Pollution Abatement Project, the Centre, state and NMC will bear share of 60%, 25% and 15%, respectively. NMC will have to contribute Rs324 crore, but the current financial condition won’t allow it, he added.

For many other state sponsored projects like Nagar Utthan, NMC will have to contribute 30% of the cost for land acquisitions. It also has other mandatory contributions in projects implemented under district planning committee. “Under these circumstances, we could not undertake any new project. Instead we should concentrate on ongoing projects,” he said.

“I have imposed the restrictions to bring in financial discipline,” he said.

Datke also sought to know whether Mundhe had issued directives that the standing committee had no power to okay proposals for administration nod. Following demand from senior BJP corporator Dayashankar Tiwari, Datke, Congress corporators Sandip Sahare and Praful Gudadhe, mayor Sandip Joshi directed the administration to table a report on financial condition of NMC in next general body meeting.

In December last year, the then municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar too had imposed a 25% cut in budget presented by standing committee chairman Pradip Pohane. Pohane had presented a budget of Rs 3,197.60 crore. Bangar dropped various works pertaining to basic amenities worth over Rs 772 crore.

VIJAYAWADA: A round-table meet of Left parties and peoples’ organisations decided to hold state-wide protest at district collectorates on February 17, seeking implementation of the bifurcation promises. The speakers condemned the indifferent attitude of the state and central governments in fulfilling the promises made to the people at the time of the bifurcation in 2014.

Among the issues, which were taken up at the meet, were denial of special category status, promised in Parliament at the time of bifurcation and failure of the Centre to help with the revenue deficit, which was to the tune of Rs 22,948 crore. They said the government has washed off its hands from the issue by paying a mere Rs 3,979 crore.

TRICHY: More than a week after panic gripped people over the spread of novel coronavirus (nCoV) from China, central Tamil Nadu no more has patients with its symptoms. Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH), a tertiary care centre in Trichy, was free of nCoV suspect cases as of Thursday.While the hospital administration discharged a 27-year-old Singapore returnee of Madurai last week, three others — a 38-year-old man from Pudukottai, a 30-year-old man from Trichy and a 35-year-old man from Ariyalur — were also sent home after either they tested negative or had no symptoms of fever, cough and breathing difficulties.Except the Pudukottai man who was working in China, others were workers in Singapore which was one of the four countries including Hong Kong and Thailand where nCoV outbreak was reported. The first passenger diagnosed with the symptom was the 27-year-old man from Madurai on February 2.“Though they had fever symptoms while arriving at the airport, their health condition became normal after a few days of treatment at the isolation ward. Though they were discharged, they are being home quarantined,” deputy director of health services (DDHS), Trichy Dr A Subramani told TOI.So was the case in the government medical college hospital at Tiruvarur where two men from there and one from Nagappattinam got admitted either with symptoms or out of fear of nCoV infection in the last ten days.All of them were China returnees.As of Sunday, all of them were discharged as they tested negative, confirmed the dean of the medical college hospital Dr J Muthukumaran, on Thursday.Yet, over 600 people from the four countries who returned through the Trichy international airport have been kept in home quarantine, said DDHS Subramanian.In Trichy district alone, 95 passengers have been home-quarantined as of Thursday.“If the home-quarantined passengers are found to have any of the symptoms in 28 days, they will be shifted to the isolation ward,” said Subramanian.",trichy,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74128831,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-86989,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/no-more-coronavirus-suspects-in-central-tamil-nadu-hospitals/articleshow/74125551.cms

Representative image

NAGPUR: In a setback to the petitioner, the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Thursday rejected his prayer to add Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) as respondents in the alleged multi-crore irrigation scam PILs.

While clarifying that the court would appoint these agencies when deemed fit, a division bench comprising justices RV Ghuge and Shreeram Modak adjourned the final hearing till March 13. The bench further directed petitioners and respondents to submit their contentions before February 29.

The court was hearing five PILs, first by NGO Janmanch (PIL No. 12/2016) through counsel Firdos Mirza and four others by social worker Atul Jagtap (PIL Nos 141, 142, 172 & 173/2016) through lawyer Shreedhar Purohit.

In his application, Jagtap stressed adding Union home ministry, principal income tax commissioner besides CBI, ED and SFIO as respondents for investigating the scam stating that he didn’t trust the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) which is conducting open probe into the case.

Defending his prayer, Jagtap said that after change of guard in the state, Ajit Pawar, who was named as a respondent in the PIL, assumed important charge of deputy chief minister in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by CM Uddhav Thackeray, and, therefore, “the ACB is directly working under him”.

Quoting ACB’s former director general (DG) Sanjay Barve, the petitioner stated that he had elaborated on the role played by Pawar and other accused officers in illegally granting mobilization advance to the contractors for projects.

While endorsing petitioner’s contentions, the then DG had held that various irregularities were committed in majority of tenders with uncanny similarity. Terming the entire conspiracy as an attempt to “defraud the government”, he claimed that contractors obtained tenders on the basis of forged documents.

The petitioner claimed that Pawar’s personal secretary had written to then water resources department (WRD) directing it that “circulars of not granting mobilization advance should be cancelled”.

“The former WRD minister had directed that all the disputed files should be directly sent to him without following due procedure as per Rules 10 and 14 of Rules of Business,” the petitioner said.

Jagtap pointed out that “after change in the government, ACB also changed its stance and granted a clean chit to Pawar through three affidavits, two of which were filed by incumbent DG Parambir Singh”.

“In view of changing political equations and roles played by NCP to which Pawar belongs, I don’t have faith in ACB as it’s directly controlled by the government. For neutral and impartial investigations, it’s necessary to add CBI, ED, SFIO and others to take over the investigations,” Jagtap said.

MUMBAI: A major tragedy was averted after a massive blaze broke out inside a ground-plus-four-storey commercial structure in the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation ( MIDC ) area at Andheri (East) on Thursday. Eyewitnesses said all offices in the building are empty, except for a bank on the ground floor.

While no one sustained injuries in the incident at the Rolta Technology Park structure, a woman who resides in a building across the road complained of suffocation after inhaling the thick smoke and had to be rushed to a hospital .

The fire , which started in a server room on the second floor, damaged the wiring, furniture, office records, computers, ACs, aluminium plates and other material stored in passages.

Mumbai fire department declared it a Level 4 blaze and deployed 13 fire engines and 100 personnel. Firemen evacuated all buildings in the complex as well as those in the neighbourhood as smoke began to spread in the area.

The MIDC is the planning authority for the area and has its own system to fight minor blazes as it has merely two fire engines. It had not conducted any fire audit of commercial structures in its jurisdiction for four years. “We conduct fire audits only while giving occupation permission to buildings. Thereafter, we do not conduct routine fire audits. Since 2016, we have not checked any of the occupied buildings for fire compliance,” said Santosh Warick, deputy chief fire officer, MIDC.

Mumbai fire department officials said they found several violations. The building’s firefighting system was not operational too.

Mumbai fire department said it will launch a probe into the blaze and has suggested the building’s water and power supply be disconnected.

Mumbai fire department officials were upset as their chief fire officer, P S Rahangdale, led the firefighting operation but MIDC’s senior-most fire officer, who has an office in the vicinity, did not visit the site. Rahangdale said, “We noticed several violations in the building. For instance, a covered roof, encroachment in passages and lack of ventilation. This created hurdles in firefighting. We will ask MIDC to submit the building plan documents and examine the violations.”

Local activist Umashankar Gautam said, “Several companies in MIDC area have shut shop. But fires keep recurring in one building or the other every year. The reason must be investigated. Someone should be made accountable for the fire incidents.”

Wendell Rodricks celebrated life and gave back to society what he earned

PANAJI: Noted fashion designer Wendell Rodricks ’ love for environment and recent protest against the felling of trees at Colvale resonated at his funeral service attended by hundreds on Thursday.“We are not here to sell but to protect land. We go against the creator when we cut trees,” Fr Freddy Lobo, during his homily at St Francis of Assisi Church, said.Drawing parallels with Rodricks’ linen whites — that earned him the tag of ‘guru of minimalism’ — and angels, he said Rodricks gave people a “foretaste of heaven where angels are dressed in white”.“Let’s go with this message that each one of us is called to protect the environment,” Lobo said.He also advised people to learn from the Padma Shri awardee’s humility and philanthropy.Among the earliest and most prominent public figures to come out about his sexual orientation, Rodricks left behind his partner Jerome, who along with family bid him a tearful farewell.A regular churchgoer, Rodricks’ funeral mass was concelebrated by five priests, including the secretary to the archbishop, Fr Joaquim Loiola Pereira, director of Caritas, Fr Maverick Fernandes and parish priest as well as former parish priests of Colvale.The church couldn’t contain the outpouring of love for the designer, teacher, writer, LGBTQIA activist and environmentalist as big names from the fashion industry in the state and beyond, models, politicians, students and teachers of the Government Polytechnic, Altinho and friends and family spilled into the church hall and the courtyard in front.Towards the end of the Eucharistic celebration, Rodricks’ youngest brother Joel, based in Dubai thanked him for bringing music into their lives after their mother sent him as a youth for guitar classes at a time when the instrument was larger in size than him.Talking about Rodricks’ sudden demise — three months before he would turn 60 — which shocked even their own family, Joel said it was not the years of life but the “life in his years” that mattered.‘Somewhere over the rainbow’ played in the background as Rodricks was laid to rest in the church cemetery.

NASHIK: The principal and two teachers of a civic school in Satpur have been slapped with a show-cause notice for allowing a group of people claiming to be followers of self-styled godman Asaram to deliver a lecture to students on the school premises on Wednesday.

The Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) also directed the principal to lodge a police complaint against the people. Asaram is serving a life sentence for a minor’s rape.

“We have taken serious cognizance of this as permission of the education department is mandatory for organising programmes in civic schools. I myself visited the school in this connection on Thursday morning,” said Devidas Mahajan, education officer of NMC on Thursday.

“A directive has been issued to the principal to lodge FIR against those who addressed the students on the thoughts of the self-styled godman in the school,” he said.

“Moreover, action will also to be taken against the principal for allowing them to address students.”

According to sources in the NMC, the followers of Asaram went to the said school on Wednesday afternoon and delivered a lecture to students on his thoughts. They also told the students not to celebrate Valentine’s Day, and instead celebrate the day as “Parents’ day” and worship them.

The followers also distributed pamphlets about Asaram’s thoughts among students while also putting up a banner displaying a photograph of the disgraced and jailed ‘guru’.

Soon after learning about the incident, a number of corporators complained to the civic administration and demanded action against the school principal as well as the visitors.

The NMC has 90 schools with over 30,000 students across all its six divisions —Panchavati, Nashik Road, Satpur, Nashik East, Nashik West and Cidco.

Nala in Uppal that has turned into a garbage dumping site

SECUNDERABAD: The 1.5 kilometre-long water channel near National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) on Uppal road in Habsiguda that was built to drain out rainwater into Musi has turned into a major water stagnation point.

Over 600 households living in 15 residential colonies located around the drain have raised alarm over the increasing mosquito menace in the area on account of stagnation of the drain water. Residents have urged authorities to desilt and clean the drain before the unhealthy situation leads to an outbreak of diseases in the area.

“The water channel has turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes. We fear the outbreak of vector borne diseases. I request GHMC to desilt the drain at the earliest,” said Suman Sharma, resident of Kalyanpur colony.

According to GHMC officials, the civic body is taking up special programs to control the mosquito population. As part of the program, anti-larval operations will be carried out in the locality, every eight days, officials said.

“We are taking up a localised, pointed program near the water channel and in other parts of the city. Bio-remediation and anti-larval operations with drones are also being taken up in the city,” said GHMC commissioner DS Lokesh Kumar.

Adding to the health hazard problem, is the unbearable stench emanating from the garbage being dumped in the drain, rue residents. Locals say that some parties are also discharging sewage into the water channel, further polluting it. “The practise of dumping garbage in the nala has been occurring for many years now. The rancid smell emanating from the drain is unbearable,” said R Pratap, a resident of Raghavendra Nagar Colony.

Some residents took matter into their own hands and laid slabs on the drain to curb the stench and control the mosquito menace. GHMC said that this has placed a roadblock on their desilting efforts. “To desilt the nala, these slabs have to be demolished. As of today, we are unable to press the desilting machines into service due to the slabs,” said a GHMC official.

The water channel is located near the NGRI compound and runs along Seetarama Colony, Teachers Colony, Raghavendra Nagar Colony, Laxmi Narayana Colony in addition to ten other colonies. The drain was built to ensure that water inside NGRI drains out in a properly.

Trichy: The situation is no different in many of the state-run universities where posts of registrars and other statutory posts are being managed by officer in-charges for months together.

Higher education secretary Sunil Paliwal, in a review meeting in 2018, insisted universities to appoint full-time officers to statutory posts. He had highlighted the need for filling up these posts to ensure effective governance.

However, not many universities have taken note of it and most of the vital posts remain vacant.

A random check has revealed that the controller of examination (CoE) in Bharathiar, Alagappa, Periyar and Thiruvalluvar universities are ‘in-charge’ officers. Further, there is no full-time registrar expect for Alagappa among these universities.

Manonmaniam Sundaranar and Alagappa universities have the statutory post of distance education director managed by ‘in-charge’ officers.

Speaking on the merits of filling these statutory posts, a senior staff from BDU said, “A regular officer is appointed for a period of three years. The confidence of holding the post for a long time will give enough strength to the officer to take decisions on any matter unlike an ‘in-charge’ staff who would only think of safeguarding his temporary post. This would prevent him from taking important decisions.”

CHENNAI: When the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority ( CMDA ) handed over plans for the Chennai Bypass Road , the state highways invested several crores in it, hoping that the stretch would act as the primary truck route between southern districts and Chennai Port.Today, less than a decade later, the road has been reduced to an expensive urban road. Truckers now prefer the newly constructed Outer Ring Road built by another government agency, Tamil Nadu Road Development Company . The old 32km access controlled expressway that interconnects four radial national highways around Chennai from Perungalathur to Madhavaram no longer serves its purpose. “People pay tolls because government has to take back the money it had invested on these roads,” said a senior official. The bypass is one of the many examples of how a slew of projects lined up by the government to decongest traffic continue to leave Chennai roads in a chaos.City planners and activists pinned their hopes on the comprehensive mobility plan (CMP) to setting things right. “But the plan hasn’t had a great start either,” said a senior official from CMDA. “The recent plan is largely a repeat of the Chennai Comprehensive Transportation Study released in 2010. Instead of looking at the effectiveness of projects taken up based on CTTS 2010suggestions, the new team is repeating the same set of suggestions,” he said.The CMP doesn’t discuss whether spending so much on the Chennai Bypass and surrounding areas had paid dividends. Instead, it is looking to connect missing links, which experts fear will cause more traffic snarls. “The same applies to footpaths, grade separators, junction improvements and traffic signals. There has been no coordinated effort,” said a senior transport department official.The Chennai Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (CUMTA), to coordinate all transport and traffic related departments, is a distant dream even after 10 years of formal announcement. “The problem right now is that each department wants to solve the problems it faces with the easiest possible solution,” the official said. The dedicated two-wheeler lane introduced by traffic police, for instance, was rolled back months after launch. The dedicated cycle tracks built by corporation near school zones with wide footpaths are now parking lots for residents and commercial establishments.M Radhakrishnan of Thozhan, an NGO that works on road safety, said the best way to reduce traffic and accidents on roads is by to promote public transportation. “For this, all proposed infrastructure projects must be completed without delays. We should encourage people to use buses, suburban trains and metro. The connectivity among these modes of transport should be appealing and people friendly,” he said. But many infrastructure projects, even those announced as early as 2011-12, are still pending in Chennai. While some are under construction for years, others including the Bus Rapid Transit System and Tambaram elevated corridor are still on paper.",chennai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74131441,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-685762,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/one-problem-many-proposals-and-no-result/articleshow/74125565.cms

319,['14/02/2020'],"Delhi: Wazirabad-Burari stretch gets underpasses, subway","Construction has started for the subway at Jagatpur

NEW DELHI: Two underpasses for U-turns and a subway will be constructed on Outer Ring Road between Wazirabad and Burari by Delhi government’s PWD to cut down on travel time, decongest the stretch and make it safe for users. Commuters going from northeast Delhi’s Gopalpur side towards Majnu ka Tila and ITO are now forced to travel in the opposite direction for almost 8km and take a U-turn at the Burari roundabout to get to the other side. Once this project is completed, they will be using the underpasses for either way, reducing travel time and also decongesting the roundabout. (See map)In order to ensure that the traffic on this busy 12-lane stretch — six lanes on either side — is not disrupted, segments of these structures will be pre-cast at an open area and installed later. This method has multiple advantages. The first is that there won’t be any traffic disruption as the road will be dug up in three phases — the right side, median and then the left side, in that order. The second advantage is that this method is cheaper and will cost the agency almost half the amount it would have otherwise spent. And the third advantage is that it will save time.A senior government official said this project would have taken over a year to complete had they adopted the conventional method. It will now take less than two months! This is the first PWD project in Delhi where this technique is being used. It it’s successfully implemented, it will be adopted for other projects as well.These underpasses are being called ‘half underpasses’ because the stretch for entry and exit on either side will be at least three metres above the level of a drain that is running alongside the road. This is to prevent any flooding.During peak hours, according to officials, the Burari roundabout gets clogged as hundreds of vehicles line up to take the U turn. That will no longer happen once the project is completed.“Constructing an FOB costs at least Rs 2 crore and an underpass about Rs 20 crore. But unlike the expenditure on the other underpasses that we have constructed in the past, these two and the subway will be constructed at a total cost of Rs 35 crore,” said the official. “We will construct the subway at Jagatpur first, as that is required the most.”The subway is being constructed at Jagatpur because several accidents have been reported from this area where people from both sides of the road cross abruptly. “Since both carriageways of the road are very wide, people are unable to safely cross the road. There are foot overbridges on this stretch too but people barely use them because they are at a distance,” said the official.The road is almost 10 metres above the level of the service lane. Students attending coaching classes at Mukherjee Nagar have to cross over to the other side where many of them stay on rent. Hence, the agency has prioritised this part of the project. Construction of the segments for the underpass and their placement will be completed by March-end. The pre-cast sections for the underpasses are also being made and the work on all these structures will be over by the end of June, said the officials.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74126408,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1029948,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/wazirabad-burari-stretchgets-underpasses-subway/articleshow/74125575.cms

NASHIK: All Nashik Municipal Corporation ( NMC ) properties, which had either been leased out without any agreement or which the lessees are using despite the expiry of the agreement period, will soon be sealed.

On Thursday, the NMC standing committee directed the civic administration to take immediate action.

TOI had recently reported on the findings of an internal audit of the civic body. The audit had found out that many of the municipal corporation’s properties were leased without agreements and the NMC had not been receiving any rent from about 400 of its 900 properties.

Uddhav Nimse, the chairperson of the standing committee, directed the civic administration to seal such properties. The directive came after the panel members complained that some of the NMC properties are being used by parties without agreement and also few years after the end of the agreement.

Standing panel member Swati Bhamre said that in her ward, the NMC had leased one of its properties to a particular party for 30 years. The lease period ended two years ago, but the party is still using the property.

Kalpana Pande, another panel member, complained about a party that used an NMC property for 10 years free of charge. Pande said the party recently signed an agreement and paid a lease amount for the next four months. “But what about the payment for the past 10 years?” she asked.

Pande asked standing committee chairman to recover all the rent from the party concerned.

Nimse pulled up the civic officials and directed them to look into the issue.

Civic officials said the municipal commissioner has directed all the six divisional officers to recover the rent pending for years.

AURANGABAD: The members of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Thursday staged a demonstration at Kranti Chowk against the rise in LPG cylinder prices.

As part of the protest, the women cooked food at the site.

The central government on Wednesday hiked the price of non-subsidised LPG cylinder weighing 14.2 kg by Rs 144.50 to Rs 149. The price hike is the steepest since January 2014. The government also announced that the subsidy for domestic users will be doubled.

Soon after the announcement, opposition parties launched a scathing attack on the government demanding a rollback on the price. Women wing of Congress and NCP held rallies and demonstrations across the country to protest the hike.

In Aurangabad , district NCP women wing led by president Chhaya Jangle Patil held a demonstration at Kranti Chowk. The activists held placards and raised slogans condemning the hike. The protestors said that people, especially homemakers, are dejected with the rising inflation. Jangle Patil said that the protest against the price rise was held simultaneously by NCP women wings in all districts of the state on the directives of state chief Rupali Chakankar.

As part of the protest, the women also cooked food in an earthen stove at the protest site. The activists said that in wake of rise of cooking gas price, poor people are left with no alternative but to switch to earthen stove.

Congress spokesperson Pawan Dongre termed the government’s move as ‘bluff.’

“The government had made an emotional appeal to people to give up their subsidy so that poor people can cook on gas stove. However, the government failed in ensuring that poor people can afford the gas on a regular basis which is why many people in Aurangabad have now switched alternative ways of cooking,” he said.

That fateful morning, almost overcome by sleep, he was walking towards his tricycle to wash his face when a speeding car hit him. The vehicle ran over his thigh and Seethapathy lost

consciousness at the sight of blood. He woke up, hours later, at a hospital.

Police told Seethapathy that the car’s driver, an elderly man, had pressed the accelerator instead of applying the brakes. But Seethapathy did not pursue the case as the driver assured him that he would pay the hospital bills and take care of his children’s education. Three months on, Seethapathy is still bedridden. Post the operation, the doctor has advised him a year’s rest.

From Vandavasi, Seethapathy sold milk in the city to support his family back home. He put his sons, aged 10 and seven, in a private school hoping that they would not become milk vendors like him.

Seethapathy told TOI that he believes that his children will have a bright future as only a few people from his village study at a private school in Vandavasi. But with the family’s sole breadwinner confined to bed, the times ahead are bleak. For his family, it’s a tight squeeze to make ends meet.

NASHIK: Nearly 50 drone operators in rural Nashik are yet to register their gadgets with Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( DGCA ).

“There are about 100 drone operators in rural Nashik. While 50 of them have already applied to the DGCA online, the remaining are yet to do so,” said Arti Singh, the Nashik rural superintendent of police. She has directed these operators to complete the online formalities as soon as possible.

According to Singh, many of these erring drone operators said they were unaware of the rules that the Center had announced about the mandatory one-time registration of drones . “But these are just excuses as the Union government had announced well in advance about the compulsory registration,” she said.

After scrutiny of the online applications, the DGCA would issue a unique identification number to each drone operator.

According to the police, the drone operators here mainly use the gadgets during events like weddings. “Some operators told us that the gadgets are bought either from Mumbai or Nashik,” added police officials.

Police sources said operating unregistered drones could lead to legal action against the operators under the Indian Penal Code. The civil aviation ministry has made it mandatory for all drone operators to register their gadgets as some drones and drone operators do not comply with Civil Aviation Requirement (CAR) standards. The Centre is keen on maintaining a database of drones as they could be used for subversive activities.

According to the Nashik rural police sources, although the deadline for online registration was January 31, there is a likelihood more time being given to the operators to register the gadgets. In the third week of January, even the state police headquarters had instructed police of all districts and commissionerates to ensure that the drone operators comply with the directives.

Pimpri Chinchwad: The Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB) plans to develop the areas around new and old Holkar bridges as recreation spots for residents.

Pramod Singh, chief executive officer, KCB, said, “We want to install six benches with sheds on an unused strip on the new bridge where people can sit and relax. We will develop two arches, one on each side of the bridge for people to access this strip. They can watch the river flowing below, the greenery around the adjacent Rajiv Gandhi garden.”

He said the garbage thrown on land near the approach road of old and new bridges would be cleared. The cantonment also proposes to light up the two bridges in the evening and at night. Boards would be put up displaying old photographs of old Holkar bridge as well as its 100-year-old history, Singh said.

330,['14/02/2020'],Disqualification plea: Ex-Cong MLAs get 4 weeks to file reply,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Panaji: Goa speaker Rajesh Patnekar on Thursday held the first hearing in the disqualification petition filed against the ten Congress MLAs who joined BJP in July 2019.

The speaker has given the respondents four weeks’ time to file their reply in the case, and also handed them a copy of the petition.

The speaker will hear the disqualification petition filed against tourism minister Manohar Ajgaonkar and PWD minister Deepak Pauskar by senior MGP leader Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar on Friday. Two hearings have already been held in Dhavalikar’s petition.

Counsel for petitioner Abhijit Gosavi informed the speaker that the Supreme Court, in a recent judgment, has laid down the law that disqualification petitions must be decided within three months of the date of filing, and requested the speaker to take into consideration this three-month deadline while granting the respondents time to file a reply.

Gosavi said that the entire matter should be decided within three months.

In May 2019, Dhavalikar filed a petition before the Goa legislative assembly speaker seeking disqualification of Ajgaonkar and Pauskar, who quit MGP to join BJP in March 2019.

The MGP challenged their claim that two-thirds of the MGP legislative party has merged with BJP. MGP had three MLAs in the 40-member House, and the number been reduced to one.

Dhavalikar had said that the 10th schedule of the Constitution does not postulate such a merger, by which the members of the legislative party would meet at midnight and claim that a merger has taken place.

In August 2019, Congress filed a disqualification petition against the 10 rebel MLAs who quit and joined BJP in July 2019. State Congress president Girish Chodankar, who has filed the petition before the speaker, had sought that the 10 MLAs be restrained from attending assembly proceedings and holding constitutional posts till the case is decided by the speaker.

On July 10, the rebel Congress MLAs led by deputy chief minister Chandrakant Kavalekar joined BJP claiming that the Congress Legislative Party had split. The remaining nine MLAs were Isidore Fernandes, Nilkanth Halarnkar, revenue minister Jennifer Monserrate, Antonio Fernandes, Francisco Silveira, Wilfred D’sa, Clafasio Dias, water resources minister Filipe Rodrigues and Atanasio Monserrate.

Congress wanted its 10 MLAs to be disqualified under Article 191 (2) para 2, and the tenth schedule of the Constitution.

“In the present case, there is no merger of the Indian National Congress. The party still exists and is duly recognised, and consequently, there cannot be a claim of a valid merger, as contemplated under tenth schedule,” Chodankar had said.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)

NEW DELHI: Nearly three years after the Supreme Court sent the Nirbhaya case convicts to the gallows, the noose seems to have got entangled in a procedural maze with lawyers filing petition after petition in various courts since a Delhi trial court fixed January 22 as the date for the convicts’ hanging .On Thursday, a bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and A S Bopanna found themselves dealing with two petitions related to the case. One was filed by the Union government seeking separate hanging of the four convicts — Mukesh Singh, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Thakur — as and when their mercy petitions were dismissed by the President. The other was a petition by Sharma challenging the President’s rejection of his mercy plea.The SC reserved its verdict on Sharma’s petition and said it would pronounce judgment on Friday, when it will also hear the counsel for all four death-row convicts on the Centre’s plea for their hangings to be separated. So, no one knows when the death row convicts will be deemed to have exhausted their legal remedies and a finality reached about the date when they will be hanged.After the SC rejected review and curative petitions of the four convicts, Gupta had filed a plea in Delhi high court claiming to be a juvenile at the time of crime on December 16, 2012. The high court dismissed his plea. His appeal was rejected by Supreme Court as well. Mercy petitions of other three — Singh, Sharma and Thakur — who invoked the President’s mercy powers for commutation of death penalty to life imprisonment, have also been turned down.The Centre is challenging a Delhi HC order of February 5 declining the plea for the convicts to be hanged separately by de-linking those who have already exhausted all their remedies from those who have not. The HC had set a deadline of 7 days for the convicts to exhaust all options.The bench will hear this petition on Friday and appointed senior advocate Anjana Prakash Sharma as amicus for Gupta, who was unrepresented. “Otherwise, tomorrow, they will come and seek adjournment saying he is not represented. That appears to be the tactic,” the bench noted.The SC is aware of the delaying tactics, but can do little except hear the petitions filed through advocates A P Singh and Vrinda Grover as these were within the convicts’ rights. Once the seven-day period granted by the HC got over, Sharma filed a petition in the SC challenging rejection of his mercy plea by the President.Among many grounds, his counsel claimed the convict suffered from mental illness and was hence unfit for execution, he suffered constant physical torture in jail, there was complete lack of application of mind to various factors by the Union and Delhi governments in recommending to the President to reject his mercy plea and that the President adopted a pick and choose policy to reject his plea when many such pleas were pending with him.Sharma’s counsel kept repeating his arguments for two hours, leaving Justices Banumathi, Bhushan and Bopanna at the brink of exasperation. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta took just 15 minutes to show the files of the Union home ministry and the Delhi government to point out that each and every aspect and fact narrated in the mercy petition were carefully scrutinised and considered, including Sharma’s family background and economic condition.He said the Union home minister recommended rejection of the mercy petition saying the case fell in the rarest of the rare category and the crime was a “dastardly and unpardonable act” that shocked the conscience of the nation.",delhi,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74126398,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-343086,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/hanging-of-four-nirbhaya-convicts-gets-entangled-in-procedural-maze/articleshow/74125592.cms

A file picture of Umesh Katti and BS Yediyurappa

BENGALURU: Senior leader Umesh Katti , who had hoped to persuade the BJP’s central leadership to hand him a ministerial post, returned empty-handed from Delhi on Thursday after being denied an audience with Union home minister Amit Shah.

Katti and his brother Ramesh had camped in Delhi since Wednesday to lobby for a ministerial berth for himself and a Rajya Sabha nomination for Ramesh. He had met BJP national president JP Nadda on Wednesday and was scheduled to call on Shah on Thursday. Sources said Shah could not meet him owing to prior engagements.

Umesh served as minister in different governments for 13 years, but this is the first time he is not part of the cabinet. ""This is the first time the Katti brothers are facing a political crisis. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa is keen to induct him into the cabinet , but the central leadership is not in favour,"" said a BJP functionary.

Katti’s name apparently figured in the list prepared by Yediyurappa when he expanded his cabinet for the first time in August last year. But, to everyone’s surprise, the central leadership replaced his name with that of Laxman Savadi.

Even before expanding his cabinet for a second time last week, Yediyurappa had categorically said Katti would be made minister. But that assurance fell flat. Yediyurappa has assured Katti a spot in his cabinet when it is expanded the next time.

Ramesh was reportedly assured of a Rajya Sabha ticket when he was denied a ticket to contest the Lok Sabha elections from Chikkodi last year. ""Both Umesh and Ramesh had gone to Delhi to remind the party high command about their assurance,"" said a source close to the brothers. In the Lok Sabha elections, the party preferred Annasaheb Jolle over Ramesh. The brothers had made efforts till last minute to get ticket but in vain.

father stabbed daughter after drinking

NAGPUR: A 17-year-old Std XII student sustained injuries in stomach after her father stabbed her under the influence of alcohol at their residence at Kuhadkarpeth on Wednesday. It is learnt the father, identified as Dinesh Burade, was angry with his daughter Nisha for talking with boys in her school.

The academically good teenager, who has her board examination starting from February 18, is recuperating at Mayo Hospital .

It’s learnt Nisha’s mother Varsha had consumed poison around a year ago after she couldn’t cope with her husband’s torture. The mother of two works as a governess at Jaripatka to supplement the family’s income.

Dinesh, now in custody of Pachpaoli police, is a carpenter. He is a habitual drinker and the addiction worsened in the last few years.

Nisha told TOI that her father, as usual, was behaving in uncouth manner and using filthy language to target her. “When I said that as a father he shouldn’t abuse his daughter, he suddenly got violent. He stabbed me even before I could apprehend it,” she said.

Nisha’s mother Varsha said that her husband objected to their daughter speaking to anyone, especially boys. “He would doubt her whenever she spoke to her classmates and school friends,” she said.

The woman said that they had not approached police earlier believing that they do not take domestic issues seriously. “This time though we told cops that we do not want my husband at home. He was in possession of the knife for quite some time. We had even questioned him over this in the past,” she said.

The Pachpaoli police have registered a case of serious assault against Dinesh.

HYDERABAD: Watching a video originally conceived in an unfamiliar language to one that is known to you will soon be a reality as a team of researchers from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad ( IIIT-H ) has developed a machine learning (ML) model that can automatically translate a video of any person speaking in one language to another.Currently, translation systems for videos generate translated speech output or textual subtitles. An out-of-sync dubbed movie or other video content ruins the viewer experience. In order to automate videos translation, a team of researchers led by professor CV Jawahar, dean (research and development) at IIIT-H developed a ML model that can perform face-to-face translation.Using ML, the model can take a video of a person speaking in one language and deliver a video output of the same speaker in another language. For example, a video of a person speaking in Telugu can automatically be translated in any other desired language such as Marathi, Hindi, Bengali etc. such that the voice style and lip movements match the desired language.“Earlier when we spoke about automatic translation, it used to be text-to-text, then came speech-to-speech translation. They do not handle the visual component. As a result, when such translated speech is overlaid on the video, the lip movements are typically out of sync with the audio,” said Prajwal KR, a student who worked on the model.To obtain a fully translated video with accurate lip synchronization, the researchers introduced a visual module called LipGAN. The module can also correct lip movements in an original video to match the translated speech. For example, badly dubbed movies with out-of-sync lip movements can be corrected with LipGAN, that has been trained on large video datasets, making it possible to work for any voice, any language and any identity.The research paper titled ‘Towards Automatic Face-to-Face Translation’ was presented at ACM International Conference on Multimedia at Nice, France in October 2019. A comparative analysis of their tool vis-a-vis Google Translate found the in-house tool to be more accurate.",hyderabad,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74130663,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-172749,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/iiit-h-model-to-automate-lip-sync-translation-in-videos/articleshow/74124634.cms
338,['14/02/2020'],In-charge appointments on rise in BDU as nepotism takes over merit,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Bharathidasan University started a separate directorate of research in 2018

TRICHY: To speed up the evaluation of PhD thesis and award degrees without delay, Bharathidasan University started a separate directorate of research in 2018. A director in-charge was appointed after separating research section from the controller of examination.

Head of chemistry department S Muthusamy was appointed as director in-charge, but the move didn’t seem to have served the purpose, said members of the Tamil Nadu Government College Teachers Association (TNGCTA) who have threatened to go on an indefinite protest seeking appointment of a full-time director for research section a few days ago. Delay has indeed become the order of the day, they said in the absence of a full-time director.

This is one example of how the ‘in-charge syndrome’ has gripped Bharathidasan University as 12 of the statutory and non-statutory posts including that of the controller or examination and director of distance education have been filled with in-charge officers.

What’s worse, such posts are being rewarded to those who do not have the required qualification, which is against the BDU Act. For instance, when controller of examination (CoE) K Duraiarasan left the office a few weeks ago, S Srinivasa Ragavan, librarian in-charge, BDU, has been made the CoE. Srinivasa Ragavan was one among the candidates for the post of director, Centre for Distance Education (CDE), for which none was found suitable.

""The BDU clearly states that temporary appointment to such posts should not be extended beyond a year, but the director of research has been holding the post for close to two years. It is unfair that the vice-chancellor is rewarding such posts to the staff close to him without bothering about the eligibility criteria,"" alleged a senior faculty from BDU.

The VC was unavailable to take calls. When asked, BDU registrar G Gopinath has said university is taking steps to fill full-time officers to all the statutory posts. ""We have got finance committee approval to appoint a full-time director for directorate of research created for fast tracking research. We will be filling other statutory posts simultaneously,"" he said.

Regarding the non-statutory posts created by the university for convenience, we are contemplating the idea of giving full additional charge for our staff than appointing people from outside, he said.

NAGPUR: Various experts outlined women’s role in a nation’s development during the inaugural function of three-day interdisciplinary international seminar on ‘Women in India and Israel: Past, present and future’ at Matru Sewa Sangh Institute of Social Work (MSSISW), Bajaj Nagar, on Wednesday.

The seminar is being jointly organized by MSSISW, School of Social Work, Sapir College, Israel, Mahatma Gandhi Fuji Guruji Centre for Social Work, Wardha, and Tirpude College of Social Work.

Present at the inaugural function were chief guest Nirmala Jadhav from Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, Aurangabad, guest of honour Nagpur University pro-VC Vinayak Deshpande, Prof Menahem Malka from Israel, Prof Manoj Kumar from Mahatma Gandhi International Hindi University, Wardha, Tirpude College of Social Work principal Keshav Patil, Leena Gahane, Matru Sewa Sangh secretary Lata Deshmukh and principal of the institute Jyoti Niswade.

Giving introductory remarks, Niswade gave a brief overview of the three-day seminar.

Focussing on the swift technological development in Israel, Deshpande said, “The way a country like Israel has evolved and advanced in the technological sector in a short span of time is an aspect to marvel at. Israel being a country unique in itself, we have a lot to learn from their rapid progress. From the agricultural perspective, the country has taught us how to save water and increase productivity at the same time.”

Appreciating Israel’s efforts in expansion of women’s involvement in several respects, he added, “I believe that the developmental level of a country depends on the participation of women in economic activities.”

He went on to discuss the association between India and Israel regarding innovation and sharing of knowledge.

Kumar delved into the status of women in both the countries across the timeline while Patil dealt with the seminar’s perspectives. Malka spoke about the social problems and education revolving around social work from Israel’s point of view.

Jadhav said that the topic chosen for the seminar is very relevant and it is the need of the hour to open a discussion on it. She outlined various issues like gender discrimination, female foeticide, unequal pay, dowry system and other pressing problems.

Gahane pointed out the common threats in both the countries and highlighted a mother's role in development of a nation. Deshmukh spoke about the status of women in nuclear and joint families, women safety and liberalization of women.

The inaugural ceremony concluded with Amod Gurjar proposing a vote of thanks. Shilpa Puranik was the anchor for the programme.

Police personnel stand outside the house in east Delhi’s Bhajanpura, where five members of a family were found... Read More

NEW DELHI: The sensational murder of the five members of a family in Bhajanpura has been cracked. The crime was committed by a 26-year-old relative, Prabhu Nath, who had borrowed Rs 30,000 from the house owner Shambhu Chaudhary. Nath was arrested from north-east Delhi on Thursday after he confessed to have eliminated Chaudhary and his family members with an iron rod.

While bodies of Chaudhary (43) and his wife Sunita (37) were found lying in their bedroom on Wednesday, the children, Shivam (17), Sachin (14) and Komal (12) were found dead in another room.

A police officer said that on February 3, Nath went to Chaudhary’s house and committed the crime. He was seen leaving the colony after the incident in a CCTV footage that helped the cops crack the case.

Alok Kumar, joint commissioner of police, eastern range, said: “ The case was cracked within 24 hours. The accused, Nath, belongs to Supaul in Bihar. He was working at an institute in Laxmi Nagar and also as a collection agent for some money lenders.”

Investigating officials revealed that Nath had borrowed the money from Chaudhary about six months back. Since it was the accused who made Chaudhary invest in “committees,” police are also probing if he secretly withdrew his money to spend.

Earlier, the cops found that the children had not attended their school after February 3. Chaudhary had spoken to Nath seven times on February 3, which brought the latter’s role under the scanner. With the help of his number, Nath was nabbed near his house.

Explaining the sequence of events, Ved Prakash Surya, deputy commissioner of police, Northeast, said: “When Nath reached Chaudhary’s residence, Sunita was alone. The accused had a heated argument with her, who taunted him for not paying their money back. Nath claims that he murdered her in a fit of rage with an iron rod he was carrying.”

Before he could flee, Komal, who had gone for her tuition class, returned home. Nath then allegedly hit her with the same weapon. Since it was post- school hours, it was time for Shivam and Sachin to return home. First Shivam entered the house and was killed in the same manner as his sister and later Sachin. The kids were blindfolded before the murder on the pretext of playing a game. The accused then locked the house from outside and fled.

Nath later called up Chaudhary and asked the latter to meet him around 7.30 pm near his house. “The two then went to a village area where they drank together. They both returned together. Around 11pm, when Chaudhary was entering his house, Nath attacked him and later shifted his body to a room,” said Surya.

In the CCTV footage recovered, Nath could be seen going towards the deceased’s house around 3.30 pm. He had left the place around 7pm to meet Chaudhary.

Panaji: Porvorim police on Thursday detained a juvenile for the rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman from Odisha whose body was recovered from shrubbery near the Kadamba depot, at Porvorim, on Monday. They are yet to trace one more person in connection with the case.

A postmortem report established that the woman was raped and that she died due to smothering. Based on the report, police began investigations and questioned several construction labourers who were working at a site near where the body was found.

Police said that during investigations, it came to light that one person had been missing since the incident occurred. The police later traced the accused.

The victim is believed to have been brought to Goa by a man from Odisha on the assurance of marriage. Police said that when the man went over to his friends’ place for a drink recently, he got inebriated and fell asleep there. When the victim came in search of him, the accused told her that he would take her to him. He, however, took her into the bushes nearby and raped her.

CLEARED SKHER

Aurangabad: Barring Aurangabd MP Imtiyaz Jaleel and Jintur MLA Meghana Bordikar, all other public representatives from the eight districts of Marathwada skipped the crucial public hearing organised by Maharashtra Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC) on the proposed tariff hike here on Thursday.

The hearing saw fewer voices against the tariff hike for residential consumers, whereas solar power unit manufacturers dominated the proceedings, raising their voice against the proposed grid-support charges.

While Marathwada has 46 assembly constituencies and eight parliamentary constituencies, a total of 52 MLAs and MPs did not attend the MERC hearing.

Aurangabad MP Imtiyaz Jaleel personally presented his say before MERC authorities, while Bordikar had submitted a detail memorandum on the proposed power hike and other demands and issues. While Jaleel sought special sops for Marathwada from the state power utility. Bordikar demanded infrastructural works in her constituency.

When contacted, senior functionaries of different political parties gave their reasons for their MPs and MLAs skipping the MERC hearing.

BJP spokesperson Shirish Boralkar said his party has already taken up the issue of flaws in the government policy decisions for the power sector at different levels. “We have been at the forefront of protecting the interests of the power consumers. Moreover, one of our party MLAs has submitted necessary presentation before the MERC,” he said.

State Congress delegate Jitendra Dehade said the state government was already mooting plans to offer free power to domestic consumers upto 100 units. “No doubt the MERC hearing was important, but our party has been advocating the demand for free power since beginning,” he said.

A senior Shiv Sena functionary said his party MLAs and MPs could not attend MERC hearing due to the visit of Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray and Aurangabad district guardian minister Subhash Desai on Thursday. “The top-brass of the party was in the city for important review meetings and therefore all party works and functionaries were busy in making necessary preparations,” he said.

MUMBAI: A special Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ) court on Thursday rejected the bail plea of Humayun Merchant (70), the alleged frontman of drug smuggler Iqbal Mirchi . Merchant was arrested in October in the money laundering case involving the now deceased Mirchi and his three Worli properties. This is the second time the court has rejected his bail plea.

Merchant is accused of holding the power of attorney for the properties and creating forged tenants in the properties that were later sold for redevelopment and proceeds allegedly laundered.

Opposing his bail plea, the enforcement directorate had submitted the probe revealed that Merchant had arranged for carriers to smuggle drugs to various countries for Mirchi. “For the said smuggling, he was arrested in Hong Kong and convicted there, and faced three years’ rigorous imprisonment.”

The ED also told the court after the prosecution complaint (chargesheet) was submitted, during further investigations, the statement of Mirchi’s second wife was recorded and she told them about this too. The woman had said she was acquitted in the case. The ED said it had recorded the statements of various persons convicted for carrying drugs at Merchant’s behest. “It is evident that he worked as front of Iqbal not only in property dealings but also in his other illegal deeds,” the ED said.

The ED also argued that Merchant had evaded law enforcement agencies for long and he could abscond if granted bail. Stating that further probe is underway and at a crucial stage, the prosecution had said, “He is now aware of the direction of the investigations and may tip off other suspects to evade the investigations.”

Defence advocate Sujay Kantawala submitted the prosecution complaint was already submitted and cited Merchant’s age and health. The defence said a key accused, Dheeraj Wadhawan aka Baba Dewan, had been granted bail. The court said their roles could not be compared.

The camera has caught the wild cat returning to the site of the killing to eat the cow.

KERI: A camera trap has captured images of a tiger in the forests of Huland which may have migrated from Satre village in Sattari, Goa, on Wednesday. The equipment was installed by forest officials of Kankumbi range in Karnataka after a cow was killed and four buffaloes injured on February 12 in the same forests.

The camera has caught the wild cat returning to the site of the killing to eat the cow. The new images are being compared to previous ones of a cub from 2016 and 2017. A wildlifer working in the forested areas of Goa, Maharashtra and Karnataka, on the condition of anonymity, said, “The images of the tiger taken in Huland are most probably of the same cub that was camera trapped in Satre in 2016 and again in 2017. The stripes of this tiger matches the images of the tiger photographed in Huland.”

Deputy conservator of forests (wildlife division) Vikas Desai told TOI, “The images of the tiger captured by the camera trap in Huland and the images of a tiger cub available in our database has indicated that this tiger is from the forests of Satre. On a day-to-day basis, our staff has been involved in monitoring tiger movements. So far we have not obtained any concrete evidence if the said tiger is in the forests of Karnataka or Goa.”

On February 12, Babu Bodke lost another cow to a wild animal killing in the Kankumbi forest range. The family alleges that it was killed by the tiger. Deputy conservator of forests of Belgaum, Amarnath told TOI, “A domesticated animal has been killed in Huland. So far we have no evidence of whether the animal was killed by a tiger or a leopard. Our officials have installed camera traps in the forests where the animal was killed and are investigating the matter.”

MADURAI: Prominent walls of Madurai city are getting a facelift with a difference — they will come alive with paintings of birds and animals which were once common to the city and suburbs but are now rare. Madurai corporation and Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI) have joined hands to beautify the city in this manner while building environmental awareness.

``Two to three decades ago, every child knew how to identify an animal or bird, but children of today do not have this knowledge. So we decided to take up paintings on the prominent walls,’’ said corporation commissioner S Visakan. He reached out to environmentalist and founder of EFI Arun Krishnamurthy, who readily agreed to chip in to develop the city’s environment. The EFI does the work with the help of corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds while the civic body’s responsibility is to identify the spots. Many important parts of the city, including the zonal offices of Madurai corporation, now have beautiful colourful paintings of these birds and animals on them, which do not fail to attract the attention of those who pass by.

Education and CSR associate of EFI, H Prestha said many of these birds and animals were now confined to hotspots like Madurai airport. What they wanted to do was help students identify and know about the birds and animals which are seen in Madurai. The names of the birds and animals are given in clear big letters below the pictures.

T Venkatesh of Vanavil Fine Arts School, the man behind the drawings, says he was handpicked by EFI which had been looking for good artists in Madurai. He uses water-based exterior emulsion paints which would look good for five years with proper maintenance. The photographs of the birds and animals were sent to him by EFI and he tries his best to adhere to the colours in the photographs.

``Even I haven’t seen many of these birds, but villagers who pass by while I draw say they have seen them in their village many years ago. That is rewarding as it proves that the paintings look like the real birds,’’ he said. The commissioner said they hoped to transform the prominent walls in the city with these paintings in the next three to four months. EFI has also come forward to rejuvenate three ponds in the city, he added.

CM Edappadi K Palaniswami

CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government’s data on revenue and fiscal deficit differs from revised budgets and annual accounts, said DMK MLA and financial analyst P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan. In an interaction with reporters on Thursday, Thiagarajan compared the financial situation of the DMK and AIADMK governments during their tenures between 2006 to 2019.

“One best example to show the current financial situation in Tamil Nadu is to compare the budget and the annual accounts of 2018-19. The budget said the revenue deficit will be Rs 17,490 crore. The financial year ended with Rs 23,459 crore revenue deficit.

Comparing revenue data between 2006 and 2011 under the DMK government, with 2011-2016 and 2016 to 2019 when the AIADMK was governing the state, Thiagarajan said the average financial performance in the DMK regime was far better than it is now. “Under the DMK regime, on an average, 100% revenue was spent for welfare schemes. During the Jayalalithaa regime, 82% of the revenue was spent on welfare schemes. Under the present (Edappadi K Palaniswami) regime, however, 100% of spending for welfare schemes is from borrowings,” said Thiagarajan.

He said the EPS government was taking loans to pay interest on loans. “Nearly 18% of the debt is used to pay interest while this was not the case under both Jayalalithaa and Kalaignar (M Karunanidhi) regimes,” he said, adding that his assessment was based on data collated from the state government website.

The MLA said the state’s revenue as per the GSDP has been declining over the years. “While it was 10.46% in the DMK government, it declined to 9.62% in Jayalalithaa’s government. Under the current government, it is 7.29%,” he said. The MLA accused the government of not being transparent in uploading the data. “The half year report was not given to MLAs and I had to ask the assembly secretary for a copy,” said Thiagarajan.

358,['14/02/2020'],Bangalore Airport: Karnataka gets nod for three more airports,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Officials say Mysuru airport is witnessing occupancy of 60-70% daily

BENGALURU: The government, buoyed by launching Kalaburagi and Bidar airports, is set to build four more in the state and already has in-principle approvals from the civil aviation ministry for airports in Hassan, Shivamogga and Vijayapura. The government is also tying up with the Indian Navy to build an airport near Ankola.

Should these plans fructify, it will take the number of airports outside Bengaluru to 10. However, the government will have to fund construction of all four airports as the Centre had put the onus on the “respective project proponent”.

As per a written response tabled by the civil aviation ministry in the Lok Sabha last week, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri said his ministry has given “in-principle” approval for airports at Vijayapura (Rs 150 crore), Hassan (Rs 592 crore) and Shivamogga (Rs 39 crore).

Sources say land acquisition for all three greenfield airports have been completed, but construction costs need to be factored-in. “Since the Centre has put the onus on the respective project proponent, effectively the state government, the state must allocate Rs 800 to Rs 1,000 crore for the purpose,” an official said.

The government though, is close to inking a pact with the navy to develop an airport at Ankola. The Navy already owns property which it is willing to concede for a civilian airport. “It will be on similar lines to the one the government constructed in Bidar with the Indian Air Force,” said another official.

Meanwhile, the government says it is seeing increased interest from “smaller” and new airlines to operate to Tier-II cities. Officials say since most established airlines have monopolised trunk routes, newer and smaller airlines are bidding under the regional connectivity scheme (RCS).

The advantages for firms operating on RCS routes are no landing or hanger costs, subsidy of almost 25% on at least 50% of occupied seats and the only 2% excise duty on air turbine fuel (ATF).

The government says three airports — Belagavi, Hubballi and Mysuru — are well settled with daily occupancy at 60% to 70%, Kalaburagi is already seeing 80% occupancy.

Tangedco had sought more time from TNERC to submit ARR and proposal for tariff revision, but the regulatory commission has ordered that the discom comply with the deadline.

Once the ARR and tariff revision proposal are presented to TNERC, the process of revising the tariff will begin with the commission holding consultation meetings with consumers across the state. It will culminate in the commission passing final orders on tariff revision. Sources told TOI that the tariff revision process will start after the urban local body elections are over.

“Once ARR is submitted by Tangedco, we will upload it on the TNERC website,” said a senior TNERC official.

He said the entire process of tariff revision including eliciting public response will take not less than four months. “If Tangedco submits its tariff revision demand by February end, latest by July we will award the final order on tariff revision,” said the official.

As per the Electricity Act, tariff must be revised every year. “We should be getting ARR every November and by April the new tariff has to be announced. But the state, for political reasons, has been refraining from tariff revision exercise for more than five years. The last tariff revision happened in Tamil Nadu in 2014. No state allows its discom to file ARR annually,” said the official.

“We have started the work on ARR,” said a senior Tangedco official. “The last revision did not help the discom mop up much revenue as the state announced free power of 100 units per billing cycle to all consumers. This is in addition to the free power supplied to huts, weavers and farmers. Though we get subsidy from the government, there is a time lag between the supply of power and receipt of subsidy,” said the Tangedco official.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The crime branch (CB) has launched a physical verification of all 660 Insas rifles with the state armed police battalion, after a CAG report said 25 rifles were missing.

Crime branch ADGP Tomin Thachankary formed a special team under Thiruvananthapuram unit DSP Anilkumar to probe the charges and to expedite the departmental probe.

The rifles, distributed to various armed batallion, would be summoned back to the police headquarters for verification of stocks. “We have asked all battalions to surrender the rifles for verification by Friday evening. The rifles will be re-issued after stock taking,” the ADGP said .

Earlier, a CB verification revealed that the missing rifles had been distributed to armed reserve camps. The information was passed to CAG officials during the exit conference held in November last year.

The exit conference records show that as many as 660 Insas 5.56mm rifles were received by the SAP battalion from the police chief store in the capital during various periods from June 29, 2005. From the 660 rifles, the SAP issued 616 permanently to various battalions and other units as per the orders issued by the police headquarters during various periods. These included 95 to KAP-1 battalion, Thrissur, 335 to KAP-3 battalion, Adoor, 135 rifles to KAP-5 battalion, Kuttikanam, 31 rifles to India Reserve Battalion , 15 rifles to quick response team, armed reserve camp, Thiruvananthapuram city, and five to armed reserve, Thiruvananthapuram coastal.

“The remaining 44 Insas rifles are very much available and are kept in the SAP battalion. As per the existing stock mentioned above, there are no deficits in receiving, issuing or current stock of the Insas rifles in SAP,” said the report.

During the exit conference, the police had promised that due departmental action was on the anvil for the gratuitous lapses in upkeep of records.

The records further said that the police replied the audit team that even though as per the audit report, 25 rifles are missing from SAP battalion’s stock, the rifles, categorized as missing have been found.

The exit meeting records added that a preliminary inquiry initiated—as the scrutiny of ammunition and stock registers has also revealed that the shortage of ammunition/cartridges— is seen from 1994.

“The physical verifications and the stock registers, etc. are being further verified and the responsibility would be fixed based on the result of the preliminary inquiry,” police said.

362,['14/02/2020'],Eight injured after FOB ramp caves in at Bhopal station,"This story is from February 14, 2020

The gaping hole in the ramp at platform No. 2 after a portion of it collapsed at Bhopal railway station on Thu... Read More

BHOPAL: Eight people including two minors were injured when the ramp of a foot overbridge (FOB) at Bhopal railway station collapsed on Thursday morning. All the victim were passengers and they were coming out of station. They fell from around 20 feet height and sustained severe injuries. The incident led to chaos at the railway station. Railway and police officials somehow controlled the situation.

Seven of the eight victims including two women and two boys belonged to the same family and were part of a 35-member family group that had gone to Hyderabad to attend a marriage function. Apart from them, a 28-year-old contractual teacher at Rajiv Gandhi Proudyogiki Vishwavidyalaya (RGPV) who hails from Vidisha, was also injured in the incident.

One of the minor boys was rushed to Hamidia hospital by the family members themselves in an auto-rickshaw while others were rushed to railway hospital by officials from where they were referred to a private medical college in Bhainsakhedi area.

When TOI visited the hospital, there was a situation of complete chaos. Patients were screaming in pain and mediapersons were trying to gather details from family members and relatives of the injured. Many news channels were shooting right from the emergency wards and talking to the injured lying on beds.

An eyewitness of the incident and member of victim family, Abdul Nasir Khan (54), a resident of Krishna Nagar near Gitanjali College on Berasia Road, told TOI that around 35 members of Rehman family including women and children had gone to Hyderabad to attend a marriage function. He said he still could not believe that his relatives who were returning happily after attending a marriage function were injured in the freak accident.

Nasir said that his nephew Ejaz Ur Rehman, a resident of Jeddah Colony Jehangirabad, was married to Mariyam on January 22. The family had gone to Hyderabad to attend the wedding of Ejaz’s sister.

Nasir said they reached Bhopal by Sampark Kranti express and alighted at platform number 2. All of them got down and started walking over the ramp of the foot overbridge. He was walking behind. As soon as they reached just near the top of the ramp, it made some sound and a part of it collapsed.

Nasir said before he could understand anything, he heard cries of his relatives. He went down and found that some of his family members were stuck under the debris.

The injured members of his family include Salim Ur Rehman (38), Khalil Ur Rehman (28), Mariyam Beg (19), all residents of Jeddah Colony Jehangirabad, along with Khalid Beg (48), a resident of Chhavni, Nahid (37), wife of Mohammed Azhar, a resident of Arif Nagar and her two sons Ayan (15) and Aman (17), were stuck under the debris.

Nasir said panic gripped the railway station just after the incident. People including passengers, railway officials, policemen and vendors started rushing towards the spot. Family members started rescuing the relatives as officials were busy in clearing the crowd. Family members themselves rushed some injured to a hospital while other injured were rushed to railway hospital by officials. After providing primary treatment the injured were shifted to a private medical college in Bhainsakhedi.

Nasir said that Nahid sustained multiple fractures in her limbs and serious injury on face. Mariyam’s hand was fractured. Khalid’s sustained severe injury in his back while Salim’s legs were fractured. Khalil too sustained severe injury in back while Aman and Ayan sustained severe head injuries.

The injured RGPV PhD scholar was identified as Anupam Sharma, 28, a resident of Arihant Vihar Vidisha. He commuted to Bhopal daily by train. His brother-in-law Shekhar Sharma, a resident of Neelbad, told TOI that Anupam had come from Vidisha by train and was climbing the overbridge through ramp when the accident took place. His colleague, who was walking behind him, informed his wife Nidhi about the incident over phone. Subsequently Nidhi informed her brother Abhishek Sharma, who resides in Sehore and works at Sanchi Milk Federation in Bhopal about the incident.

Shekhar said that Anupam sustained severe back injury and could not lift his lower body. He could not even get up from bed on his own.

IG (Rail) Jaideep Prasad said that GRP Bhopal have registered a case in the matter against unidentified accused under section 337, 338 and 288 of IPC. Probe was on and the railway officials, who will be found responsible for the incident, will be prosecuted.

Victims admitted at a private hospital in Bhopal on Thursday

BHOPAL: Facilities at government-run Hamidia hospital were disregarded as injured victims of Bhopal station ‘ramp’ collapse were taken to a private hospital instead, here on Thursday. Two patients who were treated at Hamidia hospital, were also shifted to a private hospital by 2 pm, confirmed Hamidia hospital superintendent Dr AK Chourasia. CT scan and other live saving measures were conducted at the government hospital.

Railway officials told the relatives of the injured that they have a tie-up with a private hospital. The same agreement is not with the government-run hospital. As per Indian railway medical manual, 2000 amended in 2006 determines that ‘injured should be sent to railway or government hospital’.

Soon after the accident, seven of the injured were rushed to a 60-bed divisional ‘Model’ railway hospital just 2.2 kms away from the spot, and it hardly takes 9 minutes to reach there. But the ‘Model’ railway hospital, in turn, referred the patients, after primary treatment, to a private hospital which is 18 kms. Sources say that the railway hospital was not equipped to handle the patients as it does not have a surgeon, no ventilator and in casualty care, there is only one orthopaedic.

Going by West Central Railway annual report, medical facilities available at the divisional hospital include ‘Indoor Services along with ICU and Casualty’. Medical services officials of the railway hospital Dr Asha Chamania and Dr Ajita Tausane did not respond to repeated calls and SMSes.

In fact the patients were treated at private medical hospital 18 km away whereas in the zonal disaster management plan, the private hospital is listed 8 km away, which is near Hamidia Hospital.

Questions over lack of medical staff and outsourcing have been raised against the railway hospital in the past too. Indian Railways Disaster Management Plan of September, 2018 calls for ‘specialised training initially to a few select doctors in each Divisional Hospital (and the Zonal Hospitals) to support Incident Response Team (IRT).

Bhopal railway division PRO, IA Siddique said injured were taken to the private hospital as it has better facilities. “We wanted to admit victims in a hospital equipped with best facilities,” said Siddique.

Arvind Kejriwal will take oath as the chief minister of Delhi, along with six colleagues, at Ramlila Maidan on... Read More

NEW DELHI: After leading his party to the third successive term in Delhi, AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday invited Delhiites to attend the swearing-in ceremony at Ramlila Maidan on Sunday.

In an emotional message, which was posted on Twitter and Facebook and played on FM channels all day, Kejriwal connected the honour of Tricolour with good education, health facilities, safety of women and jobs for the youth — the promises made by AAP in its election manifesto.

“Only when every child of Mother India gets good education, every person gets good treatment, women get self-confidence from her safety and honour, the tag of unemployed gets removed from the youth, every drop of farmers’ sweat brings happiness to their homes, every Indian citizen gets basic amenities and each person rises above caste and religion to take country forward, only then the Tricolour will fly high with honour,” the chief minister said, asking every Delhiite to reach Ramlila Maidan with the family at 10am on Sunday to “bless your son”.

Kejriwal will take oath along with six colleagues, who were part of his council of ministers in the previous term as well.

AAP has also invited ‘Baby Mufflerman’ Aavyan Tomar, who dressed up as Kejriwal on the day of the counting, as a special invitee, a functionary said. Tomar, a little more than a year old, hogged the headlines after he was spotted at the party headquarters. His family couldn’t meet Kejriwal on Tuesday.

Kejriwal has also written to party volunteers and supporters that their message of “vote on work” was effectively communicated, and in response, Delhiites showered AAP with their love. “I look forward to your continued support and conviction that together we can take this model of governance to people across our country,” he wrote, adding that education, healthcare, water, electricity, women’s safety and empowerment had now become winnable, mainstream electoral issues.

“Our work in providing these basic necessities has provided a dignified life to lakhs of needy people and opened up opportunities for them, besides growing the economy. It has now set a new benchmark for honest politics and good governance for governments across the country,” Kejriwal said in the letter. “Thank you for believing in us.”

A source said Kejriwal might call a meeting of his new cabinet later on Sunday to announce portfolios and call a two-day assembly session from Tuesday, when the other MLAs would take oath.

The party has decided not to invite any chief minister or politician from other states. AAP-Delhi convener Gopal Rai said the event would be a “Delhi-specific” ceremony. However, AAP is likely to invite all seven BJP MPs of Delhi and its eight MLAs. AAP has won 62 seats in the 70-member assembly.

Thiruvananthapuram: Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala demanded a CBI inquiry against state police chief Lokanath Behera with regard to the financial irregularities and misappropriation of funds cited in the comptroller and auditor general ( CAG ) report tabled in the assembly on Wednesday.

In his letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, the opposition leader also demanded a probe by National Investigation Agency (NIA) into the findings of the report about rifles and cartridges missing from the police.

He also demanded that the state police chief be immediately removed from the post.

“The CAG has come up with grave findings that as many as 25 rifles that can fire 600-650 bullets in a minute are missing from the armed reserve camp; this is a grave threat to the national security. The report also accuses that Rs 4.35 crore that is meant for construction of official quarters for sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors has been diverted for the construction of villas and camp houses for DGP and ADGPs,” Chennithala said in his letter.

Chennithala further added that all norms have been violated for purchasing of VVIP security vehicles using the funds for the modernisation of police force. Placing of supply orders without inviting tenders and granting Rs 33 lakh to the contractor without seeking the permission of the government are nothing but corruption and irregularity, Chennithala said in his letter.

Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan expressed concerns over whether the missing arms and ammunitions would have reached the hands of terrorists.

Amid the brewing controversies, Lokanath Behera met the chief minister here on Thursday and held a closed-door meeting for more than 30 minutes.

After the meeting, the police chief refused to make any comment on the CAG report citing that it would be inappropriate for him to make any comment. The chief minister, however, said that there is a specific way for replying to the findings of the CAG report.

Times View After claiming the life of a citizen at the construction site of the elevated road in Sodala last year and having a miraculous escape from a bigger mishap on Wednesday at the same site, the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) has failed to learn any lessons from these accidents. Without acknowledging the obvious failure on their part in taking safety measures, authorities have blamed the accident on ‘mechanical failure’. The response of JDA shows that it does not even want to question the lapses of the private company that caused the ‘mechanical failure’. If the JDA does not introspect and rectify its mistakes, commuters passing along such sites will be running bigger risk putting their lives in danger. Hopefully, authorities will wake up before it’s too late.

JAIPUR: While the Jaipur Development Authority (JDA) remains casual, commuters and residents fear that the incident at Sodala elevated road on Wednesday could have turned into a horrific accident, probably one of the biggest, if the 65-tonne iron cast would have come crashing down.The incident has exposed the glaring chink in security measures near the sites taken up by the authorities, while using heavy machinery. The authorities have expressed their helplessness saying that the accident occurred due to mechanical failure. But commuters have pointed out the lackadaisical approach of the civic body and the contracted firm. Vardharn Singh, a retired civil engineer said, “The JDA should thoroughly check the machines used by the contractor. If these kind of accidents occur, heavy penalty should be imposed on the contractor in order to prevent this in future. Will the civic body implement stringent measures only when people are dead?”A senior JDA engineer said, that the firm has trained staff and a safety officer at site who assigns the duty to every driver on various machines as per his experience and qualification. However, there is no way to stop accidents due to machine failure. An official on the condition of anonymity, said, “No action has been taken against the firm. The only precautionary measure JDA takes is that it works at night using heavy machines when there is no traffic flow.”The heavy machines working on construction sites at flyover routes will continue for several months threatening the safety of commuters. The skeletal pillars of the much-delayed projects, which are erected on the most arterial routes, have not only triggered severe congestion during peak hours, but also pose a risk for commuters who are travelling beneath the heavy machinery. Many heavy machines, such as piling machine, trucks and cranes, above the narrow road with traffic flowing on either sides, have made it an accident-prone area. “Wednesday’s incident could have caused immense damage. The JDA is waiting for a bigger incident to happen,” he said.This is not the first accident on the elevated road ever since the construction started. In April 2019, a 25-year-old youth riding pillion on his brother's bike was killed after an overhead height barrier crashed on his head near Hawa Sadak in Sodala.",jaipur,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74126950,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-715636,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/sodala-incident-exposes-chink-in-safety-at-jdas-construction-sites/articleshow/74125679.cms

JAIPUR: The Jaipur rural police have arrested 27 persons involved in a prostitution racket in Jamwa Ramgarh police station area. Ten men and 17 women have been arrested. They all are from Rajasthan and were running the racket in houses on NH-148. The policemen posed as customers and once the prostitution racket was confirmed, raided the houses.

The accused were arrested from Raisar police station area by a team of around 50 police personnel. SP Jaipur rural, Shankar Dutt Sharma said, “For last six months, we have been running an operation to curb all criminal activities on the highways. We received information that there was a sex racket operating in our jurisdiction and formed a team to get to the bottom of the matter.”

The arrested persons are from neighbouring districts including Sawai Madhopur, Karauli, Alwar and others. They all are aged between 20 to 30 years. “After receiving information, we sent few of our personnel to the place where prostitution was happening. They posed as clients and once money exchanged hands for a woman sex worker, we raided the houses and arrested all those who were present at the time of the raid,” added the SP. According to officials, the sex workers charged around Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 per client and cops are also looking for more people involved in the racket.

Elaborating further, the official added, “This is one of the biggest rackets that we have uncovered in over a year and there are high chances that more people are involved in it. We are investigating further to find how the women were brought into prostitution. There is a network working here through which the women are brought here. Money is the only motivation and most likely all of them are from poor families.”

The arrested persons have been booked under the relevant sections of IPC.

Thiruvananthapuram: Though the state police lost face for lack of transparency, fund diversion and out-of-the-way procurements, the only silver lining for it in the comptroller and auditor general ( CAG ) report is the pat on the back for intervention in cyberspace through the Cyberdome project .

The CAG report observed that the Cyberdome, till January 2019, had monitored and reported for further action 120 data breaches, about 50 online frauds, 50 online sexual violence, 10 women-safety issues, about five instances of child abuse/pornography, 25 instances of terrorist activities, and about seven instances of ransomware. “The activities of Cyberdome in preventing online frauds through testing for vulnerabilities in banking applications are praise worthy,” CAG observed.

The audit found that Cyberdome detected vulnerabilities in four out of 10 tested banking applications, after which RBI and National Payment Corporation of India directed the banks concerned to withdraw the applications and recommended implementation of multi-factor authentication process to prevent frauds.

The audit report further said that various other activities, including conduct of child safety awareness programme for students, parents and teachers, developing and rolling out applications on creating traffic awareness and cybersecurity among students and conduct of workshops for police cybertraining throughout the state, have all helped Cyberdome earn the ISO 27001:2013 certification for law enforcement units, and this is commendable.

Cyberdome was conceived in 2014 as a cyber centre of excellence in cybersecurity as well as technology augmentation for effective policing. It is a collaborative effort of public-private partnership by different stakeholders in cybersecurity and handling of cybercrimes. Cyberdome has been emulated in other states like Assam, Punjab and Tamil Nadu and more states have evinced interest in this model for cybersecurity.

The Cyberdome, currently headed by ADGP (administration) Manoj Abraham, is manned by 16 personnel drawn from various wings of the police department. Besides, services of about 600 cybersecurity experts and 20 organisations are also availed.

Jaipur: Residents of city will be able to track the location of garbage pick-up vehicles on their mobile phones within two weeks.

BVG Company, responsible for door-to-door garbage collection in the city, is developing an application for the citizens called Nuevas GPS system which at present is just for official use. Manager of BVG Company Rajesh Chaudhary said, “At present, this application is for the official use but within two weeks, we will launch it for people. Officials of Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) are able to keep a track on any garbage collecting vehicles in the city. But when this application will be made available for the general public, they would be able to see the location of the vehicles in their ward,” said Chaudhary.

As per the information provided, people would have to register their house through KYC on the application and then they would be able to locate the vehicles in their ward. “When the address is registered, people would be able to check the time when the vehicle arrived in their ward. They will be able to contact the driver as well. This application will work in any part of Jaipur but only for the ward their house is registered not in any other ward. This is done to avoid unnecessary traffic on the website or application,” said Rajesh. JMC officials say it is necessary to have this application as it will help people to keep tab over the vehicles’ activity.

“We receive many complaints about the irregularity of the vehicles in their wards. Many times, drivers deliberately leave many lanes in an area but this application will curtail all such issues as people will directly contact the driver,” said a JMC official anonymously.

PANAJI: Goa police statistics state that since 2017, over 60% of persons accused of rape were friends of the survivor . Data available till 2019 shows that out of 205 rape cases, registered in Goa, 128 of them were committed by a friend of the survivor. Apart from the ‘friends’, Goa police also booked family members, teachers, and other relatives. In fact, in only 9 cases was the accused rapist unknown to the victim.

The force also said that out of these 128 cases, 53 were initially registered as elopement before being converted into rape case. Also, 47 of the cases involved the “pretext of marriage”.

IGP Jaspal Singh told TOI that in rape cases, accused persons are both from Goa and outside the state. In 2017 and 2018, a British national was arrested for rape each year, and in 2019, an Iranian was arrested.

While rape cases are reported both soon after the crime and days later, police say that cases registered beyond 96 hours after the incident becoome difficult for police to probe and collect vital evidence.

Singh said that in rape cases, the accused is usually a known person, and parents need to be aware about who their children are friends with.

Over the past few years, Goa police also registered various cases involving crimes against women — kidnapping, eve-teasing, marital abuse, dowry death, immoral trafficking, etc. While chargesheets have been filed in many cases, most are pending trial. Some have even been closed due to lack of evidence.

The past five years have seen 230 cases of crimes against women remain undetected.

Goa police said they are trying to solve the undetected cases. “From time to time, directions are given to all investigating officers to conduct thorough and speedy investigations and to make sincere efforts to solve the cases,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said in a written reply tabled in the assembly.

KOLKATA: Calcutta University on Thursday denied permission to JNU student union president Aishe Ghosh to attend a programme on the campus organised by students and a section of staff to protest against “commercialisation of education” and to advocate autonomy, free speech and secularism.This, after police denied Ghosh permission to take out a march in Durgapur, her hometown, on Wednesday.Aishe’s bloodied image became the face of the anti-CAA movement after she was attacked by masked goons on the JNU campus on the night of January 5, leaving her with a gash on her forehead from repeated rod blows and a fractured arm. Many of the attackers are yet to be hauled up.The gates of Calcutta University on College Street were kept closed on Thursday, and even students from affiliated colleges were barred from entering. But the shut door could not deter the organizers.Faculty members, non-teaching staff and students, some of whom are members of Left-leaning unions, decided to hold the programme outside the main gate. Explaining their reason for not allowing Ghosh on their campus, a senior official at the university said outsiders could not be granted permission to hold programmes inside the campus.“We have ordered security personnel to shut the gates and allow people inside only after checking their identity cards,” said the official.Ghosh expressed her dismay at being stopped from entering the campus. “A university is a place for exchange of ideas and counterpoints. But some regimes want to muzzle free speech on campuses because they are scared of the power of students. Trinamool is doing in Bengal what Modi and Shah are doing in Delhi. But I am happy to see how people are fighting against these regimes on the street,” she said.The youngster compared the movement against CAA and NRC to the freedom struggle against the British. “Freedom did not come in a week or a year. It took us several decades and sacrifices. Even Gandhi and Bhagat Singh were called anti-nationals. So I don’t mind being termed ‘anti-national’ by the RSS. But what is important is that we must see whether we are ready to fight on the streets against this authoritarian regime. They will try to divide us on religious lines so that we don’t unite against them but we must continue our fight,” said Ghosh.Later in the day, Ghosh, along with several intellectuals, Left Front leaders and artists, walked in a rally, named ‘Jana Gana Mana’, from College Street to Shyambazar.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74128592,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-346323,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/cu-shuts-door-on-aishe-but-anti-caa-fight-continues/articleshow/74124738.cms

CS Gundewar felicitating Deepak malpe

NAGPUR: Exposure to high concentrations of fluoride through drinking water is the reason for incidence of fluorosis in Vidarbha. It is made worse because we are drawing groundwater from greater depths that has higher fluoride content.

Terming defluorination techniques such as Reverse Osmosis (RO) as temporary fixes, Deepak Malpe, who has been heading research on fluoride for two decades, emphasized that recharging groundwater sources with rainwater was the only affordable and long term solution.

“Water coming from dug wells in Vidarbha has fluoride content anywhere between 0.08 and 7.7 mg/litre. Borewell water has 0.13 to 19 mg/litre fluoride which was way higher than permissible limit of 0.7 mg/litre. If we recharged borewells with fresh rainwater, fluoride-level can be decreased effectively,” Malpe said. Expensive and complex techniques like RO, activated alumina, and Nalgonda techniques were temporary solutions and not suitable for rural areas, he said.

Malpe heads Post Graduate Department of Geology at RTM Nagpur University. He delivered Shivani Ghosh memorial lecture organized by Indian Institute of Mineral Engineers (IIME) at Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) on Wednesday. CS Gundewar, controller general (retd.), IBM, and president of IIME, Nagpur chapter, presided over the function. Indira Ravindran, controller general of IBM and G Vidya Sagar, additional director general and HOD of Central Region Geological Survey of India, were special guests.

Malpe presented alarming facts from his study that covered seven most affected tehsils of Yavatmal and Chandrapur districts.

“Over the years, rural population too has become highly dependent on groundwater. Tooth and bone decay are known forms of fluorosis, but it also has hazardous effects on renal, reproductive, neurological, endocrine, and development systems. Non-skeletal fluorosis can be carcinogenic and may cause cancer,” he said.

Those living in cities and getting drinking water from borewells should eat calcium-rich food, Malpe stated, adding that they too should install rainwater harvesting systems to recharge borewells at the earliest.

BJP MLA from Central Nagpur Vikas Kumbhare

Nagpur: The Nagpur division of Central Railway’s decision to operate 12289-90 Nagpur-Mumbai-Nagpur Duronto Express from Ajni has come in for sharp criticism from railway users’ body and public representatives.

BJP MLA from Central Nagpur Vikas Kumbhare said the decision is not in the interest of people, especially traders who prefer this train due to few stoppages and convenient timings. “From Nagpur, it benefits four assembly segments from the city. On Monday, I will submit my representation to the divisional railway manager (DRM),” he said.

“Many traders have complained to me demanding to roll back the train from platform number 8 as earlier. It is convenient for them to reach Santra Market side of the station instead of Ajni where there is always logjam while arriving and boarding the train,” Kumbhare said.

“If the railways wants to operate more trains from Ajni, it should start with passenger trains having less occupancy,” he said.

On Wednesday, president of passenger users’ body Rail Yatri Sangh (RYS) Brijbhushan Shukla submitted a memorandum to DRM Somesh Kumar demanding operation of the train from Nagpur. “Diverting such premium trains from Ajni will not only reduce importance of Nagpur station but is also inconvenient to passengers,” he said in a release.

From February 9, Central Railway suddenly started operating the train from Ajni for three months till May. Due to washable apron work on platform number 1 at the main station, Duronto, which used to run from home platform number 8 on Santra Market side, was temporarily shifted to Ajni from January 8. However, even as work on apron has been completed, the train has been shifted to Ajni.

Shukla said separate DRMs promised to give facelift to Ajni by constructing two more platforms, two pitline FOBs, better passenger amenities etc. However, over the years, Ajni was not developed despite increase in the number of trains.

“Now, plans are afoot to develop Ajni as an inter-model station by ministry of road transport and Central Railway. However, this project will take at least 5 years to complete. Till then, we can’t afford to run premium trains from Ajni,” said Shukla.

Railway committee convener of Nag Vidarbha Chamber of Commerce (NVCC) Pratap Motwani too opposed the move. “The railway officials are citing clashing of Duronto timings with Sevagram Express and other trains, but how far trains are punctual?”

“Ajni station is congested and lacks waiting rooms, proper toilets, food stalls, a necessary ramp, lifts, escalators, security, facility to shift differently abled passengers and sufficient parking. Passengers are facing a lot of problems. We will write to the railways and meet highways minister Nitin Gadkari on the issue,” he added.

386,['14/02/2020'],Justice Haq’s transfer: Lawyers to restart protest from Monday,"This story is from February 14, 2020

<p>Representative image<br></p>

Nagpur: After their request to stop justice Zaka Haq ’s transfer to Bombay High Court ’s Aurangabad bench was rejected, lawyers from the city have decided to restart their protests from Monday.

Chief Justice (CJ) Pradeep Nandrajog had rejected request made by the lawyers through High Court Bar Association (HCBA) for cancelling transfer orders of the judge who they termed as the most upright, honest and dedicated.

Currently, justice Haq is on a long leave till further notice and hadn’t joined the new posting at Aurangabad, as per the lawyers. TOI has been following the issue since January 21 when HCBA passed a resolution to protest the transfer.

Well-known lawyer Shreerang Bhandarkar told media that they will be protesting with white ribbons on the first day that is on Monday. “It will be followed by pink and red ribbons on the next two days. Our protests would be completely peaceful till February 22,” he said.

Claiming that he had support of most of the lawyers practicing in HC’s Nagpur bench and District and Sessions Court here, Bhandarkar warned that protests would be intensified after February 22. “Since the incumbent CJ is retiring on that date, we will move another resolution in HCBA for approaching the new CJ in this regard. We are hopeful our prayers would be heard. Otherwise, we will intensify the agitation and take steps like totally boycotting the court work,” Bhandarkar said.

Other lawyers said sudden transfer of the sitting judge, who was doing wonders in the judiciary and also streamlining the system, was nothing but a big humiliation of entire legal fraternity of city. Due to him the entire system is working well and bail matters are listed quickly. Earlier, it used to take days for these cases to come up for hearing. His efforts have also led to bringing discipline in the judicial system, which was working at snail’s pace. Just because he had issued a contempt notice to a lawyer from a powerful group and also HC registrar, complaints were lodged against him they told TOI.

The HCBA delegation led by senior counsel Shreehari Aney had met CJ Nandrajog in February first week with the resolution requesting cancellation of justice Haq’s transfer. The CJ defended his decision stating that he wanted a dynamic lawyer at the Aurangabad bench who could also effectively look after Public Interest Litigations (PILs), besides regular civil and criminal cases.

Box — HCBA differs with lawyers’ stand

The HCBA has clarified that they haven’t taken any decision to restart protest against justice Haq’s transfer and wouldn’t be part of the lawyers group which would be doing it from Monday. “It must be an individual decision of some lawyers, who are free to do it. We haven’t taken any such decision as of now,” secretary Prafulla Khubalkar said.

On lawyers’ call to move another resolution and send it to new CJ after February 22, he stated that nothing of this sort has been discussed by the HCBA’s executive body.

KOLKATA: As the first train set off from the East-West Metro’s Sector V station on Thursday evening, a host engineers and technocrats burst into jubilation, ostensibly elated that years of toil finally paid off.

“We have come a long way and today, we are the happiest. We started with an older signalling technology. But after the delay in route realignment, we could introduce the world-class communication-based train control system (CBTC) in the East-West Metro,” said Manoj Kumar, vice-president, Hitachi (sales).

Ushering in a new-era of technology for public transport, East-West Metro is being driven by an integrated CBTC and the automatic train control management system (TCMS), which will facilitate movement of trains with a frequency of 90-100 seconds. The Italy-based Ansaldo, which has designed and installed CBTC in East-West Metro, is owned by Hitachi. A team of officials from Hitachi took East-West Metro’s first post-commissioning ride on Thursday.

The other excited team leader on board the first train was Deepak Kumar Hota, chairman and managing director of BEML. “I have an emotional connect with Kolkata because my wife, Shiela, is from this city. She is thrilled we have provided world-class coaches to Kolkata’s second Metro, which unfortunately has taken three decades to start,” said Hota, who heads the Bengaluru-based PSU, which has manufactured the hi-tech train sets with body shell of cars, made of stainless steel. The lightweight, highly energy-efficient trains are monitored and selectively controlled by a microprocessor-based train control and management system (TCMS). “So, BEML has been responsible for most of the technological support and the nitty-gritty, like training the drivers in CBTC. East-West has become our baby ,” said Arun Prasad, assistant general manager, BEML.

Among the others who was jubilant that their “baby” took its first step in public was Biswanath Deewanji, chief engineer , Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation (KMRC). The man, who supervised the first piling work for the elevated viaduct in front of Shyamali housing complex in Salt Lake, maintains a low profile, even though he has seen the project through all its crises, including the tunnelling disaster at Bowbazar last August. All he said was, “Yes, I am happy that East-Metro has started rolling. Still remember 14 April, 2009, when the first piling work began. It has taken 11 years for the 5km stretch to take shape.”

Minister for ports, Michael Lobo.

CALANGUTE: The restored and renovated ‘Fort Aguada Heritage Jail and Museum’ will be thrown open by December this year, said minister for ports, Michael Lobo .

Talking to reporters at the former Central Jail during an inspection visit on Thursday, he said the museum would showcase the lives of freedom fighters, many of whom were jailed there. “The Goa Tourism Development Corporation (GTDC) is working with the Freedom Fighters Association to draw up the list of freedom fighters and to get their statues made,” he said.

Besides statues, there will also be paintings, murals, sound and light shows, a cafeteria and an open- air exhibition and performance area for art shows and music events, with a capacity for 160 people.

“Because this is in Calangute constituency, We want a small section on the life and times of Manohar Parrikar, as his ancestral house is in this constituency(Calangute). When I became MLA in 2012, I came to know that a new Central Jail was being built at Colvale and this would be closed down. There were plans to lease it out to a hotel, but I suggested to Parrikar, when he was CM, that it should be converted into a museum. He agreed,” Lobo said.

The museum will also have a section devoted to the Pinto revolt, said to be the first rebellion against Portuguese rule, as the leaders of the revolt, from the Pinto clan, were from Candolim, Lobo said.

Tourists visiting the museum will have to pay Rs 50 as entry fee. Lobo said after the jail museum work is completed, other parts of Fort Aguada, like the dilapidated gallows and bastions facing the Mandovi river and sea would also be restored.

“I appeal to the government to restore the other forts in Goa. We had made a commitment that we would restore this fort and convert the jail into a museum and we have kept our word,” he said.The work on the museum, at a cost of Rs 25 crore, has been undertaken by GTDC and is being funded by the central government through its Swadesh Darshan scheme. The GTDC has roped in Mumbai-based architects Darashaw and Co and Panjim-based heritage architect Ketak Nachnodkar to oversee the work which is being executed by Bagkiya Construction.

BENGALURU: In preparations for the state budget, chief minister BS Yediyurappa met with representatives of the farming community, who placed a series of demands to alleviate their plight.Statewide association of farmer unions presented an 18-point agenda at the three-hour meeting. One demand is to urge the Centre to recall the controversial Seeds Bill of 2019. The bill attracted much debate since it could corporatise seed distribution.Farmers also wanted a commitment from the government to waive loans up to Rs 1 lakh per farmer, a promise Yediyurappa had made. This is in addition to the coalition government’s loan waiver scheme.""Whether Yediyurappa will abide by the loan waiver promise he made when he was CM for three days remains to be seen. He did not make any commitment [on Thursday]. We would like clarity on this,"" said farmers’ representative Kodihalli Chandrashekar.Farmers also demanded the CM allocate ""substantial sums"" for irrigation, increase the height of Almatti Dam, use excess Godavari river water in Kalyana-Karnataka districts and ensure construction of the Mekedatu balancing reservoir.The CM is said to have urged farmers to have faith in him and promised them priority in his budget. But he also admitted he cannot ""fulfil"" all their demands due to financial constraints and especially since 80% of the budget goes towards paying salaries and commitments of the government. This leaves only 20% for new schemes, Yediyurappa said.The CM later told reporters: ""It was a fruitful meeting and I will try my best to accommodate their demands.""Meanwhile, the much-hyped Israel model of farming, mooted by the previous coalition government, appears to have been renewed by the Yediyurappa government. The project suffered a setback after the Kumaraswamy-led coalition government fell in June 2019. Agriculture department officials now say the stage is finally set for the project to take off. The department has already tied up with four agriculture and two horticulture universities and has demanded Rs 300 crore for the project in the budget.",bengaluru,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74130666,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-339716,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bengaluru/farmers-meet-with-yediyurappa-demand-loan-waiver/articleshow/74124407.cms

Inspector general Vijay Sakhare describe the functioning of the Cyberdome

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: While police are already under fire for behaving as if the established norms of selection of private agencies are not applicable to the force, a project that has been launched with much fanfare is in the thick of controversies for choosing a private technological partner in a non-transparent manner.

The Central Intrusion Monitoring System (CIMS), one of the projects of police noted by CAG with adverse comments in its audit report, was embroiled in controversy since the day of initiation. All kinds of electronics security and system integrators association (AKESSIA), which is the statewide association of electronic security and system indicators, had approached chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan against the arbitrary way in which police and Keltron had picked a company as the authorized vendor for surveillance equipment for CIMS project. “The company, Galaxon, has no previous experience or service in the field of CCTV camera or security systems. It is an organisation which cannot provide any service in this segment in a state like Kerala,” the representation given by AKESSIA to the chief minister said.

The CAG report had made clear remarks that there is an unholy nexus between police officials, Keltron and several vendors. “The audit observed that contrary to the reasons adduced by the state police chief to the government of Kerala justifying award of work to Keltron, in at least four instances, there was clear nexus between officers of police department, vendors and total service provider (TSP) Keltron in fixation of prices resulting in pecuniary loss to the scheme,” it said.

The AKESSIA further said that they have almost 5,000 such vendors registered under it and they should also be given opportunity to participate in the project. However, deepening the mystery, an RTI query to police had ruled out that it had not entered into any agreement with any private company for setting up the CIMS project. “The company has its representatives in the CIMS control room functioning at the police headquarters. Police may not have directly entered into any agreement with the company and it may be through Keltron, but it is too technical to cite that police and the company are not related in any manner,” police department sources said.

Launched as a joint initiative of the state police and Keltron, the CIMS was announced last month with a claim of being the country’s first state-of-the-art electronic asset monitoring facility that will not only alert police if an intrusion takes place, but also send accurate location and visuals from the location within seven seconds of an intrusion. Police had announced that the facility can be utilized by PSUs, private business houses, organisations and also individual houses across the state, for a monthly fee. With the CAG report making scathing remarks of having unholy nexus between police, Keltron and vendors, the CIMS also would be soon under scanner, sources added.

CHENNAI: Last September, nearly 4,000 youth vied for 14 vacant posts of sweepers at the secretariat. The interview that went on for 40 days had many applicants who were postgraduates and professional degree holders, including BEs and MBAs, for the job offering a monthly salary of Rs 15,000.Two months later, the Coimbatore corporation received nearly 7,000 applications to fill the 549 grade-I sanitary workers’ posts that guaranteed a monthly salary of Rs 20,000.The two episodes indicate a dearth of proper employment opportunities and job security in the state that were forcing highly qualified youngsters to compete for the post of sanitary workers and peons in the government sector.Though the Edappadi K Palaniswami government has been taking efforts to attract foreign investment and is working on an effective single window system for ease of doing business, the results will take time to fructify.Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, while presenting the 2019-2020 budget, admitted the government was facing a ""daunting task"" to improve the economic growth of the state to create more jobs and reduce poverty. The government, accordingly, is focusing primarily to woo greater investments in the manufacturing and service sectors.The CM and his cabinet colleagues toured the UK, the USA and the Middle East a few months ago and signed 41 MoUs, attracting investment to the tune of Rs8,835 crore. Ahead of the trip, the EPS government held the second edition of Global Investors Meet and signed 304 MoUs to attract investment of little more than Rs3 lakh crore that is expected to generate around 10 lakh jobs in the next few years.Though experts and industrialists welcome the government’s efforts to attract foreign investments with an eye on generating employment for the youth in the state, they also feel it will take a few years to turn it into reality.A day ahead of the state Budget, industrialists and experts opined the government should invest more in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as well as in the agriculture sector. It will arrest migration of labour from rural to urban areas. Entrepreneurs said the government should extend financial support to small and micro enterprises and create facilities to train and supply skilled workforce for the sector. ""We have been requesting the government to come up with policies to support and encourage MSMEs for the past three years, but nothing has happened. We hope our pleas will be considered this year,"" said M Swaminathan of the Federation of Association of Small Industries of India.According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) in 2017-2018, which was published recently by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation, Tamil Nadu has the highest rate of unemployment among the developed states in the country. Unemployment stood at 7.6%, as against the national unemployment rate of 6.1%. The neighbouring Andhra Pradesh (4.5%), Karnataka (4.8%), and Maharashtra (4.9%) and West Bengal (4.6%) are placed better than TN on this front.Being a predominantly service sector driven economy, which contributes to 51.86% of gross state domestic product (GSDP), the national and international economic slowdown has its direct impact on the industrial climate in the state, according to K R Shanmugam, director of Madras School of Economics.""The government should come up with a policy to enhance the minimum wages from Rs18,000 to Rs35,000 and guarantee job security for the workforce in private firms,"" said S Kannan, state acting general secretary of CITU.

The park was closed due to the presence of a leopard from a nearby forest

JAIPUR: After being closed for nearly four months, the Smriti Van will be opened for morning walkers from Friday.

The park was closed due to the presence of a leopard from a nearby forest area. The forest department has decided to open the park, but entry to it will be allowed only after those going in sign an undertaking and procure an entry pass, which will be charged.

Divisional forest officer, Jaipur, Kavita Singh, said, “The park will be opened for morning walkers only between 7am to 9.30am. We have installed 45 route signages along with warning signs on the jogging track. The residents will be allowed inside after signing an undertaking that they are entering at their own risk.” The joggers will have to register themselves at a gate to procure an identity card. For this, the department will charge Rs 55 (one time) from the joggers.

This is for the first time that public entry to the biological park was prohibited for such a long period. The forest department has installed three cages in the park, but all efforts have been futile till now. Officials said since leopard is an intelligent animal it is not entering the cage now as it was captured at an earlier occasion in the park.

As the elusive leopard, which has taken refuge inside the sprawling Smriti Van, did not go out, many residents came forward and requested the authorities to allow them entry to the park after signing an affidavit. A forest official said the feline was being regularly tracked and after monitoring its movement, the department decided to open the park after imposing restrictions. “We recently inspected the park to track the movement of the big cat. At present, the movement of the female leopard is near MNIT and temple area. We have earmarked the track on which morning walkers will be allowed.”

NEW DELHI: The mercury at Safdarjung weather station crossed 25 degrees Celsius on Thursday for the first time since November 28 last year. It touched a high of 27.8 degrees, nearly five notches above normal. The previous day, the station had recorded its first significantly higher-than-normal maximum temperature in two weeks.The weather is finally turning. This year’s long winter in north India may be coming to an end. Day temperatures in the region, which have mainly been below normal since the end of November, are now set to rise, according to the Met office.Signalling the shift in weather conditions, the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) extended range forecast on Thursday predicted above-normal heat over north India in the next two weeks.“Winter is now ending. Cold day conditions aren’t likely now in Delhi-NCR. Indications are that maximum temperature will rise over the next few days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre. “Nights may get a little colder for the next two-three days because of a western disturbance crossing the region but thereafter it will get warmer.”This the first time since late November that weekly average maximum temperatures in IMD’s extended range forecast are projected to be above normal in north India. Even average night temperatures are likely to be above normal after a week.In the capital, the change in weather was dramatic. Day temperatures crossed the normal mark for only the second time in the month on Wednesday, when a maximum of 24.5 degrees Celsius was recorded, a rise of 1.5 degrees over the previous day. On Thursday, the maximum was five degrees above the normal mark.“Heat is likely to gradually rise because no major WD activity is expected in the coming week. Some activity is expected around February 21, which could bring some rain in the northern plains and possibly break the trend of rising temperatures temporarily,” Srivastava added.Days have been particularly chilly so far this season. This is the first time in at least the last 28 years (for which records are readily available) that the temperature at Safdarjung stayed below 25 degrees Celsius in the whole of December as well as January.The mean maximum temperature in December was 18.8° Celsius, the second lowest recorded for the month since 1901. Mean day temperatures in January too were below normal by one degree Celsius.

Prices of Banglore roses have soared up at Mattutavani Flower Market in Madurai

MADURAI: With online and offline stores screaming of discounts for Valentine ’s Day, it is hard for anyone to traverse though the commercialization of romance. However, city folk, this year, have given a slip to the ubiquitous norm of exchanging expensive gifts..

Shopkeepers said that this year, surprisingly customers preferred cheaper gifts over attractive and expensive gifts.

A shopkeeper at a more than 10-year-old gift store in Thallakulam, which stocks special gifts for V-Day, said that over the years, the demand has declined. “The demand mostly fluctuates but customers are choosing gifts at cheaper rates. Even without offers, customers still come in to buy gifts ranging from cards, mugs to teddy bears but just prefer the cheaper alternative,” said Shivashankar D.

“Valentine’s Day is a meaningful day that should be celebrated because it makes us want to show our love for our beloved. But, expensive gifts like chocolates, bouquets and cards have become clichéd, I feel. We can still show our love without spending too much and instead save the money for something else,” said Nishantini R, 27.

Flower and bouquet shopkeepers said that roses remain a favourite V-Day gift. “Many prefer to buy bouquets as there is something nostalgic that many connect with flowers . We also got orders for door delivery to surprise their loved ones. Many feel it is a simple yet fulfilling gift,” said a florist from Chinna Chokkikulam.

Flower vendors are also expecting the price of button rose to go up on Friday.

JAIPUR: A 52-year-old woman committed suicide by jumping in front of a train at the Imli Phatak in the city on Thursday morning. According to initial investigation, the woman was mentally unstable and was undergoing treatment for the same.

The woman was identified as Munni Devi and the incident happened around 8 am on Thursday. “The woman left her house without informing anyone and started walking on the railway track at Imli Phatak. People called out to her when they saw an incoming train but Munni Devi did not pay heed and continued walking on the track. After some distance she sat down on the track and was hit by the train. Since the train was at high speed, no one could put themselves in harm’s way to physically remove the woman from the tracks,” said an official of Jyoti Nagar police station.

Initial investigation suggested that Munni Devi was suffering from some kind of mental ailment and the official added, “We have asked her family to give us medical details including the treatment which she was undergoing to ascertain if she was really unwell or there was some other reason that she decided to end her life. We are also questioning her husband further to find more details in the case.” Munni Devi was hit on the head by the train leading to her instant death.

MADURAI: Vice-chancellor of the Madurai Kamaraj University ( MKU ), Dr M Krishnan, on Thursday, said that the university syndicate will soon meet to take action against those involved in a case where a bundle of answer sheets was lost as well as the graft charges against the controller of examination (CoE), O Ravi.

Speaking to TOI, the VC said that he received information on February 6 that a bundle carrying 138 answer papers from the exam conducted in November 2019 had gone missing. “I got to know about the missing papers when staff requested to postpone the announcement of exam results for the 69,000-odd candidates, who took the exam this year, citing the missing papers. I instructed them to not publish the results unless the papers were found,” he said. Later, on February 10, the staff found the missing answer papers under the seat of a bus, which was used to collect the papers.

The VC further said that he immediately took note of the staff’s carelessness and initiated an inquiry. “College officials subsequently confirmed that the missed bundle was indeed original by checking the seal and stitching in front of syndicate members. The answer sheets are now in the process of correction as well,” he explained.

“Based on the replies we get to the memos, the syndicate will discuss in the next meeting and take action. We will also be discussing the matter of the graft charges against CoE,” said Krishnan.

Panaji: Raising doubts over the terror alert raised by the government, Congress on Thursday asked how the imposition of Section 144 could possibly thwart a terror attack in the tourist state.

The party also questioned why Section 144 was being imposed only in Goa, and not in the neighbouring states.

“If the terror threat is real and if the alert has been notified for the entire western coast of India, then why have these curbs been imposed only on Goa?” asked Congress media cell convenor Trajano D’Mello, addressing a press conference in the state capital on Thursday.

D’Mello said the party suspects that the state wants to either harass tourism stakeholders or clamp down on activists holding peaceful protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). “The conditions laid down for verification of people staying in rented houses and flats and tourists checking into hotels and guesthouses, appears to be very mischievous when these conditions already exist and are being enforced. This specific inclusion in the notification appears to be a ploy to be able to raid houses, hotels and any other place, and will be misused to harass people known to be speaking out against CAA, NPR and NRC,” said D’Mello.

Congress said the government’s notification was ‘mischievous’ and ‘deplorable’. “The Supreme Court, in its recent judgement, has explained to the law makers that Section 144 cannot be used to restrict citizens of their fundamental right to assemble peacefully and cannot be used to prevent expression of opinion or curb any democratic rights,” said D’Mello.

Congress said that there are adequate laws and tools to deal with terror threats, other than Section 144.

“By issuing such a notification that there are terror inputs, the government is telling the world loud and clear that Goa is not a safe place to live in , forget travel to while on holiday. The tourism industry is bound to be affected,” said D’Mello.

A couple pose for a photoshoot near Rumi Darwaza in the city

LUCKNOW: February is the month of love and those who are sealing theirs legally now are freely indulging in the romantic ritual of pre-wedding shoots.

Young couples are choosing locations in and around the city, instead of fairytale destinations in India and abroad, for the photo-op of a lifetime. From historical sites to lush green parks, Lucknow’s lovebirds are creating memories amid the city’s rich culture and heritage.

According to photographers and couples themselves, the Residency tops the list of preferred pre-wedding shoot sites, followed by Ambedkar Park, Kudiya Ghat, Gomti Riverfront, Rumi Darwaza and Janeshwar Mishra Park.

Teacher Reema Mahajan, who recently tied the knot, said she wanted her photo shoot to happen at a place close to her heart. “We had the option of choosing exotic locales, but we decided to stick to Lucknow. Several of our friends scoffed at the idea of a professional shoot in the city, but we showed them they were mistaken. Our album was shot at the Residency and at Janeshwar Mishra Park. We simply love how the pictures turned out,” she said.

Aishwarya Thapar, another ardent fan of the City of Nawabs, says the best part of shooting here is the dimension domes and minarets add to every picture. At Kudiya Ghat, for instance, the stunning architecture is further complimented by the Gomti. To top it all, people around are comfortable with photo shoots,” she added.

Some couples like Swati and Harshit Dubey are also walking the extra mile to get permission to shoot at heritage sites. “February is always in high demand, but we managed to get permission to shoot at Rumi Darwaza and Ambedkar Park. The best part of shooting in your own city is that it is easier to coordinate with photographers and family,” said Dubey.

MADURAI: Government healthcare centres in the city including primary health centres, community health centres (CHC) and Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) actively started enforcing hand hygiene only after the novel coronavirus (nCoV) breakout across the globe, said health officials and staff on Thursday.However, officials at GRH have said they are not able to completely enforce hand hygiene owing to the huge patient footfall and attenders. Despite round-the-clock cleaning by sanitation workers, many spots in the hospital are still unclean.“We are trying our best to keep the wards and corridors clean and the situation has improved much now compared to few years ago. We are also trying to restrict the number of attenders as well to prevent spread of infection but it is difficult because we always face opposition to it,” said GRH dean Dr J Sangumani.The dean also said that it was not practical to strictly enforce hand hygiene in a tertiary healthcare centre. “Currently we are strictly keeping hand sanitizers and hand washing solutions outside ICUs and infection-prone wards, enforcing hand hygiene for attenders. However, we can’t keep it for public use in the campus or for outpatients because many tend to misuse it,” said Dr Sangumani.The best way to prevent the spread of nCoV or any viral infection, as prescribed by the World Health Organisation (WHO), is practising hand and cough hygiene. “We always used to create awareness about hand hygiene and try to enforce it at all healthcare centres. However, it wasn’t strict enough before and some used to be a little careless. But, after nCoV breakout, though there has been no case in Tamil Nadu , the onus fell on hand hygiene,” said a city health official.Health centres in the city have kept hand washing solutions or hand sanitizers for public use and healthcare workers are also actively educating patients and attenders about hand hygiene, including the recommended six-step reverse hand washing method, cough hygiene and nCoV.“We are also keeping surgical spirit at the entrance of our CHC and are asking all those who visit to sanitize their hands when they leave,” said a medical officer at Sellur CHC.",madurai,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74133256,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-526840,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/not-possible-to-fully-enforce-hand-hygiene-at-grh-dean/articleshow/74125789.cms

KOCHI: In a bid to create a road map that would help pokkali farming in the state gain the status of Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System ( GIAHS ), a national intangible heritage festival is being organized here from February 14 to 16.

The festival is being hosted by the Centre for Intangible Heritage Studies (CIHS), Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady and National Museum of Natural History, New Delhi, in association with Palliyakkal Service Cooperative Bank, Ezhikkara and department of culture, Kerala.

GIAHS are outstanding landscapes of aesthetic beauty that combine agricultural biodiversity, resilient ecosystems and a valuable cultural heritage. India currently has three such systems recognized by Food and Agricultural Organization under the United Nations. One of them Kuttanad Below Sea Level Farming system is in Kerala. The other two are Saffron Heritage of Kashmir, India and Koraput Traditional Agriculture.

B Venugopal, honarary director, CIHS, said the festival has the theme of ‘intangible heritage and disaster’. “Our idea is to explore the possibilities of providing recognition to pokkali cultivation in the state which has proved itself as a futuristic agricultural practice,” said B Venugopal.

The festival is expected to recommend a strategy for the state to safeguard its intangible heritage. “We need to create a road map for receiving the IH status,” said Venugopal. This would be helpful at the next consultative meeting of the Unesco to be held in New Delhi shortly, he said.

For the first time, an university-level certificate course on intangible heritage would be launched during the programme, Venugopal said. Venu Vasudevan, CEO, Kerala Rebuild Initiative would inaugurate the event. Keynote address will be delivered by Amareswar Galla of Anant National University, Ahmedabad. Field sessions would be held at Ezhikkara on Saturday, followed by presentations by Palliyakkal bank and Chendamangalam grama panchayat. The festival would end on Sunday.

Palliakkal Service Coperative Bank at Ezhikkara had been at the forefront of promoting climate resilient farming, a model now acknowledged by the state government.

The pokkali land lie in 33 panchayats, two municipalities and one corporation area in Alappuzha, Ernakulam and Thrissur. According to a report by the agriculture department, original area under pokkali was estimated to be 25,000ha but is carried out only in 8,500ha. Out of this 5,500ha is under regular pokkali cultivation and the remaining is cultivated only when the climatic conditions are favourable.

Chennai: Despite the government implementing the 7th Pay Commission recommendations which benefited more than 18 lakh government employees, the state’s directly paid workforce wants more. Various associations of the government employees are looking forward to some of their still pending demands being fulfilled in the last full Budget of this AIADMK government, set to be presented by deputy chief minister and finance minister O Panneerselvam on Friday.

The government decided to implement the pay commission recommendations in October 2017, with retrospective effect from January 1, 2016. The additional burden due to the increase in salaries of all government employees and teachers among others came to nearly Rs15,000 crore annually and this led to increase in revenue and fiscal deficit of the state.

""Despite implementing the pay commission recommendations, we are yet to receive the arrears due from 2016. Around Rs150 crore or a little more is what is needed, but the government is yet to release the amount,"" said A Selvam, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Government Employees Association.

Lakhs of government employees and teachers went on an indefinite strike demanding fulfillment of a charter of demands in January 2019. The strike lasted a few days and was withdrawn after government threatened action against striking employees.

""The charter of demands includes release of arrears and withdrawal of new pension scheme. But even as we withdrew the strike, action was taken against 5,000 employees, including teachers, under Section 17D of The Tami Nadu Civil Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules. Action under this rule means, the employees will not get any retirement benefit. We have been asking the government to withdraw the action against the employees, but the government is stubborn,"" said Selvam. More than 1,500 employees and teachers were transferred to other districts and they continue to suffer.

Another demand of the employees is withdrawal of the new pension scheme. ""Former chief minister J Jayalalithaa had announced in the assembly about setting up a committee under former IAS officer T S Sridhar. Despite the committee submitting the report, the government has not implemented recommendations,"" said an employee at the secretariat.

Another grouse of employees is chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami is not willing to meet associations’ of government employees. ""After the strike, we have been trying to get an appointment with the chief minister to explain the demands, but he is not ready to meet us. We were able to meet some ministers who could only assure us that our demands will be taken up with the CM,"" said Selvam.

The association says there are several employees including noon meal workers and rural librarians who have completed 35 years of service. But, they still don’t get any retirement benefit except Rs2,000 pension. ""There are several demands of government employees. But, with the present financial situation of the state, it is not possible to implement all the demands. It will take time,"" said a senior secretary, not willing to be named.

Thiruvananthapuram: CPI state secretary Kanam Rajendran has criticized the opposition for trying to create a controversy over the comptroller and auditor general of India ( CAG ) report tabled in the assembly on Wednesday.

“The sanctity the Congress is trying to bestow upon a CAG report is rather ironical,” the CPI leader said, recalling the UPA era ‘when Congress dismissed successive reports of the CAG which pointed out financial anomalies to the tune of crores of rupees’.

“The opposition and the Congress should remember that the people of Kerala have not yet lost their memory power,” Rajendran told reporters here on Thursday.

The findings in the CAG report, ‘which are just allegations’, have to be examined by the public accounts committee of the Parliament or the assembly, which in turn needs to submit a final report, the CPI leader said. “The government has to take action only on such a final report,” he pointed out.

Rajendran also criticized the media for highlighting ‘some shortcomings’ pointed out in the CAG report and hiding ‘the accolades’ the government received with regard to the distribution of surplus land. tnn

Some zones in remote areas, with difficult terrain, are unpopular

PANAJI: Even as the annual auctioning of cashew zones has begun, the excise department does not expect a rise in its revenue collection, this year as well. The expected revenue ranges between Rs 35 and 40 lakh, and has not witnessed any significant rise in the past few years.

In total, 1,675 zones are on auction for the season and it is estimated that 30-40 % of them will not be bid on, as per the trend observed during the past few years.

“The cashew zones in Canacona, Bicholim and Sattari have very few takers,” an excise official said, adding that zones in South Goa were auctioned on Wednesday.

In 2018-19, he said 475 zones were not taken, out of the total 1,671 zones that were auctioned.

For zones thathave no takers, he said, sealed tenders will be invited. If still not bid on, applications are received from interested parties, the officer said.

The department, he said, can hope to get a better price for zones when there is some competition. In the past, he said, certain zones were auctioned even for Rs 1 lakh, but it is no more the case. He said, some zones exist only on paper and hence complete physical verification of the site has to be done. “Some zones have disappeared, for trees may be cleared for commercial purposes or for building homes,” he said.

Some of the cashew zones remain unpopular among bidders as the people who were traditionally into cashew juice extraction and distilling have moved on to other professions. Also, a small zone with just 20 to 25 trees is not an attractive option for it will not help economise the cost of production.

“Large properties have been divided among family members ,and this has resulted in reducing size of the zones,” he said.

In some cases, the department itself has reduced the size of the zones, which has led to a slight increase in the number of zones, he said.

“There will be no takers for zones if the juice extractor will need to travel a distance of four to five kilometres to get the raw material. It is not a viable option if he is a small trader,” the official said. In some zones, the terrain is difficult. No proper access is available, while manual collection is not an easy solution because it is difficult to get labourers. “Due to the high cost of labour, the overall cost of feni production increases,” said a trader.

The department has fixed the rate for selling cashew apples without nuts at Rs 3.5 per kg and cashew juice is to be sold at Rs 4.5 per kg.

The officer said, licensees can’t sell cashew juice at below or above the price fixed by the government.

Stray dogs roam around in Janeshwar Mishra Park on Thursday

LUCKNOW: The increasing number of stray dogs at Janeshwar Mishra Park in Gomtinagar is reportedly keeping visitors away.

On an average, two-three incidents of dogs chasing morning walkers or snatching food from picnickers are reported every day. The ticket contractor hired by Lucknow Development Authority (LDA) claims the daily footfall at Asia’s largest park has dropped by 20% from 8,000 in the past few months.

During a TOI reality check, security guards put the estimated number of canines at “no less than 100” while visitors suggested that the LMC should at least restrict the animals to a corner of the park and not allow them to roam freely.

Vishesh Mishra, a resident of Viram Khand and a fitness regular, said all morning walkers carried a stick nowadays just to be safe. “There are stray dogs everywhere. Who would want to get attacked by one?”

Visitor Vinay Sahu who comes for cycling in the park was chased a few days ago. “In my effort to get rid of them, I lost balance and fell off my cycle. Others shooed the dogs away,” he said. Another park regular Jagdish Verma said he recently rescued three children who were running away from a pack of strays.

Neha Arora who was at the park on Thursday agreed that kids were at a greater risk. “As soon as we opened our lunch boxes, three dogs tried to snatch away food from the children. We complained to the guards, but they did nothing,” she said.

Thiruvananthapuram: Economic and statistics department director has appealed to people to cooperate with the survey conducted by the department. With the campaign against NRC in the background, enumerators fear assault from people, said sources in the department.

The director in a statement made it clear that the survey had nothing to do with NRC. The survey is being done to create the consumer price index as part of the scheme mooted by the Centre for establishment of an agency for reporting agricultural statistics.

This scheme is a component of the main scheme ‘improvement of agricultural statistics’, which is implemented by the ministry of agriculture and cooperation, Government of India.

Department of economics and statistics is the nodal agency of this scheme in the state. Agricultural statistics is collected through sample surveys covering the entire state, excluding regions declared as reserve forests. At present, under this scheme, 811 investigator zones are functioning and 100 clusters are selected randomly from each zone.

The major findings in the publication “agricultural statistics” prepared by this department in every agriculture year are used for implementing various governments decisions. The survey is conducted by classifying land into wet and dry land.

Also, the geographical area of the state has been classified according to 13 different patterns of land use such as bearer and uncultivable land, building and courtyard, other non-agricultural uses. Along with this survey, details for preparing the index for sustainable development and domestic tourism will also be collected.

I met Wendell Rodricks when he first descended into Goa from the hustle and bustle of Bombay. He was drawn to his roots in the village of Colvale, thanks to his father, Felix, a niz Goenkar. After a chance introduction, we became close buddies.

I was there when he clinched the purchase of Dona Maria Braganza’s picturesque bungalow. Wendell aptly named it Casa Dona Maria. Knowing that I had initiated the Festival of Plants and Flowers in Siolim, he requested me to landscape Casa Dona Maria, which I promptly did.

We got along like fireflies and I even accompanied him to attend his fashion show in Bengaluru. Later, we gelled at the 2008 Goan Convention in Canada.

Wendell was a compulsive world traveller with his partner, Jerome Marrel. I recall illustrating their travel diary and later on, the souvenir of their house, Casa Dona Maria. During an exhibition of my work in Portugal, I visited France and was warmly welcomed into the homes of friends and relatives of Jerome and Wendell.

What Wendell will be remembered for is his minimalistic style. His passion for Goa will forever be etched in his activism for taking up environmental causes and in the popular books he authored.

A visionary par excellence, Wendell will go down in history for his magnum opus — the magnificent transformation of Casa Dona Maria into his dream project, Moda Goa Museum and Research Centre.

I will not say adieu, Wendell, for you will always walk by my side.

CM Ashok Gehlot

JAIPUR: In just over one year, the state is in various stages of processing over 1 lakh government jobs , chief minister Ashok Gehlot stated on Thursday. He was replying to a debate on the governor’s address in the Assembly on Thursday.

“We have appointed 34,283 people so far. The results of recruitment have been declared or are in the process for another 34,527 posts. Further, advertisements have been issued for 45,773 more posts,” the chief minister said, while replying to a question by Opposition leader Gulab Chand Kataria on his party’s poll promise of providing 1 lakh jobs in a year.

Gehlot said the Centre has deprived the state government of Rs 17,000 crore on various counts.

Despite the governor’s address not referring to Barmer refinery, Gehlot said it continues to be top priority of his government.

“So far, work orders worth Rs 20,393 crore have been issued,” he said.

He blamed the previous BJP government of diluting the state’s share in the refinery project.

The chief minister said the ambitious Rajasthan Eastern Canal Project (RECP) to provide drinking water to 13 districts of eastern Rajasthan would be taken up by his government. The Rs 37,000-crore river-linking project was proposed during the previous Raje government.

Claiming credit for the farm loan waiver, Gehlot said that his government had announced a relief of up to Rs 2 lakh on individual farm loans, and waived off all farm loans of the cooperative sector irrespective of the amount.

He said about 9,000 farmers out of the 20 lakh beneficiaries had loans of over Rs 2 lakh.

But the CM said the government was not able to waive loans taken from commercial banks and had sought the cooperation of Centre for a one-time settlement of loans. The Centre though has not given a reply yet. “In Chhattisgarh, the banks themselves had come forward for a one-time settlement and it can be done in the state as well.”

On power tariff hike, Gehlot said 57% of the consumers have been kept outside the purview of the revised rates. He reiterated that there was no tariff hike for agriculture connections in the next four years and the same would be borne by the state.

The government was able to tackle the locust menace and it was appreciated by the Centre, he said, adding that his government had now given Rs 500 crore to agriculture insurance firms for providing crop insurance cover for farmers.

JAIPUR: Following the intervention of the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO), the financial advisor of the panchayati raj department has red flagged the promotion of one executive engineer to the post of superintendent engineer (SE) in 2012-13, citing violation of rules.

In 2012-13, three executive engineers were promoted to two vacant posts of SEs in the department. After CMO intervened, the panchayati raj department had sought a factual report in the matter.

The three persons who were promoted by the department were Sumit Kumar Agrawal, K K Sharma and Mukesh Maheshwari as per seniority.

Maheshwari, the junior-most among the three, was promoted violating rules to the SE’s post. He is now being considered for IAS promotion (from other services).

On November 22, 2019, the CMO had directed additional chief secretary (ACS), rural development and panchayati raj department, to take necessary action as per rules in the matter. Following this, the department on November 28, 2019, directed two joint secretaries and the financial advisor to prepare a factual report in the matter.

On December 13, 2019, Hari Singh Meena, financial advisor to the department, advised reviewing the promotion of Maheshwari to the post of SE, flouting the rules, by the departmental promotion committee (DPC) and stopping the financial irregularities committed in the case, as per replies received through RTI applications.

Earlier, in August 30, 2018, the finance department too had sought reply from the joint secretary, panchayati raj department, considering the gravity of the matter.

In March 2015, the promotions were questioned in the assembly and the panchayati raj department admitted that only two SE posts were vacant. The department also resolved to correct the third promotion, the RTI reply added.

Even now, there are four SEs working in three posts in the department.

Wendell convinced Malaika Arora (L) & other models to walk the ramp for Vasco SC

PANAJI: When friends and well-wishers came calling, Wendell Rodricks didn’t know how to say no.

Vasco Sports Club’s golden jubilee anniversary in 2001 coincided with news that one of their most famous footballers, Bernard Pereira, was going through a tough time. His 14-year-old son was diagnosed with leukaemia and needed support.

“What use was a football club if it hadn’t acquired a heart after 50 years,” the club asked itself, and the then president, Noel da Lima Leitao, started planning for a fund-raising event.

The first person Noel contacted was Wendell, his dear friend, and asked him for a favour. “I have Rs 50,000 to spend. Can you do me a small show when we auction a T-shirt for this young boy? Can you get Malaika Arora to model for us?” he asked the fashion designer.

Wendell couldn’t say no, though he knew that a show costs between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 12 lakh and that Malaika’s fee at the time, for an appearance, was over Rs 2.5 lakh.

“My heart said, ‘Wendell, this man is not asking anything for himself. It is for a cause’. Actually, a multitude of causes,” Wendell noted in one of his posts.

It didn’t take much time for Wendell to convince Malaika, a supermodel, and other models.

“Wendell agreed at short notice of less than a week to put together a fashion show to roll out Vasco’s new jersey, designed by him. Wendell’s ideas poured out like a stream of telemetry,” the club said in its publication.

A few years later, Wendell had another knock on his door. This time it was Goa Football Association (GFA) secretary Savio Messias, who asked if he could design jerseys for the state team.

Wendell prepared the design and submitted it to Messias without any fanfare. Goa wore the jerseys for the first time in 2008 when they bowed out in the semifinals. But the jerseys looked so good that the GFA decided to continue with them for the next edition in Chennai as well. This time, Goa went on to edge past arch-rivals West Bengal for its fifth, and last, Santosh Trophy title.

BHOPAL: The Madhya Pradesh special task force ( STF ) has registered 25 separate FIRs in one of the biggest ever gun racket in the state involving high and mighty based in Satna district and the list of ‘beneficiaries’ includes a sitting Congress MLA from Chitrakoot.

STF officials, however, clarified that their probe currently revolves around some government employees who had issued fake weapon licences, increased quota of ammunitions without government’s approval, and extended permits fraudulently and that those named in the list are only ‘victims’ of fraud. Licences issued after 2004 are being examined, said sources.

ADG Ashok Awasthi told media that action is being taken to curb blackmarketing of ammunitions and a case has been registered in compliance with government’s assurance in the cabinet. He said a special investigation team (SIT) led by SP Rajesh Bhadoria was set up to investigate the matter and records were seized from the arms licence wing of the collectorate.

More than 100 gun licences are under scanner. Congress MLA from Chitrakoot Nilanshu Chaturvedi – whose permit was extended illegally – told TOI that he had got documents from the government office. “My area is located on the UP and MP border. We have to go to UP to get petrol. I have followed all rules needed for permit. If they have given me a forged document, how would I know? Let this be investigated,” said Chaturvedi.

ST officials said the licences issued by J&K government were registered and renewed in Satna without government’s approval. It may be noted that J&K arm licences are already under scanner of CBI and linkages between MP-based gangs and Mohammad Zuber gang is also being investigated. Investigators have found that people living outside Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan were illegally shown to be domicile of the state so that they could get ‘All India’ arms licences.

Some J&K authorities are suspected to have facilitated the issuance of these arms licences by presenting civilians in the application forms as either serving or retired personnel of Army and central paramilitary forces having served or are serving in the state.

When NAFED started purchasing through Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation, they posed as farmers and sold the tur at higher prices.

Amin Malnas (50), a resident of Wadgaon (Gadhwe) village, is the aide who was arrested on Wednesday with Gulhane. Two of his associates Dharmesh Dhole, a resident of Nathuwadi in Darwha, and Maheshwar Bhoyar, a resident of Shelidi village, were arrested earlier.

The complaint was lodged by marketing officer under the DDR, Yavatmal, on October 13, 2018, alleging a fraud to the tune of Rs1.41 crore.

Kamal Nath

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath on Thursday hit out at the Modi government for sharp spike in retail inflation during the last six years. Nath said the Centre should focus on controlling inflation and boost economic growth, instead of diverting attention from real issues.

""The statistics released by NSO show that retail inflation has soared to 7.59%, the highest level in last six years, while unemployment has reached an all time high in the last 45 years. There is an urgent need to pay attention towards curbing inflation, instead of diverting from real issues,"" tweeted Nath on Thursday.

Expressing concern over soaring prices, the chief minister said, ""Vegetable prices have gone up by 50%, while industrial production has declined by 0.3%. Out of 23 industries in manufacturing section, 16 have shown a negative growth.""

Nath also hit out the Centre for hike in LPG cylinders. He said, ""Rates of non-subsidised gas cylinders have increased by Rs 144.50. The food items have become expensive and employment is decreasing. In which direction, is this country going?""

Nath's reaction after the data was released by the Union ministry of statistics and programme implementation on Wednesday which revealed that retail inflation in the country rose the maximum since May 2014, besides pushing up food prices and telecom tariffs. The Consumer Price Index inflation stood at 7.59 percent in January 2020 as compared to 7.35 percent in December 2019.

Reacting on Nath's comments, leader of opposition Gopal Bhargava said the chief minister should control excessive and overspending on wasteful events. ""The state government has decided to spend crore on events like IIFA. It is involved in image branding at the cost of public's hard-earned money,"" said Bhargava.

He said the state government should stop demanding funds from the Centre and put a check on overspending and corruption. The government should immediately cancel the IIFA award ceremony, he added.

With delays stalking several projects under Smart City Mission, authorities are resorting to shortcuts and reducing their scope and size

MK.SunilKumar@timesgroup.com

Kochi: With the deadline for completing the works under Smart Cities Mission fast approaching, authorities are finding shortcuts for staying on target. The scope of some of the projects have been reduced while some others are likely to undergo changes.

The proposed length of the walkway connecting Metro station at Maharaja’s College ground to Boat Jetty, one of the Smart City projects, has been cut short to avoid further delay.

The project, which started way back in February 2017, and which could have been beneficial to hundreds of commuters, is yet to be completed. Authorities say the project, which was supposed to be completed in six months, got bogged down by land acquisition delays.

“Some agencies whose holdings will have to be taken over for constructing the walkway are not ready to hand over land parcels. We have not been handed over the land owned by Ernakulam Head Post Office and Maharaja’s College Hostel, among others. So, we are planning to complete the stretch till where we have already acquired land. In other areas, we are constructing the walkway on available space,” says an official associated with the project. “The work will be completed in a week,” he adds.

Making matters worse, the stretch along which the works have been completed, are used as parking lots for autorickshaws and motorcycles.

Even while the project faces hurdles, authorities, including the Kochi Corporation, is yet to take any steps to resolve the issue. Officials with the Cochin Smart Mission Ltd (CSML), the special purpose vehicle floated for implementing Smart City projects in Kochi, have also not sought the intervention of people’s representatives for sorting out the problems. “CSML officials haven’t informed me about the difficulties they face to acquire land. Had they informed me, I could have taken up the issue with the Centre as well as the state government,” says Hibi Eden, MP.

Compromises are likely to be made on the project involving the reconstruction of the Ernakulam Market, as well. CSML has earmarked Rs 100 crore for renovating the market. But the authorities have not yet floated tenders for the project as the land required for rehabilitating the merchants who runs the stalls in the market is yet to be identified.

The premises of a school near by the market, which is not functioning now, was identified for the purpose but it was found that a case has been pending before the high court regarding the ownership of the land.

“If we do not get land, we can avoid market reconstruction and just focus on renovation. We have given our suggestion to the CSML in this regard,” sources with Kochi Corporation said. But CSML officials said they haven’t taken any decision so far. Anyway, the project is yet to start rolling.

Contractors unwilling to take up works

Kochi: Though adequate funds have been allotted for completing the projects under Smart City Mission, contractors have been hesitant to take up many of the works. Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) authorities have been forced to retender the works again and again.

The Rs 7.1 crore Marine Drive Walkway project is a case in point. “All the contractors who took part in the tender process quoted above our estimate. We can’t award works at rates above the estimate as Smart City norms don’t allow it. So, we have retendered the project for the fourth time,” an official with CSML said.

“The sidewalls of the walkway need to be protected due to high tide and waves. The contractors claim it is a costly affair. So, no one is ready to take up the work at the current estimate,” the official said.

The same goes for the project to procure sweeping machines for cleaning the streets in the city. “All the firms, which have taken part in the tender procedures so far, are reluctant to take up the work. They are not ready to agree with the condition that they need to operate and maintain the machines for three years. So, we are retendering the project for the third time,” the official said.

The Rs 2 crore project to supply smart portable compactors to store and transport garbage from the city also has met a similar fate. The reason? No firms are ready to operate and maintain the machines.

CMSL authorities had earmarked Rs 32.49 crore for renovation of roads in three divisions of the corporation in Fort Kochi area. But the authorities have not yet been able to award the works to a contractor. As huge amounts need to be spent for bitumen works, contractors are reluctant to undertake roads works, a corporation official said. Now, the CSML is again inviting tenders for the works.

Sewage treatment plant: Another clogged project

Kochi: Another project that has been facing uncertainty is the much-touted vacuum sewer project designed for five divisions of the local body in Fort Kochi and Mattancherry areas. The corporation authorities have not yet been able to identify land for setting up the plant.

The land the authorities had identified earlier for the project is caught in a legal tangle over its ownership. Though the civic body authorities suggested that the plant can be set up on land owned by Cochin Port Trust (CPT), they haven’t conducted any talks with the owners of the holding so far.

At a council meeting held on January 20, mayor Soumini Jain had announced that she will hold a meeting with CPT chairperson for further discussions in one or two days but no progress has been made on that front so far.

The project to renovate Broadway at a cost of Rs 10 crore is also in a limbo. “We had zeroed in on a design. As per the design, there is a roof over Broadway. But CSML authorities want to bring in certain changes in the design. They want to avoid the roof citing chances of fire mishap. But roofed streets can be seen in cities across the world,” sources with the corporation said.

“The roofed design would have attracted more consumers to Broadway. They can park their vehicles somewhere near Marine Drive and walk along the street,” he said.

430,['14/02/2020'],CAA: Chidambaram for mass movement 'if any Muslim is sent to camp',"This story is from February 14, 2020

NEW DELHI: Congress veteran and former Union minister P Chidambaram said on Thursday that there should be a mass movement if any Muslim was sent to a detention camp in the event of the Supreme Court upholding the Citizenship Amendment Act.

""When they touch the excluded... they will only be Muslims, try to identify and throw them out, declare them stateless, there must be a huge mass movement resisting any Muslim being thrown out or kept in detention camps,"" Chidambaram said while replying to a question at an event in JNU.

When asked why the Congress brass had kept a distance from the anti-CAA protests and had not visited Shaheen Bagh, he said, ""It is not true. I have led a march in Thiruvananthapuram and many other states. We are not going to Shaheen Bagh as it will be falling into the BJP's trap and will be made political.""

Chidambaram also said that the only way to oppose CAA was legally and added that he believed in the Supreme Court which is hearing petitions against changes in the citizenship law. He questioned the fact that CAA was passed in just three days and was meant to make up for the ""NRC fiasco"" which resulted in the exclusion of 12 lakh Hindus out of Assam's National Register of Citizens.

He clarified that Congress was not against those included in the CAA. ""We are against the law on the grounds of exclusion. Our opposition is about exclusion. Include all of them. In fact, our demand is not to deny citizenship but to include all neighbours and people of all religions. Let me make that very clear. But BJP goes around spreading lies. In fact, we go a step further, I have written about it, what we need today is not CAA but a law for refugees. We must have a broad, humane law on refugees. Who is a refugee and who will qualify as refugee? We are arguing for a broader law, a larger law on refugees.""

Panaji: Tawquir Sheikh, Wendell Rodricks’ master cutter who worked with him for 32 years, has cut materials that have dressed former Miss Universes Sushmita Sen and Lara Dutta, former Miss Worlds Aishwarya Rai and Priyanka Chopra, and other big names. It was in his presence that Rodricks noticed a tall, lithe girl, Deepika Padukone, approached her and invited her to Mumbai.

“We were at a small show at a club in Bengaluru years ago and Deepika was just a model at that time. She was sitting in the audience while we were on stage. Wendell thought she looked lovely and saw that she had the potential of a top model. He talked to her in front of me and told her he would help her with a career in Mumbai and thus launched her,” Sheikh said.

Rodricks similarly spotted Anushka Sharma as a teen and launched her, too, he said.

“In the 32 years I’ve worked with him, he discovered many such models who went on to become actors. I’ve cut materials for most of the designs Wendell has made for them. Yana Gupta, Salman Khan and Arbaaz Khan have also worn Wendell’s designs cut by me,” Sheikh said.

It was the Hindu-Muslim riots in Mumbai in the early nineties that prompted Rodricks to pack up and shift permanently to Goa, he said.

“I used to work at Fatal Attraction in Mumbai, where Wendell would come to do his designs twice a week. He said that I, a Muslim man, would feel safer in Goa and would be able to work well too. I’ve made Goa my home ever since,” Sheikh, who now lives in Colvale himself, said.

Rupali Kumar with Kuldeep

LUCKNOW: When Rupali Kumar will meet her husband for a candlelight dinner on Valentine ’s Day, the experience will be much more than a romantic date.

The 25-year-old acid attack survivor, who married the love of her life Kuldeep (26) in 2017, has seen years of turmoil before finding her happiness.

Celebrating V-Day for the first time like this, the couple will be reliving the time they lost in overcoming odds to unite.

A Bhojpuri film and video artist from Ghazipur, Rupali was attacked with acid by a colleague who claimed to be in love with her.

The incident of 2015 left deep scars not only on Rupali’s face but also her heart and spirit.

“For a year after the attack, I was in intense trauma and kept to myself. In 2016, I started working in Sheroes Hangout Cafe in Lucknow where I met Kuldeep and slowly, a friendship began,” says Rupali.

Kuldeep, who takes care of all of Sheroes’s outdoor activity, said that in Rupali, he found a friend who understood him like no other.

“Over the months, I knew our friendship had developed into love but I didn’t know how to propose. She was the one who did it, much to my delight. I knew she loved me as a person and not my looks or money,” says Kuldeep, adding that physical beauty does not matter.

For Rupali, it was Kuldeep’s positivity to heal the post-attack trauma that won her over.

“The acid attack now feels like a blessing. It taught me the value of qualities in a person. It also taught me to fight and win the overall struggle,” says Rupali.

While the couple promised to each other a lifetime of togetherness, resistance from the family, Kuldeep said, was expected.

“My family did not accept Rupali until the birth of our daughter in 2018. Till then, my father did not know we had married. But now, they are warming up to us,” he adds.

On Friday, the couple is being treated by a city hotel to an exclusive candlelight dinner as part of Valentine’s Day celebrations to give out the message that love has no boundaries.

The hotel’s assistant manager, marketing, Deepti Kapil said, “We are running a social media campaign called #LoveHasNoBoundaries. The initiative aims to spread the message that true love knows no caste, colour, gender or age. Honouring that spirit, we are hosting Rupali and her husband so that their story becomes an inspiration for others.”",lucknow,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74125874,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70100,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/lucknow/love-heals-scars-of-acid-attack-survivor-shes-ready-for-v-day/articleshow/74125875.cms

MLA A Johnkumar take selfie with government whip R K R Anantharaman during the special session of the Puducher... Read More

PUDUCHERRY: The opposition AIADMK has urged speaker V P Sivakolundhu to initiate action against Congress MLA A Johnkumar for ‘lowering the dignity of Puducherry legislative assembly ’ by taking selfies with government whip R K R Anantharaman and others during the special session and sharing the photos on social media on Wednesday. AIADMK legislature party leader A Anbalagan submitted a memorandum to the speaker in this regard on Thursday.

Anbalagan said Johnkumar shared the selfies in a WhatsApp group and they were shared by several people in many other groups even as the session was underway.

“Failure on the part of the speaker to initiate action against ruling party members for their indiscipline has lowered the dignity of the post of the speaker,” Anbalagan said.

He regretted that the speaker failed to prevent AIADMK members from referring members of the opposition in a disrespectable manner during the special session in their absence in the assembly. “It is unfair that the speaker failed to prevent ruling party members from addressing members of opposition in a disrespectable manner in their absence. It is equally unfair that the speaker failed to expunge the comments from the assembly records,” he said.

Anbalagan insisted that the speaker expunge disrespectable remarks on members of opposition parties made by the ruling party members from the records and urged him to initiate action against Johnkumar for acting in an indisciplined manner during the proceedings.

Members of some WhatsApp groups came down heavily on Johnkumar for his action when they were deliberating on important issues like Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register and declaring the fag-end of Cauvery delta – Karaikal district – a special protected agricultural zone during the session.

Johnkumar was elected from Nellithope assembly constituency in 2016. He resigned to enable V Narayanasamy, who was elected the Congress legislature party leader, to contest the bypoll and retain the chief minister’s post. Johnkumar was rewarded with a party ticket to contest the bypoll from Kamaraj Nagar in 2019 when V Vaithilingam resigned and successfully contested the 2019 parliamentary polls. Johnkumar won the bypoll defeating All India NR Congress candidate S Bouvanesvarane.

Mumbai: The BMC commissioner has ordered an inquiry into the inordinate delay in reconstruction of the Chandanwadi crematorium .

Sources said the commissioner was shocked to learn the BMC has been dragging its feet for over two years in finalising the type of furnace to be installed at the crematorium. The Colaba advanced locality management has held 60 meetings with various civic officials, including additional municipal commissioners, but to no avail. “There has been an unforgivable delay in restoration,” aid Praveen Pardeshi, the civic chief.

Following the inquiry, those responsible will be suspended, said sources, adding if AMCs are to be blamed, a complaint would be made with the government.

The crematorium, one of the oldest, caters to A, B and C wards. In 2017, the BMC’s structural audit had declared it “dangerous for human movement”. In October 2017, a slab collapsed. Since then, two halls are off limits for last rites that are performed in the lobby; it is in a poor condition. CALM’s Renu Kapoor said BMC’s apathy was shocking.

His job is not restricted to just teaching lessons but to know and support students in all possible ways. It was this realization that prompted K C Rajan , a high school teacher near Kayaralam in Kannur ’s Mayyil panchayat, to do something meaningful for his students.

Ahead of his retirement next month, he gave five cents of land each to four homeless students. During his 35-year teaching career, Rajan had witnessed many students and their miseries. Some of them were homeless, said Rajan, who works at Puzhathi GHSS in the suburbs of Kannur town.

“I recently traced the background of a Class VIII student, who was frequently absent in class. When I enquired the reason, I came to know that she did not have a house and her family led a miserable life,” he said. He thought of providing land to this student. After a consultation with his family, he decided to give five cents each to four students who were identified with the help of his family, including his wife E K Rethi.

One beneficiary is the girl from Puzhathi, while the others are from Mayyil. The identity of beneficiaries won’t be revealed. Our help should not make them feel they are inferior and so I thought we should not disclose their identities now, he said. However, title deeds would be formally handed over to their families at a function at Orappadi on February 24 by former chief minister Oommen Chandy. MP K Sudhakaran will hand over the first installment of financial assistance.

The five-cent plots, with 3m road were given from the share of his parental property and the registration was completed on Thursday. Rajan is an active leader of Kerala Pradesh School Teachers’ Association, a pro-Congress association of teachers. KPSTA has offered them aid to build houses. The plan is to give Rs 1 lakh each to the students and secure financial assistance under government schemes like Life Mission, Rajan said.

KOCHI: The high court on Thursday ordered for stopping of talks being held between protesting employees of Muthoot Finance and its management in view of the attacks on employees at several places across the state. The court terms the attacks as ‘goondaism’.

Ordering the halting of talks being held following the court’s directive, Justice A Muhamed Mustaque said the attacks allegedly carried out by supporters of the employees on strike on other employees while the talks are going on amounts to arrogance. The court cannot countenance talks and attacks going on at the same time, the judge said.

The court is considering petitions filed by the management and employees willing to work seeking police protection. On Thursday, counsel representing the management and the willing employees cited attacks that occurred at Kochi , Kottayam, and Kattappana.

Following this, the court said the acts allegedly committed by the union equals to ‘goondaism’. The protesters are crossing all limits and innocent employees, including women, are being attacked on the streets.

Further, the court asked the state government what action was being taken against the protesters following the attacks. The government replied that cases have been registered. The court has scheduled a hearing after 10 days.

LUCKNOW: Governor Anandiben Patel ’s 50-minute speech at the opening of Uttar Pradesh government’s budget session on Thursday anchored on the commitment to usher in ‘Ramrajya’, amid mild slogan-shouting and waving of placards demanding withdrawal of the new citizenship law and against police high-handedness during the protests in many parts of the state .

In her uninterrupted speech, the governor highlighted the plans, programmes and achievements of the Yogi government, saying that her government was committed to usher in ‘Ramrajya’ in the state for peace, progress and welfare of all. The governor also read out couplets from the Ramayana, stressing that her government was dedicated for the welfare of the poor and weaker sections also.

Unlike past occasions, when the governor’s address was often interrupted by the Opposition, mainly the Samajwadi Party throwing paper balls and missiles towards the chair, on Thursday no such scenes were witnessed. Though the Opposition did jump into the Well of the House carrying placards, but did not try to force its way towards the chair.

The governor used facts and figures to justify how her government had brought law and order under control, assisted farmers financially, introduced the police commissioner system and built new roads and expressways. The speech of the governor, which is prepared by the state government and sent to the Raj Bhawan for the governor to read out before the joint session, sounded a compilation of the plans and programmes of almost all the state government departments.

The governor, while highlighting a network of expressways in the state, said that the process for construction of the 667-km-long Ganga Expressway has also started.

The governor said that the state government has also set up 218 POCSO courts for speedy disposal of criminal cases and to ensure justice to the girl child.

“Keeping in view the target of 5.1% growth in the agriculture sector under the agriculture policy, there is a goal of producing 641.74 lakh metric tonne of foodgrains in the state in FY21,” she said.

The state government had at a recently concluded DefExpo 2020 signed MoUs of Rs50,000crore with various companies, said Anandiben.

KOCHI: The high court on Thursday ordered for stopping of talks being held between protesting employees of Muthoot Finance and its management in view of the attacks on employees at several places across the state. The court terms the attacks as ‘goondaism’.

Ordering the halting of talks being held following the court’s directive, Justice A Muhamed Mustaque said the attacks allegedly carried out by supporters of the employees on strike on other employees while the talks are going on amounts to arrogance. The court cannot countenance talks and attacks going on at the same time, the judge said.

The court is considering petitions filed by the management and employees willing to work seeking police protection. On Thursday, counsel representing the management and the willing employees cited attacks that occurred at Kochi , Kottayam, and Kattappana.

Following this, the court said the acts allegedly committed by the union equals to ‘goondaism’. The protesters are crossing all limits and innocent employees, including women, are being attacked on the streets.

444,['14/02/2020'],Pondicherry University student council’s strike against fee hike enters day 8,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Representative image

PUDUCHERRY: The fee revision committee of Pondicherry University (PU), which convened under the chairmanship of dean (management) K Chandrasekhara Raoon on Thursday could not resolve the impasse between the students’ council and the administration over the hike in fees of all programmes from academic year 2019-20.

The administration came forward for a partial rollback of the hike in fees for some programmes but the council was firm in its stance for a complete rollback of hike in fees for all the programmes. The committee will convene again on Monday to continue the talks.

Dean (physical, chemical and applied sciences) M S Pandian, dean (law) Mohanan Bhaskaran Pillai, professor and head (management studies) Chitra Sivasubramanian and finance officer (in-charge) Amaresh Samantaraya are the members of the committee, while the council is represented by its president Parichay Yadav and joint secretary Kuriakose.

The council launched an indefinite strike from February 6 demanding that the administration revoke the fee hike and extend free transportation for day scholars. The council said the university announced an exorbitant hike in fees for all programmes arbitrarily.

Yadav said the university hiked the total fees of all courses from the academic year 2019-20 by 88%, when compared to the total fees of all courses in 2018-19. He said the university hiked the fees per annum for MCA programme by 225%, MSc and MTech programmes by 182%, MBA by 124%, PhD programmes by 56% and five-year integrated programmes by 51% from the academic year 2019-20.

Meanwhile, communist leader and Rajya Sabha MP T K Rangarajan and Villupuram MP D Ravikumar wrote to Pondicherry University vice-chancellor Gurmeet Singh urging him to revoke the hike in fees. Rangarajan said at a time when the economy is slowing down and purchasing power of the common man is in a critical stage, the hike in fees will be ‘unbearable’ for the students and parents.

He said revoking the increase will go a long way in helping the students pursue higher education. “I would like to request you to call the students’ council and the stakeholders in this issue for a calm and meaningful discussion with a view to settling the matter,” he said.

Ravikumar termed the hike ‘atrocious’ and said the increase will hamper the dreams of rural and economically backward students. He said the hike has created outrage among students and disturbed tranquility in the campus.

“Nobody can accept the 225% hike in fees for computer science courses. You have increased about Rs 10,000 for MA, MCom and MSW programmes too. This is atrocious and will hamper the dreams of rural and economically backward students,” he said in the letter to Gurmeet Singh.

Costly affair: Road cutting done on the Kankanady Junction Road to Koti Chennayya Circle

MANGALURU: The concretisation of the Kankanady Junction Road (Father Muller Hospital) to Koti Chennayya Circle (Nandigudda) was taken up at a cost of Rs 4.5 crore. Locals are fuming as road cutting works have become the order of the day, even after concretisation. The Mangaluru City Corporation had promised to develop this road into a model one.

An RTI petition by A Rajaram, a senior citizen , revealed that the MCC, after the concretisation of the road, has spent Rs 12.8 lakh for road cutting at 20 places on this stretch. Rajaram told TOI, “After I received the RTI reply in November last year, I have noticed the road cutting has taken place in three more places with six holes. So much money is being wasted due to lack of planning by engineers. This is happening on a road that is just 1.4km in length. Frequent cutting will have an impact on the strength of the road, and the wear and tear on vehicles will be high. Before starting concretisation of any road, it is important to shift the utilities like electricity, water pipelines and underground drainage, which has not happened. So, whenever there is a leak, road cutting is being undertaken. I don’t think this practice of road cutting is followed anywhere else in India,” he said.

Currently road cutting works are in progress at three places. When contacted, an official from the engineering section of the MCC, said, the main water supply line passes through the centre of this road. When the road was concretised, the water pipeline was not shifted due to a lack of funds. Since the pipeline is old, leaks are bound to develop, and the only solution is to repair the same.”

In 2013, environmental activists had opposed cutting down of trees for road widening on this stretch, and had launched an online campaign called, ‘Save the last boulevard of Mangaluru’.

Week to go for UP Board exam

Lucknow: With less than a week left for the UP Secondary Education Board examinations, the state secondary education department on Thursday launched an exclusive twitter handle dedicated to the exams.

UP Board examinations will begin on February 18. A total of 56.1 lakh candidates have registered for the exams – 30.2 lakh in class X and 25.9 lakh in class XII.

The twitter handle, @upboardexam2020, launched by deputy chief minister and secondary education minister Dinesh Sharma, is an attempt to put an end to the copying menace with the help of technological advancement. “By launching the twitter handle, we have brought all the stakeholders – officials, teachers, students, and parents – under one platform. Using twitter services, real time monitoring of information related to board exams will be done,” Sharma said.

UP government has also set up a ‘live monitoring’ control room from where officials can keep an eye on any exam center across the state. This year, there are 7,784 centres across the state. The UP Secondary Education Board, which conducts the exam, debarred 433 centres following non-compliance of rules. All examination centres will be equipped with CCTV cameras to ensure cheating-free exams. For the smooth conduct of examinations, chief secretary RK Tiwari has directed all DMs to set up a committee with members from the education and police department.

KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Thursday ordered the state election commission to prepare the electoral roll for local body elections this year on the basis of the electoral roll of last year’s Lok Sabha elections.

A division bench, comprising Chief Justice S Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly, issued the order after considering two appeals filed by Sooppy Narikkatteri and N Venugopal.

The division bench directed that the electoral roll of Lok Sabha elections should be the basis as it has been updated on February 7 this year by adding new voters.

Through the judgment, the court has ruled against the state election commission’s decision to use the electoral roll of the local body elections of 2015 for the polls this year.

The appellants had pointed out that elections to the legislative assembly were held a year after the 2015 polls and Lok Sabha polls were held last year. The electoral roll was updated at the time of the Lok Sabha elections last year. If the local body elections this year are held by making the electoral roll of Lok Sabha elections last year as the basis, only new voters need to be added. Asking the new voters of last year’s Lok Sabha polls to register again for voting in the local body elections this year would cause unnecessary trouble to them. Many of the new voters are students and asking them to appear and participate in the verification process during the time of exams would cause undue hardships. It is not proper to put thousands of voters to trouble for the sake of convenience of a few officials of the election commission, the counsels had contended.

However, the election commission had opposed the argument and had informed the court that it is not practical to conduct local body elections on the basis of the electoral roll for Lok Sabha polls. Elections to the local bodies are held at ward-level whereas Lok Sabha elections were conduct at the polling-booth level. If the electoral roll of Lok Sabha elections is considered as the draft for local body elections, it would lead to mismatches, the election commission had submitted.

The court asked how a voter who had voted during the Lok Sabha polls last year be asked to register again for the local body elections this year when there is no dispute regarding his or her addition to the voters list. The appellants had pointed out that while the electoral roll for local body elections in 2015 had 2.52 crore voters, it had increased to 2.62 crore during the Lok Sabha elections last year. The division bench issued the order to consider the electoral roll of Lok Sabha elections last year as the draft for the electoral roll for local body elections this year after considering these submissions.

Shobha Oza

BHOPAL: State Congress on Thursday said that the Kamal Nath government will fulfil its manifesto promise and get the Bundelkhand Package ‘scam’ probed by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW).

“In the Congress party’s assembly election manifesto, we promised to probe all scams of the previous government and punish those involved. The decision to probe Bundelkhand Package ‘scam’ by the EOW is the Congress government’s commitment to fulfil that promise,” said state PCC media department chairperson Shobha Oza.

Ruling party leaders on Thursday recalled that the former UPA government and with senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s efforts, the Bundelkhand Package was given in 2009 to develop the backward districts of Bundelkhand region spread over the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh . “The total amount allocated to the Bundelkhand Package was Rs7,226 crore out of which MP received Rs3,860 crore,” state Congress leaders said.

“It was proposed that the massive fund would be used to develop the backward Bundelkhand districts of the state. But the previous BJP government’s faulty policies and corruption swallowed the entire fund. The corruption was exposed during the erstwhile Shivraj Singh Chouhan government’s tenure, but no serious probe was initiated because the whole scam took place under the protection of the regime”, said Oza.

“The scam was such that stones weighing 5 tonnes were shown to have been transported by two-wheelers,” Oza said.

“The registration numbers of vehicles used for transportation of these huge boulders happened to be of scooters and other two-wheelers, not trucks. Obviously, the scam occurred because the former state government had no intention of utilising the Bundelkhand Package. It has become another scam like the Vyapam , e-tender, Simhastha irregularities, illegal mining, sapling plantation and pension scam,” Oza added.

451,['14/02/2020'],Organisational churning in state BJP soon,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Lucknow: The drubbing in the Delhi assembly polls has stirred the UP BJP unit to go in for organisational reshuffle. The state unit will reconstitute its state executive, regional and district level committees — the three key organisational structures that will frame the party’s strategy for the 2022 UP elections.

BJP sources said the party thinktank will soon get into a huddle to reconstitute the state executive committee which currently comprises 16 vice-presidents, 8 general secretaries and 16 secretaries, besides organisational wings including SC/ST morcha, farmers and minority affairs unit.

The decision on organisational churning comes a month after Swatantra Dev Singh was re-elected unopposed as UP BJP chief.

Party sources said the existing state executive, which has a tenure of three years, is likely to undergo major changes in, keeping in mind caste and regional balances. The party is likely to replace some leaders in the state executive committee, who are serving as ministers or chairpersons of some government boards. This, sources said, will be in sync with party’s principle of one functionary-one post. “The proposed changes will be in accordance with the party’s principles and future strategies. We expect the changes to take place by February end,” said a senior BJP leader. He also confirmed that along with the churning in state executive, the party would reconstitute 91-member district level committees, of which 21 are office bearers and 70 are members.

The district and regional level committees will be reconstituted two months after the party elected its new district presidents along with booth and sector level functionaries, who gather ground level feedback about the prevailing political situation in the state.

Visakhapatnam: City’s love birds will be able to celebrate Valentine’s Day without the fear of the moral policing by right-wing organisations as the city police have decided to increase patrolling on Friday.

Speaking to TOI, ACP (east) J Kulasekhar said that precautions are being taken at locations such as parks and beaches in the city and action will be taken if someone tries to moral police or take the law into their own hands. “As part of our precautionary measures, we will deploy police personnel in plain clothes at major parks, beaches, the zoo, Kailasagiri, Kambalakonda eco-tourism park as well as entrances to major hotels,” Kulasekhar added.

Hotels and restaurants in the city are decked up in heart-shaped balloons to welcome in couples on the day of celebrating love.

Police sources said that Vizag has not witnessed violence or attacks of lovers during Valentine’s Day celebrations with the exception of a few incidents in parks and the beaches a couple of years ago. Suspecting that some groups might try to create disturbance and harass those celebrating the day by forcing them to marry or beat them up, the police has appealed to the public to not indulge in public display of affection and inconvenience others.

Meanwhile, leaders and activists of some saffron outfits are making plans to ‘instil fear among the youth for celebrating Valentine’s Day’. Members of the Jana Jagarana Samithi (JJS) led by its state convener, K Vasu have raised voice against V-Day celebrations and asked youngsters to pay homage to jawans who were martyred in a suicide attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district in 2019 instead of celebrating Valentine’s Day.

Other activists present said that the BJP government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to give citizenship on the basis of religion and divide India by forcibly implementing NRC and CAA.

States like Kerala, Telangana, Punjab and Rajasthan have already spoken against NRC, NPR and CAA, said the activists. “Why is the Andhra Pradesh government yet to oppose NPR and NRC?” they asked.

Weavers find a market: Scientist Dr Khadar Vali launches the Sankalpa website

Visakhapatnam: In an effort to promote handloom fabrics and handicrafts, Sankalpa Kalagramam — arts village located in Pedagadi village in Pendurthi mandal recently launched its e-commerce website. Dr Khadar Vali, an independent scientist launched the website.

The Sankalpa art village is aimed at creating a vision of sustainable living. The village works with more than 15 professional weavers and seeks to keep the art of weaving alive. Weavers across the country have been quitting the profession over the last few decades owing to a steep fall in demand.

The Sankalpa art village’s latest collection showcases ‘Aamram’— a kurta designed in the structure of the mango leaf. There are also clothes for infants made with cotton and natural dyes.

Apart from cotton and khadi fabric, showpieces and utilities made with palm tree wood, jewellery made from Ankudu wood are also made by the people working with Sankalpa. Currently, the products are sold among villagers and those around. With the website, the management believes that these products will reach far and wide. Speaking to TOI, Chalapati Rao, director of Sankalpa Kalagramam said, “We have displayed our finest designs made innovatively with natural-dyed handloom to promote sustainable fashion. With this, we aim to provide best quality products to consumers as well as revive many art forms.”

“We hold exhibitions in Hyderabad and Bengaluru to exchange and share ideas. The online platform will help us connect, reach and cater to needs of people from different areas,” added Rao.

The art village is known for its collection of hand-woven and naturally-dyed apparels. The pure ‘pattu’ for making sarees is procured from Chebrol and Pithapuram. After that, the yarn is dyed and woven into cloth. Herbal dyes such as manjista roots, turmeric rhizomes, pomegranate peels, eucalyptus bark and fenugreek seeds are used as natural colouring agents.

Plans are afoot to connect to open schools as well as other educational institutions which offer courses in textile making so that students can learn the art of weaving, natural dyeing and design.

ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court has stayed the recovery notice issued to a Kanpur man accused of destroying public properties during the anti-CAA protest in the city that began on December 19.

Providing an ad-interim protection to the petitioner identified as Mohammad Faizan, the bench of Justice Pankaj Naqvi and Justice Saurabh Shyam Shamshery stayed the notice issued by the additional DM saying tha the Supreme Court was already examining the legality of such orders .

Challenging the recovery notice issued to Faizan, his counsel pleaded that the recovery notice was issued by an ADM whereas the Supreme Court had unequivocally provided that such an order can be issued only by a serving or retried high court judge, or retired district judge as 'claims commissioner'. The bench directed the state government to file a counter-affidavit within a month. The court directed to list this case in the week commencing April 20, 2020 before the appropriate bench for the next hearing.

This will also be subject to the outcome of the proceedings before the SC.

On Tuesday, the Lucknow bench of Allahabad HC had dismissed a similar plea, citing its pendency before the SC.

NEW DELHI: Sanjeev Chawla , wanted in a match-fixing case dating back to 2000, was extradited to India from the UK on Thursday, the first high-profile repatriation in the last 27 years since an extradition treaty between the two countries came into force. He was remanded in Delhi Police custody for 12 days.Chawla was wanted since a probe revealed his alleged nexus with former South African captain Hansie Cronje and other cricketers in fixing matches. Cronje died in a plane crash in 2002.The move is being considered a diplomatic win and big achievement for Indian intelligence and law enforcement agencies that pursued his extradition for five years.A three-member team led by DCP Ram Gopal Naik brought Chawla from London on an AI aircraft which landed at 11.40am at IGI.Chawla was in seat 27B, between two police officers, on the flight. He ate dinner and had casual conversations with the cops through the flight.Police will interrogate him about the conspiracy he allegedly hatched to lure Indian and foreign cricketers into performing as per the requirements of bookies.Chawla had been living in southeast London's Kennington area after fleeing India in 2000, and had been engaged in business there, he has claimed. Chawla is the third to be arrested in the case. Alleged bookie Rajesh Kalra and actor Krishan Kumar were arrested when the scandal broke in 2000. Chawla is being questioned by a special team of the crime branch that will take him to the venue of the match and to Mumbai to track down his contacts and network. Mumbai Police, Delhi Police's special cell and the CBI also are likely to seek custody of Chawla, sources said.""Ever since a chargesheet was filed in 2013, we had been writing to the authorities in London to arrest Chawla and extradite him. The extradition process started in 2013. An application was filed before the Westminster magistrates' court. Chawla had moved court in 2017 and got some relief. The court sought a clarification from the crime branch regarding the nature of the probe, which we provided on January 7, 2019.

466,['14/02/2020'],MMRDA to monetise 25-acre plot in Kurla,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Mother Dairy, shut down few decades back, will be revamped

MUMBAI: Prime 25-acre verdant land in Kurla , which once housed Mother Dairy complex, will be taken over by Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) for commercial exploitation. Officials said MMRDA will monetise the land to fund metro projects. The land is under state government's department of animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries.

About 10,000 sqm of the dairy land (2.5 acres) was recently surrendered to MMRDA for a viaduct and station of the upcoming Metro 2B line.

The dairy, shut down few decades back, will be revived and revamped by MMRDA. A residential building for dairy staff will be built by MMRDA.

The remaining larger portion will be used for real estate development. MMRDA is looking at mixed-used development, comprising residential and commercial areas.

MMRDA commissioner RA Rajeev said it would be premature to say how much the authority will earn from the land, but property experts said it could be worth over Rs 1,000 crore given its location below Santa Cruz-Chembur Link Road and adjoining Kurla terminus.

MMRDA is expecting a floor space index of 4 to develop the land, but the property's proximity to the airport will curb the buildings' height. ""The height restrictions will mean we cannot build over 12 floors,'' said the official.

But the challenge will be large tree cover on the land. There are several hundred trees on the property and any proposal to hack them is likely to raise the heckles of environmentalists. But officials said the proposed development will be around the trees. ""We will ensure these trees are not touched,'' they said.

MMRDA recently invited bids for architectural services for development of the land.

In 2017, Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), executing Metro 3 (Cuffe Parade-Seepz), had also planned to commercially exploit land within the eco-sensitive Aarey Milk colony.

Around 8.6 acres of 81 acres reserved for the metro car shed within Aarey was to be used for ""real estate development''.

MMRC had asked the government for an FSI of 3 for construction inside Aarey. This would have allowed it to build over 15 lakh sq ft worth Rs 2,000 crore.

But when protests started against the metro's encroachment inside Aarey, the plan to commercially exploit the land was dropped.

Kolkata: Trinamool Congress “boycotted” East West Metro’s inauguration on Thursday after the Railways issued the invitation card without naming chief minister Mamata Banerjee.

Protyush Ghosh, Metro Railway’s DGM (general), handed over an invite to Nabanna at 10.10am on Thursday ahead of the 5pm inauguration by Union railway minister Piyush Goyal. The CM was in Durgapur on Thursday for an administrative meeting. The railways claimed that its earlier letter to Nabanna seeking to include the CM’s name in the list of invitees didn’t evoke any response.

Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim said: “The CM, during her tenure as railway minister, had given impetus to this project. E-W Metro was under the state and central urban development departments. Mamata Banerjee brought it under the ambit of railways. It was on her instruction that the state eased the land and other infrastructural bottlenecks to fast-pace the project. Not inviting her is not only discourteous but uncivilised.”

Minister Tapas Ray said: “This is being discourteous.” Tourism minister Gautam Deb added: “We do not expect much courtesies from BJP either.”

Barasat MP Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Bidhannagar MLA and state fire services minister Sujit Bose and Bidhanagar Municipal Corporation chairperson Krishna Chakraborty, who had been invited to the inauguration, decided to give the event a miss. “E-W Metro was the brainchild of Mamata Banerjee during her tenure as railway minister from 2009-11. It was Banerjee who had sanctioned money (for the project) in the railway budget. Now, when the project is being inaugurated, she has not been invited. This is an insult to Banerjee and the people of Bengal,” Dastidar said.

Metro GM Manoj Joshi said” “All procedures were followed in issuing invites.”

A Railway officer said: “The CM’s name cannot be included in any official programme without a formal approval. This is not the same for local MPs, MLAs and civic body chiefs. An officer still went there on Thursday morning to learn that the CM is not in Kolkata.”

State BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said TMC is “paying for its past sins”. “During Left rule, Mamata Banerjee, as railway minister, had not invited then chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on several occasions. So, they (TMC) should be the last to talk about courtesy,” he said.

Union minister Babul Supriyo said: “I want to thank the state government for all the support to get this project moving. I wish the state representatives were here today.”

470,['14/02/2020'],"Coronavirus in Kolkata: 2.7k km away, coronavirus scare keeps foodies from Chinatown","A Tangra local walks past a deserted restaurant on Thursday

KOLKATA: India’s biggest Chinatown , in the east Kolkata district of Tangra, has ended up being an unwitting victim of coronavirus that has already claimed more than 1,300 lives in mainland China.Tangra, the origin of “Tangra-type Chinese food” that now has a pan-India presence, has not had a single coronavirus infection so far (like the rest of Kolkata and Bengal). But the district — home to nearly 40 eateries big and small — has seen a significant dip in footfall despite being 2,700km from the disease’s epicentre in China’s Wuhan, with a large section of foodies suddenly having lost their appetite for Chinese food.Tangra has around 2,500 Chinese-Indians and Kolkata’s other (and older) Chinatown, Tiretta Bazar, has around 2,000. But not a single family may have any direct link with the mainland, as most of the younger generation has emigrated to countries like Canada, Australia, the US and Sweden. That, however, does not seem to have stopped foodies from establishing some link between the disease in China and the Chinese cuisine in Kolkata.The result: a nearly deserted Tangra last weekend (February 7-9), with several restaurants reporting a 50%-60% drop in footfall from usual weekends.China imposed a lockdown in Wuhan on January 23, putting curbs on people entering or exiting the city from where the virus spread. A fortnight later, just when China is planning to ease some curbs to get the workforce back on its feet, an irrational phobia seems to have pushed gastronomes away from the Cantonese, Manchurian, Hunan and Schezwan dishes that can draw up to 10,000 visitors on a busy Saturday.Mathew Chen, owner of Shun Li, a small family-run restaurant located opposite the Chinese Kali Mandir deep in Tangra, said customer count had gone down from 81 on the first Saturday of the month (February 1) to 43 this Saturday (February 8), which resulted in a Rs-17,000 loss for a single day. For larger restaurants, like Big Boss and Kim Ling that are situated closer to Chinatown’s entrance and receive over 1,000 customers on Saturday, the loss was in excess of Rs 4 lakh.“Our business is steady round the year with sales spiking during festive seasons and weekends, particularly between October and February when the weather is pleasant. I cannot recall a single weekend-to-weekend dip in recent years like the one between Febraury 1 and 8,” Chen said.Customers who reach Big Boss after 2 p.m. for lunch or after 8 p.m. for dinner on weekends have to usually wait for a table. But, on February 8, the restaurant went almost empty with only a few tables occupied at peak hours. Manager S Chang said he had read the signs when regular customers started calling to inquire whether they would contract the flu if they came over to dine.“Guests have become curious about what sauces and ingredients are used and from where they are sourced. I assured them that everything was locally sourced but many decided to stay away,” Chang said.Owners of Beijing and Golden Joy, two high-capacity restaurants, acknowledged footfall was down but claimed they were not as badly impacted as some others. “It is a little bit up and down. Kolkata has no connection with this flu. Not a single case has been confirmed in the city. So what is this scare about?” wondered Monica Lieu, owner of Beijing and Kim Ling restaurants in Tangra. “In any case, we do not source anything from China,” Robert Liao of Golden Joy said.Chinese Indian Association president Bean Ching Law said several of his friends, all well-educated, had asked about the threat of contracting the virus if they visited Chinatown.“Chinese-Indians in Tangra have no family ties with mainland China for at least a couple of generations. Only a handful has re-established business ties. Chinese-Indians come over to Tangra during the Chinese New Year from Canada, the US, Australia and Sweden. The fear, therefore, is completely irrational,” Lieu said.Medical opinion supports this view. No virus would survive the Tangra Chinese food cooked at high temperatures on a blazing flame, virologist Amitabha Nandy said. “There can be no justification for not going to Chinatown either because there are Chinese-Indians living there or Chinese food is served,” he said.",kolkata,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-74126763,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-228498,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/2-7k-km-away-ncov-scare-keeps-foodies-from-chinatown/articleshow/74126160.cms

472,['14/02/2020'],Mamata Banerjee: Mamata raps private hosps for Swasthya Sathi refusals,"This story is from February 14, 2020

Durgapur: Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has prescribed penal action against private hospitals that refuse admission to people having Swasthya Sathi health cards.

“A couple of private hospitals enlisted as service providers under Swasthya Sathi are known to have dishonoured health cards. They can’t do this. The hospital industry has to take a humane approach. We are paying Rs 1,200 crore to service providers under health insurance package. District magistrates should charge penalty on these hospitals,” Banerjee said at the administrative meeting in Durgapur on Thursday.

The CM also prescribed the procedure for lodging public complaints. “Whenever an enlisted private hospital denies treatment to a Swasthya Sathi card-holder, he should lodge a general diary at a nearby police station. The inspector-in-charge will take up the complaint with the district magistrate and the chief medical officer of health and take penal action. The government may also cancel the hospital’s licence, if necessary,” she said.

The DM of Paschim Burdwan reported that his office had received 3,285 such refusal complaints through the Swasthya Sathi web portal and mobile app. “We have taken up each complaint with the hospitals and made the service provider treat the patient,” said DM Shashank Sethi. The CM also took stock of grievance redress in the district with special focus on Kanksa block, home to Scheduled Castes.

Thursday was the second day after Bankura that the CM told the state bureaucracy she won’t compromise on public delivery mechanism. Banerjee asked the public works department to speed up construction work on the Durgapur university campus and also in colleges. Unlike BJP in Delhi that focussed on CAA and Shaheen Bagh, Banerjee has taken care to ensure better delivery mechanism on which she wants to build her anti-CAA campaign.

Banerjee’s emphasis on improving public relation and delivery became apparent when she asked the Durgapur mayor to blend his administrative acumen with pressing needs of the public. “I know you have a lot of administrative experience. But you should take inputs from the public as well. There are so many trade licence applications pending. Try to sort it out,” she said. State labour minister Moloy Ghatak was also asked to take a flexible stand to resolve industrial disputes.

473,['14/02/2020'],"CAA Protest in Kolkata: 'Khilafat' rises again, this time against CAA","This story is from February 14, 2020

Kids protest at Park Circus Maidan on Thursday

KOLKATA: The Calcutta Khilafat Committee , which was formed a century ago after the Jallianwala Bagh massacre to unite Hindus and Muslims against the British, is joining Kolkata’s Shaheen Baghs in protesting against the new citizenship law, marking its return to socio-political movement.

In the past few decades, Khilafat — which counts among its members businessmen, doctors, senior police officers and advocates — has kept itself restricted to organising Eid prayers on Red Road and cultural programmes. Its return, thus, marks the willingness of the “Muslim elite”, often accused of staying in an ivory tower, in joining a mass movement.

Those who closely track developments within the community are not attaching much importance to Khilafat joining the anti-CAA protests, as the outfit, now anachronistic, lacks the ability to struggle on the streets. Others, however, see Khilafat as a galvanising force which, by virtue of its legacy, could help bring people from all communities on board.

“Khilafat,” said Sakir Randerian, president of Calcutta Khilafat Committee, “played a crucial role in uniting Hindus and Muslims in the struggle for India’s freedom. It had very close links with Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, C R Das, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. We hope to play the role of a galvanising force once again against the new citizenship law, uniting people from various communities and social strata.”

The first anti-CAA protest by Khilafat includes a silent rally on Saturday from Central Avenue to Park Circus Maidan, where several women have been demonstrating against CAA and NRC for over a month. It then plans to start a dialogue with the intelligentsia of different communities. A legal cell has already been formed.

Khilafat was a pan-Islamist movement, where the Muslims of the then British India allied with the Indian Nationalist Congress against the British. The first-floor office of Khilafat on 8 Zakaria Street, opposite the Nakhoda mosque, was a meeting place of several freedom fighters, including Mahatma Gandhi. The members have preserved a chair and table which Netaji would use whenever he visited.

Calcutta Khilafat Committee also appoints Qari Fazlur Rahman to lead the Eid prayers every year, which is attended by lakhs of people, most of whom come from far-flung areas in the districts. Khilafat plans to use its goodwill in the state’s hinterland to create awareness about CAA and NRC.

“Khilafat has a goodwill in the hinterland and we plan to create awareness about CAA and NRC,” said Mohammad Nurul Haque, a general surgeon associated with several hospitals in the city. “We also plan to engage with society at large to involve people from other communities too, because CAA and NRC impact everybody.” Haque is also the chairman of the committee on the anti-CAA movement. Calcutta Khilafat Committee has only 22 permanent members, many of whom are in the police force, administration and lawyers and doctors.

“We have called in experts to provide legal help,” said Mullick Mohammad Ishaque, an executive member.

Those who track political and social turns within the community in the state closely say Khilafat does not have any significant record of socio-political movement in the recent past. “They have reacted very late to the movement, so it remains to be seen how much trust they can inspire and impact they can make. It is an anachronistic organisation with a lot of nostalgia, but it remains to be seen if they can struggle on the streets,” said political scientist Hasnain Imam.

Kolkata: Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday served a show-cause notice on the vice chancellor of Cooch Behar Panchanan Barma University in north Bengal for “seriously compromising the dignity and position of the chancellor”. The notice came just 24 hours ahead of the university’s third convocation on Friday.

Dhankhar, in his show-cause notice, mentioned that the chancellor being head of the university has not received any notice/intimation for holding of the convocation till date.

The governor invoked his disciplinary powers a day after tweeting dismay over VC holding the convocation keeping chancellor in the dark. “Ministers Partha Chatterjee, Goutam Deb, Rabindranath Ghosh and Binay Krishna Barman are invited to the convocation. Chancellor, who has right to preside, has just no information. Where are we heading,” Dhankhar tweeted.

VC Debkumar Mukhopadhyay said the varsity has done everything according to rules. “I can only say that we intimated all concerned, following government rules,” he said.

The new rules framed by the state government under the West Bengal College & University (Administration & Regulation) Act leave no scope for VCs to communicate directly with the university head, the chancellor. State universities have to propose the convocation date to the higher education department, which takes the final call. Rules provide that the government may intimate the convocation date to the chancellor, marking a shift in the procedure of communication from chancellor to the government.

“The university intimated us about the convocation,” a higher education official said. But he didn’t clarify if the government had kept Raj Bhavan posted on the date.

The notice comes as first step for removal of the VC under Section 9 of the Act. However, it is easy done than said because the governor has to act on the advice of the state government, particularly the higher education minister.

Mukhopadhyay has been told to respond within a fortnight.

Malda: Balurghat District Hospital has come up with a four-bedded ward for transgenders. Transgender activist Jayita Mandal said she sees this as a great victory for people belonging to the third gender. It was opened in the hospital’s ground floor on Tuesday. The health department is planning a similar initiative at Gangarampore sub-divisional hospital as well.

South Dinajpur district alone has more than 500 transgender people, who have been facing acute problems from getting hospitalized.

In many cases, it could not be decided in which ward the trans people would be kept. They also faced resistance from other patients while using the toilet or bed. Many times, to avoid embarrassment, ailing transgenders were released from hospital just by giving medicines.

Mandal, president of Dinajpur Notun Alo Society, said: “We have been fighting for long for our basic rights like treatment, toilet and reservation. Last week, we had a meeting with district legal service authority chief Kusumika De Mitra, who assured to take up our issue with the health department.”

Chief medical officer of health Sukumar Dey said: “In this ward, patients from other gender will not be admitted. Here, the patients would get exactly the same attention of doctors and nurses as in other wards.” He hoped that the number of beds could be increased in the future keeping in mind the demand.

478,['14/02/2020'],shalini kandukuri: The best day of my life was when Shalini said ‘yes’: Nithiin,"Nithiin, known for his lover boy roles in Telugu romcoms, now has a love story of his own. The A..Aa star is all set to tie the knot with long-time girlfriend Shalini Kandukuri , and the actor can’t stop smiling whenever he talks about her. His eyes light up at the very mention of his bride-to-be and he says he can’t wait to spend the rest of his life with her. “There’s nothing filmy about our love story. There was no love at first sight or parents dramatically opposing our union. Nor were there any grand romantic gestures or wooing from either of us,” says Nithiin , adding,“But there is a lot of love and understanding between us. And at the end of the day, that’s all that matters.”A Hyderabad girl, Shalini has a Master’s in Business Management from a UK university and has recently returned to the city. “We’ve known each other for eight years now. We met through common friends and clicked instantly. We started out as friends and it was only much later, around five years ago, that love bloomed between us,” Nithiin reveals. The actor feels that the best part about his relationship with Shalini is the fact that everything happened so organically. “I did not try to woo her. In fact, neither of us tried too hard. Our relationship evolved so naturally that we knew we loved each other and we didn’t really have to say it out aloud to prove a point. We just knew that we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together. It’s a mature relationship built on understanding and trust,” Nithiin shares.Although Nithiin didn’t bring out the filmy, romantic hero in him during the five year-long courtship with Shalini, when it was time to pop the question, he decided to unleash his romantic side. “When it was time to propose to her, I wanted it to be zara hatke. I didn’t want to do the usual drill of going down on one knee and popping the question or shower her with roses. Instead, I decided to stand on one leg and propose to her,” he laughs, adding, “I just wanted to do something different, funny and memorable. I guess it really paid off. not only did it make her laugh, she immediately said, ‘yes’.”Nithiin was admittedly, in a “serious relationship” for five long years as he was always certain that Shalini was ‘the one’ for him. “I don’t believe in casual dating. I think that’s nonsense. From day one, I knew that I want to spend the rest of my life with Shalini. It was never frivolous between us. The only reason it took this long for us to get married is because we were both busy with our respective careers,” says the 36-year-old.Early last year, Nithiin and Shalini decided to tell their parents about their relationship. “We wanted to get married and we decided it was time to tell our families. They were surprised but were happy that we found love. Both families were open-minded and accepted our relationship. Cinema ibbandulu em levu (there were no filmy style oppositions from either party),” the actor shares.what is it about Shalini that makes him smile from ear-to-ear whenever he speaks of her, we ask. “It’s a very long list. Of course, she’s gorgeous. but other than that, I really love her simplicity. She has brought out the best in me in the last few years. She understands me and my profession both, and she treats everyone with equal love and care. She’s also gotten along really well with my family, it’s hard not to fall in love with someone like that,” he says, blushing . The actor proudly shares that Shalini has watched all of his films and even has her own list of favourites. “She loves Ishq, Gunde Jaari Gallanthayyinde and A...Aa. But of course, she likes them all because they’re my films. She has no choice really,” he says, laughing.Nithiin and Shalini will have a pre-wedding function at his Hyderabad residence on February 15, followed by an engagement set for April 15 and a destination wedding in Dubai on April 16. “The wedding will take place in Dubai and the preparations are on. We’re still trying to decide on the theme for the wedding because I’m busy with the shoot of Rang De. But of course, it’ll be special. After the wedding there will be a reception in Hyderabad for all my friends and the film industry. But the wedding will be a close-knit family affair.
