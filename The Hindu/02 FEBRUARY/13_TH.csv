1,2020/02/13,Ahlawat takes two-shot lead,"Aman slips to second; two eagles push Mari Muthu to third

Veer Ahlawat opened up a two-shot lead after the third round of the Tata Steel PGTI Players’ Championship here on Thursday.

The Gurgaon professional returned a card of seven-under 65 for the second straight day — a total of 19-under 197 — at the Eagleton Golf Resort.

Aman Raj (199), who had shared the lead overnight, shot a five-under 67 to slip two strokes behind the leader. Mari Muthu (201), who sank two eagles in his round of 66, was third while Udayan Mane (202) climbed to fourth. Bengaluru’s S. Chikkarangappa (203) moved up four places to fifth.

Aditya’s distinction

Aditya Raj Kumar Chauhan, meanwhile, became the first player on the PGTI to achieve the feat of making consecutive eagles. He closed the day tied-16 at six-under 210.

Ahlawat made three birdies and an eagle on the first 10 holes. Bogeys on the 11th and 14th slowed him down, but the 23-year-old signed off with a hat-trick of birdies on the final three holes.

“I was hitting pretty solid and whatever birdies I made were within 10 feet. My short-iron and wedge shots were quite accurate today. It’s now about driving home the advantage. I will play it hole by hole and not think too far ahead,” he said.

Shubhankar tied 32nd

Shubhankar Sharma produced a round of 72 to occupy the tied 32nd spot.

Top scores (after round three): 197: Veer Ahlawat (67, 65, 65); 199: Aman Raj (65, 67, 67); 201: Mari Muthu (68, 67, 66); 202: Udayan Mane (68, 67, 67); 203: S. Chikkarangappa (67, 69, 67); 204: Gaurav Pratap Singh (70, 64, 70); 205: Khalin Joshi (69, 64, 72).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/lwvdd3/article30813404.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14AHLAWAT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ahlawat-takes-two-shot-lead/article30813405.ece
2,2020/02/13,Abhay defeats Abhishek,"Tanvi eases past Aparajitha

Tamil Nadu’s Abhay Singh has been a talent waiting to explode for a while. This year, the 21-year-old has shown glimpses of his potential and his eagerness to make it to the Indian men’s team.

He won the British Open under-23 title last month and in February, he upset World No. 79 Shawn Delierre in the first round of the Banker’s Hall tournament in Canada before hurting his knee and retiring midway against Christopher Gordon in the next round.

Not sure of taking part in the SRFI-77th senior National squash championships, Abhay, however, recovered in quick time thanks to good work from Indian Squash Academy’s physio Dimple.

Playing an aggressive game from the start, Abhay got the better of Abhishek Agarwal of Maharashtra 11-7, 11-5, 13-11 in the men’s quarterfinals here on Thursday. He will take on top seed Saurav Ghosal in the last-four.

Harinder Pal Singh Sandhu tamed Yash Fadte of Goa 11-7, 11-2, 11-7 in the last- eight and set up a clash with Abhishek Pradhan, the second seed. Abhishek put it across Gaurav Nandrajog of Delhi 11-6, 11-6, 11-6.

A minor upset came when 18-year-old Sanya Vats from Delhi downed the seasoned and higher seeded Urwashi Joshi of Maharashtra 11-5, 9-11, 8-11, 11-8, 11-3 in the women’s quarterfinals.

Sanya will take on the top-seed Joshna Chinappa, who dispatched Sachika Balvani of Maharashtra 11-4, 11-2, 11-4.

Touted as next big hopefuls after Joshna Chinappa and Dipika Pallikal Karthik in the women’s category, Tanvi Khanna and Sunayna Kurvilla made it to the semifinals with relative ease.

The most engrossing semifinal on Friday will be the one between Tanvi and Sunayna.

The results (quarterfinals):

Men: Saurav Ghosal (TN) bt Rutvik Rau (Mah) 11-3, 11-3, 11-1; Abhay Singh (TN) bt Abhishek Agarwal (Mah) 11-7, 11-5, 13-11; Harinder Pal Singh Sandhu (TN) bt Yash Fadte (Goa) 11-7, 11-2, 11-7; Abhishek Pradhan (Mah) bt Gaurav Nandrajog (Del) 11-6, 11-6, 11-6.

Women: Joshana Chinappa (TN) bt Sachika Balvani (Mah) 11-4, 11-2, 11-4; Sanya Vats (Del) bt Urwashi Joshi (Mah) 11-5, 9-11, 8-11, 11-8, 11-3; Tanvi Khanna (Del) bt Aparajitha Balamurukan (TN) 11-5, 11-3, 11-8; Sunayna Kuruvilla (TN) bt Sanika Choudhari (Mah) 11-5, 11-2, 12-10.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/v1q13c/article30812542.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14SQUASH-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/abhay-defeats-abhishek/article30811822.ece
3,2020/02/13,Demand for Bharat Ratna for Dhyan Chand,"The demand for a Bharat Ratna for Major Dhyan Chand has been an ongoing one for several years now. Apart from concerted efforts by various groups including his own family, there have been several instances of individuals seeking the same.

On Thursday, Tarak Kumar Parkar reached the city to pay homage to the hockey legend, demanding the same after a 1,250 km long padyatra from Khargone in Madhya Pradesh.

Parkar, who belongs to Burhanpur, insists that the man who was synonymous with Indian sports from pre-independence era deserves the highest civilian honour in the country.

“I had been planning this since 2010 but Ashok Kumar (Dhyan Chand’s son and World Cup winner) kept asking me to postpone it saying it was not good for my health. But I finally started on December 15th and managed around 50-60km per day to reach here,” Parkar told The Hindu.

The journey took him through Indore, Guna, Shivpuri, Dhyan Chand’s hometown Jhansi, Gwalior, Agra and Mathura before concluding at the National Stadium here.

“I also run an NGO called Yuva Shakti that works to wean youngsters away from drugs and encourages them to get involved in sports. I keep travelling for that. During one such tour in 1978, en route to Nepal, I met Dhyan Chand in Jhansi and stayed with him. The simplicity of such a great man continues to amaze me,” said the former fingerprint expert in the forensic sciences department of MP Police.

Ashok Kumar said a delegation had managed to meet sports minister Kiren Rijiju on January 8 to repeat the request for a Bharat Ratna for Dhyan Chand.

“He was cordial but admitted that the PMO had the final say. Counting him, three other sports ministers (Ajay Maken, Jitendra Singh, Vjay Goel) over years, through both the Congress and BJP governments, have recommended the honour to PMO but there has been no response. It’s disappointing but we know he will always be an inspiration to every Indian. Still, something on record would be good,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/demand-for-bharat-ratna-for-dhyan-chand/article30811289.ece
4,2020/02/13,Amit Panghal is world No.1 in IOC’s Boxing Task Force rankings for Olympic Qualifiers,"“I hope to secure an Olympic spot in the first qualifier itself.”

World silver-medallist Amit Panghal (52kg) has been ranked number one by the IOC’s Boxing Task Force ahead of next month’s Olympic Qualifiers, making him the first Indian pugilist in over a decade to achieve the global top position in his category.

In 2009, Olympic bronze-medallist Vijender Singh did it for the first time after he opened India’s account at the world championships with a bronze in the 75kg division.

The 24-year-old Panghal holds the numero uno position with 420 points, according to the list released by the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) Boxing Task Force, which is in charge of administering the sport right now.

“It is a great feeling and obviously means a lot to me because it will help me in being seeded at the qualifiers. Being world no.1 also gives you a renewed sense of confidence,” Panghal told PTI.

“I hope to secure an Olympic spot in the first qualifier itself,” added the diminutive boxer from Rohtak.

The IOC task force will be conducting the Olympic qualifiers and the main event later this year in Tokyo as the International Boxing Association (AIBA) is currently suspended for alleged financial and administrative mismanagement.

The rankings took into account the last two world championships for both men and women and the continental championships and Games in 2019. The Asian Olympic Qualifiers will be held in Amman, Jordan next month.

Panghal has enjoyed a phenomenal run since 2017, clinching gold medals at the 2018 Commonwealth and Asian Games.

Last year, he became the first Indian to claim a silver medal at the world championships after notching up a gold at the Asian meet.

In the women’s rankings, celebrated six-time world champion M C Mary Kom occupies the fifth spot in the 51kg category. Mary Kom, who won an unprecedented eighth world medal – a bronze – last year, has 225 points. Her rival Nikhat Zareen is ranked 22nd with 75 points.

However, the best-placed Indian among women boxers is Lovlina Borgohain, who holds the third position in the 69kg division. The 22-year-old Borgohain is a two-time world bronze-medallist.

Among other Indians, Asian silver-medallist Kavinder Singh Bisht (57kg) is placed seventh with 190 points, followed by former world bronze-winner Gaurav Bidhuri at 32nd spot.

In the men’s 63kg division, world bronze-winner Manish Kaushik is the best-placed Indian at 12th, followed by four-time Asian-medallist Shiva Thapa at the 36th position.

Veteran Manoj Kumar, a three-time Commonwealth Games podium-finisher, is 71st in the 69kg category, in which Ashish is the highest-positioned Indian at 22nd.

Two-time world and Asian silver-winner Sonia Chahal holds the 10th spot in the women’s 57kg category.

The continental Olympic Qualifiers in Dakar (Africa), Amman (Asia), London, (Europe), Buenos Aires (Americana) and the final world qualifiers in Paris will grant more points to ensure that the winners of these events are guaranteed a seeding the Olympic Games.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/pouf01/article30808164.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AMITPANGHAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/amit-panghal-is-world-no1-in-iocs-boxing-task-force-rankings-for-olympic-qualifiers/article30808166.ece
5,2020/02/13,"Sports Minister announces Khelo India Winter Games in Ladakh, J&K","The Khelo India Ladakh Winter Games will feature an open ice hockey championship, figure skating and speed skating.

The Union Territory of Ladakh will host the inaugural Khelo India Winter Games later this month followed by a similar event in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir in March, Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju announced on Thursday.

The sports ministry will fund both the Khelo India Winter Games — in Ladakh in the third week of February and in Jammu and Kashmir in the first week of March.

The Khelo India Ladakh Winter Games will feature an open ice hockey championship, figure skating and speed skating and the competition will be conducted at block, district and UT levels with an expected participation of about 1700 athletes.

The competitions of the Khelo India J&K Winter Games will be held at Kongdori, Gulmarg in four age categories for both boys and girls.

Athletes in the age categories of 19-21 years, 17-18 years, 15-16 years and 13-14 years can compete in alpine skiing, cross country skiing, snow boarding and snowshoeing.

Around 841 athletes and officials are expected to participate in the Games being organised by J&K Sports Council and Winter Games Association of J&K, with 15 teams from different states and organisations.

Speaking about the decision to organise the Khelo India Winter Games, Mr. Rijiju said, “There is no better means than sport to channelise energy of youth in right direction.”

“We have included disciplines like Ice Hockey, Figure Skating, Speed Skating, that are part of Olympics, and with time we may also be able to produce champions in these disciplines in India.”

“I am happy to announce the initiation of yet another Khelo India Games. This will be the third Khelo India Games in one year, and we plan to organise one for indigenous games as well,” he added.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/s80mi8/article30808041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIRENRIJIJU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/sports-minister-announces-khelo-india-winter-games-in-ladakh-jk/article30808042.ece
6,2020/02/13,Leander Paes walks into the sunset,"Paes, in his farewell year, talks about his plans after hanging up his boots

The pressure of retirement is less in individual sports than ones involving teams. Failures in the farewell years, even if the athlete in question is among the pantheon of all-time greats, can evoke the uncomfortable question of dragging out a career for the greed of personal milestones. With an ageing body, it is difficult to find an answer. Those from individual sport, on the other hand, have the allowance to say goodbye whenever. They usually bid adieu when the body tires or the mind struggles to inspire. For Leander Paes, despite being 46 (well past the usual age of retirement in tennis), the reason is neither.

“I know that with my physicality and mental attitude, I could play for another two or three years if I wanted,” he said on Tuesday, 24 hours before his first match at the Bengaluru Open. He knew it might be his last professional tennis match in India. Last Christmas, he announced on Twitter that 2020 is going to be his farewell year. And, the Bengaluru Open is likely to be his last tournament at home.

“The years that I've played tennis, at the end of every year, I've asked my team to look for new goals. I've asked my team, ‘what are we playing for in the new season?’. The last three or four years, there is really nothing else to play for.”

Fair enough for the winner of an Olympic medal, 18 Grand Slams, and 54 ATP titles to say this. Despite a prolonged dry spell – his last ATP title came in 2015 – Paes has been trying to be in all levels of tournaments, from Challengers to Slams, because he says he enjoys “the lifestyle of tennis.”

He has travelled, trained, and triumphed all over the world. But after three decades, he says, “Being on the professional circuit 35 weeks a year is very hard. I find that there are other things in my life now.”

THE BEST OF PAES Paes is the only Indian tennis player to win an individual medal at the Olympics. He won bronze at the 1996 Games in Atlanta.

He is the first Indian and the only tennis player to have participated in seven Olympic Games. He hopes to extend the record at Tokyo this year.

In 2010, Paes became the second man in history to triumph at Wimbledon in three different decades (matching Rod Laver) when he clinched the mixed doubles title with Cara Black.

With Mahesh Bhupathi, he has won 303 matches, which includes 26 titles (three of which are Grand Slams)

Autobiography. Biopic. Business. Sports education. Paes is already planning his second innings. “This transition takes a lot of time... So, I have spaced it out over the next five years.”

Paes’ partners

Paes recalled the contributions of his father Vece Paes (who was part of the Indian hockey team that won the bronze medal in the 1972 Olympics), his coaches, and managers in making him the player that he is today.

He also thanked his 130-plus doubles and 20-plus mixed doubles partners. “I've been so blessed to have some of the greatest partners anyone can ask for. I don't need to rattle off the names of Navratilova, Hingis, Stepanek and Mahesh.”

“Choosing partners is something that I instinctively know. It comes from the fact that I know my strengths and weaknesses. It is more important to know your weaknesses. And then to find a partner whose strengths make up for your weaknesses, and my strengths make up for his or her weaknesses. I think the compatibility of two partners is very important.”

“Communication is really important. Because when you are playing at Wimbledon, and you are 4-4 in the fifth set, you have to make a split-second decision on where you are serving and how you are planning to cover a certain part of the court.”

One last roar

Paes’ father and his team motivate him to go on. “My team is trying to convince me to continue. My dad is always after the team asking ‘Has he done his gym? Has he done his stretching? Has he done his practice?’ My team is actually motivated for me to play the 2021 season.”

But the 46-year-old is just focused on his ‘one last roar’, as his T-shirt says. “Every time I step on court, I feel like this may be my last match. Whether it was at [the Australian Open in Melbourne], [at Tata Open Maharashtra] in Pune last week or in Bangalore now. It is going to go throughout the year. I feel like playing in the Grand Slams, hopefully in the Olympics [in Tokyo], in the ATP Tour. It is really about going out there and doing the best I can.”

For a boy, who started his career in the early 90s, wanting to emulate his parents in participating at the Olympics (Paes’ mother Jennifer was part of the Indian basketball team in the ‘72 Games), Paes has come a long way. “When I look back at my body of work, it sometimes puts a smile on my face. But… I know it will come to an end one day.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/aauypi/article30812982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGM-LEANDER1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/bengaluru-open-tennis-leander-paes-walks-into-the-sunset/article30812983.ece

8,2020/02/13,Leander lights up an otherwise dark day for Indians,"In singles, the Indian hopefuls — watched by Davis Cup coach Zeeshan Ali — drew a blank

Leander Paes’ fireworks lit up an otherwise dark day for Indians at the $1,62,000 Bengaluru Open ATP Tennis Challenger here on Thursday.

The Indian singles players — Prajnesh Gunneswaran, Sumit Nagal, Saketh Myneni, Sidharth Rawat, Ramkumar Ramanathan and Niki Poonacha — all faltered in their third round matches. It was left to Paes to lend some cheer to the goodly KSLTA crowd, and he did not disappoint.

It would not be an easy quarterfinal outing for Paes and his Australian partner Matthew Ebden, however, as they took on Tata Open Maharashtra champions Christopher Rungkat and Andre Goransson.

With Paes off-colour early in the encounter, Ebden carried the burden to help the pair claim the first set 7-5. Rungkat-Goransson fought back to take the second set without losing a game.

The stage was set for a dramatic super tiebreaker finish. Paes-Ebden did not start well, with Ebden making two unforced errors. A timely volley winner from Paes evoked a rallying cry from the veteran, who was keen to get the crowd involved. The move worked, as a pumped-up Paes then took control, putting away two crisp volleys and one overhead smash.

His serves — right down the ‘T’ — proved to be too hot to handle as well. Rungkat and Goransson, now reeling under pressure, threw in the towel a short while later.

Paes, who entered his first semifinal since the 2019 Hall of Fame Open in Newport (USA), said, “we just beat a pair which won a ATP Tour 250 series event (Maharashtra Open) a few days ago. That’s pretty cool. You have to create your own momentum. There will be doubters through life, but you have to shut the noise out and keep going.”

In singles, the Indian hopefuls — watched by Davis Cup coach Zeeshan Ali — drew a blank. The tournament is now set for a foreign winner for the first time in three editions.

Defending champion Prajnesh went down 6-7 (5), 0-6 to unseeded Benjamin Bonzi. Nagal, Myneni and Ramkumar were similarly outclassed, going down without much of a fight.

Impressive wildcard Poonacha — equipped with a strong serve and powerful groundstrokes — did well to record his best performance in a Challenger event. Poonacha’s fine run came to an end at the hands of third seed and World No. 82 Yuichi Sugita.

The results (Indians unless mentioned):

Singles (third round): Thomas Fabbiano (Ita) bt Saketh Myneni 6-4, 5-7, 6-2; Ilya Ivashka (Blr) bt Ramkumar Ramanathan 7-6(2), 6-1; Blaz Rola (Slo) bt Sumit Nagal 6-3, 6-3; Benjamin Bonzi (Fra) bt Prajnesh Gunneswaran 7-6(5), 6-0; Yuichi Sugita (Jon) bt Niki Poonacha 7-5, 6-3; Julian Ocleppo (Ita) bt Sidharth Rawat 7-5, 6-4.

Doubles (Quarterfinals):

Saketh Myneni & Matt Reid (Aus) bt Cheng-Peng Hsieh (Tpe) & Denys Molchanov (Ukr) 3-6, 6-4, 10-8; Matthew Ebden (Aus) & Leander Paes bt Andre Goransson (Swe) & Christopher Rungkat (Ina) 7-5, 0-6, 10-7; Purav Raja & Ramkumar Ramanathan bt Frederico Ferreira Silva (Por) & Nikola Milojevic (Srb) 6-4, 6-4.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/m082ef/article30812728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14TENNIS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/leander-lights-up-an-otherwise-dark-day-for-indians/article30812297.ece

Hope Hicks, one of President Donald Trump’s most trusted and longest-serving aides, is returning to the White House as his reelection campaign moves into high gear.

“I have worked with Hope for almost six years and can say without hesitation she is one of the most talented and savvy individuals I have come across,” White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.

“She has always impressed me with her quiet confidence, loyalty and expertise, and I am beyond thrilled to welcome Hope back to the White House.”

“There is no one more devoted to implementing President Trump’s agenda than Hope Hicks,” President’s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.

Known for her loyalty and low public profile, Hicks was part of the small inner circle that traversed the country with Trump aboard his private jet as he waged his unlikely campaign for the Republican nomination and then the presidency in 2015 and 2016. She was often described as someone who was especially deft at reading the president’s moods and helping others navigate his instincts.

A top Pakistani court on Thursday suspended corporal punishment by parents, guardians and teachers in Islamabad, the country’s capital.

After hearing a petition filed by musician and rights activist Shehzad Roy, the Islamabad High Court suspended till further notice Section 89 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which allows corporal punishment, the Dawn News reported.

The Section will only be suspended in the Islamabad Capital Territory, the report said.

In his arguments, Mr. Roy said the section permitted violence and force against children, citing a child’s death due to corporal punishment last year in Lahore.

“Punishing children is being considered as essential for improving learning. News of torture and punishment of children has been reported every day in the media,” The Express Tribune reported, quoting the petition.

11,2020/02/13,Narayana Murthy’s son-in-law Rishi Sunak named new Finance Minister of U.K.,"Rishi Sunak will join Home secretary Priti Patel on the top government bench as U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer

Indian-origin politician Rishi Sunak was appointed as the U.K.’s new Finance Minister on Thursday by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a Cabinet reshuffle.

Mr. Sunak, the son-in-law of Infosys Co-founder Narayana Murthy, will join Home secretary Priti Patel on the top government bench as the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Earlier, Pakistani-origin Sajid Javid resigned as Chancellor in a shock move in one of the biggest shakeups since Johnson won a thumping majority in the December 2019 general election.

He is replaced by Mr. Sunak, who was until now Mr. Javid’s junior as the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and seen as a rising star within the Cabinet.

The 39-year-old is set to move into No. 11 Downing Street, next door to the Prime Minister’s Office as he takes charge of the second most important government position as the Finance Minister.

“The Queen has been graciously pleased to approve the appointment of Rt Hon Rishi Sunak as Chancellor of the Exchequer,” Downing Street said in the official announcement.

The MP for Richmond in Yorkshire, married to Murthy’s daughter Akshata, first entered the U.K. Parliament in 2015 and has fast risen up the Conservative Party ranks as a staunch Brexiteer who had back Johnson’s strategy to leave the European Union (EU).

The U.K.-born son of a pharmacist mother and a National Health Service (NHS) general practitioner (GP) father is an Oxford University and Stanford graduate.

“From working in my mum’s tiny chemist shop to my experience building large businesses, I have seen how we should support free enterprise and innovation to ensure Britain has a stronger future,” Mr. Sunak had said during the Brexit referendum.

He co-founded a 1-billion pound global investment firm and specialised in investing in small British businesses before his entry into politics. He strongly believes that small businesses in the U.K. would flourish as a result of Brexit as the vast majority of British businesses (94%) don’t have anything to do with the EU; but they are still subject to all EU law .

12,2020/02/13,"With impeachment over, critics see Trump 'retribution tour'","Democrats and outside analysts are raising red flags that Mr. Trump is exhibiting a post-impeachment thirst for vengeance.

In the week since his acquittal on impeachment charges, a fully emboldened President Donald Trump is demonstrating his determination to assert an iron grip on government, pushing his Justice Department to ease up on a longtime friend while using the levers of presidential powers to exact payback on real and perceived foes.

Mr. Trump has told confidants in recent days that he felt both vindicated and strengthened by his acquittal in the Senate, believing Republicans have rallied around him in unprecedented fashion while voters were turned off by the political process, according to four White House officials and Republicans close to the West Wing who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.

Since then, Mr. Trump and his aides have moved with haste to clear his administration of those he sees as insufficiently loyal, reaching all the way back to the time of former special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Democrats and outside analysts are raising red flags that Mr. Trump is exhibiting a post-impeachment thirst for vengeance that’s gone beyond bending norms and could potentially cause lasting damage to institutions.

Some Republican senators, including Tennessee’s Lamar Alexander, Maine’s Susan Collins and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, said they found Mr. Trump’s effort to pressure Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy inappropriate. But they also expressed hope following his acquittal that Mr. Trump had learned a lesson from the episode.

Ms. Murkowski acknowledged on Wednesday that “there haven’t been very strong indicators this week that he has.”

After Mr. Trump vented on Twitter this week about federal prosecutors recommending up to nine years in federal prison for his confidant Roger Stone, the Justice Department abruptly announced that it would reevaluate the recommended sentence. Justice officials insisted the timing was coincidental; they’d already been planning to pull the recommendation.

Mr. Stone was convicted in November of tampering with a witness and obstructing the House investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to tip the 2016 election. The Justice Department move to back away from the sentencing recommendation prompted the four attorneys who prosecuted Stone to quit the case. One left the Justice Department altogether.

In recent days, the White House has yanked a senior Treasury Department nomination away from a former Justice Department official who supervised the prosecutions of several of Mr. Trump advisers. The administration also fired an EPA official who claims he was ousted because he was deemed too friendly with Democrats.

Mr. Trump even suggested this week that the Pentagon investigate and potentially discipline former White House aide Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who provided damaging testimony about the president in the impeachment inquiry.

That came after White House officials last week told Vindman and his twin brother, also an Army officer who had been detailed to the White House National Security Council, that their services were no longer needed and that they would be reassigned to new duties by the Pentagon. Security then escorted the brothers off White House grounds.

""We are witnessing a crisis in the rule of law in America – unlike one we have ever seen before,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor on Wednesday. Mr. Schumer called for the Justice Department’s independent inspector general to probe the department’s action in the Stone case. Later, House lawmakers announced Attorney General William Barr would come before them next month to answer questions.

Former Justice Department officials struggled to recall a precedent, describing it as norm-shattering turmoil that raises troubling questions about the apparent politicization of an agency meant to function independent of White House sway.

""I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Michael Bromwich, a former federal prosecutor and Justice Department inspector general who has been representing former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe in a criminal investigation before the same U.S. attorney’s office.

Mr. Trump turned testy during an Oval Office appearance when reporters asked him about interfering in the Stone case and whether he learned anything from his impeachment ordeal.

Mr. Trump said he did not order Justice Department officials to change Mr. Stone’s recommended sentence, though he claimed he would have had the “absolute right to do it” if he had wanted to. He used Twitter early Wednesday to congratulate Mr. Barr “for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not even been brought.”

As Democrats called for an investigation, several Republican lawmakers strained to defend Mr. Trump’s actions.

""Certainly the president is entitled his opinion, and there would have been nothing wrong with the president picking up the phone, as I understand it, and talking to Justice,” said Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican. “But I think this is a situation where the tweet was very problematic.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and Mr. Trump confidant, said he agreed the sentencing recommendation was excessive, but didn’t think the president should have tweeted about an ongoing case.

Throughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has shown he doesn’t like to wait for anything, let alone the end of a criminal case. But at moments, he has been willing to show restraint.

Early in his presidency, aides say, it took Mr. Trump an extraordinary measure of restraint to hold back on firing Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the months after he recused himself from the Russia investigation. The president reluctantly heeded the advice of his advisers and Republican allies not to dismiss the former Alabama senator until after the 2018 midterm elections.

But on the night of the election, as Republicans held onto the Senate but lost the House, Mr. Trump turned to those at a campaign party and said, simply, “I’m doing it now.” Sessions was asked to resign the next day.

Similarly, Mr. Trump knew that the likely outcome of his impeachment trial would be acquittal at the hands of the GOP-controlled Senate. Reluctantly, he acquiesced to the advice of his aides and agreed to wait to retaliate for the probe, which he deemed a conspiracy conjured up by Democrats and the so-called Deep State, until the official verdict was reached.

Now, though, Mr. Trump is once again unleashed.

Some of his targets are far out of the public eye. Mr. Trump this week withdrew the nomination of Jessie Liu, a former U.S. attorney who oversaw federal prosecutions in the District of Columbia, for a senior Treasury Department post.

Ms. Liu had supervised the prosecution of several cases inherited from Mueller’s probe into Russian interference into the 2016 election. Among those prosecuted under Liu’s watch were Stone, 2016 deputy campaign chairman Rick Gates and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

Last week, a spokeswoman for former national security adviser John Bolton charged that the White House was “suppressing” the publication of Mr. Bolton’s memoir about his time in the Trump administration with invalid claims that the manuscript includes classified material.

Mr. Bolton, according to excerpts of the manuscript leaked to the media during the Senate impeachment trial, says Mr. Trump told him he was conditioning the release of military aid to Ukraine on whether its government would help investigate Joe Biden and his son.

Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, accused Mr. Trump of being on a “retribution tour” and suggested that Senate Republicans – with the exception of Utah’s Mitt Romney, who voted with Democrats to convict Mr. Trump on the abuse of power count – encouraged the president by turning a blind eye to his conduct.

""It’s pretty clear the president of the United States did learn a lesson – the lesson he can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, he can abuse his office, he’ll never ever be held accountable by this Senate,” Mr. Brown said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ykjr8d/article30810526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/with-impeachment-over-critics-see-trump-retribution-tour/article30810527.ece

A powerful earthquake hit off Japan’s northern coast on Thursday, but there were no reports of serious damage or injuries and no danger of a tsunami, officials said.

Japan’s meteorological agency said the quake measured a preliminary magnitude of 7 and was located far off the northeastern coast of Japan’s northern main island of Hokkaido. It was centered 60 km (100 miles) below the ocean’s surface and east of Etorofu island, a Russian-held island that is also claimed by Japan.

Liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya arrived at the Royal Courts of Justice here on Thursday for the final day of his appeal against being extradited to India, during which the prosecution will conclude its arguments to establish “overwhelming evidence of dishonesty on the part of the former Kingfisher Airlines boss.

Mallya, 64, who is wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to ₹9,000 crore in unpaid bank loans, said he felt “good” as he entered the court.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), appearing in court on behalf of the Indian government, continued to take the High Court through evidence to counter his lawyers’ claims that Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot had fallen into error when she found a prima facie case of fraud and money laundering to answer in the Indian courts against Mallya.

“What they (Kingfisher Airlines) were saying (to the banks) about profitability going forward was knowingly wrong, said CPS barrister Mark Summers as he opened the arguments on Thursday.

Lord Justice Stephen Irwin and Justice Elisabeth Laing, the two-member Bench hearing the appeal, have said they will be handing down their verdict at a later date after considering the very dense case.

Also read | Court allows banks’ plea to utilise Mallya’s assets

Mallya, who remains on bail on an extradition warrant, is not required to attend the hearings but has been in court to observe the proceedings since the three-day appeal opened on Tuesday.

A key defence to disprove a prima facie case of fraud and misrepresentation on his part has revolved around the fact that Kingfisher Airlines was the victim of economic misfortune alongside other Indian airlines.

However, the CPS has argued that there is enough in the 32,000 pages of overall evidence to fulfil the [extradition] treaty obligations that there is a case to answer .

“There is not just a prima facie case but overwhelming evidence of dishonesty and given the volume and depth of evidence the District Judge [Arbuthnot] had before her, the judgment is comprehensive and detailed with the odd error but nothing that impacts the prima facie case, said Summers.

At the start of the appeal, Mallya’s counsel claimed Arbuthnot did not look at all of the evidence because if she had, she would not have fallen into the multiple errors that permeate her judgment.

The High Court must establish if the magistrates’ court had in fact fallen short on a point of law in its verdict in favour of extradition.

Representatives from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) as well as the Indian High Commission in London have been present in court to take notes during the course of the appeal hearing.

Mallya had received permission to appeal against his extradition order signed off by former U.K. Home secretary Sajid Javid last February only on one ground, which challenges the Indian government’s prima facie case against him of fraudulent intentions in acquiring bank loans.

At the end of a year-long extradition trial at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London in December 2018, Judge Arbuthnot had found clear evidence of dispersal and misapplication of the loan funds and accepted a prima facie case of fraud and a conspiracy to launder money against Mallya, as presented by the CPS on behalf of the Indian government.

Mallya remains on bail since his arrest on an extradition warrant in April 2017 involving a bond worth £650,000 and other restrictions on his travel while he contests that ruling.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/25p6xv/article30810284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIJAYMALLYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mallyas-appeal-in-uk-court-against-extradition-to-india-enters-final-day/article30810285.ece
15,2020/02/13,"China’s auto sales plunge in January, deepening market slump","Demand was already weak due to consumer jitters about a tarrif war with Washington and the crisis only worsened after the outbreak of coronavirus

China’s auto sales plunged in January, deepening a painful downturn in the industry’s biggest global market and adding to economic pressures as the country fights a virus outbreak.

Sales of SUVs, sedans and minivans fell 20.2% from a year earlier to 1.6 million, an industry group, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, reported Thursday.

“Enterprises are under huge pressure,” it said in a statement.

Also read | Mobile World Congress 2020 cancelled

The industry was hurt by Beijing’s decision to extend January’s Lunar New Year holiday in order to keep families at home and reduce chances that infection might spread. That kept factories and dealerships closed.

Demand already was weak due to consumer jitters about a tariff war with Washington, slower economic growth and possible job losses. Sales fell 9.6% last year, their second annual decline.

January’s slump looks even worse due to the timing of the holiday, when shops and factories closed for two weeks. This year’s shutdown fell in January, closing factories and dealerships even before the anti-disease controls, while last year’s holiday didn’t start until February.

February sales usually would look stronger because the holiday has ended, but automakers have yet to restart production halfway through the month. The public has been told to avoid crowds, keeping customers away from dealerships.

“In the short run, auto production and sales will be greatly affected,” CAAM said. “The components supply system will be disrupted.”

Losses to Chinese industry due to the most sweeping anti-disease measures ever imposed are expected to be so large that forecasters have cut this year’s economic growth outlook.

The sales slump is a blow to global automakers that are counting on China to drive revenue amid flat demand in the United States and Europe.

Also read | Coronavirus threat: Tata Motors eyes alternative supply chain

China accounts for 27% of global auto production, up from 7% in 2003, according to UBS.

The extended closure of factories also is disrupting the global flow of auto components. China’s share of global exports of auto parts is about 8%, up from 1% in 2003, according to UBS.

The slump is squeezing revenues for global and Chinese auto brands at a time when they are spending billions of dollars to develop electric vehicles under pressure to meet government sales targets.

Sales of electric and gasoline-electric hybrid passenger vehicles tumbled 54.5% in January to 39,000, CAAM said.

China is the biggest market for electrics, accounting for half of global sales, but demand plummeted when Beijing ended multibillion-dollar subsidies in mid-2019.

Forecasters expect demand to rebound later in the year.

“We expect many customers are merely postponing their purchase and that long-term demand growth remains largely unaffected,” Gerwin Ho of Moody’s Investors Service said in a report last week.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8jmduw/article30810172.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAAUTOSALES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinas-auto-sales-plunge-in-january-deepening-market-slump/article30810173.ece
16,2020/02/13,European Union ministers hold emergency talks on COVID-19 virus,"Ministers from the Bloc’s 27 member states gather in Brussels amid the outbreak, which has infected around 60,000 people worldwide.

European Union health ministers were holding an emergency meeting on Thursday on how to prevent the COVID-19 virus from further spreading across Europe.

Ministers from the Bloc’s 27 member states gather in Brussels amid the outbreak, which has infected around 60,000 people worldwide. Mike Ryan, the executive director of the World Health Organization’s emergencies programme, will also join the debate via video link.

More people have now died from COVID-19 than during the SARS outbreak, but no death has been reported in Europe so far.

Less than 50 suspected cases have been registered on the continent but the European Union insists that coordinated action is required to keep these figures low.

COVID-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that’s a close cousin to the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome viruses that have caused outbreaks in the past.

Janez Lenarcic, the commissioner for crisis management, said before the meeting that the risk of COVID-19 further spreading in Europe remains low, but it may increase.”

According to an EU official who wasn’t authorised to speak publicly before the meeting, discussions will focus on health questions, with issues such as travel bans or restrictions, which are up to individual nations in the Bloc, likely to be avoided.

Many countries have implemented travel restrictions on recent visitors to China, which has more than 99% of the world’s reported infections.

The EU has so far organised the repatriation of around 500 of its citizens who were in China.

17,2020/02/13,Japan reports 44 more cases of virus on quarantined ship,"Japan government has decided to allow passengers older than 80 to get off the ship after testing negative for the virus

Japan’s health ministry said on Thursday 44 more people on a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo have tested positive for the virus that causes the new disease known as COVID-19.

The Diamond Princess, which is still carrying about 3,500 passengers and crew members, now has 218 people infected with the virus out of 713 people tested since it entered Yokohama Port on February 3, the largest cluster of infections outside China.

In all, Japan has 247 confirmed cases of the new disease that apparently started in Wuhan, a city in central China, in December.

Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said the government has decided to allow passengers older than 80 to get off the ship after testing negative for the virus. He said results of tests on about 200 eligible passengers are under way, and those with chronic health problems or in cabins without operable windows will be given priority.

Kato said the measure is to reduce health risks for passengers stuck in rooms under difficult conditions. Those who are released will be asked to stay at a designated facility through the end of the quarantine period.

“We are doing our utmost for the health of crew members and passengers who remain on the ship,” Kato told reporters.

Some experts have questioned Japan’s strategy of isolating the passengers and crew in a potentially virus-affected environment on the ship while the disease is already slowly making its way into the country.

“On the ship, infections are getting very dense,” said Shigeru Omi, an infectious disease prevention expert and former regional director for the World Health Organization. “It’s like we are seeing a very condensed version of what could happen in a local community.”

18,2020/02/13,Fear of virus unnerves castaway cruise ship’s Cambodian port,"Cambodia's agreement to accept the ship after it was turned back from Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand was welcomed by the World Health Organization - rare foreign praise for a country more often accused of human rights abuses.

Cambodians voiced unease on Thursday at the arrival of a cruise ship that has been turned away by five countries in fear of the new coronavirus - despite having no suspected cases onboard.

In fact, the port of Sihanoukville, a major Chinese gambling centre where some 1,455 passengers from the MS Westerdam were due to disembark after two weeks at sea is the only place in Cambodia to have recorded a case of the virus so far.

“Don't they understand the wellbeing of people in Sihanoukville?” asked food vendor Siv Muoy. “Even though they said there is no infection, we are still worried because five countries rejected the ship.”

The enforced wandering of a ship full of people who aren't suspected to have the virus has highlighted the level of fear in the region over the new form of flu that has killed more than 1,300 people, almost all of them in China.

Cambodia's agreement to accept the ship after it was turned back from Japan, Taiwan, Guam, the Philippines and Thailand was welcomed by the World Health Organization - rare foreign praise for a country more often accused of human rights abuses.

“I dont understand why the government allowed this ship to dock,” complained 32-year-old Sihanoukville taxi driver Siek Pros.

Preah Sihanouk governor Kuoch Chamroeun declined to comment when asked about the concerns of people in Sihanoukville.

Cambodian authorities are due to carry out health checks for the presence of the coronavirus before passengers are allowed to leave the Westerdam. The ship also has 802 crew.

Buses will take passengers to Sihanoukville's international airport as the next step on their homeward journeys.

It is unclear how much time they will get to spend in Sihanoukville.

“Imagine the relief you'd feel upon hearing that you're finally going to be allowed to set foot on land after weeks at sea...then imagine the feeling when you disembark at the Sihanoukville port and see the land in question,” tweeted Lina Goldberg, author of Move to Cambodia.

Sihanoukville, which has Cambodias only deep-water port, was carved out of the jungle in the 1960s and named after former King Norodom Sihanouk.

Once a playground for Cambodia's elite, it fell on hard times during the Khmer Rouge genocide and conflicts of the 1970s and 1980s before becoming a tranquil - if somewhat down-at-heel - stop for backpackers and other Westerners.

In recent years it has been transformed. Dozens of towering hotels and casinos sprang up with Chinese investment until a ban on online gambling last year led to an exodus of tens of thousands of Chinese. Many building sites were abandoned.

Provincial authorities reported last year that more than 90 percent of businesses in the city were Chinese owned.

The first case of the coronavirus in Cambodia was discovered a Sihanoukville. The patient, a 60-year-old Chinese man from the epicentre of the virus in Wuhan, made a full recovery.

Passengers on board the Westerdam have been subjected to regular health checks, according to Holland America, the ship operator and a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp.

Stoking fears in countries on the ship's route has been the quarantine in Japan of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, also managed by a unit of Carnival Corp.

19,2020/02/13,Hong Kong protest: China replaces top officials,"Zhang's removal follows Beijing's move in January to replace the head of its Hong Kong liaison office

China has replaced the head of its office overseeing matters in Hong Kong, making him the most senior Beijing-appointed official to lose his job in the wake of sometimes-violent anti-government protests in the Chinese-controlled territory.

China's Human Resources Ministry announced on Thursday that Zhang Xiaoming would be removed as director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO), to be replaced by Xia Baolong, a 67-year-old vice chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).

Hong Kong has been roiled by more than seven months of protests over an extradition bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial.

Zhang's removal follows Beijing's move in January to replace the head of its Hong Kong liaison office. He will remain with the HKMAO as deputy director in charge of daily operations, the ministry said.

Xia served as Chinese President Xi Jinping's deputy when Xi was Communist Party secretary of Zhejiang province from 2003 to 2007. “Xi now has his proteges in place over Hong Kong for the first time,” said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a professor of political science at the Hong Kong Baptist University. “While that may give Hong Kong 'face', it is certainly going to put Hong Kong under more political pressure.”

A campaign in 2015 to tear down underground churches in Zhejiang gave Xia a reputation as a hard-liner. “Xia is not a moderate and he has shown himself to be a zealous servant of Xi Jinping. We can expect that to continue,” Cabestan said.

Zhang had backed the controversial extradition bill, telling a visiting Hong Kong delegation how urgent it was that Hong Kong pass the measure, Reuters reported in December. The bill was scrapped after mass demonstrations, and the protests evolved into calls for greater democracy, posing the gravest popular challenge to Xi since he came to power.

Beijing also said on Thursday that it had appointed as deputy directors of the HKMAO Luo Huining, who became the new liaison office head in January, and Fu Ziying, the director of the Macau liaison office.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eke2x6/article30808194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAHONGKONG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hong-kong-protest-china-replaces-top-officials/article30808196.ece
20,2020/02/13,Group of Kashmiri Pandits in U.S. hails PM Modi’s remarks on community in Parliament,"The Global Kashmiri Pandits Diaspora hailed Prime Minister Modi for his “historic statement” where he spoke about the pain of the Kashmiri Pandits who had to leave the valley due to militancy.

A group of Kashmiri Pandits in the U.S. has welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks in Parliament that Kashmir’s identity was buried when the exodus of the community began in 1990, saying this recognition is a step towards their rehabilitation and justice.

The Global Kashmiri Pandits Diaspora hailed Prime Minister Modi for his “historic statement” where he spoke about the pain of the Kashmiri Pandits who had to leave the valley due to militancy.

Describing Jammu and Kashmir as the crown jewel of India, Mr. Modi, while replying to a debate on Motion of Thanks to the President’s Address in Lok Sabha on February 6, said that on the dark night of January 19, 1990, Kashmir’s identity had been buried.

The diaspora group said that January 19 is marked by the Kashmiri Pandits worldwide as the ‘exodus day’ when the entire population of the community was forced to flee, almost overnight, their homeland of generations following a “targeted campaign of murders, rapes, destruction of properties and ethnic extermination“.

“Recognition of the exodus day in the Indian Parliament is seen by the community as a step towards restoration of justice and rehabilitation that has been the community’s demand for over three decades now,” the group said in a statement.

Mr. Modi had also said that no one can side with the statements of three detained chief ministers of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir who had said that abrogation of provisions of Article 370 will separate Kashmir from India.

The Prime Minister said statements made by former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti, Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah on the abrogation of provisions of Article 370 are not acceptable.

“Who made Kashmir only about land grabbing? Who made Kashmir’s identity only about bombs and guns? Can anyone forget that dark night of January? In reality, Kashmiri identity is closely linked with harmony,” Mr. Modi had said in the Lok Sabha.

The diaspora organisation said that there is “overriding evidence that over the last 30 years the property rights of lakhs of Kashmiri Pandits have been systematically eroded, leading to a genocide and loss to the tune of 35 billion dollars. Land, houses, temples and shrines belonging to the minority Kashmiri Pandit (Hindu) community have been illegally taken over“.

21,2020/02/13,U.S. admiral says Indo-Pacific is standing up against China,"China has scoffed at what it calls U.S. interference in the Asia-Pacific region and has denied linking aid to politics.

Countries in the Indo-Pacific region are beginning to take a stand against Chinese attempts to manipulate them through debt-trap diplomacy, coercion and bullying, a senior U.S. naval commander said Thursday.

Adm. Philip S. Davidson, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, told a foreign policy think-tank in Sydney that all nations in the region were involved in a strategic competition “between a Beijing-centric order and a free and open Indo-Pacific.”

Countries that established closer ties to China in expectation of economic growth and infrastructure development “often find themselves worse off in the end,” Adm. Davidson said.

""Through excessive territorial claims, debt-trap diplomacy, violations of international agreements, theft of intellectual property, military intimidation and outright corruption, the Communist Party of China seeks to control the flow of trade, finance, communications, politics and a way of life throughout the Indo-Pacific,” Adm. Davison said.

""The Communist Party of China uses its economic advantages to force other governments to reverse positions toward agreements that benefit China,” he added.

China has scoffed at what it calls U.S. interference in the Asia-Pacific region and has denied linking aid to politics.

According to Adm. Davidson, more countries were now asking the United States for advice on dealing with China than they did five years ago.

""I am optimistic that the region is now waking up to that aggressive behavior, but more importantly, beginning to take a stand against it,” Adm. Davidson said.

""Beijing has shown a willingness to intervene in free markets and to hurt Australian companies simply because the Australian government has exercised its sovereign right to protect its national security,” Davidson said.

""It speaks extraordinarily ill of China and serves as a warning to all nations of the kind of economic retribution they take when they dislike another nation’s diplomatic or security response,” he said.

Adm. Davidson said Australia was rightly concerned that China could potentially use its growing influence in the South Pacific to build a military base there.

""Beijing’s approach is pernicious. The party uses coercion, influence operations and military and diplomatic threats to bully other states to accommodate the Communist Party of China’s interests,” Adm. Davidson said.

""These actions often directly threaten the sovereignty of other nations and undermine regional stability,” he added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wpz78n/article30807912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIAUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-admiral-says-indo-pacific-is-standing-up-against-china/article30807913.ece
22,2020/02/13,WHO extends emergency status of Ebola in DR Congo,"The recent outbreak was first identified in August 2018 and has since killed more than 2,300 people in eastern DR Congo -- an area where several militia groups are operating

The UN health agency on Wednesday said it was extending its global emergency designation for the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo but said the sharp decline in cases was ""extremely positive"".

The recent outbreak was first identified in August 2018 and has since killed more than 2,300 people in eastern DR Congo -- an area where several militia groups are operating.

""As long as there is a single case of Ebola in an area as insecure and unstable as eastern DRC, the potential remains for a much larger epidemic,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva.

The WHO, however, said it was downgrading the national and regional risk of the disease from very high to high, while it kept the global risk at low.

Mr. Tedros also voiced hope that the emergency could be lifted within the next three months on the advice of the WHO's Emergency Committee of international experts.

The World Health Organization last July declared it a ""public health emergency of international concern"" -- a designation that gives the WHO greater powers to restrict travel and boost funding.

Mr. Tedros, who will be travelling to DRC on Thursday to meet President Felix Tshisekedi, on Tuesday said only three cases had been reported in the past week.

But for the epidemic to be declared over, there have to be no new cases reported for 42 days -- double the incubation period.

The health emergency designation last year came a few days after a patient was diagnosed with the virus in the provincial capital Goma -- the first case in a major urban hub.

More than a month before that, the WHO reported that the virus had spread to Uganda for the first time.

The Ebola virus is passed on by contact with the blood, body fluids, secretions or organs of an infected or recently deceased person.

The death rate is typically high, ranging up to 90 percent in some outbreaks, according to the WHO.

This is the second worst outbreak of the disease since 2014 when it killed about 11,000 people -- mostly in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Efforts to contain the current outbreak have been hindered by attacks on health workers and conflicts in the east.

The WHO said in November it had moved 49 staff out of the Beni region in eastern DRC because of the insecurity.

23,2020/02/13,"Kobe Bryant, Gianna Bryant laid to rest","Citing Kobe Bryant's death certificate, Los Angeles Fox affiliate KTTV reported the remains of the former Lakers star and his daughter were transferred to Pacific View Memorial Park and Mortuary in Corona del Mar. Kobe and Gianna were laid to rest in a private ceremony there last Friday.

Kobe, Gianna Bryant laid to rest Reuters Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna were buried in a private funeral service in Southern California last week, multiple outlets reported late Tuesday.

Citing Kobe Bryant's death certificate, Los Angeles Fox affiliate KTTV reported the remains of the former Lakers star and his daughter were transferred to Pacific View Memorial Park and Mortuary in Corona del Mar. Kobe and Gianna were laid to rest in a private ceremony there last Friday.

According to KTTV, the death certificate cited Kobe's cause of death as “blunt trauma” sustained in a “commercial helicopter crash.” It also said his death was “rapid.”

Corona del Mar is a community within Newport Beach, where the Bryant family lives.

Kobe (41), and Gianna (13), were among nine people killed when the helicopter they were in crashed on a hillside in Calabasas, Calif., northwest of Los Angeles, on Jan. 26. Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli (56); his wife, Keri; and their daughter Alyssa (14) -- who played on the same club basketball team as Gianna Bryant -- also were killed. Christina Mauser, a 38-year-old who was the top assistant coach of the Mamba girls basketball team, was also killed in the accident, as were Sarah Chester (45); her daughter Payton Chester (13); and pilot Ara Zobayan (50).

A public memorial service for the Bryants will be held Feb. 24 at Staples Center, beginning at 10 a.m. PT.

While the date -- 2/24 -- conveniently falls between two Lakers' home games, it still could have been chosen symbolically. Gianna -- one of Kobe and Vanessa's four daughters -- wore No. 2 on her basketball jersey while Kobe was No. 24 for part of his 20-year-tenure with the Lakers, and his retired jerseys -- he also wore No. 8 -- hang at Staples Center.

The Los Angeles Times reported that “entry is expected to be severely restricted” at the venue despite Staples Center's capacity of about 20,000.

My brain refuses to accept: wife

Byrant's wife Vanessa on Monday took to Instagram to express her grief saying “my brain refuses to accept that both Kobe and Gigi are gone.”

“It's like I'm trying to process Kobe being gone but my body refuses to accept my Gigi will never come back to me,” she added.

“It feels wrong. Why should I be able to wake up another day when my baby girl isn't being able to have that opportunity?! I'm so mad. She had so much life to live. Then I realize I need to be strong and be here for my 3 daughters.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-sports/wpfr2s/article30807374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28-GEN-KOBEAGMC71JDH54jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kobe-bryant-gianna-bryant-laid-to-rest/article30807372.ece

25,2020/02/13,Rio braces for coronavirus risk during Carnival party,"In the days leading up to Carnival, which falls Feb. 21 to Feb. 26 this year, Rio officials have been setting up a “city contingency plan,” and training health workers in the metropolis of nearly 7 million people how to identify and contain the new threat.

Preparing for Rio de Janeiro's Carnival, when well over 1 million visitors pour into the “Marvelous City” for round-the-clock revelry, is always a daunting task for city officials.

But this year, the job is just a little bit tougher thanks to the new coronavirus that had spread to some 25 countries with the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, China.

In the days leading up to Carnival, which falls Feb. 21 to Feb. 26 this year, Rio officials have been setting up a “city contingency plan,” and training health workers in the metropolis of nearly 7 million people how to identify and contain the new threat.

“It's worrying because there a lot of people moving around and a lot of tourists coming into the country from all parts of the world,” Patricia Guttman, a municipal health official, told Reuters.

Ms. Guttman said the city had freed up some 120 hospital beds that could be used for suspected coronavirus patients.

During Carnival, hundreds of thousands of visitors parade through the sweltering seaside streets of Rio. In practice, many of the celebrations often include a dearth of clothing and a surplus of alcohol, creating a ripe environment for contagious disease.

So far, South America has not had any confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus. Thirty four Brazilians evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, are being held in quarantine at a military base.

On Wednesday, Rio health workers received training on how to identify a potential carrier of the virus. They also practiced quickly applying face masks to potential patients, while themselves slipping into protective plastic suits.

City officials insist they are prepared.

26,2020/02/13,Indian imports to U.S. now less protected against countervailing duties,"USTR takes India off developing country list

The U.S. government has changed an administrative rule making it easier for it to impose countervailing duties (CVDs) on goods from India and certain other countries. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has published a notice amending lists of developing and least-developed countries that are eligible for preferential treatment with respect to CVD investigations.

To harmonize U.S. law with the Word Trade Organization’s (WTO) Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) Agreement, the USTR had, in 1998, come up with lists of countries classified as per their level of development. These lists were used to determine whether they were potentially subject to U.S. countervailing duties. The 1998 rule is now “ obsolete” as per the USTR notice.

Countries not given special consideration have lower levels of protection against a CVD investigation. A CVD investigation must be terminated if the offending subsidy is de minimis (too small to warrant concern) or if import volumes are negligible. The de minimis thresholds and import volume allowance are more relaxed for developing and least-developed countries.

India was, until February 10, on the developing country list and therefore eligible for these more relaxed standards. It has now been taken off of that list. The new lists consist of 36 developing countries and 44 least developed countries.

Differential Treatment

The de minimis standard is usually a subsidy of 1% or less ad valorem and 2% for special cases.

If a country’s goods constitute less than 3% of all imports of that good into the U.S., it meets the ‘negligible import volumes’ standard. For special cases it is 4%.

Imports do not meet the standard, if , individual volumes are less than 3% (special cases: 4%) but the aggregate volume of imports into the U.S. is 7% of all such goods.

The USTR used the following criteria to determine whether a country was eligible for the 2% de minimis standard:

Per capita Gross National Income or GNI share of world trade other factors such as Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) membership or application for membership, EU membership, and Group of Twenty (G20) membership

Why India Was Taken off the Preferential List

India, along with Brazil, Indonesia, Mayalsia, Thailand and Vietnam were taken off the list since they each have at least a 0.5% share of global trade, despite having less than $12,375 GNI (the World Bank threshold separating high income countries from others).

India was taken off the list also because – like Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa – it is part of the G20.

“Given the global economic significance of the G20, and the collective economic weight of its membership (which accounts for large shares of global economic output and trade), G20 membership indicates that a country is developed,” the USTR notice said.

Timing not linked to Trump visit

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly complained about the WTO’s classification of developing countries.

On July 26, he had issued a memorandum to the USTR titled, ‘Reforming Developing-Country Status in the World Trade Organization’. In it, Mr. Trump had asked the USTR to, among other things, “no longer treat as a developing country for the purposes of the WTO any WTO Member that in the USTR’s judgment is improperly declaring itself a developing country,” if the WTO had not changed its approach to flexibilities associated with developing country status within ninety days of the memorandum being issued.

Mr. Trump is due to visit India on February 24 and 25 and the U.S. and India are trying to finalise a trade package before the U.S. President’s arrival. The timing of the USTR announcement is not linked to the visit, a former trade official told The Hindu. “The timing is mostly coincidental and mostly related to dynamics at the WTO on developing country treatment,” the official said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rl835u/article30807241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/YETOP10STORIES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indian-imports-to-us-now-less-protected-against-countervailing-duties/article30807242.ece
27,2020/02/13,Iowa Democratic Party chairman resigns after caucus chaos,"Chairman Troy Price announced his resignation in a letter a week and a half after Iowa’s caucuses.

The chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party resigned on Wednesday after a disastrous caucus process beset by technical glitches led to a dayslong delay in reporting the results, inconsistencies in the numbers and no clear winner.

The embarrassing episode also threatened Iowa’s cherished status as the first voting contest of the presidential primary season.

Chairman Troy Price announced his resignation in a letter a week and a half after Iowa’s caucuses.

""The fact is that Democrats deserved better than what happened on caucus night. As chair of this party, I am deeply sorry for what happened and bear the responsibility for any failures on behalf of the Iowa Democratic Party,” Mr. Price wrote.

""While it is my desire to stay in this role and see this process through to completion, I do believe it is time for the Iowa Democratic Party to begin looking forward, and my presence in my current role makes that more difficult.”

After a breakdown in tallying the results on Feb. 3, it took until Feb. 6 for the state party, which operates the series of roughly 1,700 local meetings statewide, to issue what it said are complete results.

In those figures, released by the party, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg leads Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by two state delegate equivalents out of 2,152 counted. That is a margin of 0.09 percentage points.

Troy Price said it was unable to declare a winner, based on the available information. The results as reported by the Iowa Democratic Party, the AP believes, may not be fully accurate.

Mr. Price had called the delays in reporting results “unacceptable.” He said the party would conduct a “thorough, transparent and independent examination” of what caused the delays. He apologised for the breakdown in the process.

Both Mr. Buttigieg’s and Mr. Sanders’ campaigns requested a partial recanvass of the Iowa results, which the Iowa Democratic Party approved. The party says it expects the recanvass of more than 80 precincts to begin on Sunday and last two days. A recanvass is not a recount, but a check of the vote count against paper records created by caucus leaders to ensure the counts were reported accurately.

The party has said it will not change mistakes in the math and the only opportunity to correct it would be a recount, which would be the candidates’ next option after the recanvass is completed.

Mr. Price was elected to his second term as chairman of the state party in December 2018. In a statement released after his reelection, he noted that he was “incredibly proud” of the success that Iowa Democrats had in the 2018 midterms and looked forward to building on it.

""I cannot wait wait to work with them again on what could very well be one of the most consequential Iowa Caucuses of our time,” he said.

Mr. Price previously was part of several Democratic campaigns in Iowa, including those of former President Barack Obama and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Mr. Price also had served as the party’s executive director and led One Iowa, an LGBT advocacy group.

The Iowa Democratic Party instituted new rules for the 2020 contest that were meant to enhance transparency in the process.

In previous years, the Iowa Democratic Party reported just one number- the number of state delegates won by each candidate. For the first time, the party this year reported two other numbers - who had the most votes at the beginning and at the end of the night.

The additional data is a nod to Mr. Sanders and his supporters, who argued that the previous rules essentially robbed him of victory in his 2016 race against Ms. Clinton. That contest ended in a narrow delegate victory for Ms. Clinton in Iowa.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/r8dp87/article30807216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020IOWACAUCUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iowa-democratic-party-chairman-resigns-after-caucus-chaos/article30807217.ece

The number of fatalities and new cases from China's coronavirus outbreak soared on Thursday, with 242 more deaths and nearly 15,000 extra patients in hard-hit Hubei province as authorities changed their threshold for diagnosis.

At least 1,355 people have now died nationwide and nearly 60,000 have been infected after Hubei's health commission reported the new numbers.In its daily update, Hubei's health commission confirmed another 14,840 new cases in the central province, where the outbreak emerged in December.

The huge jump came as local officials said they were changing the way they diagnose COVID-19 cases.

In a statement, the Hubei health commission said it would now include cases that were ""clinically diagnosed"" in its official toll. This means lung imaging on suspected cases can be considered sufficient to diagnose the virus, rather than the standard nucleic acid tests.

Of the dramatic jump in figures Thursday, it said the new classification accounted for 13,332 of the cases and just over half the new death toll. Hubei health commission said the change would mean patients could get treatment ""as early as possible"" and be ""consistent"" with the classification used in other provinces.

29,2020/02/13,U.N. council endorses 55-point road map to end war in Libya,"The vote on the British-drafted resolution was 14-0, with Russia abstaining even though Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the 12 leaders who agreed to the plan at a conference in Berlin on Jan. 19

The U.N. Security Council endorsed a 55-point road map for ending the war in Libya on February 12 and condemned the recent increase in violence in the oil-rich North African country.

The vote on the British-drafted resolution was 14-0, with Russia abstaining even though Russian President Vladimir Putin was one of the 12 leaders who agreed to the plan at a conference in Berlin on Jan. 19.

Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he abstained because the government has “serious doubts” about whether the resolution can be implemented and end the war between rival governments “in the way we’d like to see it”.

“Events will show us who was right,” he said. “And if the resolution will have a positive impact in resolving the conflict I will be the first to acknowledge I was wrong.”

British Ambassador Karen Pierce countered that “the resolution is viable,” saying all it does “is give concrete expression to the commitments that leaders adopted at Berlin — and that included adoption by President Putin.”

“We all want to see it implemented,” she said.

Libya has been in turmoil since 2011, when a civil war toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, who was later killed.

A weak U.N.-recognised administration that holds the capital of Tripoli and parts of the country’s west is backed by Turkey, which recently sent thousands of soldiers to Libya, and to a lesser degree Qatar and Italy.

On the other side is a rival government in the east that supports self-styled Gen. Khalifa Hifter, whose forces launched an offensive to capture the capital last April and are backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt as well as France and Russia.

The Tripoli authorities and U.S. officials have accused Hifter of relying on hundreds of Russian mercenaries. Sudanese armed groups from the Darfur region recently joined the fighting on both sides, according to a report by U.N. experts.

The resolution demands that all countries refrain from interfering in Libya’s conflict and its internal affairs and observe a U.N. arms embargo, “including by ceasing all support for and withdrawing all armed mercenary personnel”. Russia sought unsuccessfully to change references to growing involvement of mercenaries to “foreign terrorist fighters”.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week that the agreement has been repeatedly violated by continuing arms deliveries to the warring parties and escalating fighting. He called the current offensives by rival forces “a scandal,” saying the commitments “apparently were made without a true intention of respecting them”.

The resolution welcomes last week’s cease-fire talks between Libya’s warring sides in Geneva and calls for their continuation “without further delay in order to agree a permanent cease-fire.” It asks Mr. Guterres to submit his views on conditions for a cease-fire and proposals for effective monitoring of a truce, with a view to making detailed recommendations when a cease-fire is announced.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ozh03l/article30807180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-UNITEDNATIONS-VASSILYNEBENZIA-AP-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-council-endorses-55-point-road-map-to-end-war-in-libya/article30807181.ece
30,2020/02/13,"A look at K.S. Ashoka's 'Dia', the most interesting Kannada film of 2020","Thought it has not received the rapturous response of the director's earlier ‘6-5=2’, this new release starring Pruthvi Amber and Kushi deserves plaudits for its acting and writing

There are times when you wonder where some directors who made a promising debut disappear. Some don’t live up to the flair they exhibited. I kept wondering where K.S. Ashoka was since he made his sensational debut with ‘6-5=2’. An engineer turned director, another who did not want to be confined to a cubicle, Ashok’s film made on a measly budget went on to collect some crores. It was every producer’s dream. The director kept you riveted for 110 minutes with an amalgam of fact, fiction friendship and fiends. There was just a hint of romance, no songs and in a nutshell a film with thrills sans frills. The film was inspired by ‘The Blair Witch Project’ but was not modified to suit local sensibilities as the common excuse goes. Ashok is the typical fanatic turned filmmaker. His family too was harried about his throwing up a job that paid handsomely and regularly for the unknown like his characters entering the forests. He did join a course in script writing first. ‘6-5=2’ is a film that worked purely because of the best form of publicity, ‘word of mouth’.

I remember it was Ramesh Arvind who called from Chennai and asked me to check out the film. The budget or the lack of it was not a deterrent to the quality. A lot of effort did go into the making with plenty of trips to locate the perfect terrain and if the acting looked effortless it was thanks to relentless rehearsals. Success can change things overnight. The unknown face who’d visit celebrities to help release his film was a known name overnight. Producers queued up because he was perceived as a director who could convert lakhs into crores. “I think attaining success is relatively easy. Maintaining it is difficult,” the mild mannered Ashok had told me. Fact is the second film of a successful director is the acid test. The expectations are manifold and simply zeroing in on a suitable story is an arduous task. Ashok did not hastily try and cash in on his overnight success but seems to have taken a tad too long to follow up. It’s seven years since he made his dream debut.

The sensibilities of a director are not only reflected in the plot but also the aesthetics, the sets, attire and the tone of the emotions. It’s a role reversal here. The heroine for a change is smitten at first sight. Traces of this was seen in the terrific ‘Gantu Mute’ recently. The initial sequences are delightful, watching her bottle up her emotions, rehearsing how she would introduce herself but mortified at the prospect. It’s not stalking simply because he seems to be unaware of her existence. A lot of thought has gone into the twists in the plot as well as eschewing clichés.

The film is full of good people tossed around by tumultuous situations not in their control like death and torn apart by conflicting emotions, recognized but not accepted. Its estrangement, even temporary more than togetherness that makes one recognize true emotional equations. The introduction of another character who tries to wean heroine away from her suicidal tendencies and bring some sunshine into her life perks up proceedings. Now nothing in the film is new or path-breaking. It’s the handling of seemingly predictable situations, the characters reactions and the pithy lines they speak that makes it stand out. You can see a lot of thought and deliberation has gone into the writing. The pace that seems leisurely picks up.

Surprisingly, there are no conflicts or showdown which would result in a tame, predictable climax. Now this seems to have put Ashok in a quandary. I’m sure there was a lot of opposition to the way Ashok decided to end the film and most probably by the producer. How people accept the end will decide the films fate at the box-office. They might have shot an acceptable end too just in case! I wish the film does well just to prove that cinema is not an escape from reality but reiteration that life is sometimes stranger.

The acting is first rate, especially Kushi and Pruthvi. Pavithra Lokesh is all grace and poise in a beautifully written role. The background score is pleasant with no songs slowing down the proceedings, something unique in a romantic film. Again, like most of our films, we really don’t know what the character played by Pruthvi does other than lending his shoulder to the shattered heroine. I wish Dia had shown some apprehension before taking a bike ride again especially after her life changing accident.

Also, no effort is made to track down the perpetrator of a fatal collision. The climax in a film is crucial and could have been executed more effectively, not how it happens but the staging. It’s abrupt rather than sudden. 'Dia' is still the most interesting Kannada film released this year. It’s not received the rapturous response that ‘6-5=2’ did, but I hope the good word that an earnestly-made Kannada film is showing spreads fast. Even that is a rarity these days.

31,2020/02/13,"Remembering Kirk Douglas, the last from Hollywood’s ‘Golden Age’","Kirk Douglas, who passed away last week, never compromised on quality and never hesitated to recommend or work with an actor if he thought him or her right for the role

The son of an impoverished immigrant Jewish ragman from Czarist Russia, Kirk Douglas, who has died aged an incredible 103, was once told by interviewer Michael Parkinson that no script writer could invent the story of his eventful life.

Born Issur Danielovitch Demsky, Douglas made a career playing heels with a fierce anti-establishment contempt.

He was the last of a group of titans from Hollywood’s ‘Golden Age’ that included Burt Lancaster, his friend, rival and co-starring partner, Anthony Quinn, Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark and William Holden.

His granite, chiselled good looks with his famous chin dimple and square-jaw threatened to typecast him in the Hollywood Studio system.

Instead, he deployed them and the experiences of a childhood spent in abject poverty to probe the dark recesses of human behaviour, building a gallery of tortured, self-centred, unsavoury, yet always charismatic and irresistible characters in ground-breaking classics such as Champion, Ace in the Hole and The Bad and The Beautiful.

But the hard-bitten toughness in which he was to later specialize was not evident in his debut, where he was cast against type playing an alcoholic weakling opposite strong Barbara Stanwyck in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946).

Yet, the role foreshadowed Douglas’ willingness to push the envelope in a regimented Hollywood Studio system which would crack and strain as America entered the 1950s with the Cold War and McCarthyism in tow.

Still a relative unknown, Douglas’ next role saw him devious in the now-legendary film noir Out of the Past (1947), where he played a ruthless, devious gangster opposite Robert Mitchum’s quintessential anti-hero.

Douglas honed his alpha male persona in Champion (1949), where he played an amoral boxer willing to do anything to climb the greasy pole. The film garnered him his first Oscar nomination and heralded his arrival as a major force in Hollywood.

He then lit up the screen in Billy Wilder’s masterful expose of the media carnival, Ace in the Hole (1951) playing an utterly cynical, self-assured reporter who deliberately prolongs the agony of a man trapped in an Inca tomb, all for the sake of the ‘Big Story’.

The film, with its trenchant study of media ethics, mob psychology and small-town seediness, coupled with Wilder’s direction and Douglas’ performance, has grown in stature over the years.

The same year, Douglas etched another of his complex shades of grey, playing a jaded, hard-bitten detective of a violent disposition in director William Wyler’s police drama Detective Story (1951).

Douglas made two of his finest films with director Vincente Minnelli, playing the diabolical film producer in The Bad and The Beautiful (1952) and bringing Dutch Impressionist Vincent Van Gogh to life in writer Irving Stone’s popular biopic, Lust for Life (1956). He won the Best Actor Oscar nominations for both performances.

In Lust for Life, Douglas shared stormy screen space with his friend Anthony Quinn, who played Paul Gauguin.

Next year, he paired with his buddy Burt Lancaster in John Sturges’ Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, a fictional reprise of the Old West's most famous gun battle. Douglas stole the show with his flamboyantly edgy portrayal of the alcoholic ‘Doc’ Holliday.

That same year, he starred in one of the greatest anti-war films of all time, Paths of Glory, directed by a young Stanley Kubrick. Douglas proved his versatility in the film with his restrained, humane performance as a French Colonel charged with defending his men falsely accused by his conniving superiors of cowardice.

He was locked in another tense duel in the classic Western suspense film, Last Train from Gunhill (1959), in which he squared-off once more with Anthony Quinn.

In 1960, Douglas created the role he would remain most identified across the globe, Spartacus. The film, which he produced, would also leave his most enduring legacy – that of cutting the Gordian Knot of Hollywood blacklist.

A labour of love, Spartacus, based on leftist writer Howard Fast’s novel, recounts the slave revolt against Roman authority circa 70 BCE and its brutal suppression by Marcus Licinius Crassus.

The film exemplified Douglas’s courageous anti-establishment tendencies, after the actor effectively ended the Hollywood blacklist by crediting writer Dalton Trumbo, a member of the ‘Hollywood Ten’ who fell prey to the infamous Communist witch-hunts that blighted America in the 1950s.

In Spartacus, while Douglas played the titular role, he surrounded himself with a dazzling galaxy of actors, with the result that the most delicious performances in the film came from the British trio of Laurence Olivier (magnificently brutal as Crassus), Charles Laughton and Peter Ustinov who walked home with a Supporting Actor Oscar playing the droll slave trader. While being combative, Douglas never compromised on quality and never hesitated to recommend or work with an actor if he thought him or her right for the role.

The late English hellraiser Richard Harris once credited Douglas for having recommended him to director Joshua Logan for the role of King Arthur in Camelot, in spite of the antipathy between himself and Douglas during the filming of the war adventure, The Heroes of Telemark (1965). While Douglas continued to star in major films in the 1960s, they varied in quality and seldom had the pathbreaking spirit of his earlier films.

He joined a strong cast in John Frankenheimer’s exciting, intelligent political thriller Seven Days in May (1964), playing the loyal Colonel who discovers an army coup headed by a charismatic General with Fascistic tendencies, played by Burt Lancaster. Two roles in this period stand as testament to Douglas’ personal qualities: his rebellious, misfit cowboy gallivanting across a modern American landscape of automobiles and helicopters in Lonely Are the Brave (1962) and his stage role as the subversive inmate of the psychiatric ward in author Ken Kesey One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.

The earthy, fiercely individualistic, anti-authoritarian character of Randle P. McMurphy was a role close to Douglas’ heart which he made his own on Broadway. While he desperately wished to reprise the role in the film version, it was Jack Nicholson who ultimately essayed it in the 1975 movie (produced by Douglas’ son, Michael). Like McMurphy, Kirk Douglas with his swaggering, bold manner and fierce sense of independence was the exemplar of the authentic American Rebel.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/kr1a2/article30810958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14bgfkirk-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/remembering-kirk-douglas-the-last-from-hollywoods-golden-age/article30810963.ece

After a couple of shows, we started dating and everything happened at lightening speed. I don’t know who made the first move, but both were eager to be together. There was some resistance from his family because he is a Tamil Brahmin and they had apprehensions about having a daughter-in-law from another State and culture. But everything got sorted out in a week and we were married in 2017. Having an artiste as my partner makes work so easy. It is one of the best things that has happened to me. Work becomes so easy. And there have been no ego clashes till date. The beautiful thing about our relationship is transparency. There are no secrets. If there is an issue, we talk, argue, fight, and that anger or sadness will be vented that way.

Sreekumar: Nine years ago, we met on the sets of Marimayam [sitcom on Mazhavil Manorama], which was like a family. We all worked in a movie as well, Vallatha Pahayan. Later, Sneha and I worked for the first time in a play, Taj Mahal , as the protagonists. When we both realised that we were compatible, we decided to be together. Our families were putting pressure on us to tie the knot and we complied. Otherwise, we would still be moving around like free birds. Acting is both a passion and profession for us. It is easy to understand the nature of each other’s work, which makes our bonding strong. Every day, we are getting to know each other better. Meanwhile, we will soon be acting together in a new play written by Jayaprakash Kuloor.

Aswathy and Srikanth (classical dancers)

Srikanth: I met Aswathy in 1999 as a student of dance. I had come to Kozhikode to conduct a workshop on an invitation from Kalamandalam Saraswathy, my mother-in-law now, and Aswathy came to receive me at the railway station wearing a plain green silk salwar set with a yellow dupatta.

From 2001, we started performing a lot as guru and shishya. Also, Aswathy started accompanying me in nattuvangam for my solo concerts. Musicians from both Kerala and Chennai who accompanied us would say that we make a good pair on stage. Once, my vocalist insisted that I propose to her and try my luck. It so happened that she was also pestered by her college mates who had seen me in 1996 when I accompanied my guru on a SPIC MACAY tour to Providence College, Kozhikode. Aswathy proposed to me and it was a conscious decision. Cupid had a very little role to play. We share ideas, help each other in choreography and understand the strength and weaknesses of each other well. It is magical to see the two energies (male and female) simultaneously on stage.

I can’t really call it a disadvantage, but most of the time we end up talking about dance or dance-related subjects.

Sreekanth: I met her at a dance programme in the capital city 15 years ago. I couldn’t help taking notice of this beautiful girl. When she came down again, we renewed the acquaintance. Later when I went to Delhi to work at the National School of Drama, I realised that her Kathak classes were also on the same campus. So I made it a point to take that route often. It was during a trip to West Asia, organised by a television channel, that we became close friends. Some of our friends encouraged the budding romance. After this trip, I moved to Delhi where I worked and would meet her often.

We both were in two minds about getting married. When I felt that we appreciated each other as artistes and individuals, I suggested marriage. She had a few conditions though — she wouldn’t leave dance, Delhi will be her base and since she moves around with men as part of her profession, I shouldn’t object to it. I was okay with everything. In 2007 we got married, with blessings from our families. It was she who encouraged me to focus on my company in the city, Cameo. We’ve worked out an arrangement as well — we will focus on our respective fields for 20 days a month and rest of the days either she will come to Thiruvanthapuram or I will go to Delhi. Now my house-cum-studio [near Ulloor] has a space where she practices and conducts Kathak classes.

Cultural and social differences have never come in the way of our bonding. We are 3,000 km away from each other and it is through phone calls that we keep it going. What matters is we respect each other’s work.

Padmavathy R: We met during our MBBS days at Calicut Medical College, Kozhikode. We were best friends for a long time. And, in our case, ‘Love is friendship set to music’. We were the lead vocal and the lead pianist in our college rock band ‘Elixir’. Music was the all powerful force behind our romance and marriage.

I find only advantages in being married to my best friend. We can understand each other’s exhaustion and state of minds, accept crazy work hours and sudden dashes to the hospital when on call duty. We are equally hands-on in raising our children and fevers and scraped knees are no big deal. Dealing with not only the ailments but also the emotional baggage of patients often drains one of energy. But coming home to an understanding spouse is a gift by itself. Having witnessed the brevity of life through our profession, it brings a unique perspective to us, both as a couple and as parents. We enjoy simple pleasures and live life as though there is no tomorrow.

Balancing full-time careers alongside children and family obligations is probably the biggest challenge we have faced. Then, we find ourselves conversing in medical jargon over the dining table, being completely oblivious to politics and day-to-day news around the world and finding quality time to spend together as a family.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/aexgbc/article30809793.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TVMVALENTINE,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-love-blossomed-in-work-spaces/article30809801.ece
33,2020/02/13,"This Valentine’s Day, I fell for a toothbrush. Well, almost...","Love is in the air, so either shut the windows or watch brands try to outdo each other, selling everything from antivirus software to toothbrushes in the name of Saint Valentine

I remember it like it was yesterday. Because it was yesterday.

Buried in the flurry of annoying mails about deadlines and credit card approval, there was one with the subject line: ‘To Sweta, my Valentine.’ This was it. My You’ve Got Mail moment.

Heart aflutter, I opened the letter. “Dear Sweta,” it began. “Flavours have been brewing ever since we met. All those times we dined together, still fresh in my mind…. Of course, there have been some questionable times. Times where we haven’t seen each other for days or weeks. But who are we kidding? We both know I’m always on your mind.”

It was signed “Yours truly, Cheese Corn Nuggets.” What is this behaviour, Swiggy? Cat-fishing innocent, if hungry-all-the-time, souls?

On Valentine’s Day, if there is one thing that outshines true love, it is punny, too clever by half digital marketers and PR professionals. Working in the lifestyle department of a newspaper, it is impossible to escape this onslaught of advertising. They would have you believe that love is leaking from the AC vents and spreading into the air of every hotel, restaurant and pub in the city.

While that is to be expected, a cursory glance at online shopping sites will tell you that any brand worth its salt — including toothpastes with salt — is ready to jump on this bandwagon.

Sample this: Electric toothbrushes at half-price to ‘put a smile on your lover’s face’ (not the kind of vibrating instrument I need). An antivirus pop-up ad, offering a Valentine’s Day discount for subscription renewal (not the kind of protection I need).

Love after all, is an all-pervasive feeling. There is nothing that can’t be romantic. Including dietary supplements, as a wellness brand tried to convince me recently. “Gift of Health for him and her, this Valentine’s Day” was their tagline, while selling probiotics for urinary tract health. If that doesn’t get your nether regions all hot and bothered, I don’t know what will. Wait, actually I do — a women’s hygiene brand had the brilliant idea of gifting your partner a pack of tampons, cramp-free patches and sweat-proof clothing.

As a woman, I wholeheartedly approve of this. In fact, every brand should get on this trend. Gift the boys in your life, Lifebuoy. Stain remover Vanish, for when you need to break up with someone right before Valentine’s. And Fair & Lovely, for telling your girlfriend that in four to seven weeks, your mom will finally approve of her.

KitKat is already ahead of the curve, with its recently launched Valentine’s Day Special ‘Left’ and ‘Right’ chocolates. ‘Magic happens when you find the ‘Right’ pack.’ and ‘This Valentine, don’t feel ‘Left’ out.’ are their slogans. I strongly suspect this is to help you reveal your political leanings to your crushes, in an increasingly divisive India. Thank you KitKat, your efforts have not gone unnoticed.

Whatever your leanings and kinks, I hope you do find love this February. Unlike me. Cheese Corn Nuggets and I are going on a break. I might start seeing French Fries again.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/cj827q/article30810469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPvalentine011jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-brands-woo-you-on-valentines-day/article30810470.ece
34,2020/02/13,RBI’s new realty norms credit negative for banks: Moody’s,"They will not address credit issues facing developers, it says

The recent decision of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), to loosen asset quality recognition norms for Indian banks by allowing them to not classify real estate loans as restructured for one year if the project is delayed for reasons beyond the real estate developer’s control, is credit negative for Indian banks, said Moody’s.

“Because it will defer the recognition of such loans from the real estate sector, and by extension, appropriate loss provisioning against them,” it said.

Property developers will have an additional year to address their funding issues before the banks have to classify a loan as restructured.

However, while this will alleviate near-term asset quality risk to the banks from the real estate sector, it will not address the credit issues facing the real estate developers, Moody’s said.

Developers are facing funding challenges because non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs), the key lenders to the sector, are facing funding challenges of their own, it added.

Property sales have also slowed, resulting in a high stock of unsold inventory and tight funding conditions are straining developers’ ability to complete projects, and by extension their solvency.

In India, principal repayment on loan to property developers typically starts two to three years after the loan has been disbursed.

In the interim period, developers are only required to pay interest on the loan.

Under the new guideline, banks can extend the principal repayment period by one year if the project is delayed because of reasons beyond the developer’s control.

The RBI’s revised asset recognition norms will not apply to the NBFIs, who are among the largest lenders to the developers, Moody’s said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rbis-new-realty-norms-credit-negative-for-banks-moodys/article30813231.ece

38,2020/02/13,"BA embarks on a serious overhaul, to get set for another 100 years of flying","British Airways (BA) has embarked on a thorough modification and upgradation drive to equip itself to fly non-stop for the next 100 years.

The airline, that recently concluded its centenary celebrations, is planning to invest £6.5 billion by 2024 to upgrade its existing fleet, acquire newer fuel-efficient airplanes and introduce various services/technologies to enhance customer satisfaction.

Moran Birger, head of sales Asia Pacific & Middle East, told The Hindu that, “We are making these investments directly for our customers. For instance, over £600 million of this investment will be going into seating, bedding, new menus and entertainment alone.”

As per BA’s new year (2020) resolutions, the airline has increased its technology usage. Majority of its fleet would have satellite-supported Wi-Fi facility by end of 2020, he said.

BA is currently trialling autonomous wayfaring robots at Heathrow to help customers navigate through the airport. Some 90,000 passengers at the airport are currently being helped by these robots in terms of lesser time in queues and faster access to check-in, lounges, family zones and restaurants.

“We have deployed these robots at Heathrow on a pilot basis. After few months, based on their performances and passenger feed back we will introduce them in other airports. These AI-driven devices, come with advanced sensors, guide and escort customers to specific zones.’’

On the new fleet, Mr. Birger said, BA was scheduled to take delivery of 20 new aircraft this year, including 787-10s and A350s which are 40% more fuel efficient. The airline would take delivery of 73 new aircraft, including 18 A350s in the next couple of years.

The airline has also introduced several changes in its Club World (Business Class), World Traveller Plus (economy-premium) and World Traveller (economy) cabins, by offering restaurant-style catering and new menus.

To cut cost and minimise wastage, BA is also planning to introduce 3D printing of non-essential aircraft parts like tray tables. This will ensure its flights depart on time and seats don’t go out of service due to minor issues.

As per Mr. Birger, BA has an increased focus on environment protection and energy saving issues. The airline has recently introduced driverless baggage vehicles and Mototok, a small EV that would push back the aircraft to a starting point, to save energy.

BA has also been adding newer lounges and refurbishing the existing ones across several airports starting with Heathrow, Edinburgh, Berlin and JFK.

Finally, the human factor is extremely critical in the airline business, as per the carrier. To enhance customer experience, BA is currently in the process of training an army of its airport hosts worldwide.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/e2j7la/article30813175.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13thBUMoran-Birger-BRITISH-AIRWAYS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ba-embarks-on-a-serious-overhaul-to-get-set-for-another-100-years-of-flying/article30813176.ece

40,2020/02/13,USTR takes India off developing country list,"Amends lists of developing, least-developed countries eligible for preferential treatment with respect to CVD investigation

The U.S. government has changed an administrative rule making it easier for it to impose countervailing duties (CVDs) on goods from India and certain other countries.

The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) has published a notice, amending lists of developing and least-developed countries that are eligible for preferential treatment with respect to CVD investigations.

Country classification

To harmonise U.S. law with the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) Agreement, the USTR had, in 1998, come up with lists of countries classified as per their level of development. These lists were used to determine whether they were potentially subject to U.S. countervailing duties. The 1998 rule is now “obsolete” as per the USTR notice.

Countries not given special consideration have lower levels of protection against a CVD investigation.

A CVD investigation must be terminated if the offending subsidy is de minimis (too small to warrant concern) or if import volumes are negligible.

The de minimis thresholds and import volume allowance are more relaxed for developing and least-developed countries.

India was, until February 10, on the developing country list and therefore eligible for these more relaxed standards. It has now been taken off of that list.

The new lists consist of 36 developing countries and 44 least developed countries.

The de minimis standard is usually a subsidy of 1% or less ad valorem and 2 percent for special cases.

If a country’s goods constitute less than 3% of all imports of that good into the U.S., it meets the ‘negligible import volumes’ standard. For special cases it is 4%. Imports do not meet the standard, if , individual volumes are less than 3% (special cases: 4%) but the aggregate volume of imports into the U.S. is 7% of all such goods.

The USTR used the following criteria to determine whether a country was eligible for the 2% de minimis standard: (1) Per capita Gross National Income or GNI (2) share of world trade (3) other factors such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) membership or application for membership, EU membership, and Group of Twenty (G20) membership.

India, along with Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam were taken off the list since they each have at least a 0.5% share of the global trade, despite having less than $12, 375 GNI (the World Bank threshold separating high income countries from others). India was taken off the list also because — like Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa — it is part of the G20. “Given the global economic significance of the G20, and the collective economic weight of its membership (which accounts for large shares of global economic output and trade), G20 membership indicates that a country is developed,” the USTR notice said.

Not linked to Trump visit

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly complained about the WTO’s classification of developing countries. On July 26, he had issued a memorandum to the USTR titled, ‘Reforming Developing-Country Status in the World Trade Organization’. In it, Mr. Trump had asked the USTR to , among other things, “no longer treat as a developing country for the purposes of the WTO any WTO Member that in the USTR’s judgment is improperly declaring itself a developing country,” if the WTO had not changed its approach to flexibilities associated with developing country status within ninety days of the memorandum being issued.

Mr. Trump is due to visit India on February 24 and 25 and the U.S. and India are trying to finalise a trade package before the U.S. President’s arrival. The timing of the USTR announcement is not linked to the visit, a former trade official told The Hindu.

“The timing is mostly coincidental and mostly related to dynamics at the WTO on developing country treatment,” the official said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/setaei/article30813123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14Talking-businessbw,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ustr-takes-india-off-developing-country-list/article30813126.ece
41,2020/02/13,SEBI devises system to track client securities,"Aims to detect misuse of collateral

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has developed an in-house system to track the movement of client securities that are collected as collateral by brokers.

“SEBI has developed the in-house capabilities to track, online, the movement of client securities collected by the broker as collateral and raise alerts with exchanges if diversion of clients’ securities is noticed,” SEBI said in a release.

“This system is likely to detect the misuse of clients’ securities collected by brokers as collateral or received in pay-out of securities,” the release added, while highlighting the fact that three ‘mismatch reports’ had already been forwarded to the stock exchanges for reconciliation with members.

There had been instances of brokerages using client securities to raise funds for themselves. The most high-profile case was that of Karvy Stock Broking, which has been barred from getting new clients on board.

“In the recent past years, it has been observed that some brokers have misused clients’ securities received as collateral to meet their own settlement obligation or obligations of other clients. Some brokers have also misused clients’ securities by pledging them with banks and NBFCs to raise funds for their own use,” SEBI said.

SEBI has already taken a slew of measures to minimise such misuse, including an early warning mechanism to detect diversion of clients’ funds and securities; restricting the broker from pledging clients’ securities even with the consent of the client; transferring securities to the client account or Client Unpaid Securities Account (CUSA) within 24 hours of payout; and mapping of Unique Client Code with the demat account of the client to detect diversion of payout of securities.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/f0dlly/article30812968.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBUSEBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sebi-devises-system-to-track-client-securities/article30812969.ece
42,2020/02/13,‘Proposed tax regime complicating system’,"Renowned strategist says Budget not convincing to investors on economy revival

While the Union Budget lacks measures to boost the slowing economy, the proposed tax regime has made the system more complicated, said globally-renowned market strategist Chris Wood in the latest edition of his hugely followed Greed & Fear report.

According to him, the Budget has helped neither the mortgage sector nor the automobile segment, where vehicle sales are dipping, and the increase in import tariffs was another negative, which also hinted that the ‘Make in India’ programme has not been successful.

“As for the Budget itself, while the stated intention to remove all deductions in the long run is a positive in terms of a general principle, in this case, the changes have only served to make the tax system more complicated, not less,” stated the newsletter, which is widely circulated among institutional investors.

In the Union Budget announced on February 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a lower tax structure with the condition that the individual will forgo all current available exemptions.

Terming the Budget an ‘anticlimax’, the market strategist said that it lacked measures “which might convince investors that the economic cycle is poised to turn up.”

While referring to the increase in import duties on electronics, electric vehicles and other goods, Mr. Wood said that this was a reminder that the ‘Make in India’ programme introduced in 2014 “has not made much progress.”

“The manufacturing sector’s share of Indian nominal gross value added has declined from 17.1% in FY16 to 15.9% in the year to September 2019, the lowest level since FY71,” the report said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/proposed-tax-regime-complicating-system/article30812889.ece

44,2020/02/13,"Soon, a panel to address fiscal policy issues","To be set up by the Fifteenth Finance Commission, it will present consolidated fiscal debt road map

The Fifteenth Finance Commission will soon set up a panel to address issues related to fiscal policy for both the Centre and the States, and present a road map for the same, Commission’s Chairman N.K. Singh said.

Mr. Singh added the Commission had also constituted a group on defence and internal security, whose mandate will be ‘to examine whether a separate mechanism for funding of defence and internal security ought to be set up, and if so, how such a mechanism could be operationalised.’ This group will be chaired by Mr. Singh with A.N. Jha, Member, Fifteenth Finance Commission as well as Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Secretary, Ministry of Defence and Secretary (Expenditure), Ministry of Finance as members.

On the fiscal committee, the Chairman said, “I proposed to constitute a broad-based committee which will address some of the issues on fiscal policy, particularly in relation to the debt and the deficit of the States as well as the Central government... there is a need to have a fiscal road map that covers the Centre and the State government.”

The panel will be headed by Mr. Singh and have representation from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the Reserve Bank of India, the Ministry of Finance, the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) panel and some of the States.

Robust legal framework

Mr. Singh, however, added that there wasn’t a need for a new legal framework as the FRBM already gives a robust legal framework, “except for the fact the States need to align their own FRBM with the new FRBM enacted by the Union Government with the amendments to the earlier one in 2018. Also, we need to ensure there is strict compliance on the issues of off-Budget borrowing, contingent liabilities...”

He said the principal terms of reference (ToR) of the fiscal committee will enhance the ability of the Finance Commission to address its ToR relating to giving a consolidated fiscal debt road map for the general government.

On Thursday, the Advisory Council to the 15th Finance Commission held its sixth meeting, at which many suggestions were given concerning the GST, he said, adding that generally, it was felt the room for improvement in GST was significant.

“They all realise the future of revenue policy is basically tied to GST. So, quite some time was spent on this. They also wanted a more systematic dialogue between the Finance Commission and the GST Council since we are also very much stakeholders.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/74dxdb/article30812787.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBUNKSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/soon-a-panel-to-address-fiscal-policy-issues/article30812788.ece
45,2020/02/13,"Shell, Reliance win in English High Court against Govt in PMT oil, gas field dispute","The government had sought $3.5 billion in dues from Reliance and Shell-owned BG Exploration & Production India Ltd

In a big win for Shell and its partner Reliance Industries, the English High Court has rejected Indian government’s challenge to the recovery of certain costs in the western offshore Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields they operated.

The government had sought $3.5 billion in dues from Reliance and Shell-owned BG Exploration & Production India Ltd based on an October 2016 partial award of an international arbitration tribunal over the recovery of certain costs from the sale of oil and gas produced from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields.

The two firms had gone to the English High Court against the 2016 partial award.

Sources with direct knowledge of the development said the English High Court had previously directed the tribunal to reconsider certain issues. The tribunal subsequently in 2018 issued another award to uphold the two companies right to recover costs.

This award was challenged by the government. Justice Robin Knowles of the English High Court (EHC) delivered a judgement on February 12 rejecting all of Government of India’s five challenges to the 2018 award, sources said.

When contacted, Reliance declined to comment on the issue.

The government had used the 2016 partial award not just to raise a $3.5 billion demand on Reliance and Shell but also sought to block Reliance’s $15 billion deal with Saudi Aramco on grounds that the company owed money to it.

Reliance and Shell had countered the government petition in the Delhi High Court saying the petition is an abuse of process as no arbitration award has fixed any final liability of dues on the company.

Sources said the Arbitration Tribunal adjudicating disputes under the Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) between BG Exploration & Production India Ltd (Shell) and Reliance with Government of India issued Final Partial Award on October 12, 2016. Parts of the 2016 Award were challenged by the two firms the EHC, and the EHC directed the Arbitration Tribunal to reconsider certain issues.

Arbitration Tribunal reconsidered the issues and on October 1, 2018, gave its Final Partial Award holding that certain costs incurred by two companies were agreed to be cost recoverable by the Government of India.

Government of India challenged the 2018 Award on five issues. The two companies also filed a challenge on one issue that certain costs which Arbitration Tribunal held not be recoverable.

The English court has scheduled a Consequential hearing on February 28, 2020, for issuing further directions in the matter, they said.

Shell and Reliance had previously contended that the tribunal’s 2016 award determined certain issues of principles. Pending determination of all issues before it, appropriately, it did not award any monetary sums. Quantification of amounts, if any, by the tribunal is to be done when all issues have been decided.

Certain parts of the 2016 award were challenged by the two companies before an English court wherein it decided some parts of challenge in favour of them and directed the arbitration tribunal to reconsider those parts of the 2016 award. The tribunal, having reconsidered, issued another partial award in December 2018 which was in favour of the two firms.

While this challenge was pending in the English court, the government unilaterally calculated certain amounts, based upon its interpretation of the 2016 award, which the government alleges are payable by Oil & Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), BG and RIL.

47,2020/02/13,Global beer and spirits maker cuts annual profit growth forecast due to China virus,"The company, which makes 10% of its sales in China, said it could not currently predict the duration and impact of the crisis.

French spirits group Pernod Ricard cut its full-year profit growth outlook for 2019-2020 on Thursday, saying the coronavirus epidemic in China was likely to have a severe impact on its third-quarter performance.

The company, which makes 10% of its sales in China, said it could not currently predict the duration and impact of the crisis, but added it nevertheless remained confident on its overall corporate strategy.

Pernod, the world's second-biggest spirits group behind Diageo, is now targeting an organic rise of between 2% and 4% in profit from recurring operations for the year to June 30, 2019. That compares to a previous forecast for 5%-7% growth.

The group, which makes Martell cognac, issued the warning as it nevertheless posted forecast-beating first-half results, helped by cost cuts and shipments tied to the earlier timing of the Chinese New Year, which started on Jan. 25 this year against Feb. 5 in 2019.

First-half profit from current operations reached 1.788 billion euros ($1.9 billion), an organic rise of 4.3%, above analysts' expectations for a 3% increase.

Sales reached 5.474 billion euros in the six months to Dec. 31, an organic rise of 2.7%, which was also above analysts' expectations for 2.1% growth.

This reflected an 11% rise in revenues in China, driven by double-digit growth in Martell cognac sales in the second quarter.

Asia Pacific accounts for 44% of Pernod Ricard's sales and is a key growth driver for the group.

China is Pernod's second largest market after the United States, accounting for around 10% of sales, and the company has been banking on China's growing middle class and younger generation to further boost sales.

Pernod said that while its strong Chinese New Year shipment programme was being executed, “replenishment after the New Year and on-trade activities were uncertain”.

Its current assumptions were for a gradual recovery in bars and restaurants from March in China and a return to normal in June, and for a recovery in March in store business.

Lost sales in China, which according to credit rating agency Moody's consumes 26% of global alcoholic beverage volumes, and from the Asia travel retail market could cut 2% off Pernod's 2020 sales and 3% from its profit from recurring operations.

Pernod is under pressure from U.S. hedge fund Elliott, which has a 2.5% stake, to improve profit margins and corporate governance.

In February 2019, Pernod vowed to lift its margins and shareholder returns under a three-year strategic plan that Elliott has described as a first small step.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fkjx0v/article30809378.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THPERNODRICARD,https://www.thehindu.com/business/global-beer-and-spirits-maker-cuts-annual-profit-growth-forecast-due-to-china-virus/article30809379.ece
48,2020/02/13,Hong Kong property developers cut retail rents in Feb amid virus battle,"The city's largest property developer by value, Sun Hung Kai Properties, which owns major district malls that host international fashion brands ranging from Coach to Zara , said on Wednesday it would reduce February rent by 30% to 50% for most of its tenants.

Major shopping mall landlords in Hong Kong are offering cuts in February rent by as much as 60% to help tenants ride out the effects of the coronavirus outbreak.

Hong Kong's retail sector, battered by months of often violent anti-government protests, is likely to suffer in the coming months as the outbreak in mainland China has emptied shopping centres and closed down tourist attractions.

Henderson Land said it will cut February rent by 20% to 60% for its small- to medium-size tenants in retail, food and beverage, as well as education businesses following similar moves by its peers.

“Hong Kong's retail and food and beverage businesses have been greatly affected since February due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus outbreak,” Henderson Land said in an emailed statement on Thursday.

The city's largest property developer by value, Sun Hung Kai Properties, which owns major district malls that host international fashion brands ranging from Coach to Zara , said on Wednesday it would reduce February rent by 30% to 50% for most of its tenants.

New World Development, whose tenants include many luxury brands, also said it would reduce the February rent, while MTR Corp, which runs malls on top some of its subway stations, said it would adjust rent for small-medium sized companies.

MTR also said it would launch relief measures for its chain and international brand tenants after collecting their sales data.

Link Real Estate Investment Trust has set up a HK$80 million ($10.30 million) relief scheme for its community malls, including measures like allowing rent payment by instalments, waiving off late payment interest and service charges, granting rent-free periods and reducing rents.

Separately, Sun Hung Kai Properties said home sales and hotel occupancy rates have been affected by the epidemic.

Hong Kong's economy contracted for the first time in a decade in 2019 and the worst yet to come, with no end in sight to the protests in the Chinese-ruled city and the virus outbreak in mainland China.

Hong Kong, which has confirmed 50 coronavirus cases and one death so far, has taken measures to reduce the number of visitors from China. The city's retail and tourism sectors rely heavily on spenders from the Chinese mainland.

49,2020/02/13,Cloud over trade talks as U.S. official puts off trip,"Hopes fade for deal during President Trump’s visit to India.

U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Robert Lighthizer has put off his trip to India this week, at least two official sources said, amid signs that the India-U.S. trade talks have hit a rough patch just ahead of President Donald Trump’s visit.

According to the sources, who are aware of the negotiations, no reason has been given for the change of plans in the USTR’s visit that was expected on February 13, but that there is still a considerable chance that he would visit as a part of Mr. Trump’s entourage to finalise a trade package or a “mini-trade deal” with his counterpart, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, on items that the two sides have been negotiating for more than two years now.

‘Missed opportunity’

The two chief negotiators have been speaking on the phone quite regularly, the sources added.

“If [President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi] fail to bring even a modest agreement forward, it will be a missed opportunity to make progress that can benefit both countries and strengthen economic ties,” said Nisha Biswal, president of the U.S.-India Business Council (USIBC) at the U.S. Chambers of Commerce. She was speaking at an interview during a visit to India this week.

However, Ms. Biswal said she remained “optimistic” that a “limited trade deal” would be finalised as part of the visit. Mr. Trump and his wife Melania are travelling to Delhi and Ahmedabad on February 24 and 25 , and are expected to visit Agra as well.

Informed sources have said that talks thus far have brought some agreement on contentious issues including medical device price caps levied by India, a rationalisation of tariffs levied by both sides, and greater market access for U.S. agricultural and dairy products.

A full restoration of GSP (Generalised System of Preferences) status appears unlikely at present, given the USTR’s notice this week that aims to treat India and a number of other countries as “developed countries”, coupled with President Trump’s strictures against giving those defined as developed countries any GSP assistance. Instead, the U.S. might offer a partial restoration of GSP concessions to Indian exporters, but only in sectors where U.S. importers are “dependent” on Indian goods, the sources said.

Officials said the U.S.’s stand on GSP, as well as certain provisions in the Indian budget had made the talks, that have continued nonetheless, more difficult. In particular, the government’s new “health cess” will impact pricing for medical devices, and the raising of tariffs on several items including electric vehicle (EV) components, dairy products, shelled walnuts, edible vegetable oils, infant foods, and soy products may also become an issue, U.S. government websites have noted.

According to Ms. Biswal, who led a delegation from the Washington-based USIBC to meet with government officials in Delhi, the bigger commercial expectations during the visit would be in the field of defence, including a $2.4 billion deal for helicopters and an air defence system, and energy.

“Despite the fact that the new budget did not contain increased spending for defence, the Indian government is expected to announce some defence deals on the margins of the visit,” Ms. Biswal, who was earlier the Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asia in the Obama administration, said.

India is also expected to discuss an increase in LNG imports from the U.S. during the visit. An MoU for India’s gas importer Petronet to invest $2.5 billion in U.S. company Tellurian Inc’s LNG project, that was signed during Mr. Modi’s visit to Houston, is likely to be formalised during Mr. Trump’s visit, news agencies have reported.

The announcement of the start of formal free trade agreement negotiations will generate considerable interest, but could take several years to complete.

The major defence deals in advanced stages are for 24 MH-60R multirole helicopters for the Indian Navy and a quick reaction air defence system to protect Delhi. The deal for helicopters, worth around $2.4 billion, is now awaiting final approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS). India and the U.S. are also in discussions for armed drones, six more P-8I surveillance aircraft and two Raytheon ISTAR aircraft among others.

50,2020/02/13,"Pulwama terror attack: Even after a year, NIA unable to trace source of explosives","Many loose ends hamper probe; NIA could not file a charge sheet as none of the key suspects are alive.

A year after the Pulwama terror attack where 40 CRPF personnel were killed, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has not been able to trace the source of high grade explosives used by the car-borne suicide bomber.

Adil Ahmad Dar, a Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist, rammed a car into a CRPF bus on the Jammu-Srinagar highway near Pulwama on February 14, 2019.

A senior government official said the explosives could not have been purchased off the shelf as it was “warfare ammunition generally found in military stores.” A forensic report said that around 25 kg of plastic explosives were used.

An NIA official said the explosives packed in the car were “ammonium nitrate, nitro-glycerine and RDX”.

The investigation has hit hurdles and the NIA could not file a chargesheet as all key suspects are dead.

Two main suspects-Mudasir Ahmed Khan and Sajjad Bhat, were killed in an encounter with security forces last year in March and June respectively.

Jaish video

After the attack, Jaish released a video claiming credit for the attack. They identified the attacker as Dar, a resident of Kakapora in Pulwama who joined the outfit in 2018. In the video, Dar is seen carrying a sophisticated weapon and sitting in the backdrop of a black and white flag. He says that “by the time the video was released, he would be in heaven”.

Also Read CRPF refuses to share 2019 Pulwama attack inquiry report

The vehicle was first sold in 2011 and resold several times before Bhat purchased it on February 4, 10 days before the attack. Mudasir Ahmed Khan, the other suspect, had arranged the explosives, the NIA said.

A senior government official said the “engine block” of the vehicle could not be recovered as it blew apart and could have been swept away after falling in a river near the site of the explosion.

“There are many unanswered questions as all the perpetrators who could have helped in piecing together the investigation were killed in encounters. The car used in the attack had changed hands several times. The last person to own the vehicle- Sajjad Bhat went on to join Jaish hours before he could be caught. He was later killed in an encounter,” the official said.

Another official said it was difficult to establish the conspiracy as the technical evidence gathered in the case could not be corroborated as none of the suspects are alive. “We do not know the financial trail, how was the car arranged. Adil Ahmad Dar, who was driving the car, was on a suicide mission. Where did he procure the explosives from, it could not be established,” said the official.

An NIA official said DNA samples were extracted from the 'meagre fragments of the car"" and were matched with Dar's father to establish and confirm the suicide bomber's identity.

The official added that only “burnt residues” could be found at the attack site. “Had we recovered samples from a bomb that had not exploded, then tracing the source would have been easier on the basis of its composition and usage pattern. In Pulwama, all we could get was charred remains,” the official said.

A fifth suspect-Qari Mufti Yasser was killed in an encounter on January 25 this year. The fourth suspect- Kamran was killed on March 29 last year. Dar's video was released by Jaish spokesperson Mohd. Hassan and the IP address from which the claim was made was traced to Pakistan, the official said.

Under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the investigating agency has 90 days to file a charge sheet in court but it can be extended if the suspects are dead or additional time is required.

In June, Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha that the Pulwama attack was not an “intelligence failure” and “the investigation by the NIA so far has resulted in identifying the conspirators, suicide attacker and the vehicle provider.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cpwn18/article26321184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Pulwama-attack,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pulwama-terror-attack-first-anniversary-even-after-a-year-nia-unable-to-trace-source-of-explosives/article30813393.ece
51,2020/02/13,Slain CRPF jawan’s family yet to come to terms with loss,"Family of Rohitash Lamba, killed in Pulwama attack, says promise to name a public place after him yet to be kept

Oblivious of the tragedy that struck his family a year ago, toddler Dhruv approaches his father’s large picture in the courtyard of his spacious house every day and bows his head with folded hands and eyes closed with reverence. The one-year-old boy has learnt the ritual from his mother, whom he often finds lost in grief.

One year after the deadly Pulwama terror attack, the family of the slain Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan, Rohitash Lamba, has yet to come to terms with the loss. Lamba, 27, a native of small Govindpura Basri village situated 65 km away from Jaipur, was the youngest of the five CRPF personnel from Rajasthan who lost their lives in the suicide attack.

Also Read | Pulwama terror attack: No intelligence failure, says government

With their lives disrupted by the tragedy, Lamba’s wife Manju Devi and parents are mostly immersed in taking care of young Dhruv, who was born barely two months before the jawan was killed.

Ms. Devi, 24, affirms that though she knows of challenges in her life, she would like to see her son following the footsteps of his late father.

Lamba had joined the CRPF as a constable in 2013 and undergone training in Kannur, Kerala, before he was posted in Jammu division’s Doda district. After his son’s birth, he visited home for a fortnight for celebrations in February 2019 and left for duty barely four days before the Pulwama terror strike.

‘Ideal husband’

“He was an ideal husband. In our short married life of two years, we never fought on anything. He cooked food for me when he came home during my pregnancy,” Ms. Devi said, with tears swelling in her eyes. Lamba spoke to her on phone for the last time just an hour before his death, assuring her of his safety and asking her to take care of their son.

Though the Rajasthan government has allotted one bigha land in the village for building a memorial for Lamba and provided a package of financial assistance worth ₹50 lakh to the family, the jawan’s father, Babulal Lamba, expects a better recognition for his son. The promise to name a public place such as school or park after the slain braveheart is yet to be kept.

Blood donation

The family has decided to organise a blood donation camp at the half-built memorial on Friday to commemorate Lamba’s first death anniversary. His younger brother, Jitendra, said people from Govindpura Basri, with a population of 4,000, as well as the nearby villages would attend the camp. The blood collected will be sent to a hospital in the nearby Chomu town.

Government job

Jitendra, 26, has met Shahpura MLA Alok Beniwal and the officers in Jaipur several times with the request for a government job on compassionate grounds, as there is no one else capable of earning a livelihood to sustain the family. “Our agricultural land is lying in disuse because of paucity of water. My parents earlier worked as rural employment guarantee labourers... We may have to return to manual labour if I do not get a job.”

Mr. Babulal Lamba said though he wanted Rohitash to become a teacher, he was inclined towards sports and physical activities since his childhood. “After completing his schooling, He used to walk for 7 km every day to attend the Government College in Chimanpura. He went to Jaipur to write the B.Ed. entrance exam, but instead appeared in the CRPF recruitment exam on the same day... We came to know of it later.”

‘Who were involved’

Mr. Babulal Lamba regretted that the “conspiracy” behind the Pulwama attack had not yet been unravelled and no one knew how a vehicle laden with 200 kg of explosives had hit the CRPF bus. “Both the BJP and the Congress exploited the attack for their electoral advantage in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll campaign. As the father of a slain jawan, I have right to know how my son was killed... Who all were involved?” he asked.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ohjkas/article30813320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/lamba2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/slain-crpf-jawans-family-yet-to-come-to-terms-with-loss/article30813321.ece
52,2020/02/13,Jaishankar spars with Jairam on Nehru,"Minister praises book that posited that former PM didn’t want Patel in his Cabinet.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar exchanged sharp messages on social media on Thursday with Rajya Sabha member Jairam Ramesh, after the Minister praised a book for arguing that Jawaharlal Nehru had planned to exclude Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel from the first post-independence Cabinet.

“Learnt from the book that Nehru did not want Patel in the Cabinet in 1947 and omitted him from the initial Cabinet list. Clearly, a subject for much debate. Noted that the author stood her ground on this revelation,” said Mr. Jaishankar, praising the book on late bureaucrat V.P. Menon who was part of the transition of power.

The Minister was referring to the biography of V.P. Menon by historian Narayani Basu, titled V.P. Menon: The Unsung Architect of Modern India. He highlighted the section where Mr. Menon said that Nehru’s government began a “deliberate campaign” to erase Patel’s memory after the latter died.

Quick response

Mr. Jaishankar’s comment drew a quick response from Congress leader Jairam Ramesh.

“Problem with this very accomplished and erudite Foreign Minister is that he wishes to forget the books he read before becoming Foreign Secretary in January 2015,” Mr. Ramesh posted, attaching scanned copies of letters from Volume Three of Selected Works of Jawaharlal Nehru to contradict the view that the Minister had supported. He cited Nehru’s letter written on July 19, 1947, where the former Prime Minister placed Patel on the top of the list of members for the first Cabinet.

The list showed Patel at the top of the nine-member Cabinet and Nehru’s name at the bottom. Mr. Ramesh also cited Nehru’s letter of August 14, 1947, where he placed Patel as second in the Cabinet. The letters indicated that Nehru shared a close working relationship with Patel on issues such as the repression of people in some princely states.

Historian Ramchandra Guha tweeted describing Ms. Basu’s argument as a “myth”.

Mr. Jaishankar retorted, “Some Foreign Ministers do read books. Maybe a good habit for some Professors too.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i2sgxu/article30813236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14JAISHANKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jaishankar-spars-with-jairam-on-nehru/article30813237.ece

Rajinder K Pachauri, former Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, died on Thursday. He was 79.

Dr. Pachauri was the founder and chief executive of The Energy Resources Institute (TERI). In April 2002, he was elected Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, established by the World Meteorological Organisation and the United Nations Environment Programme in 1988.

He received the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the IPCC, with former U.S. Vice-President Al Gore, for the year 2007.

“Investigation has revealed that the aircraft touched down left of the centreline and deviated further to the left and the delayed corrective input by the crew led to the damage to three runway edge lights,” the document of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) stated.

It also noted that the period of suspension would be counted from the date of the incident.

The aircraft was coming from Dubai when the incident occurred.

Show cause notices were issued by the DGCA to the pilot-in-command and first officer of the flight demanding explanation on the “lapses”.

The reply sent by both the pilots were deemed to be “not satisfactory” and therefore, the regulator suspended the license held by them for a period of four-and-half months, the document stated.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dgca-suspends-2-pilots-for-damaging-runway-edge-lights/article30813115.ece

The first high-speed patrol boat being built for Vietnam under the $100-million Line of Credit (LoC) will be delivered by September, said JD Patil, whole time Director & Senior Executive Vice-President defence & smart technologies, Larsen & Toubro. Hanoi is procuring 12 such boats for its border guard force under the LoC extended in September 2014.

“We should be delivering the first boat this September. Five boats will be built by L&T while the remaining will be built in Vietnam. We are trying to finish the boats by mid 2021,” Mr. Patil told The Hindu on the sidelines of the Defexpo last week.

In 2016, India has extended another $500 million defence LoC to Vietnam and discussions are under way to identify the equipment. Defence sources said Vietnam has expressed interest in Akash Surface-to-Air Systems and Dhruv Advanced Light Helicopters.

India has also extended a defence LoC to Bangladesh and part of that is also for naval vessels. “We expect something from that as well.” He said exports are picking up pace.

57,2020/02/13,Walls rise in Ahmedabad ahead of Donald Trump visit,"Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner denies it is part of plan to hide slums.

From resurfacing roads and planting palm trees along the streets to building a wall apparently to hide slums, the Gujarat government is pulling out all the stops to impress U.S. President Donald Trump, who will be the city’s guest for a few hours on February 24.

However, Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra told The Hindu that the “decision to build a wall to prevent encroachment on the road was taken two months back” and has nothing to do with the visit of U.S. President.

“It is not correct to link building of the wall to the VIP visit. After my visit to the area, we had decided in consultation with slum dwellers build a wall to prevent encroachment and secondly to save trees which were getting damaged,” Mr. Nehra said.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) has also ensured that no stray dogs or cattle — a routine presence on city roads — will be seen on the stretch from the Ahmedabad international airport to the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium, better known as the Motera stadium, where the high profile Kem Chho Trump (Howdy Trump) event will be held.

Trees have been trimmed, fully grown palm trees have been planted and even electric poles and pillars of under-construction metro system have been painted while special cameras have been installed along the roads for enhanced security.

As part of its beautification drive, the civic body has built a new wall at a few patches to hide slums dotting the road from the airport to the Indira Bridge where the President’s convoy is likely to pass through on the way to the Motera stadium.

In Motera, a middle class locality situated in the northwestern side of the city, all roads including inner streets have been resurfaced and refurbished.

“We are thankful to President Trump for making this trip, which has ensured complete makeover of our area,” said Ratnabhai Rabari, a resident and cattle breeder in Motera village.

According to officials, more than a dozen roads and streets from the airport to the Sabarmati (Mahatma Gandhi) Ashram and Motera stadium have been refurbished, with pavements and electric poles and pillars freshly painted by the civic body and metro rail authority.

58,2020/02/13,Rajya Sabha official demoted for anti-Modi posts on social media,"The Deputy Director has “failed to maintain political neutrality”, says order

On the directive of Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu, an official working in the post of Deputy Director in the Rajya Sabha Secretariat has been demoted for his social media posts allegedly against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BJP Cabinet Ministers and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adtiyanath.

A memo issued by the Secretariat dated February 12 to Deputy Director (Security) Urujul Hasan charges him with “sharing several offensive, derogatory, demeaning and sarcastic posts on social media against the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India and some Union Ministers and Chief Ministers as also sharing a number of posts indicating his active involvement/assistance/indulgence in political activities canvassing in connection with an election to the legislature”.

According to sources, the order was issued following a year-long enquiry after an anonymous complaint flagged Mr. Hasan’s Facebook posts made from April to May 2018. Many of these posts, sources said, were merely repost of others’ statements.

The Hindu tried contacting Mr. Hasan but he was not available for comment. As per the Rajya Sabha orders, Mr. Hasan has been demoted for five years and even at the end of this period he will not be allowed to resume his post of Deputy Director.

The order rules that Mr. Hasan has “failed to maintain political neutrality” as per the Central Civil Services Conduct Rules of 1964 which has stringent provisions against participation of a government servant in any kind of political activity or even freely expressing their view.

Various sections of these rules have been invoked against Mr. Hasan. As per the rules, a government servant is debarred from joining any political party, he/she is not allowed to “canvass or otherwise interfere with, or use his influence in connection with or take part in an election to any legislature or local authority”. The government servant is not allowed to even indicate the manner in which he proposes to vote or has voted.

The enquiry committee had also taken into account a Madras High Court ruling of May 10, 2018 against an actor-turned-politician for forwarding an offensive WhatsApp message, saying, “Forwarding a message is equal to accepting the message and endorsing the message.”

Former Chief Secretary of Delhi Rakesh Mehta said a civil servant is not allowed to breach the political line under any circumstances and the rules are very clear about it. “The CCS Rules apply for social media posts too. A social media post cannot be considered a private correspondence. A civil servant cannot make his political views public simply because it would prejudge their decision making process,” Mr. Mehta said. However, he agreed that the rules are archaic and need to be revisited in an era of social media.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sr785b/article30811860.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THVENKAIAHNAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-official-demoted-for-anti-pm-social-media-posts/article30811861.ece
59,2020/02/13,"Saliva of COVID-19 patients contain virus, study finds","Of the 12 patients, the virus was detected in the saliva of 11 patients.

The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 can also be found in saliva, according to a study carried out on 12 patients admitted in hospitals with laboratory-confirmed infection. Of the 12 patients, the virus was detected in the saliva of 11 patients. In one patient, shedding of the virus in saliva continued up to 11 days after hospitalisation.

The study carried out by researchers in Hong Kong and published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases has demonstrated the potential of using saliva as a non-invasive specimen for confirming infection and for viral load monitoring during the period of hospitalisation.

Also Read Explainer: How WHO names a new disease

“The use of saliva is preferred over nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimens because this would reduce the discomfort to the patient and reduce the health hazards to healthcare workers during repeated sampling,” the authors write.

The virus taken from the patients was also cultured in the lab. Three viral cultures tested positive for the virus, while two tested negative. This confirms that saliva contain live novel virus SARS-CoV-2.

Virus spread through saliva

The presence of live virus in saliva, as confirmed by positive culture, indicates that this body fluid may allow the spread of the virus. Besides direct or indirect contact, the SARS-CoV-2 virus can be transmitted through droplets.

“Saliva can be emitted through cough, and respiratory droplets containing influenza virus can be found even during normal breathing. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 virus may be transmitted via saliva directly or indirectly even among patients without coughing or other respiratory symptoms,” the authors caution.

Not only saliva secreted by salivary glands, the saliva specimens can also contain “secretions coming down from the nasopharynx, or coming up from the lung via the action of cilia lining the airway”. They are yet to study the source of the virus in the saliva samples.

The doctors collected saliva samples every day from six patients. The amount of virus present in the saliva — known as viral load — was highest in the earliest available samples in five patients. In one patient, the viral load was higher on the day after hospitalisation than the day of hospital admission.

“Our experience with SARS in 2003 showed that viral load often peaked at day 10 after symptom onset. Thus early detection and isolation of cases was strategic for infection control,” they write.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sklwe5/article30811741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13IN-TEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/saliva-of-covid-19-patients-contain-virus-study-finds/article30811742.ece

61,2020/02/13,Indian crew on cruise ship quarantined off Japan long to return home,"‘The situation is turning worse with every passing day’

“The situation is turning worse with every passing day. We want to return home as early as possible,” Binay Kumar Sarkar, crew member on-board cruise ship Diamond Princess, which has been docking in Yokohama, Japan, over the past two weeks, told The Hindu. The cruise ship, with 3,700 passengers on board, has 175 people infected with the novel coronavirus named COVID-19, making it the biggest cluster of cases outside China.

Mr. Sarkar, who hails from north Bengal, said that he, along with other crew members, can only leave after the quarantine period ends on February 19. “We have been living in fear for so many days. If everything goes as per schedule, I will be leaving for home on 20 February,” he said.

Speaking to The Hindu on Thursday, Mr. Sarkar said that while there were reports of two Indian crew members testing positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday, there have been no new reports on Thursday.

“According to the information available to us, the two Indian crew members who tested positive have been quarantined and are being provided treatment,” he said. There was no dearth of food and supplies on the ship and everyone, including the Indian Embassy, was extended a helping hand, he added.

Panic-stricken

The sight of people taking ill and the fear of viral contamination is creating panic among crew members and others on board the cruise ship. On Wednesday evening, Mr. Sarkar said, more than 30 people had tested positive, which included 20 passengers, about ten crew members from the quarantine team, and a Japanese doctor.

Since reports on the outbreak of coronavirus on board the cruise emerged, Mr. Sarkar has been releasing a number of video messages urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to rescue the Indians on board. On February 12, a statement from the Indian Embassy in Tokyo had said that 132 crew members and six passengers were Indian nationals.

“We came to know about the infection in the first week of February. Since February 6, the ship has been at the Yokohama coast. We have closely followed all the security protocol and have taken all the precautions,” said Mr. Sarkar. Apart from wearing masks and other protective gear, crew members have been asked to maintain a distance of a few metres and avoid touching surfaces like door knobs and tables with bare hands.

‘Living with fear’

“Everyone is living with the fear that they will get the dreaded virus,” Mr. Sarkar said, adding that family members back home in Bengal were also having sleepless nights.

“Not all fully understand what the viral infection is about. For instance, my mother thinks that the coronavirus infection cannot be cured,” he said.

Another crew member, Swaroop Chapadar, who hails from Diamond Harbour, also expressed similar concerns. “I had never thought that I would have to suffer such an ordeal. At first, I thought I won’t tell my family and then, when more and more people started falling ill on the ship, I finally did,” Mr. Chapadar said.

Mr. Chapadar, a hotel management graduate and a chef, is uncertain about the immediate future and said that he had no idea whether he could return safely to his home or not.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/shzh2k/article30811483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAOUTBREAKJAPANVIRUSSHIP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-crew-on-cruise-ship-quarantined-off-japan-long-to-return-home/article30811484.ece

One of the three medical students, who had tested positive for novel coronavirus infection, has been discharged after recovery said Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday. He added that the other two have also shown significant reduction in “viral load”.

“We are still waiting for confirmatory results before discharging them. They are stable and recovering and will be discharged soon,” he added. The Minister added that on Thursday a high-level Group of Ministers, constituted on the directions of the Prime Minister, held its second meeting to review the current status and actions for the prevention and management of the novel coronavirus named COVID-19 by the World Health Organisation.

Screening, surveillance

“A total of 2,51,447 persons travelling in 2,315 flights have been screened so far. Also 15,991 people across the country have been kept on community surveillance. Of them, 497 have been identified as symptomatic cases and isolated while 41 have been hospitalised,” the Minister said.

The Ministry noted that passengers arriving from Thailand and Singapore, besides China and Hong Kong, are being screened for possible exposure to the virus at 21 identified airports. Screening is also being done at major seaports and border crossings.

“The country is well-stocked [medicines, protection equipment] for the next two-three months. There is no shortage of medicine,” Mr. Vardhan said.

Speaking about the Indian crew on cruise ship Diamond Princess off the Japanese coast, in which over 200 persons have tested positive for COVID-19, the Minister said that Japan is following the best possible policy for the public. “We are in touch with the authorities and a decision will be taken accordingly,” he added.

Discharge protocol

“Previously, India had evacuated 645 people, including seven Maldivians, from China’s Wuhan city and quarantined them in two special camps. They will be kept under observation for a period of two weeks and discharged after they test negative for the virus. A discharge protocol is in place,” explained Health Secretary Preeti Sudan.

A plan to restore and preserve the nearly 800-year-old Konark Sun Temple in Odisha would be drawn up soon, after a two-day conference of experts at the end of the month, Union Culture Minister Prahlad Singh Patel said.

Mr. Patel said a conference, which would be attended by archaeologists, engineers and other experts, would be held in Odisha on February 28 and 29 to take a call on the future restoration plan for the site.

“A decision will be taken after the conference,” he told The Hindu on Thursday.

UNESCO site

The 13th Century temple, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, had been filled with sand and sealed by the British authorities in 1903 in order to stabilise the structure, an Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) official said. A scientific study was carried out by the Roorkee-based Central Building Research Institute from 2013 till 2018 to ascertain the temple’s structural stability as well as the status of the filled-in sand, the official said.

The official said the study found that the sand filled in over 100 years ago had settled, leading to a gap of about 17 feet. The official, however, added that the structure was found to be stable. The ASI was in the process of removing the scaffolding erected for the study, the official said, adding that all the scaffolding would be taken down by the end of the month.

To decide

Among the potential choices before the government would be to fill in more sand or to remove all the sand and put in place alternate support, according to Culture Ministry sources.

CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury took a dig at the Narendra Modi government on Thursday over the announcement of byelection to over 12,500 panchayat seats in Jammu and Kashmir, saying it was a “mockery of democracy.”

The Union Territory’s Chief Electoral Officer Shailender Kumar said polling would be held from March 5 to March 20 and ballots would be used for casting votes.

“After arresting major political leaders and workers under draconian PSA on flimsy charges, now this mockery of democracy. Time has come for Modi government to declare J&K as a jail. Appoint a Jail warden not a Lt. Governor. The Modi govt will be held to account on this (sic),” CPI(M) general secretary Yechury tweeted.

He also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his remarks at a summit on Wednesday that only 2,200 people in the country had declared earnings of ₹1 crore per annum.

“Mr. Modi’s complete disrespect for facts or data or the truth, shows up all the time. The only tricks they all have is spin and Goebbels-like propaganda,” Mr. Yechury said quoting reports that the data stated by PM Modi on taxpayers was wrong.

“As per Modi, every Indian is a thief while his party is the one that has usurped crores secretly through opaque electoral bonds. If no one pays tax, what has Modi done over past 6 years?

The Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra, a cultural centre reflecting India’s connect with its diaspora, was on Thursday renamed Sushma Swaraj Bhavan in honour of the late External Affairs Minister known for her empathy in reaching out to distressed Indians globally.

The Foreign Service Institute, a renowned institution where diplomats are trained, has also been renamed as Sushma Swaraj Institute of Foreign Service.

The government’s decision to name the two institutions after Sushma Swaraj came a day before her 68th birth anniversary.

The illustrious leader who brought rare empathy and a human approach to India’s diplomacy as External Affairs Minister in the previous Narendra Modi government died on August 6 last year following a massive cardiac arrest.

The Ministry of External Affairs, in a statement, said the two institutions have been renamed in solemn tribute to the “invaluable contribution” of Sushma Swaraj to Indian diplomacy, the cause of the Indian diaspora and the ethos of public service.

“The announcement is being made on the eve of her birth anniversary falling on February 14 in honour of the legacy and decades of public service of the former External Affairs Minister,” it said.

As External Affairs Minister, Sushma Swaraj brought a sense of assertiveness in India’s diplomacy besides engaging the diaspora, a central focus of the country’s foreign policy priorities.

She was one of the most followed foreign ministers on Twitter globally. She was known for helping Indians stuck abroad as she was quick to respond to their calls for help on Twitter. She even became popular in Pakistan for her response to people wanting to get visas for medical treatment in India.

The Pravasi Bharatiya Kendra located in the heart of the Capital was set up to recognise the contributions of the overseas Indian community to India’s growth and development.

A museum in the Kendra depicts the history of migration of the overseas Indian community as well as their experiences and contributions.

She had many firsts to her credit – the youngest Cabinet Minister in the Haryana government, the first woman Chief Minister of Delhi and the first woman spokesperson for a national political party in the country.

She was Information and Broadcasting Minister in the 13-day Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in 1996 and got the Cabinet portfolio again after he led the BJP to power in 1998. Long seen as a protege of veteran BJP leader L.K. Advani, she also was the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha between 2009-14.

“May be in Delhi or in Gujarat, the party activists will certainly protest”, he said.

The CPI(M) leader said the protests would be held on two counts.

“Firstly, America is putting pressure and (Narendra) Modi is succumbing to completely open up our economy which is the gain they want to achieve in order to give support to Modi on issues like CAA, Article 370 and others, Yechury told reporters on the sideline of an anti-CAA rally here.

“That is the quid pro quo going on, which is not in India’s interest.

“This apart, we will be spending billions of dollars for buying U.S. military equipment, to bailout U.S. economy while destroying our own,” Yechury remarked.

Replying to a question on the increase in LPG cylinder price, the CPM leader said his party has been protesting against it at many centres and places.

“The price hike is completely unwarranted. The international oil prices are not on escalating. In fact it is de-escalating a little.

“This is all because of the crisis created in the balance sheets of our oil majors by the Modi government which started borrowing from them in terms of greater dividends and destroying the balance sheet,” he alleged.

“In order to stabilise the balance sheets, they are doing it (price hike of LPG cylinder). There is no necessity at all for increasing the price,” Yechury said, adding the balance sheet is rectified in order to prepare the oil majors for disinvestment.

A group of 21 elected local government representatives from the 2015-quake-hit Nuwakot district of Nepal are on a five-day exposure visit to India to learn about the country’s sustainable urban development and livelihood integration.

The group, which began their trip on February 10 under the India’s post-earthquake reconstruction efforts in Nepal in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), include mayors, chairs, vice-chairs of eight rural municipalities and an official from the Federation of Nepalese Journalists, the Indian Embassy here said in a statement on Thursday.

“During their visit to India, the delegation will visit Central Building Research Institute (CBRI), Roorkee, to observe the Shake Table Testing Facility and different labs such as Structural Engineering lab, Fire lab, Technology Demonstration lab and Rural Park,” it said.

The delegation will also visit the Centre for Urban and Regional Excellence in New Delhi to learn participatory process for sustainable urban development and livelihood integration.

At the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH), the delegation will a hear presentation on post-earthquake conservation and restoration works by INTACH together with a guided tour at its heritage academy, the statement said.

The massive earthquake in Nepal in April, 2015 created havoc, killing over 10,000 people and injuring nearly 22,000 people. Gorkha and Nuwakot were the worst-hit districts.

India is collaborating with Nepal on post-earthquake reconstruction of 23,088 houses in Nuwakot district.

“To complement the Nepal’s owner driven reconstruction approach, UNOPS is providing socio-technical facilitation to home owners to rebuild their resilient homes,” the statement said.

“The visit will provide an avenue for building capacities of key local stakeholders for ensuring earthquake resilient reconstruction by raising community awareness about disaster management, recovery and resilience,” it added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ssl7n/article30810275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13IN-NEPAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/representatives-from-quake-hit-nuwakot-district-of-nepal-are-on-exposure-trip-to-india/article30810263.ece
69,2020/02/13,Another SC Bench to hear Omar Abdullah’s sister’s plea on Feb 14,"Justice Mohan M. Shantanagoudar recused himself from the case on Wednesday.

Sara Abdullah Pilot’s petition challenging the booking of her brother and former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah under the Public Safety Act (PSA) is listed before a Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Indira Banerjee on February 14.

This follows the recusal of Justice Mohan M. Shantanagoudar from the case on Wednesday.

A short order on Wednesday said the case would be listed “before another Bench since Mr. Justice Mohan M. Shantanagoudar expressed his inability to participate in the hearing of the matter”. The court had also agreed to a request made by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Ms. Bhat, to list the case again on February 14.

Ms. Pilot has urged for issuance of a writ of habeas corpus the authorities to forthwith produce Mr. Abdullah before the court and set him at liberty.

Ms. Pilot, also represented by senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan. has said she was gravely concerned about the welfare, safety and security of her brother. He was already under detention from August 5 last - the day the Centre removed the special rights of the Kashmiri people under Article 370 - when the PSA was slapped on him on February 5, 2020.

Ms. Pilot has said she was shocked to learn that just like what happened to their father, the government, has imposed a fresh lease of detention under the PSA on her brother too.

Mr. Abdullah's detention from August 5 under Section 107 CrPC (security for keeping the peace) was scheduled to end on February 5. His release was imminent. He had served the maximum period of detention, sahe has said.

‘Arbitrary exercise of power’

On February 5, the Executive Magistrate, instead of releasing him, ordered his further detention under Section 8 of the PSA of 1978 in an “arbitrary exercise of power”. In fact, she has said, in the past six months there has been no effort by the authorities to verify the truth behind the “information” that Mr. Abdullah was a threat to peace. On the other hand, there are reams of material in the form of tweets and public statements vouching for his exemplary conduct to maintain peace.

Ms. Pilot has urged there was danger to her brother's life and liberty.

The government, in its PSA dossier on Mr. Abdullah, has described him as a threat to public safety. It said he was “planning activities against the Union government”. It has also highlighted “his popularity and potential to draw voters to polling booths”.

The petition has argued that the detention order is illegal as it conflates 'governmental policy' with the 'Indian State', suggesting that any opposition to the former constitutes a threat to the latter.

“This is wholly antithetical to a democratic polity and undermines the Indian Constitution,” it has said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ro63ky/article30780832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH10OMAR-ABDULLAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/another-sc-bench-to-hear-omar-abdullahs-sisters-plea-on-feb-14/article30809435.ece

The Supreme Court on Thursday reserved its judgment on a plea by the Nirbhaya case convict, Vinay Sharma, against the rejection of his mercy petition by the President.

Appearing before a Bench led by Justice R. Banumathi, Sharma’s lawyer, A. P. Singh, claimed the rejection of the plea for mercy amounted to a gross miscarriage of justice. The file sent to the President did not have the signature of the Home Minister and the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi. Mr. Singh said he had filed a Right to Information (RTI) request.

‘Not like first appeal’

Justice Ashok Bhushan told Mr. Singh that the court’s jurisdiction while hearing a challenge against the President’s rejection is limited. “You cannot argue here like how you are arguing a first appeal,” Mr. Bhushan observed.

“It is not for your benefit, it is for the satisfaction of the court,” Justice Bhushan told Mr. Singh. The court would pronounce its judgment on February 14.

73,2020/02/13,Ram Nath Kovind: future training of marine engineers must be tailored to evolving technologies,"He awarded the President’s Colour to INS Shivaji, the country’s premier naval training institute, at a ceremonial parade in Lonavala

While maintaining core competence in their vocation as engineers, the training of marine engineers in the near future must be tailored to rapidly evolving technologies, said President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday.

He was speaking after awarding the President’s Colour to INS Shivaji, the country’s premier naval training institute, at a ceremonial parade in Lonavala, 75 km from the city.

“Technology is leapfrogging to produce autonomous vessels. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are being deployed for decision-making and warfighting. The training of marine engineers will also need to be tailored to train them to work with evolving technologies, while maintaining competence in the core engineering profession,” Mr. Kovind said.

‘Greater vigilance needed’

Observing that the geopolitical situation in the world today and in the Indo-Pacific region, in particular, demanded greater vigilance, the President said that the Indian Navy had adopted mission-based deployments in the Indian Ocean region.

“Hence, high-quality training of marine engineers is crucial for sustained deployments and presence in our areas of interest. The future will also see great diversity in the propulsion systems ranging from the conventional to nuclear, electric and hybrid propulsion. The concepts of maintenance will also undergo a paradigm shift with increased requirements on operational availability of platforms,” Mr. Kovind said, adding that INS Shivaji would need to impart the requisite skills to trainees in order to prepare them to meet future challenges.

Speaking on the importance of the Indian Navy in maintain not just national security but also economic security, the President said that 90 % of the country’s trade by volume was handled by sea routes, remarking that the Navy was the chief instrument of India’s sea power.

Humanitarian role

Mr. Kovind particularly singled out the humanitarian role essayed by the Indian Navy in launching ‘Operation Vanilla’ last month to provide relief and assistance to the afflicted population of Madagascar ravaged by Cyclone ‘Diane’.

“India and Madagascar are connected through Indian Ocean Region. I had the honour of visiting the island nation in 2018. I am particularly happy that India was one of the first respondent to come to the rescue of our Malagasy brothers and sisters.”

“As a leading power, India plays a crucial role in shaping the global paradigm with respect to international security, trade and commerce. India’s rise in the international order has been fuelled by many factors, including the capabilities and valour of our armed forces,” the President said.

Mr. Kovind lauded the energetic parade which preceded the awarding of the President’s standards while praising the high standard of training being imparted at INS Shivaji.

“It is a proud moment for me to present the President’s Colour to INS Shivaji. This establishment was first commissioned in 1945 as His Majesty’s Indian Ship (HMIS) ‘Shivaji’. Since then, it has dynamically evolved into a premier technical training institution of the Indian Navy with state-of-the-art training facilities,” he said.

The President’s Colour ranks high among the honours bestowed upon a military unit in recognition of the exceptional service rendered to the nation, in peace or war.

“The institution has kept pace with the rapidly changing technologies in all aspects of marine engineering. I am glad to note that more than two lakh officers and sailors of the marine engineering branch of the Navy, Coast Guard and friendly foreign countries have been trained in this fine institution till date,” he said, addressing the parade.

Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh and Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari were also present on the occasion.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4s82o7/article30808568.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kovind2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ram-nath-kovind-future-training-of-marine-engineers-must-be-tailored-to-evolving-technologies/article30808570.ece

75,2020/02/13,"Supreme Court orders parties to publish criminal history of Lok Sabha, Assembly candidates","Apex court says they must also explain why the candidates were chosen

The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered political parties to publish the entire criminal history of their candidates for Assembly and Lok Sabha elections along with the reasons that goaded them to field suspected criminals over decent people.

The information should be published in a local as well as a national newspaper as well as the parties’ social media handles. It should mandatorily be published either within 48 hours of the selection of candidates or less than two weeks before the first date for filing of nominations, whichever is earlier.

A Bench led by Justices Rohinton F. Nariman, in the judgment, ordered political parties to submit compliance reports with the Election Commission of India within 72 hours or risk contempt of court action.

The judgment is applicable to parties both at Central and State levels.

Also read: Election Commission joins plea to disclose criminal cases against candidates | Editorial — Crime and politics: on political candidates with criminal records

The judgment by the Bench, also comprising Justice S. Ravindra Bhat, signified the court's alarm at the unimpeded rise of criminals, often facing heinous charges like rape and murder, encroaching into the country's political and electoral scenes.

Information should be detailed

The published information on the criminal antecedents of a candidate should be detailed and include the nature of their offences, charges framed against him, the court concerned, case number, etc.

A political party should explain to the public through their published material how the “qualifications or achievements or merit” of a candidate, charged with a crime, impressed it enough to cast aside the smear of his criminal background.

A party would have to give reasons to the voter that it was not the candidate’s “mere winnability at the polls” which guided its decision to give him ticket to contest elections.

“It appears that over the last four general elections, there has been an alarming increase in the incidence of criminals in politics. In 2004, 24% of the Members of Parliament had criminal cases pending against them; in 2009, that went up to 30%; in 2014 to 34%; and in 2019 as many as 43% of MPs had criminal cases pending against them”, Justice Nariman wrote.

The four-page judgment was based on a contempt petition filed by advocate Ashwini Upadhyay about the general disregard shown by political parties to a 2018 Constitution Bench judgment (Public Interest Foundation v. Union of India) to publish the criminal details of their candidates in their respective websites and print as well as electronic media for public awareness.

“In this judgment (2018), this court was cognisant of the increasing criminalisation of politics in India and the lack of information about such criminalisation among the citizenry”, Justice Nariman observed.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lk9728/article30808147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-orders-parties-to-publish-criminal-history-of-candidates/article30808148.ece

A complaint has been lodged against Prateek Hajela, the former Coordinator of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, for allegedly tampering with the records associated with updating the citizenship exercise whose complete list was published in August 2019.

Almost simultaneously on Wednesday, the office of the NRC Coordinator lodged an FIR against Ajupi Baruah, a former associate of Mr. Hajela, for resigning without surrendering the password to the NRC data records system.

In its complaint to the CID office in Guwahati, the Assam Public Works (APW) asked the Deputy Inspector General of Police to register a case against Mr. Hajela for “tempering (sic) the valuable public records, i.e., NRC final list of Assam”. It also sought an inquiry into the former coordinator’s involvement in “cybercrime in the whole process of NRC”.

The APW is the NGO whose petition in the Supreme Court in 2009 led to the NRC updating exercise.

Mr. Hajela had relinquished his charge on November 11, 2019, after the Supreme Court, which has been monitoring the NRC exercise, ordered his transfer to his home State Madhya Pradesh.

The role of Ms. Baruah, who quit as Project Manager of the NRC, on the same day as Mr. Hajela, has also come under a cloud with NRC’s Executive Director Chandana Mahanta lodging a complaint against her at the Paltanbazar police station in Guwahati.

According to Ms. Mahanta’s complaint, Ms. Baruah resigned and handed over charge on November 11 last year but did not share the password of the official email IDs cpm.nrc.assam@gmail.com and pm.spmunrc@gov.in.

Ms. Mahanta also said the emails contain very sensitive correspondences and information on the NRC, and action needed to be taken against Ms. Baruah for unauthorised possession of passwords of email IDs linked with an exercise monitored by the Supreme Court.

The police said they have begun an investigation.

NRC data secure

State NRC Coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma has said that the NRC data were fully secure offline and that his office as well as that of the Registrar General of India (RGI) has the backup.

“There should not be any fear of loss of NRC data. We have the backup of the database while the office of the RGI has the backup in its disaster recovery site for use in case of damage of the database here,” he said.

The Union Home Ministry had earlier said “some technical issue” had made the NRC data unavailable online.

Mr. Sarma said Wipro had been awarded the task of providing the cloud service, which enabled the people to view a part of the NRC data online. The contract between the NRC office and Wipro ended in October 2019 but the firm provided the service for some more time for the data to be available online.

A statement from Wipro said the IT firm continued to pay the hosting service fee as a “goodwill gesture” until January 2020 despite the contract having ended four months before. The firm said it would be willing to provide the services again if the agreement is renewed.

The final NRC published on August 31, 2019, had excluded 19,06,657 people.

Ten people were injured when part of a ramp collapsed at the Bhopal Railway Station on Thursday morning. While some sustained critical injuries, no deaths had been reported, said a railway official.

“Doctors are inspecting the injured at the Chirayu Hospital, where they were shifted from Hamidia Hospital. An inquiry team has reached the spot to ascertain the cause of the incident, which occurred at 9.10 a.m. on Platform number 3,” said the official, I A Siddiqui, Railways Public Relations Officer. “The cause is not known yet.”

After the ramp collapsed, people rushed to the spot and removed several injured from the debris.

The Railways have given a compensation of ₹5,000 each to the seven grievously injured, and ₹500 to others, said Mr. Siddiqui.

The Divisional Railway Manager, Bhopal, Uday Borwanker, wrote on Twitter, “I met the injured at the hospital and the doctors. The seven injured were given immediate treatment and their condition is stable according to the doctors”.

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath was apprised of the incident and he ordered the administration to offer every possible help to the victims and ensure their treatment, State Congress spokesman Narendra Saluja said.

Former Chief Minister and BJP national vice-president Shivraj Singh Chouhan said, “I request the government to offer assistance to the families of the victims. I pray for the speedy recovery of the injured.”

The arrest of terror mastermind Hafiz Saeed by Pakistan is part of Islamabad’s long-pending international obligation, a government source said. The statement indicates that South Block would prefer Pakistan to take more verifiable actions against terror outfits and individuals.

“The decision has been made on the eve of FATF (Financial Action Task Force) Plenary meeting, which has to be noted. Hence the efficacy of this decision remains to be seen,” said a source indicating that a Lahore anti-terrorism court’s decision has to be viewed in the context of the Paris meeting of the FATF that will begin on February 16.

In the last meeting of the FATF in November 2019, Pakistan was warned that it would remain on the ‘Grey’ list if tough actions were not initiated against terror outfits and terror financing individuals in the country.

The official maintained that India expects Pakistan to take similar actions consistently. Saeed who received a five-and-a-half years sentence for being part of a terror outfit has been asked by the anti-terror court to pay ₹15,000. The FIR against him was registered in July 2019 on charges of terror financing at the Counter Terrorism Department in Gujranwala. The court also handed the same sentence to Zafar Iqbal, a close aide of Saeed.

82,2020/02/13,Syed Ali Geelani’s wish sends security agencies in Kashmir Valley into a tizzy,"Ailing Hurriyat chairman wants to be buried in Srinagar’s “Martyrs’ Graveyard”.

The wish of ailing Hurriyat chairman Syed Ali Geelani, 90, to be buried in Srinagar’s “Martyrs’ Graveyard” has sent the security agencies into a tizzy as the J&K administration had to stop Internet services on Thursday night in the wake of rumours about the deterioration in the separatist leader’s health.

Sources in the J&K police said Mr. Geelani’s wish, circulated online from across the border, “does pose a security challenge”.

“Geelani’s wish is to be buried at the Mazar-e-Baqee in Saudi Arabia’s Medina. However, he has said ‘to be buried among the martyrs at the Mazar-e-Shohada (Martyrs’ Graveyard), Eidgah in Srinagar, will itself be an honour’,” reads the Hurriyat statement.

The wish was followed by the routine plan for the mourners. The J&K administration acted immediately to stop its circulation in the local newspapers and other social media platforms “to contain any fallout on the law and order”, officials said.

Sources said the administration is dealing with divided opinion whether to allow a burial in Srinagar or not. A section of the security agencies is for “convincing the family to bury him at his ancestral graveyard in Sopore’s Dooru area in Baramulla district”.

A team of doctors from the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) visited Mr. Geelani for a check-up at his residence here. The SKIMS decided against issuing any health bulletin. He has been bed-ridden for many weeks now, with acute chest congestion and bouts of dementia.

Mr. Geelani’s son, Naseem Geelani, said “Abu [father] is stable. He was having chest congestion, but now recovering.”

83,2020/02/13,Providing 100 units of free power feasible: economist,"‘Poorer sections of society will benefit’

Even as two senior ministers in the Maharashtra government have expressed divergent views on providing free electricity to people who consume up to 100 units of power, city-based economist H.M. Desarda on Wednesday supported the feasibility of such a measure on the lines of the one in Delhi.

State Power Minister Nitin Raut had last week said the Maharashtra government was considering a proposal to provide free electricity to domestic users whose monthly consumption is up to 100 units.

The proposal is on the lines of the 100% subsidy being given to domestic consumers in power tariff up to 200 units by the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi.

However, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar later said that such a plan might not be feasible in Maharashtra at present.

“Power usage up to 100 units can be made free for domestic consumers if we follow the Delhi government pattern. The basic requirement for this is accountability. The poorer sections of society will benefit from it,” Mr. Desarda said.

When asked about the likely loss to the State exchequer, Mr. Desarda said only 5% consumers fall in this (poor) category in Maharashtra, while people from other stratas of society can bear these expenses without any major burden.

“The government agencies spend a lot of time and energy recovering money from these consumers. The move will help save their efforts and an automatic controller can curb malpractices,” Mr. Desarda said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/providing-100-units-of-free-power-feasible-economist/article30806442.ece

Mr. Habika was involved in the murder of TDP MLA Kidari Sarveswar Rao and former MLA of the same party Siveri Soma in 2018 in Visakhapatnam. As per police records, he was involved in several incidents of violence, including murders, arson and exchanges of fire with security forces.

93,2020/02/13,Madhya Pradesh grapples with spiralling neonatal deaths,"Staff crunch, low community referrals major factors: National Health Mission

Madhya Pradesh has recorded the highest percentage of newborn deaths of 11.5% against the total admissions to government-run sick newborn care units (SNCUs) in the past three years across the country, a rate ominously spiralling since 2017, according to the National Health Mission (NHM). The country’s average is 7%.

Although admissions of neonates (under 28 days) in the State have dropped from April 2017 to December 2019 — remaining lower than West Bengal, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh — the percentage of deaths at 12.2% surpassed Bihar’s last year. Meanwhile, West Bengal, where 34,344 neonatal deaths occurred in the period, the most in the country, the declining percentage of deaths from 9.2% in 2017 to 8.9% in 2019 coincided with a slump in admissions.

Several factors

Staff crunch, low community referrals, absence of a special neonatal transport service to health centres, reliance on units in cities as last resort and the non-availability of enough units to cater to increasing institutional deliveries had contributed to the spike in the percentage of deaths, said Dr. Saloni Sidana, Additional Mission Director, NHM State unit.

“We have just half of the required staff nurse strength at the units across the State. For instance, in the Jabalpur unit, there are only 14 against a required 22 nurses,” she said. “Recently, 700 nurses were recruited.”

The crunch is magnified as only one against the required five (82% shortfall) of surgeons, gynaecologists, physicians and paediatricians is available at hospitals. While 4,074 doctors were in position in March 2019, 18,422 more are required, reveals the NHM data.

“Reasons for neonatal deaths are more clinical than other child deaths,” said Dr. Vandana Prasad, community paediatrician and of the Public Health Resource Network. “The younger the baby is, more specialised intervention is required.”

Time crucial

As the units are located at hospitals with the delivery load of more than 3,000 infants per year, mostly in District Headquarters, transporting neonates on time is crucial as they may succumb to fatal diseases within hours. “Although there is a dedicated service to transport pregnant women to hospitals from remote areas, there is none for neonates, who are mostly dependent on the 108 ambulance service,” said Dr. Sidana.

Moreover, she added, with increasing institutional deliveries in the State (80.8% as per the National Family Health Survey-4, 2015-2016), the number of neonatal care units, being optimally utilised, had not been increased proportionally.

There was no system of continuity of care, said Dr. Prasad. She added, “The health of children and mothers is not tracked in a systematic way by one platform, and services are often given randomly.”

The major challenge, however, remained community referrals, significantly aided by ASHA workers — only one in ten sick neonates born outside a hospital is taken to an SNCU. “This is due to the absence of transport, inability to identify a disease by parents, and lack of awareness,” said Dr. Sidana.

Abysmal sex ratio

Madhya Pradesh has also recorded an abysmal sex ratio in admissions — of 663 (number of girls admitted against 1,000 boys) in the three years against the country average of 733, though its sex ratio was 931 as per the 2011 census. “In almost three fourths of the cases relating to boys, more admissions can be attributed to the prevailing bias against the girl child in society,” said an NHM official, requesting anonymity, “While other cases can be attributed to better immunity among girl children to combat diseases.”

In Bhopal, the capital city of Madhya Pradesh, one in every five children admitted to a unit died in the three years — the highest death percentage of 19.9% in the State, ten times above the NHM’s mandated key performance indicator of below 2%. Meanwhile, in 31 of 51 districts, mostly tribal and having low nutrition and maternal health levels, have a death percentage of more than 10.

Urban areas higher

“Urban areas report a higher death percentage as they offer tertiary care, and admit several serious cases from peripheral districts,” said the official, who stated that several districts had under-reported deaths, too. “In order to improve neonatal mortality rate, many notorious units admit fit patients, only to discharge them within hours. If we go by actual figures, Madhya Pradesh has a death percentage of close to 15%,” the official said.

The case of underreporting is illustrated by the NHM’s Child Health Review 2019-2020, which spotlights 43 districts where government officials didn’t report more than 50% of deaths of children under five, to falsely jack up their score.

Sachin Jain, of Vikas Samvad, a non-profit in Bhopal, said, “More than 70% neonatal deaths occur within the first week, most within 48 hours. When the first week passes, the probability of survival increases. Therefore, when the number of institutional deliveries are increasing, the child is the unit’s responsibility. Blaming everything on the community and lack of awareness is a convenient way out for the NHM.”

Neonatal mortality

According to the Sample Registration System, neonatal deaths in India mainly occur owing to premature births and low birth weight (35.9%), pneumonia (16.9%), birth asphyxia and birth trauma (9.9%), other non-communicable diseases (7.9%), diarrhoea (6.7%), congenital anomalies(4.6%) and infections (4.2%).

Under the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, each country, including India, has aimed to bring down neonatal mortality to at least 12 per 1,000 live births. In 2018, it stood at 23 for India.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jyps3j/article30836864.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Lives-cut-shortcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/madhya-pradesh-grapples-with-spiralling-neonatal-deaths/article30805519.ece

95,2020/02/13,"Why not notify entire J&K as jail, asks Tarigami","No place to accommodate foreign delegations as guest houses are full of political detenus, says CPI(M) leader

Taking a dig at the Narendra Modi-led government, CPI(M) senior leader from Kashmir Yousuf Tarigami asked the government to notify entire Jammu and Kashmir as a jail so that it no longer has to convert hotels and guest houses as jail to accommodate the ever-growing list of political prisoners.

He was speaking at a press conference at the CPI(M) headquarters in Delhi on Wednesday.

“The government should notify Jammu and Kashmir as a central jail. Then they do not have to invoke the Public Safety Act [PSA] or force us to stay inside our homes or convert guest houses and hotels into detention centres.” He said the government is taking delegations to Kashmir, but they have no place to put them up as guest houses are full of political detenus.

Asked why Jammu and Kashmir despite six months of clampdown has not seen a public outcry or a Shaheen Bagh kind of protest, both Mr. Tarigami and party general secretary Sitaram Yechury said, “Jammu and Kashmir cannot have a Shaheen Bagh for similar reasons as there cannot be a Shaheen Bagh in Tihar jail”.

Slamming the government for invoking the draconian PSA against two former Chief Ministers — Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, Mr. Tarigami said the government has shown it’s moral bankruptcy. “The government will repent what it did to J&K. I am also saying all those people who clapped at the insult of Kashmir on August 5, where the entire community of Kashmir was humiliated, will repent it,” Mr. Tarigami said.

Both leaders questioned the government’s claims of normalcy since it has so far been unable to hold elections for the legislature. Mr. Yechury said in the absence of an elected government, the allotment of land for various projects is legally questionable.

Mr. Yechury also said the delegations from Jammu and Ladhak regions meeting him were concerned about their rights that they enjoyed in the past and under Article 35 A.

“Till the time the Supreme Court does not decide on the petitions challenging the abrogation of Article 370 and 35 A, the Jammu and Kashmir administration should not take decisions like giving government land to individuals and trusts from different States. Such decisions cannot be legally sustainable,” he said.

Welcoming the AAP’s victory in the Delhi Assembly elections, Mr. Tarigami said the people of the national capital have shown some light in the “regime of darkness”. “We have no trust in the government, but we trust the wisdom of the people of this country who have expressed it time and again. What happened yesterday in Delhi gives us hope. The victory is the light in this regime of darkness,” he said congratulating the people of Delhi.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/why-not-notify-entire-jk-as-jail-asks-tarigami/article30805076.ece

97,2020/02/13,"Cong. protests LPG price hike, Rahul tweets a throwback picture","The price has been hiked about six times since August 2019, says Mahila Congress

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday took a dig at the BJP over the LPG cylinder price hike by tweeting a throwback picture of the BJP leaders protesting against the hike during the Congress-led UPA era.

“I agree with these members of the BJP as they protest the astronomical ₹150 price hike in LPG cylinders,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted along with the picture of the leaders that included Smriti Irani in the frame.

The former Congress chief used the hashtag #RollBackHike as the women of his party protested across the country over the issue.

In Delhi, a delegation of women leaders including former Lok Sabha MP Sushmita Dev and former MLA Alka Lamba submitted a memorandum in the Petoleum Ministery.

When the delegation was stopped at the gate of the Shastri Bhavan by the security personnel, they resorted to a flash strike.

“The price has been hiked about six times since August 2019. It is extremely insensitive on the part of the government. It comes as a surprise that the BJP leaders who held shrill press meets when they were in the Opposition to protest the price of the LPG gas during the UPA government are today silent. It is also shocking that when the entire country is reeling under the shock of the economic crises and unemployment, a basic commodity like LPG has been made so expensive,” a statement from the All India Mahila Congress said.

“The Prime Minister takes great pride in the fact that crores of people have given up their gas subsidy for the poor. Now affording the non-subsidised gas has become extremely difficult for the citizens. It is more shocking that within 24 hours of the Delhi election results, the BJP government has increased the price. Is this revenge for their crushing defeat?” it asked.

On Wednesday, the government had announced a steep hike of ₹144.5 for every LPG cylinder due to the spurt in the benchmark global rates of the fuel.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/y0dak5/article30571111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14-SANDEEP-RAG1V6VSJS03jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-flays-lpg-price-hike/article30804895.ece
98,2020/02/13,"₹81.67 crore worth electoral bonds sold before Delhi polls, says response to RTI query","Scheme attracted criticism for lack of transparency in political funding.

In the run-up to the Delhi Assembly Elections, 139 electoral bonds worth ₹81.67 crore were sold by various branches of SBI, according to the response to an RTI query filed by Commodore Lokesh Batra (Retd.)

In the 13th phase of bond sales, between January 13 to 22, the largest number (43) were sold by the Kolkata branch, though the majority (89) were encashed at the New Delhi branch, said the RTI response from the SBI.

Of the bonds issued, 78 were the denomination of ₹1 crore while 34 bonds worth ₹10 lakh each were issued. The remaining 27 bonds were worth ₹1 lakh each. No bonds were issued in the lower denominations of ₹1,000 and ₹10,000. All bonds sold were redeemed.

The electoral bonds scheme has been criticised by the Opposition parties as well as the civil society groups for a lack of transparency in political funding, as the donor remains anonymous. So far, ₹6,210 crore have been donated through this method since the scheme began.

The Hindu Explains: What is an electoral bond and how do we get one? | Use of electoral bonds for Delhi polls worries activists | The opacity around electoral bonds

It is not known which parties are the recipients of these bonds sold in January 2020. However, an analysis of the 2018-19 accounts of major political parties by election watchdog Association of Democratic Reforms has shown that the biggest beneficiary so far has been the BJP.

The ADR is the petitioner in an ongoing case on the scheme in the Supreme Court. In its November 2019 plea, it had asked for a stay. However, on January 20, the apex court declined to issue a stay, despite concerns being raised about anonymous donations and opaque funding during the Delhi polls.

“This was the apprehension we had expressed, that more unaccounted money will go to political parties for the Delhi elections, without the voter knowing who has given the money to whom. The SC did not take us seriously, and now this data showing that ₹81 crore worth of bonds were sold has validated our fears,” said ADR founder Jagdeep Chhokar. He said though the scheme was originally formulated for the Lok Sabha polls, the window for the sale of bonds had repeatedly been opened before the Assembly elections as well.

The Supreme Court has not set a date for the next hearing but had given the Election Commission of India two weeks to submit its response. In its submission last week, the ECI said it had received sealed covers from 105 political parties with details of funds received through electoral bonds till date. Apart from recognised national and State political parties, the list includes 71 registered unrecognised parties. It also includes four “unidentified address of political parties”, according to the affidavit filed by the Commission.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1ywrfy/article30805348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FL10sbielectoralbond,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8167-cr-worth-electoral-bonds-sold-before-delhi-polls-rti-query-shows/article30804578.ece

In the first phase of the budget session, the Rajya Sabha recorded 96% productivity with 155 members getting a chance to speak in a largely disruption-free session with a loss of only 96 minutes in its scheduled nine sittings.

The Upper House functioned for a total of 38 hours and 30 minutes as against the scheduled available time of 41 hours and 10 minutes. While the House lost 5 hours and 32 minutes on February 3, 2020 due to disruptions and forced adjournments, the members sat for 3 hours and 56 minutes beyond the scheduled time, resulting in a net loss of one hour 36 minutes of the scheduled time.

Though the House was scheduled to have 9 sittings, not much business could be taken up as per the convention on the first two days of the session as the House was adjourned after the address of President to the joint session of Parliament and after laying of budget papers on the table of the House on the second day. On the third day, business could not be transacted due to disruptions.

100,2020/02/13,SC considers plea for reinstatement by former district judge,"She had resigned after raising sexual harassment allegations against a judge of Madhya Pradesh High Court

The Supreme Court on Wednesday considered the plea for reinstatement by a former district judge from Madhya Pradesh who resigned after she raised sexual harassment allegations against a judge of the State High Court.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde heard the former additional judge’s lawyer and senior advocate Indira Jaising.

The court enquired whether the woman judge was willing to accept a post in any other State if she is reinstated.

Impeccable record

Ms. Jaising submitted that her client owns an impeccable service record and is willing to take up a post in any northern State. The senior lawyer explained that her client had to resign owing to her inability to accept a transfer from Gwalior, where she was then posted, due to personal reasons.

In 2015, a three-member committee of judges led by Justice R. Banumathi, set up by the Rajya Sabha, had criticised her transfer.

Ms. Jaising said her client now only wished to retain her seniority in service and continue in her profession. She wanted to “move on.” She was even willing to forego the remuneration for the period she was not in service.

Asking the Madhya Pradesh High Court Registrar General to consider her plea, the court commended the former judge for her “right attitude” and hoped for a peaceful resolution. Ms. Jaising was asked to furnish a list of places the former district judge would like to be accommodated. The court then adjourned the case to March.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-considers-plea-for-reinstatement-by-former-district-judge/article30804390.ece
101,2020/02/13,Andhra University professors facing charges of sexual harassment bound over by police,"Action taken based on media reports and complaints received by university registrar

Two Andhra University professors who are facing sexual harassment allegations have been bound over under Section 41/109 CrPC by the city police, in Visakhapatnam on Thursday.

Addressing a press conference, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP-Zone I) S. Ranga Reddy said that the III Town police have bound over K. Ramesh Babu, associate professor of Marine Living Resources (MLR) Department, and R. Swamy Das, head of Social Work Department.

Though no complaints have been lodged against the professors, the police said they have taken action based on media reports and complaints received by AU Registrar V. Krishna Mohan.

The DCP said Prof. Ramesh Babu’s wife had lodged a dowry harassment case against him at III Town police station a week ago. “During the investigation, we found out that the professor is in an extramarital affair with a research scholar,” he told the media.

Meanwhile, students from the Social Work Department have lodged a complaint with the university administration, alleging that Prof. Swamy Das had been making abusive, vulgar and double entendre comments in the classroom, according to the DCP.

“The two professors were taken into custody on Thursday morning and produced before the Mandal Executive Magistrate in Seethammadhara. Executive bonds were written pertaining to their behaviour. The professors will be under watch. We will write about the investigation findings to Vice-Chancellor P.V.G.D. Prasad Reddy,” Mr. Ranga Reddy said.

Arrest likely

The DCP said that the dowry case against Prof. Ramesh Babu is being investigated and he is likely to be arrested soon.

The police officer appealed to students and research scholars to come forward if they are facing any harassment from their professors or guides. He said that details of the students will be kept confidential and action will be initiated against the perpetrators.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1twf7m/article27585309.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07VZ3ANDHRAUNIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/au-professors-facing-charges-of-sexual-harassment-bound-over-by-police/article30813854.ece
102,2020/02/13,‘Universities and colleges must start using technologies’,"Bad example will be set for students if institutions don’t implement technology they teach, says Special Chief Secretary

Expressing dissatisfaction over the non-implementation of technologies in the very universities where it is being taught, Special Chief Secretary (Higher Education) Satish Chandra asked all 16 State-run universities and technological universities, both State-run and private, to be a model for students first and then teach new technology.

Speaking at the inauguration of the Second Tech VCs’ Conclave 2020 at JNTU Anantapur on Thursday, Mr. Satish Chandra said that it was painful to see Registrars and Vice-Chancellors of even technological universities spending hours on voluminous files of hard copies and not concentrating on academics. Office work can be simplified by e-Office and automating several approvals by framing rules and incorporating them into the software so that approval is obtained automatically.

Describing technology as a dynamic change agent, Mr. Satish Chandra said that by the time a student graduates from university, the technology that he/she has learnt becomes outdated. The curriculum should therefore be adaptable to current industry needs and available technology, so that the courses look futuristic. He also advised Vice-Chancellors to deliberate on how practically these technologies could be implemented in pedagogy, day-to-day lectures, and administration of the university.

“If the universities themselves cannot implement the technology they teach, a bad example is being set for the students,” he observed.

The Association of Indian Universities secretary general Pankaja Mittal said that Andhra Pradesh had 31% Gross Enrolment Ratio in higher education, as compared to the national average of 27.5%, but this needs to further improve. National Board of Accreditation chairman K.K. Aggarwal said that universities should strive for excellence rather than perfection.

Perfection leads to complacency once it is achieved, but excellence is everlasting and there is no end to it, he said.

The first Vice-Chancellor of JNTU, Y, Venkatarami Reddy, expressed concern over the lack of quality among the vice-chancellors and registrars and the rot must be stemmed in the education system, he said. Quality of students’ education must improve every year, but instead has been deteriorating, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/universities-and-colleges-must-start-using-technologies/article30813847.ece
103,2020/02/13,"New fee structure for schools, junior colleges by April-end","Ground work has already begun, says regulatory panel secretary

The government will come up with new fee structure for schools and junior colleges in the State by April-end and the first step towards that was taken on Thursday by conducting surprise checks on 10 such private educational institutions in each district, said Aluru Sambasiva Reddy, secretary of the Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission.

At a press conference here on Thursday, Mr. Sambasiva Reddy said the government was getting information/data about the infrastructure, staff position, fee structure, number of students and expenditure on each student. A team of two persons of Mandal Education Officer rank would visit one institution for the entire day and cross-check all facilities on these parameters in a prescribed pro forma of the Commission, Mr. Sambasiva Reddy said.

Any private educational institution following any stream or syllabus of any board of education, would come under the purview of the commission. If they violate the norms, penalties or suspension of licence would be the punishment, he said. The teacher-student ratio, the amount spent on each student vis-a-vis the amount of fee collected from each student would be taken into account in rural, semi-urban and metro cities and grading of schools done depending on quality of teaching staff and infrastructure.

While some schools in Anantapur district were inspected by officials from Kurnool, a similar exercise was taken up in 130 schools all over the State and on Friday, 10 junior colleges in each district would be inspected and this would become a year-long routine from now on, he said.

Training for teachers

Meanwhile, Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh visited a training centre in Bukkarayasamudram mandal to witness the conduct of refresher programme for school teachers. The Minister said one lakh teachers would be trained in English teaching skills before the beginning of the next academic year.

A bridge course would be organised for students from Classes 4 and above and starter course for students from Classes 1 to 3, who will learn the language for the first time.

104,2020/02/13,90% corporate schools fail to make the grade,"Monitoring panel conducts surprise checks in Chittoor, Kadapa districts

Members of the Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERMC) conducted surprise visits on a number of schools in Chittoor and Kadapa districts on Thursday. The series of raids was meant to find out the gaping holes in infrastructure and chinks in the academic system, in a bid to alert the authorities for corrective action.

The raids revealed that almost 90% of the corporate private schools failed to maintain the minimum standards in terms of student-teacher ratio, classroom space, fee structure and failed even on the civic infrastructure front such as playground, sanitation, fitness of buses, different entry/exit routes, fire safety certificate, etc.

Led by its member V. Narayana Reddy, a retired professor at Sri Venkateswara University, the panel comprising 30 members, raided several schools in Railway Kodur, Rajampet, Kadapa and Proddatur towns. They even interacted with teachers and students to confirm the lapses, if any. Most of the teachers were found to be under-qualified and the corporate schools were learnt to be charging exorbitant fee ranging from ₹60,000 to ₹1.20 lakh from each student in the garb of ‘special focus’, ‘techno’, ‘super classrooms,’ etc.

The raids assume significance as they happened in the district represented by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan mohan Reddy. “It is for this very reason that the panel wants to act tough on the violations, as the government has earmarked the highest spending for the field of education,” Prof. Reddy told The Hindu. Only the presence of required infrastructure and the right academic ambience would help attract students to schools and reduce dropout rate, besides ensuring the success of the flagship programmes like ‘Amma Vodi’ and ‘Gorumudda’, the panel member observed.

Tough message

Post-raid, the schools would be given an opportunity for explanation before the committee, which was formed through a legislative Act and having judicial powers. The managements would also be given a chance to mend their ways in the next three months, failing they would be closed down from the next academic year, Prof. Reddy said.

A similar raid was conducted on ten schools in Tirupati simultaneously, in which Education Department officials from Kadapa district took part.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/332od8/article30813830.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14VJPG4-RAID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/90-corporate-schools-fail-to-make-the-grade/article30813831.ece

Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council and senior Telugu Desam Party leader Yanamala Ramakrishudu has asserted that the YSR Congress Party government will feel the power of the Council in the ensuing budget session.

Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu said Council members would not remain mute spectators if the government acted according to its whims and fancies.

The Centre alone has the right to abolish or revive the Legislative Council of State under Article 169 of the Constitution. The Council has members from five categories, including teachers, graduates, local bodies and Governor quota.

“Would the Rajya Sabha also be abolished if it rejects the Bills passed by the Lok Sabha?” he asked.

He wondered why the government was afraid of constituting the select committee to study the Bills relating to repeal of CRDA and decentralisation of administration. The ruling party members were well aware of the difference between a money Bill and a general Bill. The 14-day rule was applicable only to money Bills. Even if the Bill was not referred to the select committee, it would be the property of the Council for four months, he said.

‘Doubts over CM’s Delhi visits’

Referring to the Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s visit to Delhi, the former Finance Minister said that the CM had failed to get any funds even after seven visits to Delhi.

“He has met Mr. Modi three times and Home Minister Amit Shah four times till date. The details of his visit to Delhi are kept top secret and not revealed even under the RTI Act.”

In its search and seizure operations in Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Pune, Kadapa Visakhapatnam and Delhi on February 6, the Income-Tax Department (ITD) detected the siphoning of more than ₹2,000 crore through transactions layered across multiple entities.

The turnovers of the last ones in that chain were found to be less than ₹2 crore, which was to avoid maintenance of books of accounts, tax audits etc., according to an official release.

The I-T department stated that more than 40 premises were covered and three prominent infrastructure groups based in Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) and Telangana were among the entities which were searched.

Investigation led to the busting of a major racket of cash generation through bogus sub-contractors, over-invoicing and bogus billing.

Documents seized

Several incriminating documents and papers were found and seized during the searches.

The I-T Department also stumbled on emails, WhatsApp messages and unexplained foreign transactions.

Close associates, including the ex-personal secretary of a prominent person, were among those whose premises were searched.

The ITD release further stated that the infrastructure companies subcontracted works to several nonexistent/bogus entities. Such entities were either not found at their registered addresses or were found to be shell entities.

Several such sub-contractors were controlled by the principal contractors with their I-T return filings and other compliances done from the IP addresses of their main corporate offices.

Many woman are suffering harassment silently and rise in attacks on women across the country is a major cause for concern, according to Civil Supplies Minister Kodali Sri Venkateswara Rao (Nani).

The Minister, along with Eluru Range Deputy Inspector-General (DIG) of Police A.S. Khan, Krishna District Superintendent of Police M. Ravindranath Babu inaugurated the Mahila Mitra awareness programme at Gudivada in the district on Thursday.

“Owing to social stigma and non-cooperation from the family members, woman are not coming forward to complain against the violence, torture and harassment. The government is ready to take action against those who harass woman and punish the accused severely,” said the Minister.

“Police will keep the details of the victims confidential and take action against the miscreants. There is no need for women to come to the stations and the victims can just lodge a complaint through ‘Disha App,” said Mr. Venkateswara Rao.

Mr. Khan, while explaining the incident in an APSRTC bus and the response of the police for the complaint lodged through ‘Disha App’, appealed to the women to download the App and make use of it.

The SP said Mahila Mitra committees were formed in all mandals and at each police station level in Krishna district. Mahila Mitra would act as a bridge between the public and the police and the investigation officers would visit the houses, enquire about the incident, take complaint and do justice to the victims, Mr. Ravindranath said.

108,2020/02/13,Rise of renewable energy impacts RTPP fortunes,"It can still be put back on track, APSEB engineers tell expert panel

The 1,650-MW Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant (RTPP) at Kadapa bore the brunt of the State’s Renewable Energy (RE) capacities overshooting the Renewable Power Purchase Obligation (RPPO). RTPP had consistently operated at 70% to 80% Plant Load Factor (PLF) till 2015 when the share of wind and solar power in the total energy mix started increasing rapidly.

All thermal power plants have since been adversely affected by the rising RE generation, especially the RTPP which has certain other factors also that pushed it into the red. Still, it (RTPP) can be revived by taking some remedial measures.

This was the opinion which the APSEB Engineers' and Assistant Electrical Engineers’ Associations conveyed to the four-member expert committee constituted by the State government in early January to examine the problems being faced by RTPP and suggest steps to overcome them.

Associations’ president M. Vedavyasa Rao and Vamsi Srinivas stated in their communication to the committee that the thermal units’ heat rate, auxiliary consumption, specific coal and oil consumption and wear and tear have increased as a consequence of their (plants’) operation at low loads in the wake of injection of a large quantity of RE into the grid.

This had its impact on the RTPP, whose PLF stood at just 46% in 2018-19 and plummeted to 21% in 2019. They cited the sudden addition of RE power beyond the RPPO, procurement of premium coal at a high cost and poor quality of the coal as the three major reasons for the increase in the RTPP’s cost of generation.

The APSEB engineers have suggested that with 100% materialisation of fuel supply from Mahanadi Coalfields and Singareni Collieries, the RTPP could be operated at 90% PLF and that the diversion of 1.88 million tonnes per annum under the flexible raw coal scheme should be discontinued from 2020-21.

They also advised that the Singareni Collieries Company Limited should be asked to supply only G-12 to G-15 grades to the RTPP to reduce the cost and variations in quality.

Long-term contracts

Besides, long-term imported contracts should be made with foreign suppliers directly without the involvement of middlemen to ensure proper quantity and quality at affordable prices.

As per a Central Electricity Authority recommendation, the RTPP was best suited for flexible thermal energy generation and that was probably the reason for NTPC showing interest in taking it (RTPP) over because its small size generators (210-MW) were advantageous for flexible generation, the engineers observed.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rise-of-renewable-energy-impacts-rtpp-fortunes/article30812480.ece
109,2020/02/13,Four railway stations in Andhra Pradesh converted into energy neutral,"They meet their requirement by tapping solar power

Four railway stations in the State -- Ontimitta, Kadiyam, Dwarapudi, and Godavari -- have been converted into ‘energy neutral’ by the South Central Railway (SCR). The energy neutral stations are capable of meeting their full energy requirement by tapping solar power through Solar Photovoltaic (SP) panels, according to an official release.

The SCR has taken the lead in the country in harnessing the potential of solar power by converting total 13 railway stations. The stations are four in A.P., and Ghatkesar, Dharur, Raghunadhapalli, Mellacheruvu, Dharmabad, Sivungaon, Umri, Karkheli, and Bolsa in Telangana into ‘energy neutral’.

Ontimitta is in Kadapa-Renigunta section of Guntakal division and the other three stations are in Rajahmundry-Duvvada and Nidadavolu-Rajahmundry sections in Vijayawada division.

The concept of energy neutral stations, which has been aggressively pushed by SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya, is based on the principle of developing railway station buildings with total solar power tapping capabilities commensurate to their exact load requirements.

The SP panels on the rooftops are integrated with the on-grid or off-grid solar energy plants to derive power supply to the entire station.

The total capacity of solar plants installed at the 13 energy neutral stations is 99 kWp costing around ₹50 lakh. An anticipated energy generation of 1.30 lakh units annually is expected to yield a saving of ₹13 lakh.

Besides, the generation of clean solar energy facilitates a reduction in the carbon footprint to the tune of 1,170 tons per annum.

All the power needs of the energy neutral stations like lighting, fans, pumps, and other electrical appliances are met by the solar energy generated by them, which brings down the net traditional energy consumption at these stations to zero.

Significant strides

The SCR zone has made significant strides in the adoption of green energy by commissioning solar power plants of 8.20 MWp capacity, solar hybrid plants with 1.75 KWp capacity, a 2.18 lakh litres per day solar water heating facility, a 570 kWp water pumping system and 52 KW-equivalent day pipe lighting system at its offices.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xam302/article30746252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6BMRAILBUDGET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/four-railway-stations-in-state-converted-into-energy-neutral/article30812338.ece

Minister for Women Development and Child Welfare Taneti Vanita raised a complaint of forgery of her official letterhead and signature by a person in Kadapa district with the Minister for Home M. Sucharitha and Director General of Police (DGP) D. Gautam Sawang on Thursday.

Ms. Vanita, in the complaint stated that a man named M. Reddeppa of Devalampeta village, Chinnamandedam mandal of YSR Kadapa district had submitted a forged letter to the District Collector seeking 1.2 acres of government land in the village to establish a small scale industry.

Seeks stern action

“This is a very serious matter. I request you to probe the matter and take stern action against the culprits so that such instances should not recur,” Ms. Vanita said in the letter to the DGP and Home Minister.

The ‘recommendation’ letter was brought to the notice of Ms. Vanita’s office by the Collectorate, and it was found that the letter was not genuine prompting Ms. Vanita to immediately raise a complaint.

The complaint will likely be forwarded to the Kadapa district by the DGP’s office for further investigation.

111,2020/02/13,Parties speak in one voice on Ramayapatnam port project,"‘No progress so far on the project’

Leaders cutting across party lines urged the Union and State governments to work in close coordination to facilitate setting up of a major public sector port at Ramayapatnam. A roundtable convened by Prakasam District Development Forum president Ch. Ranga Rao on Wednesday noted that both the governments had expressed keenness to get the project going, but no progress had been achieved so far.

The YSR Congress Party government should seize the offer made by the NDA government to develop a central port in a place suggested by the State government as an alternative to the site at Dugarajapatnam, they said before submitting a memorandum to the two governments through district Collector P. Bhaskar.

112,2020/02/13,Chaitanya yatra: Roja lashes out at Naidu,"‘People will not be carried away by his deceptive tactics’

YSRCP’s Nagari MLA R.K. Roja has appealed to TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu to compliment Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for implementing a slew of welfare schemes and steering the State on the path of development and not indulge in mud-slinging for political gain.

Addressing the media here on Wednesday, Ms. Roja said people of the State were heaving a sigh of relief after having undergone several ordeals during the TDP rule. Referring to Mr. Naidu’s programme to embark on ‘Chaitanya yatra’, Ms. Roja said, “ With what face will Mr. Naidu undertake the tour after voting against the proposal to set up three capitals? The people of the State are intelligent, and I am sure they will not be carried away by his deceptive tactics.”

“Though there are lakhs of beneficiaries under every welfare scheme , it is unfortunate that Mr. Naidu is indulging either in mudslinging or in politicising them to serve his political interests,” Mr. Roja alleged.

She also charged Mr. Naidu with trying to downplay the Disha police stations and Disha App, which were aimed at protecting women and school and college-going girls.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/3h1cvw/article30807226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13VJPG4-ROJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/chaitanya-yatra-roja-lashes-out-at-naidu/article30807227.ece

114,2020/02/13,TTD lifts restrictions on sale of ‘big laddus’,"Pilgrims can buy any number of them at ₹200 each

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has resolved to lift restrictions on the sale of big laddus and make them freely available to devotees at its counters.

TTD Additional EO A.V. Dharma Reddy told The Hindu on Wednesday that the big laddus (popularly known as Kalyanotsavam laddus) have a great demand among pilgrims. Devotees also attach vast sentiments to the laddus stuffed with rich ingredients such as cardamom, cashew nuts, dry grapes, ghee, sugar candy and other raisins. It is for this reason that the laddus were sold at exorbitant rates in the black market.

With a wish to protect the vast sentiments of the pilgrims (attached to the big laddus) and at the same time check its sales in the black market, the management had decided to make it freely available.

Devotees can now purchase their desired number of laddus without any kind of recommendation at its original cost price of ₹200 each. On an experimental basis, the management has decided to maintain a buffer stock of at least 10,000 laddus every day, Mr. Reddy added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dcruna/article30806476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TH-LADDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ttd-lifts-restrictions-on-sale-of-big-laddus/article30806477.ece

Challenges and opportunities thrown up by the advent of disruptive technologies will come up for detailed discussions at the two-day annual national conference of the Computer Society of India (CSI) that will be held here on February 20 and 21.

Being hosted by the Visakhapatnam chapter of CSI in association with Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited at Hotel Gateway, the conference will attract 10 domain experts of national repute along with nearly 400 delegates including 75 students from across the country.

The theme of the conference is ‘Edge Computing, Process Automation through Robotics, Industry 4.0 and Cognitive Technology’ (EPIC-2020).

“We will have separate sessions on smart industries, Internet of Things, cognitive computing, robotics and artificial intelligence,” CSI Visakhapatnam chapter chairman and RINL director (Personnel) K.C. Das told reporters here on Wednesday.

He said that the conference assumes significance as Visakhapatnam has been identified as a major smart city to be developed as an IT hub. The main objective of the event was to bring IT professionals, researchers, academia, students, NGOs, MNCs, and government departments on a common platform, he added.

Sharing of ideas

“The event will help in sharing of ideas and knowledge on how disruptive technologies are changing today’s society and industry,” Mr. Das said, adding that the conference would be an ideal platform to foster a ‘developmental dialogue’ between the leaders of today and the leaders of tomorrow.

RINL CMD P.K. Rath will be the chief guest at the event. Principal Secretary (IT) Kona Sashidhar will deliver the keynote address. Visakhapatnam Port Trust chairman K. Ram Mohan Rao has agreed to be the chief guest at the valedictory.

116,2020/02/13,Missing baby found dead by sniffer dogs,"The 2-year-old’s mother claimed she died of hunger

The missing case of two-year-old K. Gnanasa ended on a tragic note, with police retrieving the baby’s body on top of the Duvvapalem hill at Pendurthi, here on Wednesday morning.

About 20 policemen from the Quick Response Team (QRT) and two dog squads, along with Armed Reserve Police were searching for the baby since Monday.

Police launched the search for the baby after a Railway employee K. Appa Rao lodged a complaint with the Pendurthi police stating that his wife Kusumalatha had left home on February 6 along with their daughter Gnanasa, and was nowhere to be found. Kusumalatha reportedly left home following a dispute with her husband, according to police.

On February 10, Kusumalatha was found unconscious on a hill near Duvvapalem by some locals, who informed the police. However, when she was asked by the police about her daughter, Kusumalatha said that the baby had died of hunger and claimed that she had buried the body atop the hill.

Police then launched an extensive search for the body and brought in sniffer dogs to trace the body. Pendurthi Inspector G. Surya Narayana registered a case.

The baby’s body has been sent for post-mortem.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/missing-baby-found-dead-by-sniffer-dogs/article30804694.ece
117,2020/02/13,Thousands of tribals gather for land rights in Visakha Agency,"Public meeting held in Paderu to demand proper implementation of constitutional provisions and legislations

Thousands of Adivasis congregated in Paderu in Visakhapatnam district on Wednesday at a public meeting to demand that constitutional provisions and legislations for the protection of their rights be implemented in earnest.

Tribals from 11 mandals of the Agency area of Visakhapatnam as well as from East and West Godavari, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram districts assembled at the Junior College grounds in Paderu for the Adivasi Atmagaurava Sabha to put forth their demands and assert their rights.

The Joint Action Committee for Protection of Rights of Adivasis (JAC) demanded that the land held by non-Adivasis as properties and business establishments in contravention of the Land Transfer Act be returned to the Adivasis.

The flashpoint of Wednesday’s protests was the reservation of seats in the upcoming local body elections for non-Adivasi communities. The JAC had first protested in January against the same and had obtained a stay from the High Court on the issue.

The movement is gaining steam and the JAC plans to take it forward with awareness campaigns and further protests.

‘Tourism a nuisance’

The JAC also raised concerns about the increasing number of tourist establishments held by non-locals in Araku valley. They alleged that the presence of these establishments is destroying the pristine environment and the culture of the valley, creating an unsafe environment for women, and is intruding upon their privacy. Among other major demands put forth are: detection and deletion of illegally-held ST certificates in the region, and removal of non-Adivasis holding jobs reserved for Adivasis.

Speaking at the meeting, Ramarao Dora, convener of JAC said, “Land and resource grabbing in the Fifth Schedule region by the non-Adivasis has increased over the past decade. Despite protective legislations, little has been done to protect our rights.”

“Tourism is becoming a nuisance for us. Not only that, Adivasis only get daily wage jobs or lower rung employment at these establishments whereas the non-Adivasis make profits out of it by holding it under benami ownership,” he said.

Former Union Secretary E.A.S. Sarma spoke about the primacy of the Gram Sabha in the Fifth Schedule areas. Among those who attended and spoke at the public meeting in solidarity were V.S. Krishna of Human Rights Forum and JAC functionaries from Munchingput, Pedabayulu, Araku and Ananthagiri.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/57quzh/article30804641.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-VJ-ADIVASIRIGHTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/thousands-of-tribals-gather-for-land-rights-in-visakha-agency/article30804642.ece
118,2020/02/13,Tenure of SIT probing Vizag land scam extended,"The term of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) constituted by the State government in October last to undertake fresh a inquiry into the alleged land scam in Vizag has been extended by three months.

The SIT comprising former IAS officers Vijay Kumar and Y.V. Anuradha and retired district and sessions judge T Bhaskara Rao was initially asked to submit its report within three months from the date of appointment.

It was asked to probe into all cases of change of classification of government land in revenue records or web-land, all cases of assignments made to ex-servicemen or political sufferers where NOCs have been given for the sale of land based on fraudulent certificates, government land grabbing by private individuals and encroached government land by tampering of land records.

150-page report

The SIT, led by Mr. Vijay Kumar, submitted a 150-page report to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy in the last week of January and also had requested for extended time to complete the investigation.

The government, in an order issued on Wednesday, said after careful examination it had been decided to extend the tenure of the

SIT and it shall submit its report within the extended period.

The SIT till date has received 1,368 petitions. It has gone through 278 cases and in 137 cases, it was waiting for reports from the officials concerned.

About 62 petitions were rejected due to lack of proper details and petitions related to 22A were referred to the Collector for further action.

119,2020/02/13,"Kadapa police bust cybercrime racket, arrest seven persons","The gang was operating at the local level as well as in Delhi

The Kadapa police arrested seven persons who were part of a cybercrime racket that had operations at the local level as well as in Delhi.

A woman from Mydukur had lodged a complaint of online fraud, after which the Kadapa police took up the investigation leading to the busting of the gang.

In her complaint, Giddaluru Umadevi of Mydukur town said that a man claiming to be an agent of an insurance company called her and informed her that he had come to deliver a cheque for a bonus payment, but was unable to hand it over to her as she was not at home. The caller then said that he would transfer the money to her bank account, and on the pretext of confirming her identity, sought details of her ATM card. He also asked her to forward him the One-Time Password (OTP) that was delivered to her mobile phone.

No sooner did Ms. Umadevi reveal the details, an amount of ₹10,000 was debited from her account. Realising that she had been conned, Umadevi approached the Mydukur police, who registered a case under Section 66(D) of the IT Act.

The cybercrime cell at Kadapa, which took up the investigation, zeroed in on Veera Nagaiah and arrested him. Upon interrogation, Nagaiah said that he and three of hsi friends Murali Yadav, Ravi and Ramana, were offered jobs by a man named Siva of Mydukur in a Delhi-based call centre, with a monthly salary of ₹13,000 and free boarding and lodging. Their job was to call up random people and offer to sell Ayurvedic products or mobile phones at throwaway prices. They would try to ascertain details of bank accounts from gullible people and then pass on these details to Sumit Bansali, Sivaratri Karthik and Narala Karthik, who ran the call centre and are known to have committed cybercrimes in the past.

The four, on returning to the State recently, followed the same pattern and resorted to cyber crimes at the local level, this time in the guise of officials supervising DWCRA, Rythu Bharosa and Amma Vodi schemes. All four persons were arrested by the Kadapa police. Based on Veera Nagaiah’s confession, Kadapa SP K.K.N. Anburajan formed a special team which went to Delhi and arrested Sumit Bansali, Sivaratri Karthik and Narala Karthik.

“Since cybercrimes are on the rise, we once again request people not to disclose their bank account details to strangers,” Mr. Anburajan said at a press conference here on Wednesday.

Police also rescued 15 local youths who had gone to Delhi hoping to get a job at the same call centre and brought them back to Kadapa.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kadapa-police-bust-cybercrime-racket-arrest-seven-persons/article30804608.ece
120,2020/02/13,"Police, APSRTC launch detailed inquiry into Disha App complaint","Statements of driver, conductor and passengers will be recorded

The Eluru police have launched an inquiry into the alleged sexual harassment of a woman aboard a Visakhapatnam-Vijayawada APSRTC bus in the early hours of Tuesday.

A woman passenger lodged a complaint through the Disha App while on the bus, alleging that a co-passenger, sitting in a seat behind her, had misbehaved with her. Following the directions of West Godavari district Superintendent of Police Navdeep Singh Grewal, the Eluru III Town Police registered a ‘Zero FIR’ and commenced an investigation.

Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) O. Dilip Kiran, who is investigating the case, said the victim resisted and raised an alarm in the bus, forcing the driver to stop the vehicle on the roadside.

The suspect was produced in court and the judged asked for a notice to be served on him under Section 41 CrPc and follow the directions of the High Court in the Section 354 (A) IPC case.

Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) Visakhapatnam Regional Manager M.Y. Danam said on Wednesday that a departmental enquiry has been ordered into the incident.

“As it was a non-AC Super Luxury bus, there was no CCTV camera installed inside the vehicle. The depot manager has been directed to conduct an inquiry and submit a report. We will take the statements of other passengers on the bus,” Mr. Danam said.

Mr. Dileep said that the police will record statements of the driver and conductor as well as those of the passengers that were travelling on the bus.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/police-apsrtc-launch-detailed-inquiry-into-disha-app-complaint/article30804604.ece
121,2020/02/13,Wait for land survey is as long as 9 months in some districts,"1.31 lakh pre-survey cases pending in the State that has 3,650 surveyors

In many taluks of Belagavi and Haveri districts, among others, if a farmer in distress wishes to sell his land in a hurry, he may not be able to do so for about eight to nine months. For, the automated queue system is so long that his turn may come close to a year from the date of application. The reason for this pendency of cases for survey is owing to shortage of surveyors and the high number of applications. Without the podi (division of survey numbers into several sub-divisions), the farmer cannot sell land.

For example, in Hangal taluk of Haveri district, if a farmer applies for podi now, his ticket number would be 1,280, and surveyors would be assigned based on the number from the ascending order. Similar is the case in Athani taluk of Belagavi where the pendency is 1,064 while in Channagiri taluk of Davangere, there are 990 cases. In contrast, in at least 50 taluks across the State, the pendency of cases is nil, which means surveyors there do not have work. A land surveyor, according to a Government Order, has to complete 23 survey requests in a month.

In all, there are 1.31 lakh pre-survey cases pending in the State that has 3,650 surveyors. Belagavi has the highest with 17,814 cases, followed by Haveri and Davangere with 11,664 and 8,719 cases, respectively. Districts with high pendency cases include Bengaluru (7,169), Mysuru (6,502), Ramanagaram (5,950), Hassan (5,713), Vijayapura (4,707), and Kalaburagi (4,468).

The controversy

However, as attempts are being made to reduce the pendency of cases for land survey in several districts, especially in north Karnataka, it is now snowballing into a controversy, with a section of surveyors deputed to clear the pendency airing apprehension. The deputation — orders for which have been issued — to clear the pendency is temporary and for three months. As many as 90 surveyors have been deputed to clear pendency, and those would be replaced by another 90 for three months. The department hopes to bring the pendency levels to “normal” in about six months.

While the surveyors have complained of long-distance deputation, officials in the Survey, Settlement and Land Records Department have defended the move. “Though care has been taken to depute surveyors from neighbouring districts, in some cases, pendency was high even in the neighbouring districts which has resulted in deputation to a far-away district. But this deputation is within the State and temporary,” a senior official said. He pointed out that only 90 surveyors or less than 2% of the staff had been put on temporary deputation, and such deputation had come from those districts where the load was less to districts where pendency was high. “Work has been rationalised,” the official said.

In terms of pendency, Haveri district has the highest, with 151 cases per surveyor. “With 23 surveys fixed for a month, it may take at least eight months for a farmer in queue to get his podi done. This apart, there will be new applications. In rural areas, farm land or a portion of the land is sold mostly when there is medical emergency or a marriage. In case of death of a senior member, such podi requests come,” an official said.

Official transferred

Amid pressure from government employees to cancel deputation, the government late on Thursday evening transferred Commissioner, Survey, Settlement and Land Records, Munish Moudgil against whom surveyors had expressed ire over being deputed to distant places. Mr. Moudgil has been replaced by K.V. Trilok Chandra.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/aw897s/article30813772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGFARMLAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/wait-for-land-survey-is-as-long-as-9-months-in-some-districts/article30813773.ece
122,2020/02/13,Siddis of Belagavi get their due after a long wait,"Parliament has passed a Bill to include them in the ST list

Members of the Siddi community residing in the jungles of Belagavi district are delighted after Parliament passed a Bill to include them in the Scheduled Tribes (ST) list.

Hitherto, Revenue officials used to issue certificates to Siddis based on block-level categorisation. This created an anomaly where Siddis from Karwar and Haliyal taluks in Uttara Kannada districts were counted among the STs while those in Khanapur taluk of Belagavi district were not. The Khanapur Siddis had to obtain other backward class (OBC) certificates.

Unequal cousins

“All these years, it was very painful to see that while we were beneficiaries of government schemes, our cousins in Belagavi district were not getting them. The amendment will now help hundreds of children realise their dreams,” said Francis Siddi, an assistant professor of computer science at Haliyal in Uttara Kannada district.

Ismail Siddi, who has not studied beyond high school, said the amended law would help the next generation. “We are talking not just about higher education here. There are several young men who are good in sports, but because their parents are so poor they are forced to work or migrate to cities. Such promising young persons can now go to sports hostels or get scholarships to fulfil their dreams,” he felt.

Social activist Gopi Krishna who has helped the Siddis in Belagavi, said, “Since the adoption of the Constitution, the Siddhi community in Belagavi district has been deprived of the benefits reserved for the Scheduled Tribe category. That injustice will end now.” He felt that the move would reduce the seasonal migration of Siddis to cities for jobs, among other things.

Report in The Hindu

Citing reports in The Hindu, the then zilla panchayat Chief Executive Officer R. Ramachandran wrote letters to the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes and the Union Ministry of Tribal Affairs in 2018. The commission sent a team of officers to visit Bhooranaki and surrounding villages near Khanapur to assess the situation. A preliminary report was sent to the Union government, which sought a detailed reply from the State government. In a few months, the commission made a recommendation to include Siddis in the list of Scheduled Tribes.

A senior Revenue Department officer said, “The amended list will be published in the Central gazette soon. Once that is available, the State government will issue relevant orders. We will instruct tahsildars to issue certificates as per the new list,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/g3sbkv/article30813747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGSIDDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/siddis-of-belagavi-get-their-due-after-a-long-wait/article30813748.ece
123,2020/02/13,BJP has elevated tainted leaders: Congress,"Party points to Karnataka Minister

Welcoming a Supreme Court order directing parties to upload online the details of pending criminal cases against their electoral candidates, the Congress on Thursday accused the ruling BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of going against the ruling.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala tweeted a news report on Anand Singh, who is accused in mining and forest crimes, being appointed the new Minister for forest, environment and ecology in Karnataka.

“Modi ji & BJP again come to the rescue of ‘Bellary Gang’! SC says give reasons for giving tickets to tainted Netas... Modiji says make tainted netas not MLAs alone but Ministers of the ministry, which has been allegedly looted! Will SC issue contempt of [court] against PM and Karnataka CM?” he asked.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court asked all political parties to upload on their website details of pending cases against candidates contesting polls and the reasons for selecting persons with pending criminal cases.

At an official party briefing, Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill pointed out that on August 27, 2014, the Supreme Court had issued an advisory not to include any person facing charges of serious offences.

“The Prime Minister is in violation of the advisory of the Hon’ble Supreme Court not to induct any Minister facing serious charges of crime or having a chargesheet in the trial court. Is it not true that a chargesheet has been filed against Shri Anand Singh?” he asked.

When it was pointed out that Mr. Singh was in the Congress before defecting to the BJP, Mr. Shergill said, “Indian National Congress’ statistics and data shows that INC is on the path of neat and clean politics and the BJP is on the path of crime and criminal politics.”

Opinions, however, were divided over the top court’s latest order, with some senior leaders questioning certain aspects of the judgment.

“The Courts decision, despite its lofty motivations, is yet another instance of judicial foray in matters essentially political. The objection on principle is to the Court treating the accused persons at par with those finally convicted as far as their public and political standing is concerned,” former Law Minister Ashwani Kumar said.

“The Supreme Court has not defined what crimes. Can a person be debarred from contesting if he was arrested for participating in a political agitation,” D. Raja, CPI general secretary, told The Hindu and added that the order needs to be studied before making a detailed comment.

“But from what little I know, when a candidate files his nomination papers he has to declare his criminal records. The Election Commission, which is an independent body can reject the nomination, if it wishes so,” Mr. Raja added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kyq98i/article30813659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14SURJEWALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bjp-has-elevated-tainted-leaders-congress/article30813660.ece

“There is no dearth of talent and eligibility in the State and authorities concerned must ensure that right person is appointed at the right place,” he said.

He has submitted several recommendations pertaining to higher and primary education and is hoping that the State government would implement a few in the upcoming budget. Some of the other recommendations include setting up of a dedicated university for specially-abled students, online delivery of question papers to avoid paper leakage, and introduction of skill infused degree courses. He has also requested the government to devise a meaningful way to observe public holidays.

125,2020/02/13,State sees steady rise in number of candidates with criminal history,"Study shows 391 out of 2,560 candidates in 2018 Assembly polls had criminal cases against them

A look at the last few Assembly elections in Karnataka shows the number of candidates with criminal cases steadily rising, from 195 in 2008 to 334 in 2013 and 391 in 2018. This assumes significance in the light of the Supreme Court on Thursday ordering political parties to publish criminal history of their candidates for the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls within 48 hours of selection.

A study by the Karnataka Election Watch and Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) during the Karnataka Legislative Assembly elections in 2018 showed 391 with criminal cases out of an analysis of 2,560 candidates. Cases of as many as 254 were serious in nature.

Among major parties, 83 (37%) out of 224 candidates from BJP, 59 (27%) out of 220 candidates from Congress, and 41 (21%) out of 199 candidates analysed from Janata Dal (Secular) had declared criminal cases against themselves in their affidavits, according to the ADR report. As many as 58 (26%) from BJP, 32 (15%) from Congress, and 29 (15%) from JD(S) declared serious criminal cases such as murder, attempt to murder, and kidnapping against themselves in their affidavits.

The Karnataka Election Watch and ADR have analysed the affidavits of 2,560 out of 2,655 candidates for the Karnataka 2018 Assembly Elections.

It said that there were 56 (25%) red alert constituencies in the Assembly Elections in 2018. Red alert constituencies are those which have three or more candidates with declared criminal cases.

Harish Narasappa, a volunteer at Karnataka Election Watch, ADR, welcomed the Supreme Court order saying it was “a step forward”, but said it would not solve the problem of candidates with criminal antecedents in politics.

“The only solution is when parties take a stand not to field those with cases of serious criminal offences and offences for regulatory violations. But as winnability becomes the only criteria, there seems to be no solution visible,” he said. But the Supreme Court order now informs the voters as to which party has fielded the most candidates with such antecedents helping them to make an informed choice. “But the political parties have to now own up these candidates and their antecedents explicitly,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/unjpjc/article30813361.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGFEBcriminal-casescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-sees-steady-rise-in-number-of-candidates-with-criminal-history/article30813362.ece
126,2020/02/13,CCI defends its probe order on Amazon and Flipkart,"The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Thursday contended before the High Court of Karnataka that it was not looking into any violations related to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy by e-commerce majors Amazon and Flipkart, but intended to examine only whether they had entered into anti-competitive agreements in violation of Section 3 of the Competition Act, 2002.

Submission in this regard was made before Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar, who is hearing a petition by Amazon Seller Services Pvt. Ltd., which had questioned the January 13 order of the CCI directing its Director-General to conduct an investigation into a complaint given by Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh (DVM) that the two e-commerce majors through their online marketplace had indulged in anti-competitive agreement giving preference to select sellers and offering deep discounts.

Advocate B.N. Harish, appearing for CCI, has contended that there was no referee in the CCI’s order on FDI violation and Amazon has raised this issue only to overcome the jurisdictional issue for approaching the High Court. He also contended that CCI’s order asking its D-G to conduct investigation is neither a judicial nor a quasi judicial one but is merely an “administrative order” to its another wing on administrative side.

Pointing out that the Competition Act has no provision to issue notice to the parties before passing such “administrative orders” asking the D-G to conduct an investigation and submit a report, Mr. Harish contended that petitioner has no reason to approach the court of law as none of its civil rights were affected as the D-G will issue notice to Amazon and take information from it before giving report to the CCI.

On Amazon’s claim that the CCI had ignored its own recent study on e-commerce market in India, which had dealt with the operation of online marketplaces, including Amazon, CCI’s counsel said that the study report was for understanding the online market and it was not a relevant document to be noted before deciding whether there is a need to seek investigation report from the D-G.

Appearing for DVM, senior counsel K.G. Raghavan that the complainant had provided “enough and more” materials to the CCI for ordering investigation through its D-G in terms of the parameters laid down by the apex court. He also contended that the best place for deciding the controversies over the online marketplace is before the CCI while making it clear that the petitions filed before the Delhi High Court and the Rajasthan High Court by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) is not linked to violation of Competition Act but for violation of Foreign Exchange laws. Mr. Raghavan too has contended that no rights of Amazon or Flipkart were affected by order of investigation at present as the CCI may either continue further proceedings or close the complaint as provided in the Competition Act based on the investigation report.

Further hearing has been adjourned till February 14.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ch3dcy/article30813342.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cci-defends-its-probe-order-on-amazon-and-flipkart/article30813343.ece
127,2020/02/13,Police deny involvement of Ashok’s son in accident,"An accident that left two killed in Hosapete on Monday turned controversial on Thursday with reports claiming Revenue Minister R. Ashok’s son Sharath was driving the car and there was a cover up under way.

However, C.K. Baba, Superintendent of Police, Ballari, denied that the Minister’s son was in the car that was involved in the accident.

Speaking to mediapersons on Thursday, he termed the allegations as “rumours”.

Meanwhile, Mr. Ashok, speaking to The Hindu in Bengaluru, said the police were probing the case and he would not interfere in any manner. When quizzed whether his son was in the car involved in the accident, he said anything he says would amount to influencing the probe and refused to comment. “The car that was involved in the accident is no way related to my family and the police FIR does not name my son. Beyond this, I do not want to say anything,” he said.

Mr. Baba said a person named Rahul was driving the car and has been injured. A case has been booked against him. Ravi Naik, a pedestrian, was killed on the spot and Sachin, who was inside the car, breathed his last on his way to the hospital.

“The Minister’s son was not involved in the case and we don’t have any pressure from anybody. The investigation is in progress,” Mr. Baba said.

Laxma Naik, a resident of M.M. Halli Tanda in Hosapete taluk, lodged a complaint in Marriyammanahalli police station on Monday evening, in which he had alleged that his relative Ravi Naik and he were hit by a speeding car on National Highway 50 when they were standing by the roadside around 3 p.m.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dwydx7/article30813332.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGACCIDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/police-deny-involvement-of-ashoks-son-in-accident/article30813333.ece
128,2020/02/13,Pressure on CM to change Anand Singh’s portfolio,"The Forest Minister faces charges of violating Forest Act

The allotment of portfolio of Forest and Environment to B.S. Anand Singh, who faces charges of violating the Forest Conservation Act, has raised eyebrows with some leaders from Ballari warning of agitation and an online petition being floated demanding his removal.

Social activist and founder-president of Samaj Parivartan Samudaya S.R. Hiremath, who has for long fought illegal mining cases, called Mr. Singh’s appointment as Forest Minister as “a dangerous precedent.” He argued that Mr. Singh should either offer to resign or Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa should drop him from the Cabinet. “We are also exploring legal possibilities against Mr. Singh’s induction into the ministry,” Mr. Hiremath told The Hindu.

Quoting former Chief Justice of India R.M. Lodha, Mr. Hiremath said he had advised against giving ministerial berths to leaders against whom police investigation was done and chargesheets had been filed.

In Ballari, seeking change in Mr. Singh’s portfolio, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has warned an agitation. In a joint press release, the party said that that the Chief Minister has insulted the entire State by handing over the forest portfolio to Mr. Singh who was facing serious charges of violating of the Forest Conservation Act.

“Mr. Singh is accused of illegal mining and destruction of forest resources and handing over the Forest Department to him is simply like handing over the house key to a thief. The people would not tolerate such a move,” the release said.

Meanwhile, the United Conservation Movement has launched an online petition seeking change of the Forest Minister. The petition seeks answers on how the forest officials who were supposed to pursue cases against Mr. Singh, as they would have to report to him now. “What could be more ridiculous than this?” the petition sought to know.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pressure-on-cm-to-change-anand-singhs-portfolio/article30813299.ece
129,2020/02/13,Mixed response to bandh in Bengaluru,"Schools and colleges remain open; cab and airport taxi services hit

Bengaluru: The call for a Karnataka bandh to demand the implementation of reservation for Kannadigas in all jobs in the State elicited a mixed response in the city on Thursday.

Though bus and metro services were normal in the city, the number of commuters on the road using the services was visibly lower than usual. Kempegowda Bus Terminal in Majestic, the nerve centre of bus services in the city, almost wore a deserted look in the morning. A few Kannada activists gave roses to BMTC bus drivers who were plying their buses, requesting them to support the cause and stop services.

Cab services were adversely affected, as Ola and Uber Driver’s Association have supported the bandh call and refused to ply. Tanveer, president of the association, said Ola and Uber were plying only vehicles they owned, which was around 10% of the entire fleet on a usual day. “None of the drivers who had their cabs attached to these aggregators are plying today,” he said.

Meanwhile, airport taxi services also supported the bandh, which created hurdles for airport commuters. BMTC bus services at Kempegowda International Airport remains the only reliable service to and from the airport.

Schools and colleges were open as usual across the State. In some cases, parents had to make arrangements to drop their wards in school, as a few school van drivers have supported the bandh call.

Kannada organisations are all set to take out a rally demanding the implementation of the Sarojini Mahishi Report that recommends a majority of jobs in the State to be reserved for Kannadigas, from Krantiveera Sangolli Rayanna Railway Station to Freedom Park at 11 am. The rally is expected to disrupt traffic in Central Business District.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1ckflb/article30807617.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/K-bandh-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mixed-response-to-bandh-in-bengaluru/article30807618.ece

131,2020/02/13,People advised not to enter brimming lakes,"Deputy Commissioner M. Deepa has appealed to the public to avoid entering into lakes as most of them in Dharwad district are brimming due to incessant rain late last year.

Chairing an official meeting on the conservation of lakes here on recently, Ms. Deepa said that several cases of death due to drowning in lakes have been reported in the recent times. Therefore, the public should avoid swimming, bathing cattle and carrying out such other activities in the lakes. The officials too should take steps to caution the public against such activities, she said.

The district has 1,246 lakes, including 525 in gram panchayats, 19 in town panchayats, 62 under the Minor Irrigation Department, 26 each under Major Irrigation Department and Public Works Department, 34 in Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation, 16 under Revenue Department, seven in Town Municipal Council limits, three under the Panchayatraj Department, two each under the Railways and Forest Department and 254 others.

Almost all of these lakes are full and are not safe for swimming, bathing cattle or carrying out any such activities. The residents living in the vicinity of these lakes should avoid entering them and also ensure that their children stay clear of the water bodies, she said.

Ms. Deepa has instructed the officials of the Department of Minor Irrigation to see that information boards containing details of the depth of water and suggesting against swimming and taking selfies are installed near the lakes.

This apart, the Department of Public Instructions and the respective gram panchayats should hold awareness programmes on this for the benefit of the local people. Such programmes should also focus on steps to be taken to preserve and conserve lakes, she added.

Officials from the Police Department said that cases of death by drowning in lakes have been reported from both urban and rural limits. Assistant Commissioner of Police M.N. Rudrappa said that 10 such cases were reported in the city limits in the last one year.

Deputy Superintendent of Police Ravi Naik said that 42 cases of loss of life by drowning, slipping into lakes, suicide and others were reported in 2019.

132,2020/02/13,Non-payment of govt. subsidy sees rise in dues to GESCOM,"Electricty firm recently sought permission from KERC to increase power tariff

Gulbarga Electricity Supply Company Limited (GESCOM) recently sought permission from the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) to increase power tariff by 74 paisa a unit across categories, and monthly fixed charges by ₹20 a kV for irrigation pump-sets and ₹10 a kV for other category consumers.

This has, however, attracted criticism by users who argue that the company was attempting to transfer the financial burden on to consumers in its bid to increase the revenues instead of trying to explore other avenues of revenue generation such as the collection of the subsidy dues from the government.

Data collected by The Hindu shows that the State government has to pay ₹2,524.06 crore, including the interest of ₹1,458.43 crore, to GESCOM for the free power to farmers’ irrigation pump-sets since 2007-08, when the free electricity to irrigation pump-set scheme was launched.

The government has been repaying lesser subsidy than the actual claim by GESCOM and it has led to the accumulation of debts.

As per the information provided by GESCOM authorities, the outstanding dues as on November 2019 were ₹1,065.63 crore.

Interestingly, the GESCOM is not claiming interest on the dues, though there is no provision in the Electricity Act 2003 for exempting the government from paying the interest on the dues.

“GESCOM collects interest from its consumers. Whey is it not applying the same rule to the government? Collecting interest from poor consumers and exempting government from paying interest is not just unfair, but also a violation of the Electricity Act 2003,” Deepak Gala, an environment activist, said.

In fact, the stakeholder had raised the issue in a consultative meeting in 2018.

Considering the demand, even the KERC, in its tariff order in 2018, directed GESCOM to take up the issue with the government.

“The matter of charging interest on the subsidy dues shall be taken up by the GESCOM with the government, as non-release of subsidy results in borrowing from other sources by paying necessary interest to pay its liabilities which cannot be passed on to consumers,” the order observed.

As per the KERC directions, GESCOM wrote to the Department of Energy requesting it to release the interest on the arrears of subsidy between 2007-08 and 2016-17. However, the government turned down the demand.

“In a similar matter, the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) had directed Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) to pay the interest on the dues in 2017-18. The Punjab government had paid ₹5,600.7 crore subsidy to PSPCL during 2016-17, in staggered installments. The commission levied interest on the delayed payment of subsidy at 9.70%, which worked out to ₹307.79 crore. The Karnataka government should also pay the interest on dues as the Electricity Act is applicable to entire India,” Mr. Gala says.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/970bkp/article30804306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGKALABURAGIGESCOM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/non-payment-of-govt-subsidy-sees-rise-in-dues-to-gescom/article30804311.ece
133,2020/02/13,Opposition stirs up a storm over CAG report,"UDF seeks removal of Loknath Behera as State Police Chief

The Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) on Thursday sought to reap political dividend out of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India’s finding that the police had bypassed statutory norms of fiscal probity to acquire pricey equipment at questionable rates using Central funds earmarked for modernisation projects.

The police headquarters, which is responsible for procurement, appeared to be at the centre of the maelstrom as adverse reports buffeted the department.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala penned an open letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking the removal of Loknath Behera as State Police Chief. He said the CAG had singled out Mr. Behera for criticism and listed his ‘financial shenanigans’ in the audit report.

CM responsible: Cong.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullappally Ramachandran and Congress legislator P.T. Thomas also stepped up their criticism of the Police Department.

Mr. Ramachandran said Mr. Vijayan had passed over several senior officers and hand-picked Mr. Behera to the post and was vicariously responsible for hisactions. He said Mr. Behera had sacrificed the interests of the rank and file of the force by diverting modernisation funds to build villas and buy luxury cars for officers instead of quarters for subordinates and hardy vehicles for station use.

Mr. Thomas said the Chief Minister’s Office could not wash its hands of the fraud and sought an anti-corruption inquiry.

Mr. Chennithala also sought a National Investigation Agency inquiry into the CAG’s finding that the police could not account for 25 assault rifles and 12,061 rounds of live ammunition.

The Chief Minister’s Office said it was not in receipt of Mr. Chennithala’s letter. However, the government was of the view that Mr. Behera had done no wrong. The police had replied to the CAG’s queries. But, the government felt the answers were not fully factored in the final report.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/opposition-stirs-up-a-storm-over-cag-report/article30813914.ece

137,2020/02/13,SPC unit reaps harvest at Pazhayarikandam,"Minister shares memories of his life as a farmer

It was a harvest festival of a different kind when the paddy cultivated by the members of Student Police Cadet (SPC) of the Government High School, Pazhayarikandam, was reaped on Thursday.

Electricity Minister M.M. Mani joined the students in reaping the harvest.

Farmer’s life

Mr. Mani said he was a farmer prior to becoming a full-time politician. He shared his memories of his life as a farmer in the district when paddy was a major crop for settlers.

He said the initiative of the students was a positive sign that the young generation had not abandoned farming.

It was a model for the general public and a mindset for hard work should be retained. The farming was a means of livelihood in the district and the early settlers worked hard in making the land productive. Many achievements in farm technologies should be used for augmenting farm production, he said.

The SPC unit sowed the seeds last October with the help of the Agriculture Department as part of the ‘Padom Onnu, Padathekku’ ( Lesson One, to Paddy Field) scheme.

The 1.5-acre land for sowing the seeds was given by T.S. Jessymol, a teacher of the school.

Organic farming was preferred to reduce the expenses. ‘Ithikannappan’, a traditional seed variety which needed a growth period of 130 days, was used.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/spc-unit-reaps-harvest-at-pazhayarikandam/article30813344.ece
138,2020/02/13,Economic slowdown due to structural issues: expert,"Chandrasekhar pins blame on govt.

The present slowdown of the Indian economy is due to deep structural issues and the government lacks rationality in dealing with the real issues facing the economy, C.P. Chandrasekhar, Professor at the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, has said.

Dr. Chandrasekhar was delivering the 23rd annual lecture on ‘India’s dramatic growth slowdown — A long-term perspective’ organised by the department of economics department of Mar Thoma College in Thiruvalla on Thursday. He said India adopted a strategy in 1950 to revive the domestic demand by investing in capital goods, reviving rural demand by land reforms, breaking the monopoly in land ownership, and reducing inequality. Only a limited role was there for foreign capital and export-led growth.

However, the growth trajectory had been completely changed with the arrival of neo-liberal fiscal reforms. With the passing of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, the government’s overemphasis on the reduction of fiscal deficits led to significant reduction in public spending. Now, the government’s debt financing was reduced and the private sector debt started rising.

Credit boom

Dr. Chandrasekhar said the economic growth since 1990 was largely fuelled by credit boom, retail spending boom and lending to the corporate and infrastructure sectors. Credit as percentage of GDP rose from 22% to 55%, infrastructure lending increased from 3% to 35%. All these led to a form of credit bubble in India, that ultimately resulted in a lending burst, he said.

Starting from a historical perspective, Dr. Chandrasekhar outlined the key policy inputs and factors that defined India.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/economic-slowdown-due-to-structural-issues-expert/article30813319.ece
139,2020/02/13,Efforts on to bring fishers to mainstream: Minister,"Mercykutty Amma inaugurates KSCADC scheme to distribute free bicycles for girl students belonging to fishing community

The State government will continue its efforts to address the educational backwardness of the fishing community and bring them to mainstream, said Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma here on Thursday.

She was speaking at the State-level inauguration of Kerala State Coastal Area Development Corporation’s (KSCADC) new initiative that provides free bicycles for girl students belonging to the fishing community.

2,000 beneficiaries

As many as 2,000 girls studying in government schools in eight coastal districts of the State will be the beneficiaries of the project being implemented with financial assistance from Petronet LNG Limited. According to KSCADC officials, fishers in Kerala lack several basic amenities, including proper houses, drinking water, electricity, education and health-care provisions, making them a sidelined community.

Compared to other sections the dropout rate among such students is very high and it is girls who have to face this problem.

Other responsibilities at home and the issues they face while using public transport services force many to drop out of school. Since it is mostly high school girls who drop out, students from Class 7, 8 and 9 will be given bicycles as part of the initiative. Though the project has been launched to encourage girls complete their studies and curb the dropout rates, it also aims to inculcate confidence and independence in them. As part of the project, they will be made aware of road safety norms and the importance to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Moreover, opting for bicycles is expected to bring down the pollution and traffic blocks near schools.

Objective

Another objective of the project is to help students who belong to remote fishing villages with connectivity issues by providing them a safe and cheap mode of transportation. As many as 463 girls from 20 government schools in the district received bicycles as part of the project on Thursday.

142,2020/02/13,8 canals to get a new lease of life,"Mararikulam North and Kuthiathode grama panchayats identify canals

Eight canals in Mararikulam North and Kuthiathode grama panchayats are set to get a new lease of life.

Three canals in Mararikulam North panchayat — A.S. Canal, Karikkadthodu and Valiyathodu — will be cleaned and deepened at a cost of ₹5.5 crore.

Pollution

“The water channels have been remaining polluted for the past 10 years. Local residents have long been demanding the rejuvenation of the channels and we have decided to renovate it. The cleaning and beautification will commence after February 21,” says D. Priyesh Kumar, president, Mararikulam North grama panchayat.

According to officials, the renovation work will be carried out jointly with the Irrigation Department. A sum of ₹87 lakh has been earmarked for the cleaning of Karikadthodu.

“We have handed over the amount to the Irrigation Department after completing the tendering process. The beautification of Valiyathodu will be carried out at a cost of ₹1.67 crore. In the case of A.S. Canal, a project report for cleaning and deepening the waterbody has been prepared. The amount set aside is ₹3 crore,” says an official.

Encroachers evicted

Meanwhile, the Kuthiathode grama panchayat has launched a project for the cleaning of Deshathodu, Kurumbilthodu, Changramthodu, Thonithodu and Karayathodu in its limits. Officials say that as part of the project, encroachers on the banks have been identified and evicted.

“We have started cleaning channels using a dredging utility craft. The canals will be deepened after removing the silt,” says Prema Rajappan, president, Kuthiathode grama panchayat.

The panchayat authorities say that they hope to revive farming in the region.

“Once water starts to flow again in the channels, it will help revive agriculture and bring an end to the water crisis in the region,” the president says.

145,2020/02/13,SEC may challenge HC verdict,"Conduct of local body polls on the basis of 2019 electoral rolls

The State Election Commission (SEC) is likely to challenge the High Court direction to conduct the local body elections on the basis of the electoral rolls prepared for the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.

Sources privy to the poll process told The Hindu that the SEC being a constitutional body similar to the Central Election Commission with absolute authority for preparing electoral rolls and conducting elections, it may challenge the High Court direction to get its powers reaffirmed by the apex court.

But delimitation of wards being an exercise conducted largely on the basis of a political decision, the court could well intervene and initiate measures, sources said.

The State government has chosen to distance itself from the issue and has clarified that it would abide by the SEC’s decision and was not ready to pick up a row. The raging differences of opinion between the government and the SEC had delayed the elections in 2015. The government is committed to conducting the elections in time and was unwilling to stray into the powers of the commission, sources said.

The commission has already prepared the draft poll rolls and was gearing up to publish it within a fortnight. The SEC, with the clearance of the CEC, had conducted a massive exercise in 2015 for preparing a comprehensive voters’ list which could be used for future elections too.

Booth-level offices were fanned out across the State with the CEC’s voters’ list used for Lok Sabha and Assembly elections and after collecting ward specific details, it was also incorporated into this list. The SEC’s plan was to use this list by including fresh applicants, so that it could be completed in a fool proof manner. Moreover, the poll rolls are revised before the conduct of each local body byelection.

Collection of booth-wise data does not help the conduct of local body polls. For each booth comprises more than one ward and hence using the 2019 voters’ list would be a laborious and time consuming process. Synchronising the wards and booths is not a logical proposition too. The commission is likely to flag such issues, if it resolves to move the apex court.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sec-may-challenge-hc-verdict/article30811546.ece

A Keralite student from Wuhan university, who tested postive for the novel coronavirus thereby becoming the country’s second such case, was on Thursday discharged from the isolation ward of the Alappuzha Medical college hospital, health department sources said.

The youth was discharged after his two consecutive samples sent for testing at the National Instiute of Virology, Pune, turned out negative, the sources told PTI.

“On the basis of the two consecutive negative results, the patient has been discharged. He will be in home quarantine for the remining 14 days.”

147,2020/02/13,Statutory funds not reaching KRSA: CAG,"‘₹435.51 cr. for the period 2008-2009 to 2017-2018 has not been transferred to KRSF’

At a time when 12 persons on an average are getting killed daily in road accidents in the State, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) audit has revealed that statutory funds were not being provided to the Kerala Road Safety Authority (KRSA) and that ₹435.51 crore for the period from 2008-2009 to 2017-2018 had not been transferred to the Kerala Road Safety Fund (KRSF).

“Despite clear provisions in the statutes, there was a short transfer of ₹435. 51 crore to the KRSF. The government has not taken any steps to rectify this and the KRSA was unable to allot funds for projects identified for road safety,” the CAG report for Revenue Sector for March 2018 has noted.

The CAG has pointed out that as per Section 11(3) of the KRSA Act, 2007, 50% of the compounding fee collected should be transferred to the KRSF in the subsequent year. As per Rule 3(4) of the KRSA Rules 2007, up to 1% of the road safety cess collected by the Motor Vehicles Department can be charged for expenditure on account of collection of cess and the balance should be transferred to the KRSF’s head of account.

The CAG audit has also revealed that diversion of compounding has resulted in loss of share of ₹15.57 crore, 50% of the compounding fee, to the KRSF.

The ₹45.83 crore collected as compounding fee using 100 speed detection cameras during 2014-2015 to 2017-2018 was credited to the bank account of the police instead of remitting to the head of account for compounding fee. Of the amount, ₹23.16 crore was diverted to Keltron, who installed the speed camera, and ₹7.78 crore the Police Department.

The CAG has pulled up the KRSA for the poor financial management of the projects executed through implementing agencies and District Road Safety Councils (DRSC) for improving road safety. Out of the 214 projects with an estimated cost of ₹147.8 crore implemented during 2013-2014 to 2017-2018, the audit has revealed blockage of funds, loss of interest and diversion of funds in the 54 projects verified.

The instances of the non-compliance of the provisions of the KRSA Act 2007 were cited in the report. Appropriate rules regarding reports, return and consolidated reports were not framed. No annual report was prepared and submitted to the government as envisaged in the Act and Rules, certified reports were not prepared till date and expert members were not nominated in the DRSC, the CAG has said.

The CAG has pointed out that the KRSA does not maintain any information about the present status of the implementation of the project, amount pending with the agencies after completion and up to date account of refunds regarding completed projects.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/statutory-funds-not-reaching-krsa-cag/article30810444.ece
148,2020/02/13,"Now, an uru cruise through Malabar’s cultural landscape","New venture will have luxury dhow ferrying 50 guests before year end

Uru (dhow), Kerala Tourism’s latest niche product and a reworked version of kettuvalloms, is all set to steal the show on the State’s exotic backwaters.

The State-owned Bekal Resorts Development Corporation (BRDC) has decided to launch a luxury dhow before year end to give travellers the opportunity of a mesmerising cruise through the backwaters of Malabar. The story of uru dates back to centuries and its significance in furthering trade is etched in the annals of history.

Beypore’s fame for making quality dhows is known across the world, especially in Arabian countries where businessmen are now keen on making luxury dhows. (History has it that the Arab travellers who reached the coast for trade paved the way for the building of the uru.) But, this is the first time that a dhow is being tailor-made for cruising through the shallow backwaters of Malabar.

“We are going for a ₹3 to ₹4-crore luxury dhow with all modern facilities that can ferry 50 guests. The design will be finalised soon and the work will be awarded through competitive bidding. We are planning to launch it before year end,” BRDC managing director T.K. Mansoor told The Hindu.

The aim is to give a experiential day tour through the cultural landscape of Malabar. Along with the art forms of the north such as Yakshaganam, Duff Mutt, Pavakali, Kolkali, Alamikkali and Oppana, tribal art such as Mangalam Kali, Eruthu Kali and Man Kali would be performed by artistes where the dhow stops during the cruise.

Besides offering traditional culinary delights, travellers would be taken on a journey through the heritage of the State through narratives and visual tools. They would be given a glimpse of the making of the vessel, its history and significance by SMiLE entrepreneurs trained in story-telling.

“The project will also preserve the shipbuilding culture of north Kerala. We are eyeing Arab tourists in a big way,” he said.

149,2020/02/13,HC tells EC in Kerala to hold local body polls based on Lok Sabha voter list,"It quashes poll panel’s order to conduct civic polls based on 2015 local body election voter list

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Thursday directed the State Election Commission (SEC) to conduct the ensuing local body polls based on the voter list prepared for the 2019 Lok Sabha election.

The Bench comprising Chief Justice S. Manikumar and Justice Shaji P. Chali issued the directive while quashing the SEC’s order to conduct the civic polls based on the voters list prepared for the 2015 local body elections.

The decision has come under fire from the Congress and other Opposition parties.

The Bench passed the verdict while allowing appeals filed by Congress leader N. Venugopal and Indian Union of Muslim League (IUML) Nadapuram Mandalam president Soopy Narikkatteri against a single judge’s judgment upholding the decision of SEC. The single judge had upheld the decision while dismissing their pleas against the decision.

The SEC has directed the election officers to prepare the electoral roll of all local bodies treating the roll prepared for the 2015 local body elections as draft electoral rolls.

The SEC took the stand that an electoral roll revision using the 2019 electoral roll will be a huge task. According to it, if the 2019 electoral roll was used, door-to-door visits will have to be carried out to prepare a ward-based roll. Besides being a time-consuming affair, huge expenses would have to be incurred for the exercise.

The petitioners pointed out that the electoral rolls were renewed for the Assembly election of 2016 and finally for the 2019 Lok Sabha election. If the 2015 electoral rolls were taken as draft rolls, it would inconvenience a large number of voters as they would have to again enrol their names in the list. In fact, more than 90% of voters now in the electoral rolls prepared for the Lok Sabha election would have to undertake the exercise of registration afresh. This was because persons who had enrolled themselves in the 2019 electoral roll would not be in the 2015 voters list.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-tells-ec-in-kerala-to-hold-local-body-polls-based-on-lok-sabha-voter-list/article30809101.ece
150,2020/02/13,Thrissur city roads in bad shape,"Corporation has promised to repair roads dug up for Amruth project by Jan. 30

Even as the Thrissur Corporation has given an affidavit in the High Court to complete the work of dug up roads for the Amruth project by January 30, many major roads in the city remain in pathetic condition.

On a petition filed by DCC general secretary Shaji J. Kodankandath on the dilapidated condition of the roads, the High Court had recently sought an explanation from the city corporation.

It has been more than a year since the Kerala Water Authority dug up the roads, including most of the major roads in the Thrissur Corporation limit, for laying water pipes under the Amruth project.

Digging works in 2018

Though digging works were done in October 2018, no steps had been taken by the corporation and the water authority to restore the roads into motorable condition, according to the petitioner.

In its counter affidavit in the High Court, the Thrissur Corporation denied laxity on its part and said the laying of pipelines as part of the Amruth project was being carried by the Kerala Water Authority.

The corporation had taken immediate steps to restore the roads, which had been cut for laying pipes, soon after the works were completed. The civic body had prepared estimates and obtained technical sanction for almost all restoration works of the roads and even awarded works after inviting tenders, it said in the counter affidavit.

Corporation claim

“In total, pipe-laying works have been completed in 42 roads. Out of the 37 roads for which technical sanction has been obtained for restoration, work has been awarded to 31 roads. Relaying of seven roads has already been completed,” said the corporation.

Though the corporation was taking keen efforts to complete the relaying of works within the shortest period as possible, the Kerala Water Authority was yet to lay water pipes at some of the roads in the corporation limit, it said. The corporation said it would complete the work by January 30.

The deadline had passed. But many of the major roads remain severely battered. The muddy roads not only offer a bumpy ride for the passengers but also give them a shower of dust.

153,2020/02/13,"Soon, farmers in State to get licence to kill wild boars","Guidelines to be issued on use of legal firearms against marauding sounders, says Forest Minister

Forest Minister K. Raju told the Assembly on Wednesday that the government would soon permit farmers with licensed firearms to shoot wild boars that wander into their lands.

Replying to a calling attention motion by Kerala Congress (M) legislator P. J. Joseph, Mr. Raju said a committee of wildlife experts categorised wild boars as vermin in 2018. The government will finalise the modalities of using legal firearms against marauding sounders to insulate farmers from any legal jeopardy.

Wildlife conservationists have resisted the proposal on the ground that it might open the door for unchecked poaching and spawn a black market for wild meat.

A farmer’s tale

Mr. Joseph narrated the tale of a farmer in Idukki who was forced go underground to escape arrest and incarceration under the Wildlife Act after some people reported to the Forest Department that they had seen the carcass of a king cobra in his compound. Mr. Joseph, himself a successful farmer, said farmers often found themselves in conflict with wildlife and consequently the law.

He said marauding sounders destroyed crops more than wild elephants.

He asked the government to sanction wild boar hunting and suggested that its meat, tusks and hide be used to make value-added products.

Watering holes

Mr. Joseph also asked the Forest Department to dig well-replenished watering holes deep inside forests and provide enough feed to pre-empt wild animals from foraying into habitation centres during summer. Piecemeal fencing of forests land had disrupted traditional animal pathways.

A seemingly lost elephant and its calf were terrorising his constituents, Mr. Joseph said.

Mr. Raju said the government would build a network of trenches, solar and rope fences, and animal crash guards to separate forests from habitation centres. It has also embarked on a programme to rehabilitate families who dwell on the forest fringes.

Radio collars

Wildlife enforcers would capture marauding elephants, tigers, wild buffaloes and leopards and radio-collar them before relocating to them into forest interiors.

They would form mobile phone groups of those dwelling near forests to detect, warn and prevent human-animal conflict.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jfqcz7/article30804846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TVBANDIPURFORESTVIEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/soon-farmers-in-state-to-get-licence-to-kill-wild-boars/article30804848.ece
154,2020/02/13,Safe custody of ivory stock haunts Forest dept.,"Proposal to destroy the huge stock by burning has been shot down by Kerala State Board for Wildlife

The attempts of the Kerala Forest Department to get rid of the huge quantities of ivory in its vaults have failed. A proposal to destroy it by burning was shot down by the Kerala State Board for Wildlife recently.

It estimated that around 12 tonnes of ivory is in the possession of the department, which is worried about the safe custody of the commodity.

A significant quantity of the off-white teeth and tusks of elephants are kept at the Forest Headquarters and lockers of the State treasury and bank lockers. Ivory has also been stored in the various offices of the Forest Department.

The ivory of dead captive elephants is left with the safe custody of its owners. Ivory comes to the vaults of the department from captive and wild elephants.

The materials confiscated from poachers and illegal traders too add to the volume, says a senior forest official.

The ivory comes in various sizes and shapes and some are huge in size and heavy to handle. In some other cases, the ivory comes as carvings and idols.

The security requirements for the material, a banned item that has no official market or price, is a matter of concern, he says.

Though the proposal for destroying the ivory by crushing and burning it was placed before the board meeting held in the last week of January, it was opposed by the majority of the members.

Representatives of the NGOs and conservationists were absent at the meeting, as the term of the nominated members had expired.

Similar attempt

A similar attempt by the department seven years ago too failed to get the approval of the authorities.

The Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who presided over the meeting, suggested steps for using the ivory.

The forest officials explained that the burning of ivory was an internationally accepted practice and small pieces shall be crushed and burned in the initial phase.

They also objected to the proposal that ivory shall be exhibited at museums and educational institutions, as they feared that it would promote poaching of elephants.

Valliyil Gopinath, former Head of Forest Force, suggested the destruction of ivory for protecting the wild elephants.

The supply of ivory has to be cut to end the illegal craft of ivory carving, which is still thriving in some parts of the State. Illegally procured ivory is the raw material for the carving. The use, possession and trade of ivory is banned, says Mr. Gopinath.

The Centre had earlier permitted the State governments to destroy the ivory in its possession, as it could not be used for any other purpose. Yet, the earlier attempts to destroy it did not succeed.

Mindset needs to change

The mindset against the destruction of the ivory, deemed as a valuable item, need to change if one is serious about protecting the elephants, he says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mahy28/article30804830.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13tv-tuskcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/safe-custody-of-ivory-stock-haunts-forest-dept/article30804831.ece
155,2020/02/13,Kerala imposes ₹13 price cap on bottled water,"Government views current prices as exploitation of consumers, makes it an essential commodity

Bottled drinking water has come under a price cap in Kerala, with the State making it an essential commodity and fixing a ceiling of ₹13 per litre. The current retail price is ₹20.

The State government on Wednesday announced the price reduction after Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan signed the Food Department proposal.

Including bottled water in the list of essential commodities enables price control. Food Minister P. Thilothaman told The Hindu that the notification on the new price would be issued soon. He said the government had also decided to make BIS standards mandatory for all brands of bottled water. This would force unauthorised manufacturers to shut shop.

In 2018, the government convened a meeting of bottled water manufacturers at which it was decided to bring down the price to ₹12. But the decision was not implemented in the face of opposition from traders and some manufacturers.

Eminently feasible

The Minister said some companies had insisted on a minimum price of ₹15. “We understood that manufacturers could afford to sell bottled water at much less. Traders were also fleecing buyers, extracting a huge margin. The government cannot close its eyes to such exploitation,” he said.

The Kerala Bottled Water Manufacturers’ Association welcomed the decision to reduce the price. Its president, M. E. Mohamed, said the Association had taken the initiative to cut the retail price after multinational brands hiked their price to ₹20 a litre in 2012. There was, however, some opposition from industry players, over commercial concerns.

The State government sells a litre of bottled water at ₹10, through a subsidiary of the Kerala Water Authority, he said. The move by the State government would help the industry in the long run. The public felt that bottled water manufacturers were fleecing customers.

There are around 200 bottled water manufacturers in Kerala, as per a rough estimate. But the Association has less than a hundred members. Most manufacturers sell around 300 to 500 cases of bottled water a day, a case consisting of 12 one-litre bottles.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ze82i5/article30804513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THRDWATER1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-imposes-13-price-cap-on-bottled-water/article30804515.ece
156,2020/02/13,‘Oh My Kadavule’ movie review: An endearing romcom exploring a second chance at love/ life,"This Ashok Selvan and Ritika Singh-starrer about a couple rediscovering their true self in a disintegrating marriage is a pleasant, non-fuzzy take on modern-day relationships, even though it offers very little space for physical intimacy

Romance as a genre has been long dead in Tamil cinema, only to be resurrected by Elan in 2018 when he made the simple, but affecting Pyaar Prema Kaadhal. There have hardly been any satisfactory movies on Love, Breakups, Zindagi since then — probably because very few filmmakers harvest time and effort to perfect the genre that has been done to death. Debutant Ashwath Marimuthu does that exceedingly well to a certain extent, without the urgency to romanticise the romance clichés. Sure, you could say that Oh My Kadavule (OMK) functions primarily on the romantic troupes; impulsive decisions, emotional meltdown, bad breakup followed by a road-trip in search of long lost soul. But where the movie becomes slightly better than ones with pretentious intentions is the quality to discount its own mishaps.

Ashwath seems to have grown up on a steady diet of Gautham Menon movies. His OMK is dedicated to “GVM Sir” or rather his ‘kadavul’, if we can put it that way. The movie can be seen as a fresh retelling of the now-classic Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya, for the primary characters in OMK seem to have been designed after Karthik and Jessie of that movie — what if Karthik and Jessie ended up marrying each other like they do in the song ‘Anbil Avan’, and what if Samantha’s character had gotten her own arc? These afterthoughts may have inspired him.

But unlike GVM, who has become the Poster Boy of Kollywood’s romance; whose triumph lies in the fact that he has convinced the audience to fall for his deceptively simple make-believe world, Ashwath’s idea of romantic relationship is largely restricted to writing cutesy scenes between the couple — if you consider OMK’s supremely vanilla first half which takes painfully long time in the world building exercise. The movie, in fact, is a rare instance where the writing is surprisingly effective in the second half, with properly fleshed out scenes that redeem whatever little that had been established in the first half. For example, there’s a hilarious stretch involving Arjun and his father-in-law Paulraj (MS Bhaskar), who hires him as a quality controller. His job? To test the fragility of the toilet basin with varying size and shape. You laugh at his expense, but we’re made to reassess the scene in the second half, which has a great recall value.

Oh My Kadavule Cast: Ashok Selvan, Ritika Singh, Vani Bhojan, Sha Ra, Vijay Sethupathi and Ramesh Tilak

Director: Ashwath Marimuthu

Storyline: Childhood friends Arjun and Anu think they are destined to be together under the pretext of marriage. But what if life (or rather God) gives them a second chance, when they are about to file for divorce?

Given Tamil filmmakers’ inexplicable fascination to write asexual characters when they seem to be flirting with so-called ‘madly in love’ tales, there’s some plausible explanation as to why the narrative in OMK eschews from showing steamy scenes between Arjun Marimuthu (Ashok Selvan) and Anu Paulraj (Ritika Singh), who are really good as a warring couple. They are trapped in a loveless marriage. Or as Arjun puts it: “Love-ae illatha love marriage.” The movie is replete with pop-culture references; there are clippings from Tamasha, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya and Jaane Tu...Ya Jaane Na. Like the latter movie, Arjun, Anu and Mani (Sha Ra, with two laughable jokes) are childhood friends who know each other in and out. The movie spends little time on their friendship, for its own good, and dives straight into the issue: Marriage Story. It presents an archaic cliché such as childhood love, but redeems it with an inventive solution — allowing Arjun to friend zone Anu even in marital life, “Friend-a wife-a paaka mudiyala,” he says. But the issues that crop up in their relationship are at the surface level: invading privacy, suspecting a love affair and everything that Sathi Leelavathi dealt with.

Arjun-Anu’s marriage begins to crack when the other woman, Meera (Vani Bhojan), steps in their life, Meera is Arjun’s highschool senior and childhood crush, and is the most interesting character. She is an assistant to...Gautham Menon (played by himself) and is struggling for a break. When was the last time we saw a female assistant director on screen? Allow me to rephrase it: when was the last time we saw a female cinema aspirant on screen? But that alone remains to be her virtue. For, Meera continues to be a proponent to propel the Arjun-Anu love story, though there’s a separate episode in the second half where Meera gets to show the finger to patriarchy.

OMK actually becomes engaging when the fantasy element kicks in, when Arjun encounters Men in Black (Vijay Sethupathi as God and Ramesh Thilak as his humble minister) who offer a rare proposition: a restart button, if pressed, would transport him back to the exact moment he said ‘yes’ to Anu. He jumps at the opportunity to save his marriage from falling apart. In that sense, the twisted narrative has a very 12B-approach and goes on to re-examine the ‘what if’ events leading up to the dramatic plot point.

There’s an endearing moment that comes in the second half between Paulraj and Arjun, where the latter discovers a dad in him. “Anu grew up without a mother. I’m now afraid to give my daughter to someone I don’t know. Would he take care of her?,” says Paulraj to Arjun, in one of the defining scenes of the movie. It’s the sort of scene that would milk the emotions to pulp. But Ashwath handles it with commendable resistance. It ends with Arjun apologising. That’s what most people would do, if life gave them a second chance.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ytrq78/article30810656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KO13463,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/oh-my-kadavule-movie-review-an-endearing-romcom-exploring-a-second-chance-at-love-life/article30810657.ece
157,2020/02/13,‘Veyyon Silli’ up in the sky: Suriya says ‘Soorarai Pottru’ is a tribute to Captain G.R Gopinath,"The actor dedicated the film to the founder of Air Deccan, and praised director Sudha Kongara for decade-long work on the project

At 3.30 p.m. on Thursday, the skies came alive with music. Taking inspiration from the subject of their movie, the team of Suriya’s upcoming Soorarai Pottru released the first song of the movie titled Veyyon Silli mid-air, aboard a SpiceJet Boeing 737 flight in a first-of-its-kind event.

The flight was a special one for more than one reason. Among the passengers which comprised the team behind the film and journalists were also 70 children from the Agaram foundation who were given the opportunity to go on a flight for the first time.

“We chose students from government schools across the state based on an essay writing competition. We had asked them about what they would do if they were given a chance to travel on a plane and many had written that they would like for their parents or siblings to have that opportunity instead,” said actor Suriya, about the heart-warming responses they had received.

“Whatever inventions are introduced, it is meaningless if not made affordable and accessible. In 2000, less than one percent of the population was able to fly. Captain Gopinath changed the whole industry and took the common man to the skies,” the actor said, speaking about the film. Stating that G.R. Gopinath had revolutionised the aviation industry, Suriya said that the film was a tribute to him and heaped praises on director Sudha Kongara for her vision and decade-long work on the project.

Soorarai Pottru is based on the life of Captain G.R. Gopinath who founded Air Deccan.

Ajay Singh, Chairman of SpiceJet who released the song said that they were happy to partner with the film as the film’s theme resonated with their vision of making every Indian fly.

“Suriya promised me creative freedom when I worked on this film and he gave me enough creative freedom which took me higher than this Boeing 737,” said director Sudha Kongara. The actor had earlier said that Kongara had worked on the film for 10 years.

After the release of the single Veyyon Silli mid-air, G.V. Prakash Kumar spoke about the song and said that they had chosen to incorporate folk instruments and lyrics for the song while presenting it in a stylish format. “I’m hoping that after this film, biopics become more popular in Tamil cinema,” he said.

Amidst cheers from the young passengers, the composer sang a few lines from Veyyon Silli as well.

Inside the Chennai airport

For the first-time fliers, their experience in air was made better through announcements by the flight captain who ensured that they got to see stunning ariel views of the Bay of Bengal, Chennai Port and M.A. Chidambaram Stadium among other landmarks in the city.

The film is being produced by 2D entertainment and Academy award winner Guneet Monga’s Sikhya Entertainment.

158,2020/02/13,Vetri Maaran on why he decided to present ‘Baaram’,"How ‘Baaram’, a film that grabbed eyeballs after winning the National Award, was conceptualised

Even before its theatrical release, independent movie Baaram stoked a controversy when it was awarded the Best Tamil Feature at the 66th National Film Awards, snubbing its fellow nominees — Pariyerum Perumal, Vada Chennai, Merku Thodarchi Malai and Peranbu — which were perceived to be the potential winners. But if not for the National Award tag associated with Baaram, nobody would have known of its remote existence, which, sadly, is the case of any independent movie.

An alumnus of FTII (Film and Television Institute of India), the Mumbai-bred Priya Krishnaswamy’s journey isn’t any different when she decided to put together Baaram, based on the ghastly practice of thalaikoothal (senicide). “We wanted to reach more people because of the subject. The National Award win, in fact, opened doors for us and I’m grateful to the jury members,” said Priya, who was in town for the press meet of her second movie, which saw the participation of filmmakers Vetri Maaran, Ram, Mysskin, Kamalakannan, Arun Karthick and Ajayan Bala. She added, “The mark of an artiste is to recognise the struggle of another artiste. I’m deeply grateful to Vetri Maaran and all the filmmakers who have supported us.”

Baaram, in her own words, is relatively a “small movie” which she never thought of releasing to a mainstream audience, until she met Ram at International Film Festival of India (IFFI), where his Peranbu was screened under Indian Panorama section. It was Ram who convinced Priya to take a trip to Chennai, meet people and discuss the release prospects, “National Award isn’t a barometer to judge the quality of a movie, but it somehow helps to sell the product better, so thanks to the jury,” said Ram in his speech, “The most difficult aspect of filmmaking is to retain the simplicity of the craft. Priya has managed to do that with Baaram.”

Tracing roots

Ram fostered a meeting between Priya and Vetri Maaran, who is presenting Baaram through his Grass Root Film Company, along with SP Cinemas. “It was almost a guerilla warfare,” noted Vetri Maaran, about the trials and tribulations Priya and her daughter [Ardra Swaroop] endured as long as five years. “All I could afford was the brand name; the rest of it was taken care of by Priya and her team. In fact, Ram’s contribution to bringing Baaram here is much more than mine,” he said, making an interesting observation about the lack of a parallel movement in Tamil cinema.

“Our [mainstream] audience is more refined compared to other industries. This I noticed when they received Visaranai with open arms,” he remarked, adding, “The success of this movie will mark the beginning of many such projects.”

Mysskin said, “I thought it was going to be an ‘art’ film when Ram invited me for the screening. I walked in with a headache and was sceptical about it [Baaram]. But the movie gave me a tight slap.” Baaram, according to him, lifted a huge weight off his chest and made him lighter as a person. “My initial reaction after watching it was to visit my parents. It’s been years since I last saw them. The movie will bring families closer. That’s what it did to me,” he added.

Baaram is scheduled to release on February 21.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/p2omvo/article30810571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GetImageContentH7K8R68T,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-weight-of-reality/article30810572.ece

There are actually two love at first sight scenes in this romcom about three cousins. First up, Kuttan (Nivin), on his first ever flight, catches the eye of beautiful, half-Malayali airhostess Meenakshi (Isha Talwar), who helps him adjust his seatbelt. Sadly, that romance is all too brief thanks to Kuttan’s naivety and Meenakshi’s double-timing! The enduring one is when Aju (Dulquer Salmaan) is bowled over by RJ Sarah (Parvathy), after listening to her talk show. He makes a surprise visit to her studio and finds out that she is wheelchair-bound. That does not stop him from choosing to walk beside her for the rest of their lives.

George is gobsmacked by Malar and her Tamil accent. So what if Malar is the new guest lecturer in the college? As far as George is concerned she is the love of his life, colouring his soul with a million myriad hues. Their love is short-lived for reasons beyond his control. Malar becomes the one who got away, but never forgotten.

After an engaging game of cat and mouse, Charlie (Dulquer Salmaan) and Tessa (Parvathy Thiruvothu) meet in person only at the very end of the film, of all places at the Thrissur Pooram, one of the biggest temple festivals of Kerala. However, as the movie progresses, we find that the souls of these two vagabonds found each other long before that meeting — in Charlie’s cluttered apartment in Fort Kochi that Tessa now rents, in the town’s alleyways and its people and high up in the misty tea estates of Idukki. No wonder Tessa is immediately drawn to Charlie amid the sea of humanity at the Pooram. That said, getting each other to reveal each other’s identities is not easy as it seems.

161,2020/02/13,Remembering Pran in his birth centenary year: The good bad guy of Hindi cinema,"A versatile actor, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award winner lent interesting layers to villainy, which not many attempted before or after him

Sunil Sikand has been posting on social media some memorable photographs of his father Pran, whose birth centenary is being celebrated. He started with the one where the legendary villain of the big screen is dressed as a woman. Most could not recognise him in the photo which, according to Sikand, a filmmaker, was a prank played by his father during the wedding of his (Pran’s) elder brother. This was not a one off. He played Sita in Ram Leela in Shimla opposite Madan Puri, who played Rama. Who would have thought the actors would go on to become two of the most successful villains of Hindi cinema.

“He was a master of disguise. My favourite performances of him are in Halaku, Shaheed and Jungle Main Mangal where he completely transformed himself according to the demands of the character,” says Sikand, who was an assistant director in Dharam Veer and Amar Akbar Anthony, films in which Pran played crucial roles. “Punctual and disciplined, for him, make-up was an integral part of acting. We would work extra-hard with the make-up man to design his look.”

A versatile actor, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award winner lent interesting layers to villainy, which not many attempted before or after him. Nobody thought of K.N. Singh, who used to be a popular villain before Pran arrived on the scene, as somebody who could woo the heroine and become a competition to the hero. He was even paid more than the heroes. Be it Zanjeer, Madhumati, Do Badan, Love in Tokyo, An Evening In Paris, Brahmachari or Ram Aur Shyam, Pran lent a certain dignity to his roles that were closer to life. He could play a rustic zamindar or smuggler with equal felicity.

Off-screen, Sikand describes Pran as a man of ethics. He declined to accept the Best Supporting Actor Filmfare award for Beimaan because Ghulam Mohammed was not given the Best Music Director award for Pakeezah. Describing him as a doting father, Sikand, who has directed his father in Farishta and Lakshmanrekha, says, Pran was in love with the camera. “He started as a photographer and carried through that passion. He was also fond of collecting pipes.”

Considerate colleague

Amitabh Bachchan, who worked with the three-time Filmfare Award winner in over a dozen films, remembers him as a “considerate colleague” who lent “sophisticated elegance” to his surroundings. “He was soft-spoken, reserved and a gentleman,” says Bachchan in a written statement. “However, none of these traits could be related to the roles he played on the screen. This proves his acting prowess,” he adds.

Bachchan also underlines his proficiency in Urdu. Sikand attributes this to his father’s education in the Urdu medium. He would often use Urdu words in films, the favourite being barkhurdar. It is said that Pran used to write his dialogues in Persian.

Ameya Bundellu, a young film historian, who has tracked the filmography of Pran says, the actor constantly evolved when others around him remained trapped in an image. “He started as a hero in Punjabi films. After the Partition, when he moved to Bombay, he was offered negative roles, starting with Ziddi and Badi Behan, but he never allowed them to become one dimensional.”

In the 1950s and 60s, he was pitted against the top heroes of the time, but he stood out. Writers penned characters with Pran in mind. “He didn’t need to bring any physicality or brute force to the characters. His menacing look was enough to fill the audience with fear. He internalised the emotions so well that you could see different shades of grey in the same character and, at times, a streak of reformation too,” says Ameya, citing Jis Desh Main Ganga Behti Hai, where as dacoit Raka, he has a change of heart towards the end. “He also brought in a touch of humour to the crook as he bonded with Kishore Kumar in Half-Ticket,” adds Ameya, who runs a film club Mumbai which screens little-known films. One of them is Nanha Farishta, where Pran, along with two other villains of the time, Ajit and Anwar, finds a baby girl who changes their life.

His off-screen image of a thorough gentleman also helped. “We never faced any problem in school for being the children of a popular villain,” says Sikand. “There was no controversy around him,” remarks Ameya.

Upkar, where he played the lovable Malang Chacha, changed his villainous image forever. People accepted him as a stern grandfather in Parichay, an aggressive Michael in Majboor and an honest police constable in Beimaan. In “Victoria No. 203, though Navin Nischol is the hero, it is Pran and Ashok Kumar who drive the narrative,” reminds Ameya. In Dharma, one of the big hits of 1973, he played the title role of a dacoit. Its song ‘Raaz Ki Baat Kehdoo Toh’ featuring him and Bindu was a hit too. So was the song ‘Hum Bolega to Bolenge Ki Bolta Hai’ from Kasauti in which he plays a Nepali. In the 1980s and early 90s, he continued to play supporting roles. From the stern jailor of Kaalia to an imposing patriarch in Sanam Bewafa, Pran’s dialogues continued to stir emotions.

While Ameya looks back at his on-screen chemistry with Ashok Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan, Sikand fondly remembers his roles opposite Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand, and Shammi Kapoor. “He gave pran (life) to every role!”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/1eeqsg/article30809856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14FRPRAN5,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/remembering-pran-in-his-birth-centenary-year-the-good-bad-guy-of-hindi-cinema/article30809859.ece
162,2020/02/13,'Pressure Cooker': What does it mean to be an NRI?,"With the American dream as a backdrop, director Sujoi Karampuri explores the realm of NRIs in today’s context

Nearly two decades after Hyderabad Blues and Dollar Dreams released, we have another film on the American dream. Pressure Cooker, directed by Sujoi Karampuri and his brother Sushil, is a take on the life of NRI families. “The theme of the desis’ American dream can be recurring, as the issues keep changing. Tharun Bhasckar who saw the film said it is the most comprehensive film on NRIs so far, because we didn’t bother to be politically correct. People left India in the 80s and 90s in droves, and by now their parents would have gotten quite old; that angle hasn’t been dealt in seriousness. Parents tend to push their kids to the U.S. so that they are successful and they can feel proud of them. What happens when they go and when the parents need them the most? However, that is not the only element. There is romance, friendship; there is this boy who is confused, he doesn’t know if he should follow his passion or go abroad. The heroine is strong in her convictions. She is like an anchor and he is like a storm. She questions his assumptions and punctures it with cute dialogues.”

Sujoi shares more. “When the boy’s goal is questioned he says it is going to America. The girl laughs and wonders how reaching a place can be a goal.” There is a love story. The initial brush is rough but over a period of time they like each other because of their value systems. Their conflicts come to the fore in the end. A story of the boy who wants to follow his dreams in his country, allowing the children to follow their passion and the girl who doesn’t want to marry an NRI — sounds refreshing...

The whole movie is in Telangana dialect. Sujoi says, “That is what I speak at home. We wrote the script three years ago, even before Pelli Choopulu. My brother and I were patient with the project. Doing a good product was of paramount importance, we did some previews, re-shooting the scenes, restructuring ..we went through all of that.”

Sujoi and Sushil’s friend Shyam is also an important part of the project who helped with the script. The selling point is its originality. It has a compelling emotional story and is being promoted as a new-age family entertainer.

The film stars Sai Ronak, Rahul Ramakrishna and Preethi Asrani. The directors hails from Warangal and are touring Andhra for promotions. Says Sujoi, “We always have this perception that audience back mainstream commercial blockbusters but when Pelli choopulu was received well, we knew they would like our movie too. There is a lot of content that connects to common people. We tried to make it authentic and realistic. It is a story of collective experiences, some of it is from mine, some from my brother.”

The trailer of Irrfan Khan’s much anticipated Angrezi Medium is out!

Directed by Homi Adajania, the movie also stars Kareena Kapoor, Radhika Madan, Deepak Dobriyal, Dimple Kapadia, Ranvir Shorey, Pankaj Tripathi and Kiku Sharda.

Angrezi Medium is a spin-off of Irrfan Khan's 2017 comedy Hindi Medium, and expected to be a poignant tale of the relationship between a father and a daughter. Irrfan Khan plays a small-town sweet-seller, while his daughter, played by Radhika Madhan, harbours dreams of studying overseas. The story traces the journey of the two to London, where Radhika’s character wishes to study, while her dad faces several issues with arranging the fees for her admission.

The movie is pitched as a tale of ‘unconditional love between a father and his daughter’, along with unbreakable friendships and small-town obsessions with the ‘foreign’ dream.

165,2020/02/13,‘Kaadan’ is the toughest movie I’ve been a part of: Rana Daggubati,"At the press meet of ‘Kaadan’, director Prabhu Solomon and actors Rana Daggubati and Vishnu Vishal spoke about wildlife conversation, which seems to be the underlying message of the movie

There are few movies that promise to offer a wholesome cinematic experience. Prabhu Solomon’s upcoming Kaadan is one movie that hopes to achieve that. It is a movie that is intended for families and children, though it touches upon a universal concept: coexistence between man and animal.

Prabhu Solomon is one filmmaker whose movies have a strong sense of Nature. But the director said he was double-minded when he walked into the office of Suresh Productions [the company owned by Rana Daggubati’s father, Suresh Babu], when he had gone to narrate the script of Kaadan. “I had only narrated the first 20 minutes of the movie, but he [Suresh Babu] started to engage with me, which was very encouraging,” said Prabhu Solomon, speaking at the press meet of Kaadan, releasing in Hindi as Haathi Mere Saathi and Aranya in Telugu.

The jungle book

The director is reasonably confident about the product, given the core message that Kaadan carries within. “The movie is just a spark and I hope it reaches the proportion of forest fire. We haven’t fabricated the truth, but sugar-coated it for the sake of commercial viability,” he said, adding that the character Rana Daggubati plays was inspired from environmental activist Jadav Payeng, who is famously called the Forest Man of India. Talking about the significance of elephants in the larger ecosystem, Prabhu noted how we have been abusing wildlife for the longest time. “I read a report about a wall being raised blocking the passage of elephants from Kaziranga National Park. Who will voice for their [elephants] issues?”

That question formed the basis of his script, which has Rana playing the guardian of the forest. “It was a physically demanding role and required Rana to run amidst 30-odd elephants. There were instances where I had asked for retakes, but he never made me feel uncomfortable,” he added.

Into the woods

Coming to Chennai was like a homecoming for Rana, who visited the city almost three years after the release of Baahubali: The Conclusion. Having played the eponymous Bhallaladeva in Baahubali series, Rana was almost convinced that no other character would be as exhausting as the mighty warrior. “But Prabhu sir changed my perception within a week,” he laughed, adding, “I have always believed that it’s not the storytellers who find stories, but the other way round. The power of this story is much bigger than us.”

The team of 'Kaadan'

Rana had been wanting to do a Tamil movie ever since his début film, Leader, which was produced by AVM Productions. But he was waiting for the right script, despite meeting Tamil filmmakers on and off. He describes Kaadan the “toughest movie” he has ever been part of, “I’ve wanted to do a movie that had the potential to reach a larger section of the audience. This is the first time I’m part of a movie that was shot in three languages.” But Rana isn’t the only hero of Kaadan. Unnikrishnan, a wild elephant that has also acted in Kumki 2, has played a pivotal role. “Having worked with him [Unnikrishnan], I can safely say that he’s learned the language of cinema,” added Prabhu.

For Vishnu Vishal, it was about overcoming fear. “I’m afraid of forest and Nature. But the movie communicates an important message: that love is universal,” he said. It was during the making of this movie when Vishnu met with a severe injury that put him out of work for a month. But looking back, he says he was grateful to have had the fall. “I have no regrets because I was back on my feet and overcame my inhibitions,” he said, adding, “The movie went through a lot of hurdles over the last two and a half years. But one person who kept his patience and vision intact was Prabhu sir.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4ah6tq/article30808630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kaadan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kaadan-is-the-toughest-movie-ive-been-a-part-of-rana-daggubati/article30808632.ece

167,2020/02/13,"When we try doing things that are ahead of the times, it might not be accepted easily, says filmmaker VK Prakash","Although the director is disgruntled at not been given his due for his contributions to the Malayalam film industry, his love for experimenting with genres and storytelling keeps him going

V K Prakash is a storyteller. The School of Drama alumnus, who has found success in advertising and movies, seems to connect the formats quite well using storytelling skills. Since his debut as a director with the National award-winning Punaradhivasam in 2000, VKP, as he is popularly known as, has been making experimental films and taking up novel themes.

At present, he is busy shooting Oruthee with Navya Nair and Vinayakan in the lead roles. Vishnu Priya, a completed film in Kannada with Shreyas Manju and Priya Varrier, a Marathi project with Amey Wagh, and Ramasethu in Malayalam, a biopic on E Sreedharan, the visionary behind the Kochi metro, are in the works.

Even after an incredible journey as an ad filmmaker and as a movie director, VKP tells Friday Review that he is surprised that his contributions are often overlooked by the Malayalam film industry.

Edited excerpts from an interview.

You work in multiple languages and in different genres...

I have grown up watching all kinds of movies. As a filmmaker, I like to experience the genres that I enjoy. My experience at the School of Drama has perhaps influenced me to make a Punaradhivasam and a Freaky Chakra, which have won prestigious awards. When you experiment, the results are unpredictable. While doing commercial ventures the objective is different. Perhaps it is my background in advertising that compels me to make movies with definite objectives.

Do you have a separate narrative pattern while working in ad films and feature films?

I have done storytelling commercials by creating ideas and communicating those to the audience. That has been my forte. Advertising helps in technical upgradation and provides an opportunity to work with the best technicians using the finest equipment. That is a great learning process. I make use of those lessons while making feature films and the storytelling expertise in advertising.

Your last release Praana had top technicians and was made with a single actor, Nithya Menen. Were you disappointed with the reception it got?

The mistake I made with Praana was that it got released in Malayalam first. The movie was made in four languages and if the Telugu version had come out first, I would have received more appreciation. Now, negotiations are on for the release on OTT platforms and the movie might be appreciated then. Praana was made mainly for a fantastic theatre experience.

You started a digital revolution in Malayalam with Moonaamathoraal. How important is technology in filmmaking?

Cinema is an audio-visual medium. Until the 1990s, movies were made with wonderful visuals. After that the focus shifted to dialogues and drama. I have tried giving more importance to visuals in my movies like Mullavalliyum Thenmavum, Beautiful and Trivandrum Lodge. At the same time Nirnayakam was content based. How you use your craft to tell a story in a creative way makes a film. As a filmmaker, I believe visuals will do the storytelling and the dialogues will be supportive.

When we try doing things that are ahead of the times, like the digital experiment for Moonaamathoraal, it might not be accepted easily. I had to face a lot of serious problems while releasing Moonaamathoraal. We were planning for a wide release but I was forced to restrict the release to 18 theatres. Interestingly, everything has gone digital from then on. But the sad part is that such contributions have been forgotten and, in Malayalam, I never get a mention anywhere. I guess that is because I keep a low profile and am not politically inclined.

Were you surprised when your movie Trivandrum Lodge got criticised for its bold theme and dialogues, despite it becoming a commercial success?

I consider Trivandrum Lodge a cult movie as such a theme was never handled in Malayalam cinema before. It was a challenge to tackle a story like that and I consider the movie as one of the best in my career. Trivandrum Lodge was a serious cinema, which had a rather slow-paced narrative and was never made for tickling the audience. We are planning a sequel to Trivandum Lodge.

VK Prakash and Navya Nair | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

What is theme of Oruthee, which you are currently shooting with Navya Nair and Vinayakan in the lead?

Oruthee is based on a true story, which will strike a chord with the women of today. The story is being narrated against the backdrop of the current political situation. The film is about a woman who reacts in a situation, without realising the extent of her actions. Navya essays a middle class woman and Vinayakan plays a cop.

Your next work in Malayalam is Ramasethu...

I am making Ramasethu as a fanboy. More than a biopic, the movie is an honest story based on E Sreedharan’s life. We are planning to start the shoot later this year.

Your daughter Kavya Prakash made her debut as a director with Vaanku...

To see my daughter turning director is really special. Vaanku is based on a story by Unni R and has a strong theme that has been narrated in an entertaining way.

What was your experience doing the web series Parchhayee, based on ghost stories by Ruskin Bond?

Parchhayee is a series of stories directed by directors all across India and I have done two of the 12 stories. I have always been fascinated by Bond’s writings and it was an amazing experience. We shot in Shimla.

You are seen at times doing brief appearances on screen. Do you enjoy your stint as an actor?

I usually do it for friends, mainly when I have to go for the shoot only for a couple of days. I enjoy acting. But playing legendary satirical writer Sanjayan in Vidooshakan was a rare opportunity and I was really excited about doing that.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/un44ms/article30798958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvfVKP,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/filmmaker-vk-prakash-on-his-love-for-experimenting-with-genres-and-storytelling/article30798962.ece
168,2020/02/13,"Dear Kollywood, where are the love stories?","As Valentine's Day approaches, Tamil cinema is desperately yearning for romantic subjects, with the likes of an 'Alaipayuthe' or 'Vinnaithaandi Varuvayaa' just a nostalgic memory

The Valentine weekend is here, but there is no palatable excitement in the Tamil film trade. Among the new releases, there seems to be only one romantic film, Oh My Kadavule. That’s a far cry from the days when romantic subjects used to crowd the ‘Kadhalar Dinam’ weekend.

With the decreasing number of songs, the concept of love itself has changed in Tamil films. Veteran music composer Gangai Amaran, who was part of a jury selecting the best songs from 2019’s films, had a tough time. He explains, “I’m pained to say the quality of music and lyrics have come down over the years, as most music directors are in search of a catchy number without bothering about the lyrics and composition.”

In the last few months, films that were marketed as ‘rom-coms’ did not work well at the box-office. Films like Alaipayuthe and Vinnaithaandi Varuvayaa look like they were from a different time. The last romantic hit in Tamil was the Vijay Sethupathi-Trisha 96 in 2018, directed by Prem Kumar, who remade the film in Telugu as Jaanu with Samantha and Sharwanand. But even the filmmaker doesn’t describe it as a ‘pure romance’. “It did not have the kind of romance or love scenes that Tamil audiences are used to. I won’t be making any sequel to it. Now, I’m in the process of writing a new script more of an edge-of-the-seat thriller as I would like to do something different.”

With the trend veering towards thrillers and horror comedies, romance seems to have taken a backseat. And that, in turn, affects the songs in the films. Today, most stars are not keen on lip sync songs and prefer background numbers. The number of songs has come down to three or four per album, as opposed to seven a few years ago. Singer Srinivas explains, “Songs have moved from ears to the eyes, as the idea today is to create a big bang impact as a promo to create a curiosity around the film. So the emphasis is on catch phrases and the need to catch the attention of the viewer in 10 seconds. Melody is no longer relevant in an age when composers are trying to create viral hit numbers.”

Carnatic singer Sudha Raghunathan agrees, saying, “The new romantic songs are no patch on the 60s to 80s evergreen numbers, the golden age of Tamil film music, and lack beauty in lyrics. Today’s romantic numbers are folk-driven. As a Carnatic singer, I’m unable to get over the fact that the melody, pain or sadness in a romantic number has gone missing.”

Challenges for composers

Tamil cinema’s popular music director and currently the busiest with an impressive list of romantic numbers, D Imman, feels that love tracks are difficult to be fit in non-romance genre flicks. “Only if the director got that extraordinary skill to form a neat lead scene bridging into a song will it work in today’s times.” He feels that the top heroes in the industry doing ‘mass’ commercial films require only four songs....most of them ones that play in the background. “With so many restrictions, implementing a romantic number or convincing a story teller to have a romantic song in their films is challenging.”

When a film needs to be trimmed, the romantic song is the one that gets hit first. A CBFC spokesperson says, “It has come to our notice that a lot of filmmakers are doing their own cutting to reduce run time. They remove songs or reducing their length prior to release after we have issued the censor certificate. It’s illegal as per law they should re-censor the film even if they cut one second from the original.”

Imman affirms by saying that it is only the fast-paced song that usually makes it to the theatre cut. “As a composer, once you do fast or rhythm-based songs, the intensity in melody making may get affected.” It is one of the major reasons why romantic songs are comparatively getting reduced these days.” With a new breed of filmmakers and composers taking over Tamil cinema, the onus seems to be more on creating chartbusters rather than a good old romantic melody.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ffpzyn/article30808460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MPVTV6,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dear-kollywood-where-are-the-love-stories/article30808462.ece
169,2020/02/13,Madras High Court stays tax official’s order against A.R. Rahman,"Commissioner of GST and Central Excise accused composer of tax evasion

The Madras High Court on Wednesday stayed the operation of an order passed by a Commissioner of Goods and Services Tax (GST) and Central Excise on October 17, accusing acclaimed music composer A.R. Rahman of having evaded payment of service tax, and directing him to pay arrears to the tune of ₹6.79 crore, excluding interest, from April 2013 to June 2017, along with a penalty of another ₹6.79 crore.

Justice Anita Sumanth granted the interim stay following a writ petition filed by the composer, challenging the tax demand along with penalty.

In his order, the Commissioner of GST and CE (Chennai South), K.M. Ravichandran, stated that intelligence gathered by the Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGSTI) indicated that the composer was not discharging service tax correctly on payments received by him.

Hence, an inquiry was initiated, and it was found that the composer was earning income by composing music for movies, receiving royalties for public performances of his music works, and by conducting live concerts both within the country as well as in foreign nations.

After excluding considerations received in foreign currency directly from the organisers abroad, the official held that all other services were taxable.

‘Wrong assumption’

However, in his affidavit, filed before the court, Mr. Rahman said that the Commissioner had proceeded on a wrong presumption that the producer of a movie should be considered as the owner of the copyright of a musical work. Relying upon Section 13(1)(a) of the Copyright Act of 1957, he claimed that the composer would be the sole and absolute owner of copyright on songs as well as background score composed for the movies, produced by others.

Stating that he assigns all rights on the works created by him in favour of the producer through an agreement, the petitioner said only thereafter, the producer becomes the absolute owner of the copyright on the musical work.

Stating that he had been discharging service tax only for the sound recording services provided by him, the composer said that permanent transfer of copyright could not be termed as a service liable to be taxed.

Further, temporary transfer of copyright was exempt from service tax, in terms of a notification issued by the Centre on June 20, 2012, he contended.

Stating that it was the Additional Director General of GST Intelligence who had issued a showcause notice to him on October 21, 2018, the petitioner said that it was legally impermissible for one authority to issue the notice and direct another authority (Commissioner of GST) to adjudicate the matter thereafter.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/mqgin9/article30805707.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-RAHMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/high-court-stays-tax-officials-order-against-ar-rahman/article30804702.ece
170,2020/02/13,Women guest lecturers complain of denial of maternity leave,"More than 3,500 guest lecturers, of which a large number are women, are engaged by the Higher Education Department to teach in arts and science colleges in Tamil Nadu

Women guest lecturers working in government arts and science colleges have complained about denial of maternity leave despite being in service for many years.

More than 3,500 guest lecturers, of which a large number are women, are engaged by the Higher Education Department to teach in these colleges. Tamil Nadu government at present provides 270 days of maternity leave to its women employees, subjected to them meeting certain eligibility criteria.

Citing a letter issued by the Principal Secretary to Government (Training) on April 20, 2015, the women guest lecturers say that, as per the letter, they will fall under the category of “non-permanent married women government servants, employed under the emergency provisions i.e. temporarily” and hence will be eligible for maternity leave provided they have completed one year of employment.

L. Uma Bharathi, a guest lecturer in Quaid-e-Millath Government College for Women, who is expecting her second child, said that officials, however, denied her leave by stating that guest lecturers were not eligible.

“Though majority of us are engaged for many years in colleges, we do not receive salary for the month of May during vacation. Every June, the government shows as if we are engaged afresh. Hence, we are being told that we cannot claim to have completed more than one year,” she said. “The delivery of my first child was through C-Section. Hence, this child is also going to be C-Section. My doctor has advised me to be on leave,” she noted.

V. Thangaraj, State president, Tamil Nadu All Government College UGC Qualified Guest Lecturers’ Association, said that the guest lecturers have been demanding maternity leave for many years. “We are not even stressing for paid leave. Anyway, we are getting a pittance of only ₹15,000 since 2016. The government should at least consider providing unpaid maternity leave with an assurance that the women can join back work after their leave,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/i281a9/article30809716.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GUESTLECTURERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/women-guest-lecturers-complain-of-denial-of-maternity-leave/article30809718.ece
171,2020/02/13,SHRC asks DGP to give instructions to SHOs on registering FIR,"The commission takes suo motu cognisance of a report published in The Hindu on March 11, 2018

The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has recommended to the Tamil Nadu government to instruct the Director General of Police (DGP) to issue suitable instructions to all Station House Officers (SHOs) across the State to act as per Section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) whenever complaints were received and cognizable offences were made out in them.

While passing orders on a complaint, SHRC acting chairperson D. Jayachandran also recommended to the State government that the DGP be instructed to give necessary training/awareness programme about human rights to all the SHOs across the State.

The Commission had initially taken suo motu cognisance of a report published in The Hindu on March 11, 2018 and sought for a report from the Director General of Police / Director, Investigation Wing of the Commission. Subsequently, the complainants sent the complaints to the Commission.

In their complaint, R. Irudayaraj and Saloman David submitted that four churches / prayer houses at Koodal Pudur and Sikkandar Chavadi of Madurai district were attacked by some Hindu religious extremist groups and the Holy Bible was burnt on March 11, 2018. Though complaints were submitted and videos submitted, police failed to mention the name of Hindu Munnani functionary in the FIR and hence the complaint.

The respondent policemen denied all the averments set out in the complaint filed by the complainants. They submitted they registered a case on March 14 and accused persons were arrested on March 17 and 19 that year and that similar action was followed in other cases too.

After considering the arguments from both sides, the Commission referred to the Supreme Court judgment in Lalithakumari vs. Government of Uttar Pradesh case which held the office in-charge of a police station was mandated to register every information oral or written relating to the commission of a cognizable offence and eventually register an FIR, as per Section 154 of the CrPC.

“Considering the records available on hand and the report.. the respondents issued only CSR and registered FIR only after three days, after the intervention of the higher officials, which shows the slackness in duty by not registering an FIR instantly…” Mr. Jayachandran pointed out.

The Commission also recommended a compensation of ₹60,000 to the complainants and that the sum be recovered from Inspector Manivannan and Sub Inspector Murugan, then attached to Koodalpudur police station.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xmf537/article30817064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THTNJAYACHANDRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/shrc-asks-dgp-to-give-instructions-to-shos-on-registering-fir/article30808873.ece
172,2020/02/13,"Over 400 Dalits in Coimbatore converted to Islam, claims outfit","“The State government’s failure to see the Nadur tragedy through the caste discrimination prism, recognise that casteism was at the core of the tragedy and displaying anti-Dalit bias were the reasons for the conversion”

Over 400 persons from Coimbatore have converted to Islam in recent weeks, Tamil Puligal, a Dalit outfit, has claimed.

According to M. Ilavenil, general secretary of the outfit, 420 residents, many of them members of Tamil Puligal, from Thondamuthur, Annur, Periyanaickenpalayam, Karumathampatti and Mettupalayam embraced Islam at mosques near their homes.

He claimed that the religious conversions were the fallout of the wall collapse in Nadur, Mettupalayam in early December 2019, in which 17 persons belonging to the Scheduled Caste died. None of the converts were from Nadur “because Hindu organisations and police are camping there after our announcement [about conversion] on January 24,” he further claimed.

The outfit’s chief Nagai Thiruvalluvan, arrested on charges of inciting violence in Mettupalayam, said his cadres had planned for the conversion when he was imprisoned. The primary reason was what he described as “discrimination against Dalits”, particularly by the officials.

“The State government’s failure to see the Nadur tragedy through the caste discrimination prism, recognise that casteism was at the core of the tragedy and displaying anti-Dalit bias were the reasons for the conversion,” he charged.

“Why did the police show hesitation in registering a case against the owner of the property whose compound fell on three houses killing the 17 Dalits; why did the police, right from the beginning, attempt to conceal the discrimination angle; why did the government not take any action against officials who had failed to act on Nadur residents’ petition regarding the compound wall and why did the police fail to act in a fair manner,” he asked.

“These questions have been weighing on the minds of his outfit’s members, Dalit activists and concerned Dalits. This has been a simmering anger that led to the decision to conversion to Islam, where they are guaranteed of equality,” he added.

This, however, did not include people from the affected area, Nadur, he said. “Consequent upon our announcement, members of Hindu outfits have camped in the area convincing the residents to not convert. They are supporting the building of a temple. And, the police too are in good numbers. Even I’ve not been able to go there.” Terming the Dalits of Nadur gullible, Mr. Thiruvalluvan said they were under the Hindu organisation’s influence.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/zh4hcf/article30808863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WALL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/over-400-dalits-in-coimbatore-converted-to-islam-claims-outfit/article30808864.ece
173,2020/02/13,"Air India Express set to achieve record profit, says CEO","Announces flights to Doha, Abu Dhabi and New Delhi from Tiruchi

Air India Express, which has been posting profits for the past four consecutive years since 2015-16, expects to achieve a record profit of over ₹500 crore during the current financial year, its Chief Executive Officer K.Shyam Sundar said here on Thursday.

The low cost carrier, a subsidiary of Air India, also expects to cross ₹5,000 crore in operating revenue, for the first time since inception, during the current fiscal.

“The airline’s revenue in the first six months of 2019-20 stood at ₹3,124.34 crore and this is a phenomenal growth of 40% over the same period over the previous financial year. The half-yearly net profit of the current fiscal was ₹679.8 crore against the ₹177.3 crore registered during the same period the previous year,” Mr.Shyam Sundar said wihle announcing the launch of flights to Doha, Abu Dhabi and New Delhi from Tiruchi.

The airline’s revenue in the third quarter was also excellent and the operating revenue increased to ₹4,235 crore by the end of December 2019. During 2018-19, the airline’s revenue was ₹4,171.5 crore and the net profit, ₹168.5 crore.

Air India Express, he said, was catering to a niche market and was always looking to expand operations from Tier II or III cities such as Tiruchi and connect them with foreign destinations abroad. “We are here to seize every market opportunity subject to availability of capacity. We are identifying potential routes,” he said.

Answering a query, he said that any fleet augmentation plans could be finalised only after the disinvestment process was over. The airline currently operates with a fleet of 25 Boeing 737-800 aircrafts with a seating capacity of 186 -189.

New flights

Stating that Tiruchi was the top destination for the airline in Tamil Nadu, Mr.S hyam Sundar announced the launch of direct flights from the city to Doha and Adu Dhabi and to New Delhi in its summer schedule, effective March 28.

The airline is launching flights to Doha from Tiruchi for the first time while reviving the service to Abu Dhabi, which it had suspended some years back. The Tiruchi-Abu Dhabi-Tiruchi service will operate four times a week and the Tiruchi-Doha-Tiruchi flights will be thrice weekly.

Domestic flights

The airline will also launch a Tiruchi-Madurai-New Delhi service, the first service on the route by the airline. “We are extending the Madurai-New Delhi flights, which have been operating four days a week, to Tiruchi and making it a daily flight,” Mr.Sundar said and hoped that the service would also address the city residents’ clamour for increasing domestic air connectivity.

The airline is already operating to Dubai, Sharjah and Singapore from Tiruchi and once the new flights are launched, the airline will be operating 35 flights a week from the city.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/m0fxpb/article30808269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIEXPRESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/air-india-express-set-to-achieve-record-profit-says-ceo/article30808270.ece
174,2020/02/13,Headmaster of a primary school held for sexual assault on students,"The arrest of the headmaster, A. Makaliappan (52) from Vinayagar Nagar near Sulthanpet in Coimbatore, came in the wake of an inquiry conducted by the District Child Protection Unit

After three days of furore, the Negamam police in Coimbatore arrested the headmaster of a primary school near here for alleged sexual assault on minor girls.

The arrest of the headmaster, A. Makaliappan (52) from Vinayagar Nagar near Sulthanpet in Coimbatore, came in the wake of an inquiry conducted by the District Child Protection Unit which found that he had allegedly subjected three minor girls to sexual assault in school.

Makaliappan was arrested late on Wednesday for offences under Sections 9 (f) (whoever being on the management or staff of an educational institution or educational institution, commits sexual assault on a child in that institution), 9 (l) (whoever commits sexual assault on a child more than once or repeatedly), 9 (m) (whoever commits sexual assault on a child below twelve years) read with 10 (punishment for aggravated sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. He was produced before a magistrate and remanded in judicial custody.

According to the police, Makaliappan was working as headmaster of the panchayat union primary school on Pollachi-Palakkad Road as headmaster for 10 years.

On February 2, the District Child Protection Unit received information on alleged sexual harassment by the accused on girl students. Sudhamani, a counsellor with the District Child Protection Unit, went to the school and conducted an inquiry. During the enquiry, three students gave statements accusing the headmaster of having touched their private parts.

The officer later lodged a complaint with the police which led to the headmaster’s arrest around 11.30 p.m. on Wednesday. The arrest of the headmaster comes in the wake of a series of protests by the parents of students since Monday evening.

On Tuesday, the then Coimbatore Chief Educational Officer P. Ayyanan ordered the transfer of Makaliappan and said that departmental inquiry would be initiated against him. Makaliappan was transferred to a nearby primary school, although he was on medical leave when the transfer order was issued.

Hours after the transfer of the headmaster, the Department of School Education issued an order transferring Mr. Ayyanan to Namakkal on Tuesday evening.

175,2020/02/13,New barrage at Mukkombu to have an automatic monitoring system,"It is part of the ₹387.60 crore barrage project across Kollidam river to replace the existing one, a portion of which collapsed in August 2018 due to heavy flood.

The Public Works Department plans to install an automatic reservoir monitoring and control system, an advanced computerised control and flood monitoring mechanism, at Mukkombu barrage near here.

It is part of the ₹387.60 crore on going project to construct a barrage across the Kollidam river to replace the existing one, a portion of which collapsed in August 2018 due to heavy flood. On behalf of the PWD, Larsen and Toubro, is executing the project.

The new barrage will probably be the first to get such an automatic reservoir monitoring system in this region. Apart from continuously monitoring the reservoir water level, the system would envisage increase or decrease in level by taking into consideration the geographical contours of the area and other factors.

A sensor will measure the rise or fall in water level. The software allows the exact monitoring and the adjustment of water outflow to maintain the required level. There will be a mechanism to get the visual display of various aspects of water level, gate positions and others.

Informed sources told The Hindu that the system would also measure the rate of inflow water to the barrage. Based on the requirement, the water level of the barrage could be maintained by setting optimum level by opening and closing the gates automatically. All preliminary measurements and data for installing the system have been collected. A team of electrical and electronic engineers would be involved in designing the system.

A senior PWD official said that the new barrage would have 55 hydraulic shutters. While the southern arm would have 45 shutters, there would be 10 shutters in the northern arm. The average weight of each shutter would be 10 kg. However, each of them was being customised as per the requirement. An onsite fabrication unit had been set up at the barrage construction site so as to modify or adjust the shutters as per the site requirement.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/16no8t/article30807867.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUKKOMBU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/new-barrage-at-mukkombu-to-have-an-automatic-monitoring-system/article30807868.ece
176,2020/02/13,AICTE’s course correction worries engineering colleges,"The council has held stakeholders’ meeting in Mumbai and Delhi so far. Another will be held in Andhra Pradesh for colleges in the southern region.

The All India Council for Technical Education has made the approval process tougher to comply with keeping in line with its decision on course correction and improving the quality of engineering education. College administrators are feeling the impact now.

The council has held stakeholders’ meeting in Mumbai and Delhi so far. Another will be held in Andhra Pradesh for colleges in the southern region. In the last two meetings, college administrators have been reiterating the same point though.

The principal of an autonomous college from the western region, who participated in the meeting held in Mumbai on Monday, said that AICTE Chairman Anil D. Sahasrabudhe had responded only to 25% of the queries raised by colleges.

“I am heading an institution with a long-standing reputation but even we will have difficulty in increasing the teacher-student ratio from 1:20 to 1:15. We need at least a year to change over but the chairman did not respond to this plea,” he rued.

Teachers welcome the council’s move to reduce the MCA programme to two years, but say this could mean the excess staff would have to be sent out.

The council’s emphasis on accreditation of 60% of courses in a college as mandatory for approval has caused consternation. “Only a handful of colleges, including the CEG manage to fill PG seats. Most others have only three or four students. Under the new regulation, we will have to close PG sections. But then in a few years we may not have sufficient teachers,” the principal pointed out.

This academic year, the admission was less than 30% in more than 100 colleges. With the council introducing new norms for admission, it is only going to get more difficult to run colleges, said P. Selvaraj, secretary, Consortium of Self-Financing Professional, Arts and Science Colleges in Tamil Nadu.

According to sources around a dozen colleges in the State may opt out of admission for academic year 2020-21.

R.M.Kishore of the RMK group of institutions, who is attending Wednesday’s meeting, said he would appeal for more time. “The deadline to submit for approval is February 29. Even if it is extended by a week, we can’t recruit teachers,” he said.

From next year, the council has decided that Chemistry is not required for B.E, B.Tech admission. Instead, students could have taken biochemistry, vocational or computer science as a subject in Class 12. Teachers say this could deny level-playing field for students, who would have made better choice had they known it earlier.

Deadline extended

On Thursday, Anna University announced an extension of deadline for colleges to apply for affiliation. It was earlier February 10. It has been extended to Feb 17.

178,2020/02/13,TNPSC recruitment scam: Appavu refutes Jayakumar’s charges,"The Minister has alleged that the former DMK MLA had close links with the accused

Former Radhapuram MLA M. Appavu has categorically denied Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar’s allegation that he had close ties with one of the persons arrested in connection with the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission recruitment scam.

After the CB-CID police, who are probing the TNPSC Group IV and Group II A recruitment scam, arrested hairdresser Ayyappan from Ramachandrapuram near Vijayapathi under Koodankulam police station limits, who has also passed in the Group IV exam, Mr. Jayakumar had told the reporters that Mr. Appavu had close links with Ayyappan and showed a photo of the two that went viral on social media to reiterate his charge.

Denying it stoutly, Mr. Appavu, while addressing the media here on Wednesday, said the CB-CID probing this scam should be given freehand in the investigation which should be monitored by a sitting Judge of the Madras High Court.

Moreover, all examinations being conducted by the TNPSC should also be conducted under his supervision to weed-out “murky deals” now getting unearthed everyday from every nook and corner of Tamil Nadu.

“I am in public life for 24 years and had been the MLA for 15 years. I have always raised my voice against irregularities and scams and never been part of anything unethical and unlawful. Since I am in public life, I attend all auspicious functions and unfortunate incidents in my constituency [Radhapuram]. During one of these functions, the said Ayyappan might have taken a photo with me which does not mean that he is my supporter,” Mr. Appavu clarified.

While accusing the Ministers of Tamil Nadu, including Mr. Jayakumar, of indulging in corruption of all sorts, Mr. Appavu said sitting MLA of Radhapuram I.S. Inbadurai was spearheading the malicious campaign against him.

He said Mr. Jayakumar, in a bid to portray him as innocent, had indulged in mudslinging against DMK president M.K. Stalin and his son Udhayanidhi Stalin.

Mr. Inbadurai, who met reporters in the evening in a hastily arranged press conference, said Ayyappan, who did election work at Padalaiyarkulam along with Mr. Appavu in the recently held Nanguneri by-poll, had sought ticket in the DMK to contest in the Radhapuram union council election as he had held the party post of Radhapuram union students’ wing deputy organiser.

“Since Ayyappan had close association with Mr. Appavu, the CB-CID should question the former MLA also in connection with the TNPSC recruitment scam. If not, I will approach the court seeking direction to the investigating agency to grill Mr. Appavu,” Mr. Inbadurai said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/q2eena/article30807358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA13-APPAVU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tnpsc-recruitment-scam-appavu-refutes-jayakumars-charges/article30807359.ece
179,2020/02/13,13 students in hospital after eating laddus in Dharmapuri,"Students consumed them accidentally

Thirteen students who accidentally consumed sesame laddus mixed with rat poison, meant to kill rodents in a government school, were rushed to the Government Medical College Hospital. The students are said to be out of danger.

All students, aged 17-18, of Begarahalli Government Higher Secondary School, were rushed to the nearest primary health center, after they ate the laddus, bought by a fellow student to the school.

A student of Gejanayakkanahalli village, D. Palanichamy, reportedly bought the sesame laddus to school, and shared it among classmates. It was later found that his father had mixed rat poison with the laddus and set them aside, to be used to kill rodents at home. Unaware, the boy had brought them to school.

Thirteen boys, including Palanichamy, complained of giddiness, and a few vomited and fainted, before they were rushed to the nearest PHC. From there, the boys were taken to the Government Medical College Hospital, Dharmapuri.

180,2020/02/13,HC questions rationale behind making changes in textbooks,"Court seeks explanation from SCERT

The Madras High Court on Wednesday questioned the basis on which State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) takes a decision to add or delete content from the textbooks prescribed for school students and wanted to know the procedures that were followed before taking such decisions.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha raised the question during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate S. Doraisamy of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK) against a circular issued by SCERT on January 10 for deleting a particular sentence from Class X social science textbook.

The sentence read that Hindu Mahasabha and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) had taken a pronounced anti Muslim stance during the days that led to the partition. P. Chandrasekaran, secretary of Chennai chapter of RSS, had taken exception to the sentence and made a representation to delete it from the textbook.

When his plea was not answered, he filed a writ petition before the High Court. During the course of hearing, SCERT told the court that it had decided to delete the sentence from the copies to be printed in future.

Insofar as the copies that had already been distributed, it was stated that stickers would be pasted on top of the sentence.

A single judge of the court was also told that the SCERT had written to the Director of School Education as well as the Director of Matriculation Schools to ensure that the sentence was effaced, by pasting a sticker on top of it, from the textbooks that had already been distributed to the students.

When advocate V. Elangovan, representing the present PIL petitioner, assailed such a decision taken by SCERT and contended that history should not be allowed to be changed, the judges called for an explanation from SCERT as to how could it make changes to a textbook solely on the basis of an individual’s representation.

They directed Special Government Pleader C. Munusamy to ensure that a counter affidavit along with supporting documents by March 19.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/o6yevt/article30644964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADRASHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-questions-rationale-behind-making-changes-in-textbooks/article30805485.ece
181,2020/02/13,SHRC recommends ₹10 lakh compensation for medical negligence during childbirth,"Woman, infant died after nurse tried to manage delivery in the absence of doctor

The State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) on Wednesday recommended the payment of ₹10 lakh as compensation to a man, whose wife died after a nurse attempted to assist in the process of childbirth in the absence of a qualified gynaecologist at a Primary Health Centre in Erode district. The newborn also died in the incident.

SHRC acting chairperson D. Jayachandran recommended that a sum of ₹5 lakh be recovered from the respondent, Dr. S. Vijayalakshmi, an assistant surgeon who was attached to the PHC in Vijayamangalam at the time of the incident. The Commission also recommended disciplinary action against her. According to the complainant, B. Raj of Perundurai taluk, his wife Kanchana had registered her pregnancy under the National Health Mission scheme at the Primary Health Centre in Vijayamangalam and underwent periodic check-ups during 2018. When she visited the PHC after developing labour pain on November 11 that year, the respondent informed her that she was ready for delivery.

However, when the patient visited the PHC again the same afternoon, she was told that the doctor had gone to Chennai, and that the nurse would have to administer the delivery. During an inquiry, it came to light that the nurse had called the respondent over the phone and had explained the complexity of the pregnancy to her, but the latter still did not return to the PHC.

The procedure was ill-administered by the nurse, leading to the patient being shifted to another PHC at Thingalur, which refused to provide treatment. The patient was eventually taken to the government hospital in Erode, where the doctors declared her and the infant dead.

The Commission had taken suo motu cognisance of a media report in December 2018 and had called for a report. The woman’s husband submitted a complaint against the respondents in September last year.

The SHRC also recommended disciplinary action against all four members of the Special Maternal Death Audit Committee.

Mr. Jayachandran asked the State government to strictly monitor the presence of doctors to provide delivery care on a 24x7 basis in all PHCs across the State. He further recommended that a duty chart in Tamil, with mobile numbers, be displayed in all PHCs, and that the authorities should make random calls and undertake surprise visits to PHCs.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/shrc-recommends-10-lakh-compensation-for-medical-negligence-during-childbirth/article30805464.ece
182,2020/02/13,PMK pitches for free bus rides and school breakfast in shadow Budget,"Ramadoss rejects NRC, proposes climate-smart agriculture

PMK founder S. Ramadoss presented the party’s shadow Budget for 2020-21 on Wednesday.

Dr. Ramadoss rejected the National Register of Citizens, prescribed free bus rides for women, proposed to implement only the “good aspects” of the National Education Policy and demanded that breakfast (with milk) be provided to school students in Tamil Nadu.

Days after the AIADMK government declared the Cauvery delta region a protected agricultural zone, Dr. Ramadoss said there was a need for adopting climate-smart agriculture to mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture.

“Agricultural growth needs to be at 6%. The PMK will take steps to form an expert committee and improve the groundwater situation such that the water table increases,” Dr. Ramadoss said. He said steps will be taken to create 50 lakh jobs in the agricultural and horticultural industries in the next five years.

Dr. Ramadoss also spoke about what is regarded as the party’s pet scheme – prohibition – and stressed the need for improving protections for women, especially those being harassed by men on the pretext of love. “Steps will be taken to create a separate unit in the police force to clamp down on violence against women due to unrequited love. The unit will also take action against fake marriage rackets and fight harassment of women in schools, colleges and workplaces,” he said. He called for smaller districts, such that each district had a population of 12 lakh. The PMK leader disagreed with the Centre on its decision to privatise public sector units.

To queries regarding his party’s relationship with the AIADMK, he said he was happy with the measures taken by the ruling party.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pmk-pitches-for-free-bus-rides-and-school-breakfast-in-shadow-budget/article30805460.ece
183,2020/02/13,Upcoming Budget may feature ‘populist scheme’,"This despite govt. resources being ‘already stretched’

The AIADMK government’s last full-fledged Budget before the 2021 Assembly election, to be presented by Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam on Friday, is expected to feature a ‘populist scheme’.

The expectation is based on the ground that the State government is to receive a revenue deficit grant of ₹4,025 crore and net an additional non-tax revenue of ₹2,600 crore during 2020-21.

Though these sources of income will not make the State revenue-surplus, they provide some room for the government to launch an “attractive scheme” in the coming year.

Besides, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, given his penchant for springing a surprise and the prevailing political fortunes of the ruling party, may be inclined to walk the extra mile.

Without ruling out the possibility, those involved in the preparation of the Budget say, however, that the government’s resources are “already stretched”. There are commitments towards the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation and State Transport Corporations that remain to be fulfilled.

The fact that the government’s calculations of revenue, worked out at the beginning of the current year, have gone wrong has been a matter of concern. A case in point is the growth rate in revenue through commercial taxes, which has been extremely modest. In the first half of 2019-20, the growth rate was 3.15% against the original estimate of around 11%

Resource mobilisation

Considering this and other factors, the Deputy Chief Minister, in his statement of mid-year review, which was presented to the Assembly last month, categorically said that the original estimated revenue deficit of ₹14,315 crore will be exceeded. He also dropped enough hints that the government might take up “additional resource mobilisation” to make up for the revenue shortfall, even as it continues various welfare and development schemes. Other than the recent hike in liquor prices, the government hasn’t announced any other increases.

It is against this backdrop that the 15th Finance Commission’s recommendation of providing a revenue deficit grant to the State has given relief to the government.

If the Centre releases the arrears of ₹4,073 crore in the Integrated Goods and Services Tax and around ₹3,370 crore in performance and basic grants for local bodies, the government’s financial health will see a substantial improvement.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/od88ex/article30805453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13Tamil-Nadus-fiscal-picturecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/upcoming-budget-may-feature-populist-scheme/article30805454.ece
184,2020/02/13,Azhvar idol traced to London museum,"It went missing from Kumbakonam temple 60 years ago

The Idol Wing CID has traced a bronze idol of Thirumangai Azhvar, which went missing from a temple in Kumbakonam 60 years ago, to a museum in London.

Abhay Kumar Singh, Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), Idol Wing CID, told The Hindu, “The idol has been missing from the Soundararajaperumal temple in Sundaraperumalkovil village near Kumbakonam since the 1960s. We traced the bronze idol to the Ashmolean Museum, London, after verifying the documentation of Hindu idols by the French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP). The picture of the Thirumangai Azhvar idol, which was taken in 1957, matches with the idol kept in the museum.”

The Idol Wing CID is pursuing new leads and reopening old cases which were closed several years ago.

Officers of the special unit had stumbled upon a new lead on the idol which went missing nearly 60 years ago.

Didn’t match picture

The investigators found a similar idol placed on the pedestal during a recent visit to the temple concerned. The picture provided by the IFP did not match with the idol they had seen at the temple, the police said.

The Ashmolean Museum, which is part of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, had purchased the idol in 1967 from an auction house for about $2,340.

“Now, we are taking steps to bring the idol back from London. We will intimate the Ashmolean Museum through the Indian Embassy and furnish a first information report (FIR), asserting that there had been a theft of property,” the ADGP said.

The Idol Wing CID had registered an FIR based on a complaint from the temple’s executive officer, Ka. Raja, who alleged that the idol went missing between 1957 and 1967.

The police have now intensified the investigation into the status of the idol between 1957 and 1967 and how it had ended up in London.

Other cases

“This positive development in the Ashmolean Museum will be the first big action on a new list of old robberies [of idols] from Tamil Nadu and Karaikal which we have cracked. The list of over 25 bronze idols has been passed on to law enforcement authorities in India and overseas. We hope similar action will follow from the other positive identifications in America, London, Germany and Singapore,” said S.

185,2020/02/13,Tamil Nadu CM Palaniswami inaugurates Ceat tyre plant,"‘T.N. accounts for 40% of country’s tyre production’

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday inaugurated Ceat’s tyre plant in Sriperumbudur near Chennai. The plant is expected to generate 1,000 jobs, with a proposed investment of ₹4,000 crore.

Inaugurating the plant, the Chief Minister said that Ceat had now joined other tyre-makers like MRF Ltd., Apollo Tyres, JK Tyres and Michellin Tyres in setting up a factory in the State.

“From two-wheeler tyres to tyres for fighter aircraft, they are all made in Tamil Nadu,” Mr. Palaniswami said, adding that the State accounted for 40% of India's tyre production. He pointed out that all clearances for the project were issued through the single window portal.

“An environment is emerging wherein the entire supply chain is being created within the State and firms need not depend on imports for raw materials,” he said.

“For instance, the tyre companies are currently importing synthetic rubber, which is a key raw material from countries like Malaysia and others. The proposed petrochemical project in the State will enable the tyre-makers to source the raw material at low cost locally, and the project will generate jobs,” Mr. Palaniswami said.

‘Firms reopening’

He also said companies which were closed down due to various reasons were being re-opened due to the efficient functioning of the State government. The Chief Minister congratulated Anant Goenka, MD, Ceat Tyres Ltd., and his team for implementing the project within a short span of 18 months since the signing of the memorandum of understanding with the State government. He requested Mr. Goenka to start a major R&D facility in Tamil Nadu.

Sixth plant

The Chennai plant would be the sixth in the country for Ceat, the flagship company of the RPG Group. “The company has invested ₹1,400 crore and employs 350 people, and plans to ramp up the investment to ₹4,000 crore over the next 7-10 years, and will create over 1,000 direct jobs,” said Mr. Goenka. Women accounted for 20% of the workforce and the company planned to raise it to 40% over time, he said.

He pointed out that the plant would cater to both domestic and export markets and the plant will reach full capacity utilisation in six months.

With a total area of 163 acres, the plant has a manufacturing capacity of 28,500 passenger car radial tyres per day and 2,500 motorcycle radial tyres per day.

Mr. Goenka said the Chennai plant will emerge as the company’s largest plant going forward and will make tyres for electric vehicles, high-end cars and bikes and for European markets.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jusvbc/article30805435.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13CMEDAPPADIPALANISWAMICEATTYREPLANTANANTGOENKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cm-inaugurates-ceat-tyre-plant/article30805436.ece
186,2020/02/13,NEET scam: sleuths seek UIDAI assistance to track down suspects,"CB-CID shares photos, biometric data for verification with Aadhaar database

The Crime Branch-CID of the Tamil Nadu police has written to the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), seeking its assistance to track down those suspected of having acted as proxies in the sensational NEET scam.

Investigators have shared the photographs and biometrics of at least a dozen suspects with the UIDAI authorities for verification with the national Aadhaar database.

The suspects, booked on the charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery and impersonation, were hired as proxies by candidates from Tamil Nadu to write the test on their behalf in different centres across the country.

The scam first surfaced in the Theni Medical College in Tamil Nadu, where the first case of a candidate clearing NEET with the help of a proxy who took the test on his behalf in north India was exposed. After the case was transferred to the CB-CID, more such cases were detected, and the agency had arrested 15 persons, including seven medicos and six parents. An investigation is on to apprehend the proxies who were hired to write the examination for these candidates at centres in other States.

Since the proxies are suspected to be undergraduate or postgraduate medicos, the agency has written to the Board of Governors of the National Medical Commission, requesting that the photographs of the suspects be shared with all medical colleges in the country for identification.

“We have written to the Director-General of Health Services to verify data in deemed universities. The details of proxies have also been shared with the Directors of Medical Education (DME) of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra and Rajasthan for posting the photographs of suspects on the notice boards in all medical colleges,” Superintendent of Police C. Vijaya Kumar told The Hindu on Wednesday.

Social media

After Director-General of Police M.S. Jaffar Sait held a review meeting with senior officials on the progress made in the case, investigators decided to write to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, seeking their assistance in identifying the suspects. “Since a majority of youth, particularly students, are active on social media, it is possible to identify the suspects if their photographs are shared with the administrators of such platforms,” he said.

Mr. Vijaya Kumar said the photographs/fingerprints of the proxies will not match with any records maintained by the National or State Crime Records Bureaux since they were not habitual offenders. “It has been almost three months since we wrote to the Central and State health authorities. Special teams are closely coordinating with these officials, and a breakthrough is expected soon. The possibility of a similar scam in NEET in other parts of the country cannot be ruled out,” he said. The CB-CID, which is currently focusing on the NEET scam in MBBS admissions, will soon start probing allegations of similar irregularities in postgraduate admissions, sources in the agency said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/neet-scam-sleuths-seek-uidai-assistance-to-track-down-suspects/article30804795.ece
187,2020/02/13,"Have you closed the existing hydrocarbon wells, Stalin asks CM","‘It is incumbent upon Centre to make an announcement first’

CHENNAI Raising the issue of the existing hydrocarbon wells in the Cauvery delta, DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday said it was incumbent upon the Centre to announce the closure of the wells to give credence to the Chief Minister’s announcement that no more hydrocarbon projects will be allowed in the region.

“Already, hydrocarbon wells have been dug in 31 places, and work is going on there. Have you closed them? Only after you close them can you pass any legislation denying permission to dig any more wells. The CM is unable to say that the Centre has to make an announcement first,” Mr. Stalin said.

Speaking at an event on Wednesday, he said, “While there is no doubt that the [State government’s] announcement is a boon to people who are suffering from various issues [in the region], it is the Centre that has to make an announcement first. It is worrying that the AIADMK government does not even have a basic understanding of such issues.”

The announcement on the protected agricultural zone was aimed at fooling the voters of the delta districts in view of the impending elections, he said. “Also, the announcement has to be made through a G.O, and the Central government has to approve it because it is the Centre that provides the funds,” he added.

In a statement, Mr. Stalin requested Minister of External Affairs Jaishankar to immediately intervene and ensure the safe return of Indian employees on board a Japanese cruise ship, as they had not been allowed to leave since 60 passengers of the ship had contracted coronavirus. Six of the affected employees were from Tamil Nadu, he pointed out.

Transfer of TNPSC probe

The DMK on Wednesday urged the State government to transfer the probe into the alleged malpractices in the TNPSC Group-I exams, held in 2015, from the State police to the Central Bureau of Investigation. The party claimed there was pressure on the police to shield some of the accused in the case.

DMK Rajya Sabha members R.S. Bharathi and P. Wilson called on Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam at the Secretariat and submitted a representation in this regard. In the representation, the DMK referred to a case pending before the Madras High Court over the TNPSC Group - I exams and underlined how three investigating officers probing the case were replaced",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/622d1d/article30804781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13DMKMKSTALIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/have-you-closed-the-existing-hydrocarbon-wells-stalin-asks-cm/article30804782.ece
188,2020/02/13,HC names RO for producers’ council polls,"The Madras High Court on Wednesday appointed one of its retired judges as the Returning Officer for conduct of elections to Tamil Film Producers Council (TFPC). The court also ordered that the entire election process should be completed by June 30 and a report in the court should be filed by July 30.

Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy passed the order on a batch of civil suits and writ petitions filed in 2018 and 2019 in connection with the conduct of elections to the producers council. Even as the cases were pending in the court, the State government appointed a Special Officer to manage the affairs of the council.

Advocate Krishna Ravindran, representing the council’s past president Vishal Krishna, impressed upon the need for conducting a fair and free election to the council at the earliest since the one-year tenure of the government appointed Special Officer was due to end during the course of the current year.

However, Additional Advocate General P.H. Arvindh Pandian told the court the tenure of the special officer had been extended for a further period of one year. As per the extension, the Special Officer could continue to administer the council till January 2, 2021, he said.

The AAG also requested the court to allow the Special Officer to conduct the elections under the supervision of a retired High Court judge who could be appointed as an Observer, if necessary. On the other hand, the litigants before the court insisted upon appointing a retired judge as the Returning Officer.

Accepting their plea, Justice Ramamoorthy ordered that the elections should be conducted only by a retired judge, who shall be named later, for conduct of elections as per the bylaws of society.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-names-ro-for-producers-council-polls/article30804726.ece
189,2020/02/13,Chief Minister honours fishing village in Thoothukudi that does not use nets,"532 fishing villages in State are co-managing resources with the government

The fishers of Kombutharai village in Thoothukudi do not know how to use fishing nets — they are accustomed to the traditional hook and line method of fishing, and they believe in conserving marine resources and do not catch small-sized fish.

Recently, the village’s co-management committee received an award from Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami as “the best village with co-management in the State”.

A cash award of ₹30,000 and a memento were presented on the occasion. The amount will be spent towards the welfare of the village.

Co-management is a concept that is being introduced in 532 fishing hamlets in Tamil Nadu, where the local community and the government share responsibility and authority for management of resources.

Cooperative governance

“This village has its own co-management committee that takes responsibility for the management of resources. They manage conflicts on their own, they handle fish in a hygienic manner, and they budget their expenses,” explained an official of the Fisheries Department.

Manakkudi in Kanniyakumari district and Sulerikattukuppam near Chennai have won the second and third places amongst co-managed villages for the CM’s award.

Better methods

George Gregory, the president of Kombuthurai’s fishermen’s cooperative society, said that the villagers had moved to their present location from Kanniyakumari in 1980, since “the catch there was not much”.

“Our forefathers only used hook and line fishing, which is what the 200-odd fishers in our village also follow. In fact, none of us know how to catch fish using nets. Our hooks and lines sometimes run for a length of about 4 km. With this method, we don’t catch the young of the fish, but only the big-sized ones. We don’t have any middlemen to sell our fish — we have removed them since the mid-1990s. Our fishing cooperative society fixes prices according to the catch,” Mr. Gregory explained.

The village also does not use plastics, and cleans its beach, fish-landing centre and auction hall regularly.

The fishers also contribute towards the upkeep of the village, the cooperative society, and any other needs.

The Fisheries Department has also set up similar co-management committees at the district, regional and State-levels to get more villages into the system.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/chief-minister-honours-fishing-village-in-thoothukudi-that-does-not-use-nets/article30804357.ece
190,2020/02/13,‘Governor will take good decision on Rajiv case convicts’,"Minister slams DMK for ‘empty talk and lip service’

Law Minister C.Ve. Shanmugam on Wednesday expressed hope that Governor Banwarilal Purohit would take a “good decision” on the release of all seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.

He told mediapersons, on the sidelines of an official function, that the Supreme Court had ruled that the Governor could take a decision on the matter, and that it could not issue any direction to him.

Guaranteed powers

“The Governor can exercise his powers guaranteed under the Constitution. We hope the Governor will take a good decision on the issue,” he said.

Taking a dig at the DMK, Mr. Shanmugam said the Opposition party, which was making tall claims now, had failed to take any steps for the release of the convicts.

The DMK was only resorting to empty talk and lip service on the issue, Mr. Shanmugam alleged.

While the DMK was in power, it had recommended the case of Nalini, wife of Murugan, and was against the commutation of death sentence for the other convicts.

“There is no point in raising an accusing finger against us,” he said.

191,2020/02/13,"Fortunes sink in borewell, farmer takes extreme step","Failed investments in agriculture push him into debt trap

Nagulapally Pochamma and her husband Balanarasiah used to have frequent fights on how judiciously to spend their money. While Pochamma felt that having a proper roof over the head was a priority so that they could spend the rest of their life in peace, Balanarasiah used to differ. Being a farmer, he thought it best to invest in their farm and got borewells dug. He hoped for a rich harvest and good returns on the investment. However, the repeated investments in borewells proved to be his nemesis. The borewells failed and he landed in a debt trap, ultimately taking the extreme step.

Balanarasaiah (48) ended his life at his farm on January 29 by consuming pesticide. Since 2013, Balanarasaiah had sold about three acres of land to repay his debts. He had hoped that Mother Earth would not fail him and sooner or later he would be blessed with sufficient water to cultivate his land. But that was not to be.

“My husband sold an acre of land for ₹ 50,000 in 2013 to repay loans and since then has been selling our land in bits and pieces. He used to take loans and dig borewells and then sell land to repay them. After some time an acre of land fetched ₹ 1 lakh and an open well was also dug, which too did not yield considerable water, thereby pushing us back to square one. Meanwhile, a tractor engaged for agricultural work toppled and resulted in the death of the driver. We had to pay that family a huge amount as compensation. This increased our debt burden,” Ms. Pochamma told The Hindu.

“I always argued with my husband over the repeated investments in borewells and insisted that we spend the money to build a house instead. But my suggestions were never taken seriously. The failed borewells in addition to crop loss forced him to take the extreme step,” she said, adding that at present they are left with 1.5 acres of patta land and one acre of poramboku land.

They had cultivated cotton and paddy which pushed them further into the debt trap. “Farmers always trust Nela Talli (Mother Earth) and even in their wildest dream can they ever think of being away from their land. The same farmers are forced to sell their land,” said Puli Raju, a government teacher, who has been documenting suicides by farmers since the year 2000 in the erstwhile Medak dsitrict.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sn81aq/article30813708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14POCHAMMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/fortunes-sink-in-borewell-farmer-takes-extreme-step/article30813709.ece
192,2020/02/13,Chief Minister for revamping the irrigation sector,"Irrigation engineering department to be split into 11 circles

Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao wants to reorganise the Irrigation engineering department by splitting it into 11 circles.

To meet the irrigation requirements of Telangana, all the engineering departments of irrigation sector would be bought under one roof he said and added that each circle would be headed by a chief engineer.

The Chief Minister, who visited the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project and inspected the Medigadda barrage also conducted an aerial survey of the project in Mahadevpur mandal in Jayashankar-Bhupalapally district on Thursday. Later, he held a review meeting on irrigation as well as other issues with officials at the Collectorate in Karimnagar.

Mr Rao assured to fill up all vacant posts in the Irrigation department by June-end and construct quarters for the staff by April-end. He instructed authorities to take steps to lift 530 tmcs of Godavari water and also take up repairs of all irrigation canals during the summer season.

Briefing newsmen about KCR’s three-hour long review meeting, Minister for Health Eatala Rajender, Minister for Social Welfare Koppula Eshwar and Minister for BC Welfare and Civil Supplies Gangula Kamalakar said that the CM has given the sanction to construct 160 check dams at a cost of ₹ 1,000-1200 crore in the integrated Karimnagar district. The CM instructed the authorities to complete the construction of these check dams by June 2020 to ensure water throughout the year in the district.

The ministers said the Chief Minister also instructed the authorities concerned to develop tourist circuits from Kaleshwaram to Sripada Yellampalli project, covering Medigadda, Annaram and Sundilla barrages and Lower Manair Dam, MMD and UMD projects of the Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project.

The Chief Minister has also approved the construction of new vastu-compliant Collectorate by demolishing the existing one to accommodate all departments under one roof, the ministers said.

193,2020/02/13,"Priority to greenery, sanitation: Minister","Calls upon stakeholders to work in mission mode under Palle Pragathi

Improvement of greenery and sanitation in villages should be accorded top priority in implementation of the Palle Pragathi programme to foster inclusive growth and all-round development of villages, said Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar.

He was speaking at the Panchayat Raj Sammelan held here on Thursday.

The meeting was attended by all elected representatives of the rural local bodies, including sarpanches, MPTCs, ZPTCs, and MPPs, apart from mandal and district level officials.

Khammam MP Nama Nageswara Rao and Collector R V Karnan were present.

Addressing the gathering, Mr Ajay Kumar said the district secured fourth place in execution of development works initiated under the first two phases of Palle Pragathi programme in the entire State.

All the stakeholders should work cohesively in mission mode to enable the district to bag first place in the next phase of the Palle Pragathi, he suggested.

To sustain and continue the Palle Pragathi endeavour, the government had been releasing ₹339 crore every month to gram panchayats for taking up need-based development works in all villages, he said.

The State government's landmark welfare and development schemes, including Rythu Bandhu, free 24X7 power supply to farm sector and the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project in Jayashankar Bhupalapally district, had earned national and international acclaim, he asserted.

Once completed, the Sitarama Lift Irrigation Project in the composite Khammam district would give a fillip to agricultural production and promote economic prosperity of farmers, he said.

State level flying squads would tour the district to inspect the progress of works launched under Palle Pragathi.

The villages which excelled in the implementation of Palle Pragathi would be suitably rewarded. Action would be taken against elected representatives and officials if their villages lagged behind in timely completion of development works under Palle Pragathi , he added.

Mr Nama Nageswara Rao said Palle Pragathi was being implemented across the State with missionary zeal by drawing inspiration from Mahatma Gandhiji's Gram Swaraj concept.

“Apart from highlighting the development and welfare schemes being implemented by the State government in Parliament, I have invited MPs from different parts of the country to visit the State to gain insights into the landmark schemes heralding all-round development of Telangana,” Mr Rao said.

Collector R V Karnan said the government appointed an Additional Collector for rural local bodies to monitor the status and progress of sanitation and other works taken up under Palle Pragathi on a daily basis.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tp9mrc/article30812377.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14HYKHMPALLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/priority-to-greenery-sanitation-minister/article30812379.ece
194,2020/02/13,Two killed as bus mows down moped,"Overspeeding suspected to be the reason for the accident

Two persons were killed on the spot when their moped was hit by an RTC bus on NH-65 (Hyderabad-Vijayawada) on Thursday. Another person, travelling on the same moped, is battling for life at a hospital

Both victims, aged around 40, were related and were identified as Bikshapati of Dandu Malkapur and Narasimha of Chennareddygudem. Another person, Anand, who was riding pillion, suffered critical injuries, the police said.

The three were driving to a function hall where they were to attend to a wedding. None of them was wearing helmet at the time, though one was holding it.

The Chityala police said the accident occurred around 11.45 a.m., near Chityala railway station junction on the highway, when the bus knocked down the moped that was making a U-turn. The bus, on its way to Hyderabad, was a Super Luxury carrier belonging to the Kothagudem depot.

“According to preliminary findings, overspeeding caused the accident. The junction is an accident-prone area and is filled with barricades and stoppers, but the bus was beyond the allowed speed limit there,” an official said.

There are four danger zones — Gundrampally outskirts, Veliminedu, Pedda Kaparthy junction and the road opposite the bus stand — in the Chityala police station limits on the highway.

The Chityala police booked a case against the bus driver for negligent driving.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/two-killed-as-bus-mows-down-moped/article30812335.ece

197,2020/02/13,"Looking back, looking ahead","The Ganakala Parishath -- an institution that was born with the intention to give impetus and promote the musicians of Karnataka -- turns 50. Musician R.K. Padmanabh, president of the prestigious institution, speaks of its journey and achievements

The huge arch in N.R. Colony -- by the side of the Rama Mandira -- is where Ganakala Parishath’s golden jubilee celebrations actually take off. Long queues spill on to the road; it is an indication that the main hall is full, and eager audience is trying to find space where large screens are beaming the proceedings. Tens of volunteers are patient at their job of crowd managing. Finding your way through the crowd, and on reaching the auditorium, the president of the Parishath, renowned musician R.K. Padmanabh, sits in a corner of the stage, intently listening to a lecture demonstration. That’s his place each day, intently absorbing every moment that unfolds on the stage. The auditorium is chock-a-block, you overhear – musicians and connoisseurs alike – saying that the16-day mega festival featuring 50 concerts, 15 lectures and more, is on par with what happens at The Music Academy, Chennai. “We have to be a role model to every other Sabha, whether it is execution, or remuneration,” says R.K. Padmanabh, going into the details of putting together this mega festival. An author of several books, including a memoir Nenapinangaladinda, the musician is a shining example of a believer in community living. “This space is for one and all, I just don’t believe in boundaries of any kind – caste, class or religion. There is no hierarchy, the purpose of the Parishath and my life is to propagate and educate. Sangeeta jnana vihinulaku, mokshamu galada…” he declares. Speaking of his book Vipra Vikrama, he says that one cannot claim Brahminhood just by one’s birth, it is what one becomes by his deed. “A Brahmin is he who loves everyone, that’s my belief,” says R.K. Padmanabh, as we settle down for a conversation.

Padmanabha performed as part of the protest demanding improvement of roads in Arakalgud; singing at Rudrapatna on the banks of Cauvery Photos: Bhagya Prakash K. AND THE HINDU ARCHIVES

Here are excerpts.

Ganakala Parishath has turned 50. It is a great milestone for any institution. If you were to recapitulate these five decades, how would you do it?

It is indeed a great milestone. Ganakala Parishath (GKP) started in December 1969. The greater significance is that it was started by a team of musicians. One of the chief purposes to start GKP is to give preference to the artistes of Karnataka. Also, the general perception is that Carnatic music is for elite audience. But the idea was to take it to everybody, the common people.

The bylaw says that 80 per cent of the committee members have to be musicians, which makes it the only institution in this country that is run by musicians. The first music conference was held in 1970, with B.S. Raja Iyengar as the president. It introduced a special format, for the first time, GKP organised special lectures, demonstrations, etc. Until then it was believed that music is meant for a performance, and speaking about it was not regarded highly. But under the leadership of the musicologist, B.V.K. Shastri, the Parishath recognized the importance of such discussions. He brought great artistes S. Balachander, M.S. Subbulaksmi, Lakshmi Shankar, T.N. Krishnan, Prof. B.R. Deodhar, Siddarama Jambaldinni… it was a grand line up.

What was the trigger to found such an organization?

If you remember, in those years the Kannada movement was at its peak. Writer Aa. Na. Krishna Rao who was also at the forefront of the movement, apparently said: “What are you musicians doing? You never come together. If you do, it will be a revolution.” The surprise is that they came together: A. Subba Rao, H.V. Krishna Murthy, Anoor Ramakrishna, Honnappa Bhagavatar, Bangalore Venkataram, A. Veerabhadrayya, B.V.K. Sahstri, H.P. Ramachar, Raja Rao, L.S. Sheshagiri Rao, Tirumale Rangachar and V.N. Rao were the founding fathers.

Aa. Na. Kru was invited for the first conference and how happy he was! Hundreds of musicians from all over Karnataka had come together for a noble cause. “This was my dream, and I am so happy to see it realised,” said the elated writer. The institution was never financially rich, but rich in talent.

What does it mean to you to head an institution that has such a grand history?

My association with the Institution starts long before I came into it formally. It is part of the emotional memory of every musician in the state, a legacy that our senior musicians have left for us. So it is a role that comes with tremendous responsibility. In 2001, I became the Experts Committee chairman, in 2002, I was conferred the Ganakala Bhushana, and in 2004, I was made president.

My vision and intense belief as the president is to take Carnatic music to the nook and corner of Karnataka. I have taken the annual conference to places such as Ramanathapura, Nanjangud, Holenarasipur, Siddapur, Tumkur, Gadag, Bijapur and Belur. The committee also targets audience of all age groups while it formulates its events.

The general attitude is what do villager’s understand? We ignore them and therefore fail to educate them. Why should someone know the intricacies of a form? Isn’t it enough that they have musical ears and a heart that is touched by its resonances? I believe that anything that is pleasing to the ear will be enjoyed. It has been the Parishath’s aim and mine too. I think it has been a successful run so far.

Many of the places that you mention, for instance, Gadag, Sirsi, etc are Hindustani belts. What kind of reception did Carnatic music have?

You will be surprised, I toured the entire state atleast ten times before the annual conferences were organised. I visited schools. I went to the Dharwad University too. We – the students and me -- engaged in a conversation, and I introduce Carnatic music to them. I even sing to them. When we organized the annual conference in these places, the halls were full. I abhor the divisiveness – we must be open to all forms of music. There is a Madras sambar and there is a Mysore sambar, both are sambar, isn’t it? They may have different flavours, so what? Both together form what we call Indian classical music.

Did you receive feedback?

Plenty. Someone from Siddapura wrote to me. The person admitted to switching off the radio when Carnatic music was broadcast, but after the GKP conference he had developed a liking. There are many such examples.

In fact, there has been glorious examples of a give and take relationship between legendary musicians practising Hindustani and Carnatic. In fact, Ustad Abdul Karim Khan had discussions with Mysore Vasudevacharya and is also said to have taken lessons from Veena Dhanammal. He pays his tribute to the Carnatic tradition by recording Saveri and Kharaharapriya for the gramophone.

Absolutely. There are plenty of such examples. G.N. Balasubramaniam and Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Bhatkande used to attend concerts at the Music Academy, Palghat Raghu and Alla Rakha… there are many such. That has not faded away. In fact, now it is better. Hindustani musicians were a bit conservative and kept us at a distance, but now we are interacting and performing with each other. We meet often, and exchange ideas. Carnatic musicians, for the longest time, had not even met Gangubai Hangal, Pt. Jasraj or Pt. Bhimsen Joshi. Things have changed.

Since we are talking of interactions, one hardly sees Carnatic musicians attending each other’s concerts. It is a rare sight.

GKP is an aberration to that phenomenon. I am so happy that so many musicians are coming here. I have gone looking for artistes, and personally invited them. Under natural circumstances, they should come on their own. But somehow that doesn’t happen. It is also true that we are not generous enough to recognise the good work done by many. Honour their work, compliment it… treat them well. Atleast I believe in it. Everyday, 2000 people turn up here, musicians and non-musicians. Why? Because they feel welcome.

When you take your festival to remote areas, what is the audience composition?

All kinds of people. Let me tell you this, those who are serious about music never talk about caste. What is important to us is their art, I see goddess Saraswati in them, and I even fall at their feet, irrespective of who they are and where they come from. People of all castes and all religions come, and that is how it ought to be in the natural course of things.

You were a late entrant to music.

Oh yes, 1974. But I worked extremely heard. I could afford none of the modern facilities, not even fees. My journey, which was full of miseries, was an introspective one. In the absence of guidance, I devised my own methods to strengthen my voice, culture it… and I succeeded in it.

Once I became an accomplished artiste, I did not want to deny anyone the opportunity of listening or learning. I have trained thousands of students, and I have not taken money from anyone. Since I am self-fashioned, I fear none. I am not worried if they will call me for a concert or not. I will not mince words. Just the other day, I said that the Kannada and Culture minister has no culture at all. People can take it to him. The least is to know how to treat an artiste. I will never be wishy washy. I am under the huge umbrella of legends, as Tyagarja says in “Endaro Mahanubhavulu”. When you are part of such a great tradition, why fear anyone?

Your book Nenapina Angaladinda is a stunning document of community living. There is this musician called R.V. Srikantaiah in your book, who walks and talks music till he dies.

His father Venkatarayaru was R.R. Keshavamurthy’s guru. Srikantaiah was faculty in a Chennai university. He was such a bright mind, but lost his senses in the late years of his life. He came back to the village. Young and foolish that we were, we threw stones at him. He would keep singing. The day he died, they had made him lie down on the stone pulpit outside their house. He was gasping for breath, but still singing, Rama Bhakti Samrajyam.That day it was amusement for me, but now it makes me cry. What great people! Even Chowdaiah. He was God to me, I used to wait endlessly to get a glimpse of him. Devendrappa was another phenomenally generous musician – he fed so many young boys and taught them music. They are inspirations, people who shaped my life.

Today there is an abundance of talent. But we are not producing legends.

No field is producing legends. That was a glorious period, it is over. We should not even compare it with anything. Music has grown immensely, new directions, new experimentations…that is the nature of the present.

But one thing I would like to say: do what you want, but leave tradition alone. Don’t tamper with it. Why should we fuse Quran with Bhagavadgita? Or Gurugranth Sahib with Ramayana? They are all great texts by themselves, they don’t need support, they can stand on their own. So, let’s not try to save tradition, it is best left alone.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/5qvs8q/article30811004.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGFRKP,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/looking-back-looking-ahead/article30811009.ece
198,2020/02/13,Artist Lenin Dani Raj on winning the Artists for Wildlife and Nature Award,"Beauty lies in minute details: Lenin Dani Raj loves nothing more than reproducing nature on his canvas and he recently won the Artists for Wildlife and Nature Award for his work

Two years ago, artist Lenin Dani Raj from Mettupalayam was on a nature walk through Kallar in Kerala when he heard a rustle. He watched as a black and white bird emerged from the canopy of trees. “It was huge and flew swiftly by. I heard its wings flap even from a distance,” he recollects. This was Lenin's first sighting of the Great Indian Hornbill and this bird is now the favourite subject for his art. Lenin is a final year MSW student at PSG College of Arts and Science and has recently won the Artists for Wildlife and Nature Award in open category at an event held at Bengaluru. “My work features the mating of the Common Rose Butterfly on the tip of a Heliconia flower. This red and black butterfly can be easily spotted around Coimbatore. I chose Heliconia flower with similar shades to compliment it. My drawing was selected from more than 250 entries from around the country,” he says.

Lenin started off drawing cartoon characters. “It was after I volunteered with a local environmental NGO called Wildlife Wranglers that I developed an interest in Nature. One day I saw a photograph of a Scarlet Macaw on the internet. I loved its vibrant colours and tried to reproduce it. That was my first wildlife art.” Lenin showed the work to Jeshwin Kingsley, a conservationist and it was a turning point. “He encouraged me and gave me photographs of birds that he shot for me to practise my art,” he says.

Getting the details right is the most important in wildlife art. “I read about the subject and discuss its characteristics with experts. I use more than one photograph as reference as the editing and lighting used in photography can alter the real colours of birds. I also go on nature walks to gain a first hand knowledge on different plants and animals,” he says. In 2019 Lenin reproduced photographs of Ward's Trogon and Fire-tailed Sunbird shot by renowned wildlife photographer Jainy Maria Kuriakose. “She saw these works online and bought them immediately. They now decorate her living room.” Lenin included butterflies in his works recently. “I couldn't find many wildlife artists who drew butterflies and so I took it up last year.”

More on the award The award was organised by Artists for Wildlife and Nature, a Bengaluru based trust that aims to promote Nature and wildlife

This was their third edition of the competition

The Artists for Wildlife Show was judged by Jan Martin MCguire, conservationist and wildlife artist from USA

Lenin received the award from Padma Shri K Ullas Karanth who is the founder of Centre for Wildlife Studies

Lenin submitted 10 of his works in colour pencil for the award. “Seven of those were selected and displayed at an exhibition at Venkatappa Art Gallery in Bengaluru as a part of the competition. There, I met my favourite artist Paresh Churi and he shared a few of his techniques. I also got a chance to interact with visitors and get their feedback.”

Other than wildlife, he also does human portraits. “Most of them are commissioned works in colour pencil. It is my favourite medium as it helps me get even the minute details right,” he says. Lenin says that wildlife drawing has brought him closer to Nature. “Now I am keen to know about different species and more than ever I wish to work in Nature conservation.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/wg8ca/article30810386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/award-winning-drawing,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/lenin-dani-raj-from-mettupalayam-won-the-artists-for-wildlife-and-nature-award-in-open-category/article30810393.ece

200,2020/02/13,Artist Sisir Sahana recreates elements of Nature in his latest series in glass,"Titled A Dialogue with Soil, his latest series of 10 works, will be on display at Forum Art Gallery till March 7

Each of Sisir Sahana’s pieces in glass, is a world in itself. A world that strangely appears in motion; replete with drastically different elements inside.

Take for instance, the one sporting a red overtone from his latest series. Lit from behind, the glass installation is made of smaller elements (also in glass), that resemble roots under soil. A nondescript blob, in deep red, remains suspended in liquid glass, lending it an abstract quality. Titled A Dialogue with Soil, this display of 10 works in the challenging medium, is an attempt by the artist to dig deeper into Nature to reclaim latent components.

Looking back

A professor in Ceramics and Glass, Department of Design in Kala-Bhavana, Visva-Bharati University, Santiniketan, Sisir’s preoccupation with glass dates back to right when he started out in 1998. His interest in glass painting brought him closer to the medium. Twenty-two years later, not much has changed. The techniques may have, but only as a way to better the possibilities of the brittle medium.

However, this particular series, which has been in the works since 2019, was born out of a residency programme that Sisir attended at the Pittsburgh Glass Center. “Most of the works are inspired by certain images and situations that I have witnessed at some points in my life. Combined with the exceptional facilities that Pittsburgh has, I was able to experiment with regard to technique as well,” Sisir says of the series. The quality of glass that is available in the US is also visibly better — clear and easy to fuse different techniques into.

Sisir’s earlier work explored human and animal bodies and their activities, but this series is a visible deviation. “Here, I thought I should experiment with human existence rather than the physical body; and what better way to explore human existence than to look at Nature,” says the artist, adding that motifs of flowers, roots and other physical manifestations of life, are depicted in an effort to shed light on their coexistence with human beings. And these images, when portrayed as part of soil, metaphorically suggest that they are frozen in time, yet, a hint of life is unmissable. This constant possibility of life and motion, is what even the tiny bubbles inside clear glass, intend to say.

In one of the sculptures, the upper half lends an ice-like appearance, while the lower half is as clear as water, replete with bubbles and smaller pieces within. In another work inspired by the artist’s scuba diving experience in Andaman and Nicobar Islands, one can also spot amorphous jellyfish-like entities inside. Heating and cooling the glass to perfect temperatures makes this possible. He explains that techniques such as “Fusing, blowing, casting and slumping”, when merged together, contribute to the gradation in opacity within the works.

A Dialogue with Soil will be on display at Forum Art Gallery, Adyar, till March 7 from 10.30 am to 6.30 pm.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/xzkznr/article30808608.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12MPSisirSahana-OldSeeds-Ten-18x5x13inches-Glass-2019-P-HRjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/artist-sisir-sahana-recreates-elements-of-nature-in-his-latest-series-in-glass/article30808610.ece
201,2020/02/13,SAHMAT: Upholding the Constitution through art,"Over 50 artists have expressed their views on the Constitution whose 70th anniversary is being celebrated across the country

As the nation celebrates the 70th anniversary of the adoption of the Indian Constitution, over 50 artists from across the country have come together at Jawahar Bhawan, to articulate their views through photographs and artworks. This has been made possible by the coming together of the organisation SAHMAT with Aban Raza, an artist and filmmaker, who has curated ‘Celebrate. Illuminate. Rejuvenate. Defend. The Constitution of India at 70’.

On display is a copy of the original document that became effective in 1950. The installations, works in mixed media and photos highlight social issues that have come out onto the streets.

Protest at Jamia

When we meet, the nearly six foot tall artist is in a session with 15 undergraduate students of history, political science, and sociology, explaining the work of each artist. Most of the artists on display are young — in their 20s, though there are a few seniors as well. So while Sanna Mattoo from Srinagar is 26 years old, Pablo Bartholomew from Delhi is 64.

Raza, who is also a teacher of printmaking at Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI), was on campus on December 16, a day after the assault on students. “It was very scary and all my students were fearful. Yesterday five students were roughed up when they tried to cross the barricade after undertaking a protest march from Jamia to Parliament Street.” Her reaction came after I pointed out an impactful digital print of JMI students by Ram Rahman. There are other pictures of the protest by students of the minority community against the fear that they would be robbed of their citizenship.

Also present at the exhibition is historian Sohail Hashmi, elder brother of Safdar, overseeing the work spread across the the gigantic space. “SAHMAT was formed as a reaction to Safdar’s murder. It is a fight for preservation and creation of creative voices,” he says, talking of how the people of Kashmir have suffered over the past few months.

At the exhibition, there are a series of photos by Sanna Mattoo that is titled ‘I will never forget the day my breath started fading away’. There are moving images of a Kashmiri Muslim woman — looking at her fiance, a civilian killed in an encounter. There is also a scene of women mourning death of Aamir, a 13 year old boy. Another disturbing picture of a youngster whose back has torture marks is also on display. These photos on human rights abuse, allegedly perpetrated by security forces in the Valley, highlight the anguish and pain of ordinary Kashmiris. The curator wanted more representation from Kashmir to inform visitors of the situation prevailing in the Valley.

Another highlight is a collage of the Preamble and pictures in which artist Vivan Sundaram has added more text for the layman. In ‘Understanding the Preamble’, the text is bordered by photos of protest by women and a banner with “Save the Constitution” written on it.

Pablo Bartholomew’s Gandhi Statue, Machlipatnam district, Andhra Pradesh, was taken in 1977. Khursheed Ahmad, a Kashmiri artist freelancing in Delhi, has painted a calligraphic work that shows the historic accord of the Delhi Agreement of 1952 signed by Pt. Nehru and Sheikh Abdullah.

Ram Rahman, a co-founder at SAHMAT says the context of the exhibition is poignant, because of the current agitations focusing on citizenship and rights. “It has led to an amazing burst of creativity, both visual and in text, with poetry songs and slogans, very often created by very ordinary people. There is also much wit and humour in much of the agitation that one is seeing and I think there is a very positive way of citizens engaging with serious issues.”

Excerpts from a conversation with Raza.

What was the idea of the exhibition?

The main idea is to take a stand and to say: ‘Ok this is what is happening in the country and this is not going in the right direction’. So we have to pause and think about what we have achieved so far since the Constitution was set up 70 years ago, and about how we take this forward. The only way is to involve more young people. So we decided to rope in young artists who will take the dialogue forward.

Can art go hand in hand with politics?

The Constitution itself was hand painted by Nandlal Bose and his team. Art now is being used as protest: roads have been painted, murals installed in the city. Art is reminding us that we need to take a stand. Art and politics have to go hand in hand when there is a threat to change the nature of the Constitution. Artists have to be responsible and relevant to society. If you stay apolitical, then it means you are silent, which is not acceptable in today’s context and times. You have to be a responsible citizen and save the Constitution.

Do you feel that art is a medium to highlight the concerns of the minorities in Delhi — like the dadis in Shaheen Bagh and students protesting at JMI?

Absolutely. We have included Shaheen Bagh’s banner that has a poem by German poet and playwright Bertolt Brecht translated into Hindi. It is “Kya zulmato to ke dor mein bhi geet gayte jaye ge/ Ha zulmato ke geet jayege” (meaning, “In the dark times will there be singing? Yes, there will be singing about dark times.”) The intention was to increase representation; minority’s representation. The voices in Kashmir, of young women and Dalits can be heard loud and clear here. There is one artist from Manipur; two from Assam couldn’t come because of road blockages.

Could you talk a little about the artist Sanna Mattoo’s depiction of life in Kashmir?

Sanna Mattoo is a photographer who is risking her life. She could just disappear one day. Not just her, but any Kashmiri. Where is the accountability? It is absolutely ridiculous that all democratically elected representatives like Omar Abdullah have been in the custody for months.

202,2020/02/13,Envoys meet Jammu groups,"Politicians and members of civil society apprise delegation of situation

Twenty-five Ambassadors, on the second day of their visit to J&K, met several senior officials, Army officers and groups supporting the revocation of Article 370 and the introduction of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Jammu.

As many as 33 delegates, including politicians and members of the civil society groups, called on the visiting envoys and apprised them of the situation following the revocation of J&K’s special status and the introduction of the CAA.

“After the abrogation of Article 370, the neglected community of West Pakistani Refugees got citizenship rights and voting rights after 70 years,” Laba Ram Gandhi, head of West Pakistani Refugees, told the envoys.

‘Politics over CAA’

On pointed questions on the CAA by the envoys, Mr. Gandhi said, he informed them there was no protest against the Act in J&K. “Those protesting are doing politics over the Act,” Mr. Gandhi said.

Refugee group

Several representatives from the Balmiki community, the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoJK) displaced persons and the Kashmiri Pandit migrants shared their opinions and expressed satisfaction over ending J&K’s special status by diluting Article 370 on August 5.

Earlier in the day, the Army apprised the envoys at a meeting in Srinagar of Pakistan’s attempts to foment trouble and push in militants, officials said.

The envoys, including 10 Ambassadors from European Union countries, met Chief Justice Gita Mital at the Jammu and Kashmir High Court and discussed the prevailing situation. They were also briefed by Lt. Governor Girish Chander Murmu, Chief Secretary B.V.R. Subrahmanyam and J&K police chief Dilbagh Singh.

‘Important information’

“We got a lot of important information,” an envoy said in Jammu, as the delegation left for Delhi. “The two-day visit of foreign envoys to J&K concluded. We have had interactions with some groups of civil society, traders, political representatives, media outlets, military units and some local government officials about the current situation and their prospects for the future. Jammu visit will hopefully further widen our perspectives of the region.

203,2020/02/13,Priyanka slams Uttar Pradesh government over law and order,"Her criticism comes after a crude bomb went off at a Lucknow court injuring three lawyers

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday slammed the Yogi Adityanath government over law and order after a crude bomb went off at a Lucknow court injuring three lawyers.

“The U.P. government should now clearly state that it lied to the public for three years. Actually the State is dominated by criminals. In the capital, lawyers are being attacked with bombs in the court. From the capital to remote regions, nobody is safe,” Ms. Vadra tweeted in Hindi.

The police suspected ‘rivalry’ between two groups as the reason behind the explosions but the Congress general secretary targeted the BJP government for it.

In a separate tweet, Ms. Vadra hit out at the BJP government over women’s safety and alleged that Uttar Pradesh is witnessing ‘jungle raaj’.

“There are shocking incidents against women every day in U.P. A victim’s father was murdered in Firozabad. A young girl was raped and murdered in Sitapur. Where is the government?

The entire State machinery of the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh “led from the top, acted with grave prejudice and perpetrated violence targeting one particular community, the State’s Muslim population” during the clampdown on those demonstrating against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, a group of activists alleged on Thursday.

Under the banner of Karwan-e-Mohabbat and U.P. Coordination Committee Against NRC, CAA, NPR and Detention Centres, the group, led by activist Harsh Mander, released a report here titled “A State at war with its people”, highlighting the alleged police brutality against protesters.

The U.P. police “have been found to sometimes behave like a lynch mob, and also to chase and shoot both protesters and innocent bystanders with an intent to kill,” the report noted.

The report accuses Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of indulging in “culpable hate speech” and “inciting revenge against the Muslim citizens”.

205,2020/02/13,ECI announces J&K panchayat bypolls from March 5,"Many areas are freezing in inclement weather

Despite likely wet weather, cold temperatures and snow covering many parts of Jammu & Kashmir, the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Thursday announced by-elections for 11,639 vacant panchayat seats, to be held in eight phases from March 5 to 20.

It will be the first democratic exercise to be held in the newly-carved Union Territory of J&K, after its special status was revoked on August 5, 2019.

“By-elections in snowbound areas of Marwah and Wadwan of Kishtwar district and Gurez of Bandipora will be conducted later on,” said Chief Election Officer Shailendra Kumar, in Jammu.

However, no dates have been announced for the Union Territory of Ladakh.

Ballot papers

Unlike the previous panchayat polls, which were held in October-November in 2018, these by-elections will be contested on party basis, and ballot papers will be used instead of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). For Kashmiri migrants, postal ballot will be available, officials said.

“Keeping in view snowfall and the winter season in Kashmir, we have decided to hold elections as the weather conditions are improving in the Valley too,” said Mr. Shailendra.

The polls will be held in 128 blocks in the Kashmir Valley, involving 887 panchayat halqas (an area comprising a village or some contiguous villages), where a total number of 11,457 panch constituencies are vacant. In the Jammu division, by-elections will be held in 182 vacant panch seats in 146 blocks, involving 124 panchayats halqas.

Many vacancies

“Almost all blocks have vacancies, and the most vacancies are in the Kashmir division. Every block has one vacancy after the Block Development Council (BDC) polls,” he added.

At least 307 seats of panchs and sarpanchs fell vacant after the BDC elections were conducted last year.

The 2018 panchayat elections saw voting for 22,214 panchs and 3,459 sarpanches.

The elections are being held even as the top leadership of the main regional parties, the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) remain behind bars, including Dr. Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti. Both the NC and PDP stayed away from the polls in 2018 on the issue of Article 370, impacting the turnout of voters. It remains to be seen if these parties will participate in the upcoming polls or not.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mgu6nw/article30812209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI9292019000163B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/eci-announces-jk-panchayat-bypolls-from-march-5/article30812211.ece

207,2020/02/13,"Amarinder govt. failed in fulfilling promises made to farmers, youth and poor: Akali Dal","Electricity has become expensive due to the Congress mismanagement and scams, it says

Former Punjab Chief Minister and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Parkash Singh Badal on Thursday accused the Congress government of not fulfilling the promises made to farmers, youth or the poor during the 2017 Assembly election campaign.

“Chief Minister Amarinder Singh should either fulfil the promises or quit,” said Mr. Badal, addressing a party protest rally at Raja Sansi in Amritsar.

Mr. Badal also expressed concern over the social and political climate in the country. He said those in power at the Centre and the States should ensure that the country was run strictly in accordance with secular democratic ethos as enshrined in the Constitution. “Any deviation from the sacred principles of secularism can only weaken our country. Those in power at the State as well as others must work unitedly and tirelessly to safeguard, preserve and protect India as a secular democracy. This is the legacy we inherited from the great Guru Sahiban, saints and seers. And this is the legacy we must leave for the coming generations.”

Mr. Badal said the governments and political parties must work to bring the Hindus and the Muslims as well as the others in an embrace of love and understanding. “Hatred and bitterness should have no place in our public life. The atmosphere in the country should be such that minorities feel secure and respected as equal partners in the task of nation building,” he said.

SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said, “Forget about fulfilling any promise made to farmers, youth or the poor, the Congress government has failed to even protect the prime witness in the ‘Behbal Kalan’ police firing case”.

At least three lawyers were injured when a crude bomb exploded outside one of their chambers in a Lucknow court compound on Thursday.

He said about 10 people hurled crude bombs outside his chamber in which he and two other lawyers were injured. “One bomb exploded but two still lay unexploded,” he said, questioning the security on the premises. Bomb disposal and dog squads have reached the site of the blast.

Last month, lawyers struck work in protest against the recent attacks on them in the State.

The Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh had asked bar associations to abstain from work to put pressure on the government to pass legislation to protect lawyers.

211,2020/02/13,IIT Kharagpur club cancels permission for discussion on citizenship,"Permission was given initially but withdrawn later

A group of research scholars of IIT Kharagpur on Thursday claimed that a discussion on the issue of citizenship on the campus had to be called off, after permission for holding the programme was withdrawn.

A spokesperson of research body ‘Education Group’ said, initially they were given the permission to organise the programme at the IIT employees-run staff club within the campus on February 12.

However, they were informed by the club on Tuesday that it had been withdrawn for “some reasons”.

“We were informally told that discussions on such a contentious issue cannot be held within the campus area as per the instructions from higher authorities of IIT Kharagpur,” she said.

IIT Kharagpur officials did not wish to talk about it but a faculty, not willing to be named, said, it had nothing to do with the “pro-Centre” or “anti-Centre” policy of the premier educational institute.

“Our policy is not to allow any programme which may trigger tension, division and untoward incident within the campus.

“The researchers are free to organise the programme outside the campus,” he said.

The spokesperson of the research body said, it would have been a general academic discourse on the issue of identity and citizenship without directly referring to the controversy involving the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.

“We had invited three speakers and none of them were politicians,” she said.

At least 12 people were killed and around 8 seriously injured as the private bus in which they were travelling collided with a truck here on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway, police said on Thursday.

District Magistrate Chandra Vijay Singh told PTI: “Twelve people lost their lives in the accident, while eight sustained serious injuries.”

Officials said that the death toll may rise further.

Superintendent of Police (rural) Rajesh Kumar told PTI that the accident took place at around 10 pm on Wednesday in Nagla Khangar Police Station area of Firozabad.

“The sleeper bus was going from Delhi to Motihari (Bihar). The double-decker bus hit the container truck from behind,” he said.

The injured have been sent to Saifai in Etawah for treatment, he said.

213,2020/02/13,Aishe Ghosh to campaign against CAA in Bengal,"She will participate in roadshows and campaign for SFI in Jadavpur University students’ union polls

In an attempt to infuse fresh energy to its campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has roped in Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union president and Students’ Federation of India leader Aishe Ghosh.

For the next few days, Ms. Ghosh is likely to address a number of seminars, participate in roadshows and even campaign for the SFI for the Jadavpur University students’ union elections.

‘An inspiration’

“Aishe is Bengali and can connect with the people of the State. Her struggle is an inspiration not only for the students but also for all the people,” State SFI secretary Srijan Bhattacharya told The Hindu.

Ms. Ghosh hails from Durgapur, an industrial township in south Bengal, and this is her first visit to her home town since she was attacked by masked goons inside JNU campus on January 5.

However, her first public rally in the State did not get police permission.

On a day when Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee addressed a rally against the CAA-NRC in Durgapur, the rally led by Ms. Ghosh was denied permission in town by local police authorities. While the CPI(M) and other Left parties held rallies and processions against the CAA, they could not hog the limelight like the protests organised by the Chief Minister. A section of Left leadership feels that Ms. Ghosh’s presence can add some spark to their campaign.

Ms. Ghosh will address two conventions on autonomy of educational institutions inside the campus of Calcutta University and Presidency University. She will also lead a rally under the banner of Students Against Fascism in north Kolkata from Calcutta University to Shyambazar on Thursday and campaign for the SFI at Jadavpur University on Friday.

CPI(M)’s leadership crisis

She is also likely to meet the protesters at Park Circus who have been camping at the site drawing inspiration from the Shaheen Bagh in Delhi.

The CPI(M) has been trying to bring in young faces as leaders and also given tickets to youth leaders from the SFI. However, the party is still grappling with a leadership crisis. Senior CPI(M) leader and Labour Minister in the Left Front government, Anadi Sahu, admitted that the protests by students against CAA “is creating a sensation in the country”.

“We will be joining the rally led by Aishe Ghosh. We want new leadership to emerge. These are the students who are not only leading from the front but they are also withstanding attacks,” he said.

Mr. Sahu, who is also the general secretary of the trade union arm of the party, said that the CPI(M)’s national campaign against the CAA will culminate on March 23, the day of martyrdom of Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/238gqs/article30804387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE13AISHEGHOSH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aishe-ghosh-to-campaign-against-caa-in-bengal/article30804388.ece
214,2020/02/13,Indradhanush mahotsav offered a rich variety,"From film songs and classical music to thematic choreography and stand-up comedy, Indradhanush festival was a total entertainer

Indradhanush Mahotsav 2020, hosted by The Fine Arts Society, FAS, Chembur, took off in a grand manner with singer Abhijeet presenting popular numbers in a melodic sequence with the audience joining in.

Abhijeet

The songs of Kishore Kumar had a special effect on the audience who enjoyed the three hour show. K. Ganesh Kumar, chairman, Board of Trustees, welcomed the guests and explained the role of FAS in spreading Indian art and culture.

Pt. Hariprasad Chaurasia’s elaborate Megh Malhar followed by Pahadi was mellifluous.

He proved that age only aids freshness and solidity in craft. The veteran and his sishyas gave a masterful demonstration of melody through bansuri. Yogesh Shamsi provided suitable support on the tabla.

Stories from mythology

‘Divya Vivaham,’ conceptualised and curated by Usha RK, showcased the sequence of marriage rituals of six divine couples from the Hindu ethos. Rati and Manmatha by Arundhati Patwardhan and Parimal Phadke made for a spirited start. Jatis, musical notes, tanam and a lilting tillana in Maand and the typical antarpaat as a prop depicted the impact of desire between them.

Divya Vivaham by Usha RK

Sita and Rama were enacted by Prachi Saathi and Anand Satchidanandan. Cadenced paces and postures of Rama, the grace and emotions of Sita, interlocking of eyes as visualised by Kambar, the Pravaram announcing their lineage and Panigrahanam (wedding) were threaded well together.

Siva and Parvati, impersonated by Parshwanath Upadhye and Shruti Gopal was graphic with meticulous attention to detail. Post the penance of Parvati, Siva - the bridegroom — decked in tiger skin, snake armlets and ash performs the mangalyadharanam.

Rukmini and Krishna, presented by Rasika Kiran and Pavitra Bhat was about the ritual of Jaimala, groom and bride garlanding each other. The use of dupatta, metrically tied, folded, untied and unfolded aided the metaphor. Shreyasi Gopinath and Aditya PV as Draupadi and Arjuna showcased the Swayamvara of Draupadi leading to the ritual of Saptapadi. Fast footwork, seven swaras, which added melody to the seven steps, the mantra conveying the meaning of the vow made for interesting viewing.

Valli and Karthikeya by Aditi Sadashivam and Mithun Shyam concluded the marriage rituals on a happy note. Bubbly Valli and buoyant Murugan endeared themselves to the viewers with effortless exposition. Murugan as the hunter, the persistent suitor, the old man were well-presented by Mithun. The Nalangu banter was portrayed by the duo with ease.

Nattuvangam by Ramya Janakiraman, vocal by Karthik Hebbar, mridangam by Satish Krishnamurthy and flute by Raghunandan provided the melodic and rhythmic content. “It was a fabulous experience. What more can a person who conceptualised the thematic production and dancers ask for but a full house audience and appreciation,” emoted Usha RK.

Seamless rendition

Jugalbandi by U. Rajesh and Purbayan Chatterjee began with an elaborate Shanmukhapriya. Both the artistes embellished the ragam, tanam and the song ‘Vilayaada idu nerama’ in a brilliant manner. The chemistry between the two artistes was seamless and tangible with each supporting the other and coming out with different songs in the medley.

Jugalbandi recital by U. Rajesh (Mandolin) and Purbayan Chatterjee (sitar)

“The programmes were chosen to be inclusive, keeping in mind the cosmopolitan composition of our members,” said Ramesh Ramamoorthy, President of FAS Managing Committee.

‘I love Mumbai,’ by Cyrus Broacha and Kunal Vijayakar was a string of episodes centred around the maximum city, the city of dreams, the city that never sleeps, the city that just sucks you in making it impossible for you to move out. Mumbai waking up on a typical morning, the street food, the BEST buses, the packed train, etc. were projected on the backdrop.

Cyrus Broacha

Cyrus made his entry from the aisle, shaking hands with the audience. His spontaneous snippets on the budget, political scene, mobile culture and taxi driver were enjoyable. The house broker, South Mumbai glitterati corrupting the Hindi language bordering on vulgarity and club culture were some episodes enacted.

The Parsi gentleman singing with four members of the audience, a girl selecting her match from the audience, singing and dancing, prizes given to the audience, went down well with the audience. Cyrus’s confidence and conviction, thoroughly entertained the younger audience.

Enjoyable medley

Sudhesh Bhosle did what he is best at. A near four-hour show was packed with popular numbers. Various songs of Kishore Kumar, Manna Dey, Hemant Kumar and S.D. Burman were a huge hit with the listeners. The public demand for more songs clearly showed that neither the singer nor the fans wanted to go home.

215,2020/02/13,Controversial remarks on air lead to apology,"Commentators Amarnath and Doshi deemed insensitive in social media

Commentators working on the Ranji Trophy match between Karnataka and Baroda were forced to apologise here on Thursday after making seemingly insensitive remarks on air.

Broadcasters Rajinder Amarnath and Sushil Doshi, calling the game for Hotstar, made the controversial comments during the second day’s play at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.

Sunil Gavaskar’s work as a Hindi commentator was being discussed when Amarnath, a former Haryana allrounder and a younger brother to former India star Mohinder, had this to say: “In India, every Indian should know Hindi. It’s our mother tongue; for us, there is no greater language than this.”

Doshi, a veteran commentator, agreed with him. “I’m angry with those people who say, ‘We are cricketers but we still speak Hindi’. You live in India, you will obviously speak the language of India. What is there to be proud of?” he asked.

Angry reactions

These words did not go down very well. There was a flurry of angry comments on social media, with some pointing out the irony of making such remarks when teams from the States of Karnataka and Gujarat were on the field.

Amarnath, to his credit, later apologised on air. “The intention was never to enforce a language. All the languages of the country are a part of the country. Everybody loves to speak his language. My intention was not to hurt anyone,” he said.

Speaking to reporters after the day’s play, Amarnath and Doshi explained their view.

“I meant to say that every Indian ‘could’ know Hindi rather than ‘should’. When I came to know somebody had objected, I said I deeply regretted it,” said Amarnath.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sacllm/article30813387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14DOSHI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/controversial-remarks-on-air-lead-to-apology/article30813390.ece
216,2020/02/13,‘Dhoni is India’s best captain’,"Now we have that same aura in our dressing room: Raina

Veteran India batsman Suresh Raina feels M.S. Dhoni is the best captain India ever had. Raina and Dhoni play for the same IPL franchise — Chennai Super Kings — which is also led by the latter.

“I think we have the best captain who has changed the Indian team like anything. Now we have that same aura in our dressing room,” Raina said on ‘The Super Kings show’ on Star Sports Tamil.

The 38-year-old Dhoni has retired from Test cricket but his future in the limited-over formats is a subject of intense speculation.

The two-time World Cup-winning former captain took a break from cricket after India’s exit from the 2019 World Cup in England. He is set to be back in action at the IPL, where he will captain the CSK, starting March 23.

With three restricted stands at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai finally being reopened, Raina urged the fans to fill the venue in every CSK home game. “We have all the seats available. Hopefully, we’ll have more fans now so that there is more energy on the field,” the 33-year-old Raina said.

Raina, who last played for India in 2018, also expressed his excitement about the prospect of playing with CSK’s latest acquisitions.

“This year we have a lot of new talent in our team. Piyush (Chawla) is there, then we have Hazelwood, Sam Curran, Sai Kishore from Tamil Nadu, he has been bowling really well for them. So, I think we have a lot of mixture of youngsters and seniors.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/vvmmtx/article30813241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14RAINA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dhoni-is-indias-best-captain/article30813242.ece
217,2020/02/13,Jagadeesan goes on the rampage,"His scintillating 183 takes Tamil Nadu to 424; Unadkat scalps six

N. Jagadeesan went from strength to strength as Tamil Nadu amassed 424 in its first innings on the second day of its Ranji Trophy Group B clash against Saurashtra at the SCA stadium on Thursday. In reply, the hosts were 107 for three at close.

The Tamil Nadu wicketkeeper-batsman, who had revived the visitors’ innings along with Sai Kishore on day one, continued the good work in the company of M. Mohammed. Jagadeesan, 61 overnight, kept the scoreboard moving with a combination of well-run singles and twos, and boundaries. When he completed his century off 200 balls, the Coimbatore player must have felt elated and relieved as he has had a quiet season so far.

Perfect combo

With partner Mohammed displaying solid defence and a stout heart, Jagadeesan stitched together a crucial 115-run stand for the eighth wicket. The former scored 42 off 121 deliveries with seven fours.

Just when things seem to be slipping away from Saurashtra, captain and left-arm pacer Jaydev Unadkat applied the brakes with a brilliant over. He ended Mohammed’s resistance and also sent back M. Siddharth off the next delivery.

Even as the Saurashtra players were celebrating Unadkat’s five-wicket haul, Jagadeesan began to chalk out his next move. Realising that he was running out of partners — in fact, he had only one left (K. Vignesh) — Jagadeesan decided to shift gears and employ the long handle.

Changing gears

What followed was a scintillating exhibition of strokeplay as Jagadeesan put the Saurashtra attack to the sword, hitting fours and sixes at will. Even Unadkat and left-arm spinner Dharmendrasinh Jadeja were not spared as they faced the fury of his blade. Jagadeesan galloped from 100 to 183 off just 56 balls, adding 66 for the final wicket with Vignesh whose contribution was five!

Vignesh had the best seat in the house — non-striker’s end — to watch Jagadeesan decimate the Saurashtra attack. Just as he looked on course for a double hundred, Unadkat had him caught off his own bowling to finish with a six-wicket haul. As he trooped off, Jagadeesan received a big round of applause not only from his teammates, but also the Saurashtra players.

With a big score on the board, there was a spring in the Tamil Nadu bowlers’ step. They removed the openers, Harvik Desai and Kishan Parmar, with just 45 on the board. While pacer Vignesh accounted for the former, left-arm spinner Sai Kishore dismissed the latter.

The other left-armer, Siddharth, sent back Vishvaraj Jadeja with debutant Jaganath Sinivas pulling off a good catch. It was left to Avi Barot (38) and Arpit Vasavada (11) to ensure that there was no further damage.

218,2020/02/13,"Openers’, lone spinner’s spots in focus","Taking on New Zealand XI in a warm-up match, India will look to get line-up right for first Test

Clarity on opening combination, a call on whether R. Ashwin’s variations can trump Ravindra Jadeja’s allround skill-sets will be the focus for India in its three-day warm-up game against New Zealand XI starting here on Friday.

After the harsh reality check of 0-3 drubbing in the just-concluded ODI series, a red-ball warm-up game will be the most welcome distraction for Virat Kohli and his men as a precursor to the two-match Test series starting next week.

Ideal practice game

India could not have asked for a better practice game as the opposition team is full of New Zealand senior and A-team players, including leg-spinner Ish Sodhi, allrounder Jimmy Neesham and wicketkeeper Tim Seifert, in its ranks.

The inclusion of white ball pacers Scott Kuggeliejn and Blair Tickner will be the kind of test which both Prithvi Shaw and Shubman Gill will relish as they make a case for their inclusion in the playing XI for the first Test starting in Wellington on February 21.

Shubman will be itching to show his skipper that he is ready for the big debut which is eagerly anticipated among his growing legion of fans, despite his international career being two-match old.

Test for spinners

A flat track like the one at Seddon Park will also be a test for the two frontline spinners with Ashwin and Jadeja getting a chance to test the likes of Daryl Mitchell, Tom Bruce and Seifert in action.

For the New Zealand XI, there is Dane Cleaver, who has had scores of 196 and 53 in the two A ‘Tests’ against India. He would like to impress the selectors and get into the first team for the Test series. India is looking to get its combination right for the Test series which is a part of the World Test Championship.

The teams (from):

India: Virat Kohli (Capt), Mayank Agarwal, Prithvi Shaw, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane (Vice-capt.), Wriddhiman Saha (wk), Hanuma Vihari, Ravindra Jadeja, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav, Ravichandran Ashwin, Rishabh Pant, Navdeep Saini and Shubman Gill.

New Zealand XI: Daryl Mitchell (Capt), Finn Allen, Tom Bruce, Dane Cleaver, Henry Cooper, Scott Kuggeleijn, James Neesham, Rachin Ravindra, Tim Seifert, Ish Sodhi, Blair Tickner, Will Young. Jake Gibson and Scott Johnston.

219,2020/02/13,Ngidi scripts remarkable South Africa win,"Helps beat England by one run

Fast bowler Lungi Ngidi took three wickets in his last two overs as South Africa snatched a thrilling one-run win in the first T20I against England.

Jason Roy and captain Eoin Morgan hit half-centuries for England and they looked well on the way to chasing down South Africa’s total of 177 for eight. But the match changed dramatically in the last three overs as England lost six wickets for 24 runs to finish on 176 for nine on Wednesday.

“You run in as hard as you can and hit your length. All of a sudden their team was on the back foot,” said Ngidi who was Man-of-the-Match for his 3/30.

England needed just seven to win off the last over but Ngidi dismissed Tom Curran and Moeen Ali while conceding only five runs.

Adil Rashid was run out off the last ball, trying for an second run which would have tied the scores.

The scores: South Africa 177 for eight in 20 overs (T. Bavuma 43, Q. de Kock 31, H. van der Dussen 31, J. Smuts 20, Jordan two for 28) bt England 176 for nine in 20 overs (J. Roy 70, J. Bairstow 23, E. Morgan 52, Ngidi three for 30, Phehlukwayo two for 32, Hendricks two for 33). Toss: England.

220,2020/02/13,Shahbaz spins Bengal back into it,"Tiwari-Nandi century stand allows a 186-run lead over Punjab

Manoj Tiwary and Arnab Nandi hit fifties to put Bengal in the ascendancy on day two of the Ranji Elite A match against Punjab here on Thursday. Bengal was 199/9 at stumps, 186 in front. Krishan Alang and Vinay Choudhary had restored a sense of parity by skittling the lower middle-order.

Bengal knew it had to show a lot more application and nous than the last innings. It was then that Tiwary’s experience came to the fore.

Starting positively, Tiwary kept the scorecard ticking with singles and twos, sandwiched between fours. He was ably supported by Arnab Nandi who was resolute in defence, and put away the loose balls.

By tea, both batsmen had brought up their hundred stand. Nandi was eventually dismissed for a 98-ball 51 by Siddarth Kaul. And by the time, Alang trapped Tiwary in front for a well-crafted 65, the lead had swelled well past 100.

Oohs and aahs

Punjab was left to rue a promising start though. In nine overs before lunch, that tested the skill of the batsmen, Kaul and Alang had reduced Bengal to 18 for two. There were oohs and aahs, along with a plenty of head-holding, in almost every over bowled.

Earlier in the morning, Bengal needed early wickets to make a fight of the match. Akash Deep provided the first breakthrough with an outswinger to send back debutant Ramandeep Singh in the first over of the day.

Shahbaz Ahmed then left Bengal in ecstasy as he summoned the sort of spin bowling burst that was required to lift his side out of day one gloom. The left-arm orthodox tore through the Punjab middle-order in a spell during which he picked five for 29 to finish with 20-5-57-7.

Morning moisture

The early morning moisture played a part in giving the bowlers a bigger say. For the batsmen, there was the slowness of the Patiala pitch, and its at times unpredictable bounce to tackle.

The last wicket pair of Anmol Malhotra and Baltej Singh showed stiff resistance, adding 26 to take a slender first-innings lead of 13. Malhotra, whose unbeaten 51 handed Punjab a win in the last match, struck 44.

221,2020/02/13,Karnataka holds all the cards,"Takes sizeable first innings lead and despite poor catching has Baroda in the doldrums

The second day of this Ranji Trophy encounter did not match the first for drama, but the contest still rattled along quickly. Karnataka claimed a handsome first-innings lead of 148 runs in the morning and then, notwithstanding some sloppiness in the field, dismissed half the Baroda side. The visitor was 208 for five at the close of play at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday, ahead by 60 runs. Baroda’s No. 11, Babasafikhan Pathan, is unlikely to bat on account of an injured hamstring while the wicket-keeper Viraj Bhosale is nursing a fever. The pitch has no demons in it and Karnataka will be hopeful of forcing a victory on day three.

No help

When Baroda began its second essay, it was evident that the surface was not offering seam bowlers as much help as it had a day earlier. Twenty wicket-less overs elapsed before Karnataka finally broke through. A short, wide delivery from Prasidh Krishna was slapped straight to the point fielder by Kedar Devdhar. Vishnu Solanki fell in the following over, trapped leg-before by K. Gowtham.

Ahmadnoor Pathan (90) and Deepak Hooda (50) , though, resisted. The pair added 94 runs for the third wicket, boldly taking the attack to Karnataka. Hooda struck two massive sixes off Gowtham, including one that thumped into the roof overhang. Karnataka did itself no favours in the field, spurning as many as four opportunities. When Hooda was on 27, a tough chance just eluded substitute D. Nischal at forward short leg. Twenty minutes from the tea break, Pathan was dropped on 55 by Karun Nair at first slip. After Hooda was bowled by Ronit More — with a peach of a delivery that jagged back in and hit the top of off-stump — Nair put down another catch, this time reprieving Abhimanyusingh Rajput.

Another let off

Pathan was then let off a second time, on 86, when Sharath Srinivas shelled a simple offering behind the wicket. Fortunately for Karnataka, the opener added only four more runs. He was dismissed later in the same Prasidh over, caught by Sharath down the leg-side. Krunal Pandya fell cheaply yet again, caught spectacularly in the gully by a diving Devdutt Padikkal.

In the morning, Karnataka added 68 runs to its overnight score of 165 for seven. Abhimanyu Mithun made a typically attacking 40 (46b), with Sharath (34), who wore one on the ribs and had to leave the field briefly, lending support.

The scores: Baroda — 1st innings: 85.

222,2020/02/13,Fazal cracks an unbeaten century,"Keeps Vidarbha in the hunt for the first innings lead

Faiz Fazal led from the front with a superbly-paced unbeaten 126 (209b, 15x4, 3x6) to keep Vidarbha in the hunt to realise the first objective of taking the first innings lead against Hyderabad on the second day of the four-day Ranji Trophy Elite group match at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here on Thursday.

In reply to Hyderabad’s first innings score of 272, Vidarbha finished the day at 242 for four, with captain Fazal still at the crease with his second century of the season.

Earlier, the home team, resuming at 239 for seven, could score only 33 runs more with 22 of them coming from Mohd. Siraj’s lusty blows.

In the morning, the focus was on young debutant Prateek Reddy, who was unbeaten on 76. But he missed a wonderful opportunity to score a century as he nicked a perfect length ball from pacer Aditya Thakare to the wicketkeeper on 83.

Early blows

And when Vidarbha batted, the ever-dependable pacer Ravi Kiran struck two early blows — trapping opener Akshay Kolhar leg before and geting rid of Aniruddha Choudhary who snicked one which was moving away to ’keeper K. Sumanth — to leave the team at 24 for two in the eighth over.

But, the man in form Ganesh Satish (65, 153b, 9x4 1x6) joined his skipper and the pair added 124 for the third wicket, which effectively pushed the hosts on the backfoot.

In the morning session, Fazal was at his fluent best, essaying some flowing drives off both pacers and spinners on either side of the wicket. After lunch, he was more cautious and saw his partner do most of the scoring.

Lacking support

That was the phase when Ravi Kiran once again lacked support from the other end. Siraj, Ravi Teja and Chama Milind, who tested Satish quite a few times angling the ball away from the batsman, failed to get the breakthroughs.

Consequently, Vidarbha wriggled out of the crisis and eventually managed to stay on top even as another debutant and young left-arm spinner Aniketh Reddy had the satisfaction of sending back a well-set Satish after tea — stumped smartly by Sumanth.

But, with Fazal staying put at one end, Hyderabad’s misery only piled up in the battle for survival to avoid relegation.

The scores:

224,2020/02/13,Dhoni is best captain India ever had: Raina,"Dhoni is set to be back in action at the IPL, where he will captain the CSK, starting March 23.

Veteran India batsman Suresh Raina feels Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the best captain India ever had.

Raina and Dhoni play for the same IPL franchise – the Chennai Super Kings – which is also led by the latter.

“I think we have the best captain who has changed the Indian team like anything. Now we have that same aura in our dressing room,” Raina said on ‘The Super Kings show’ on Star Sports Tamil.

The 38-year-old Dhoni has retired from Test cricket but his future in the limited overs formats is a subject of intense speculation.

The two-time World Cup-winning former captain took a break from cricket after India’s exit from the 2019 World Cup in England. He is set to be back in action at the IPL, where he will captain the CSK, starting March 23.

With three restricted stands at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai finally being reopened, Raina urged the fans to fill the venue in every CSK home game.

“We have all the seats available. Hopefully, we’ll have more fans now so that there is it will be more energy on the field,” the 33-year-old Raina, a former India batsman, said.

Raina, who last played for India in 2018, also expressed his excitement about the prospect of playing with CSK’s latest acquisitions.

“This year we have a lot of new talent in our team. Piyush (Chawla) is there, then we have Hazelwood, Sam Curran, Sai Kishore from Tamil Nadu, he has been bowling really well for them. So, I think we have a lot of mixture of youngsters and seniors.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/owa6q6/article30808327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SURESHRAINAANDDHONI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dhoni-is-best-captain-india-ever-had-raina/article30808328.ece

227,2020/02/13,"Wetlands in Coimbatore home for 162 bird species, says recent survey","Resident species outnumbered migrants when a total of 162 species of birds were spotted in the wetlands of Coimbatore in the recently concluded Asian Waterbird Census (AWC).

Of the 162 species, 125 were resident and 37 migrant; comprising 103 land birds and 59 waterbirds. The total number of birds spotted in the census was 5,996. The census held between January 5 and 20 covering 26 wetlands also saw an increase in terms of the number of species spotted compared to the results of census in previous years.

Meanwhile, the census data showed that the overall bird population declined in the last three years from 7,079 in 2017 to 5,996 this year. This was attributed to the drop in migrant bird population by 34 % while residents showed a steady population.

Interesting sightings recorded in the census included Temminck’s Stint, Syke’s Warbler, Blyth’s Pipit, Lesser Sand Plover and Yellow Bittern. While Cattle Egret, Indian Pond-Heron and Little Cormorant, the top three resident waterbirds sighted, Wood Sandpiper, Western Yellow Wagtail and Common Sandpiper were the top three migrant waterbirds.

Barn Swallow, Red-rumped Swallow, Blue-tailed Bee-eater, House Crow, Common Myna and Rose-ringed Parakeet were the most populous resident and migrant land birds. Krishnampathi tank stood at the top of the chart with the sighting of 72 bird species and 853 individuals. Average number of species found in a wetland stood at 37 while the average bird population of a wetland was at 232.

Average number of species per wetland showed an increasing trend which according to the surveyors could be due to increased pressure of species to move out from their regular operational area for lack of food and habitat.

According to them, Vellalore, Senkulam, Achankulam, Krishnampathy, Kolarampathy, and Pallapalayam wetlands assume significance as they provide suitable breeding habitats for Pelicans, Herons and Egrets, Swamphens and Coots, and Ducks such as Lesser Whistling and Spot-billed.

During the survey, the quality of wetlands in the upper Noyyal-fed areas were assessed better than those falling in the lower areas.

Coimbatore Nature Society took the lead in the survey in Coimbatore for the seventh consecutive year under the leadership of Selvaraj P.R., Chetan H.

228,2020/02/13,"Industries continue to face financial crunch, say MSMEs","‘There are several challenges in getting bank loans and financial aid and it is crippling growth’

Several announcements of the State and Central governments and bank products target the Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs) so that the sector gets adequate funds. In the recent announcements in the Union Budget, too, the Government has spelled out schemes to meet the financial needs of the MSMEs.

According to banks and officials, the micro and small-scale sector in Coimbatore, which is a hub of manufacturing industries, are said to be seeing a growth in credit off-take in the last couple of months, indicating growth.

However, according to the MSMEs, there are several challenges in getting bank loans and financial support and it is crippling growth.

B. Karthigaivasan, General Manager of District Industries Centre, Coimbatore, says that the number of applications received for the capital loans interest subsidy scheme from the MSMEs has gone up in the recent months. The applications are from existing units and new ones.

The Coimbatore District Lead Bank Manager S. Venkataramanan says that the MSME sector is seeing a growth every quarter in loan off take. According to the banks, the 59-minute loan scheme and the one time restructuring scheme for MSMEs are witnessing encouraging response in the district.

But, according to the industries, the challenges and fund crunch continue.

S. Surulivel, who heads the Coimbatore chapter of Laghu Udyog Bharati, says micro and small-scale industries prefer to take loans from nationalised banks rather than private banks or the Non Banking Finance Sector as they fear high hidden charges. But, in the nationalised banks, the time taken to sanction loans is long and the documents required are also more. Under the 59-minute loan scheme, only the in-principle approval is given immediately. The actual sanction sometimes takes six months and the banks ask for a lot of papers. In the case of loan restructuring scheme, some banks ask for additional collateral.

According to P. Nallathambi, president of Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers’ Welfare Association, if a small-scale unit is unable to repay the loan for 90 days, the account becomes a non-performing asset. There are several practical challenges in the schemes of the Central Government that aim at improving fund flow to the micro and small-scale units. In the recent period, the Tamilnadu Industrial Investment Corporation has increased the interest subvention and this is attractive to the MSMEs.

J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises, says the banks do not restructure the loan for units that have not repaid for four or five months. “Our problems started more than a year ago. For the last one month, many micro units are having almost nil or just 10 % orders. The entire repaying capacity of the units has diminished. How can the units continue with regular repayment of bank loans ?” he asks. Some banks do the restructuring only if the unit has repaid the loan till the previous month or defaulted only for one month, he claims.

Coimbatore Tiruppur District Micro and Cottage Entreprenuers Association president C. Sivakumar says the micro and small-scale units in Coimbatore continue to face financial problems. The Government schemes only benefit the larger industries. “For those who take ₹2 lakh to ₹10 lakh loan, there is no support from the Government or the bank,” he says. Production and turnover have reduced for the micro units with the slowdow. While the industries need more financial support now, the banks are pressurising the industries on repayment. “They are converting cash credit to term loan and asking the units to pay interest,” he says.

Mr. Sivakumar also says that awareness should improve among the micro units on the one-time restructuring scheme.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/u21npq/article30813877.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14cbmsp,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/industries-continue-to-face-financial-crunch-say-msmes/article30813878.ece

235,2020/02/13,Headmistress of Coimbatore school accused of forcing Dalit girl to clean toilet,"Preliminary inquiry into the complaint is on, says senior police official

A Dalit man from Idikarai in Coimbatore lodged a complaint with the Periyanaickenpalayam police on Thursday, alleging that the headmistress of his 10-year-old daughter’s school forced her to clean the school toilet.

The complainant accused the headmistress of the government primary school of resorting to casteist slur against the girl and beating her when she refused to clean the toilet.

As per the complaint, a copy of which was circulated among mediapersons, the class V student refused to go to school for two days, and also refused to eat.

When enquired, she told her parents that the headmistress forced her to clean the school toilet for two weeks.

The complainant alleged that the headmistress asked her to clean the toilet again on Tuesday. When the girl refused, the headmistress beat her and told her that people belonging to her caste were doing such works and therefore what was her difficulty in doing so.

236,2020/02/13,No progress on Hosur’s proposed international flower auction market,"The project continues to be dogged by allegations that vested interests are stalling it

Eight months after Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced an international flower auction centre in Hosur, a major flower producing and exporting hub in the country, the location and the status of the project is shrouded in opacity.

Mr. Palaniswami had announced the setting up of the flower auction market at a cost of ₹20.26 crore. It was to be implemented by the Agriculture Marketing and Agri Business Department (AMABD). The market, according to farmers, will revamp the existing middlemen-trader dominated pricing system and align prices to global demand, keeping them updated with real-time fluctuations.

At present, Hosur’s flower growers rely on the prices fixed by traders citing hyperlocal demand, even while the prices may be higher elsewhere in the country.

A 7.67 acre land was identified in Moranapalli village on Hosur-Krishnagiri National Highway (NH) and an informal plan layout was made six months ago.

Simultaneously, another land on Bagalur Road, located in the neighbourhood of former Minister Balakrishna Reddy, was also identified. But the Bagalur land, while poramboke (belonging to the government) on record, is under litigation. “It is our ancestral land with 20 coparceners (persons with equal rights) but wrongly marked as poramboke,” said Siva, the litigant. “I submitted a petition to the Tahsildar along with the court order which directed the Settlement Office and other officials to make inquiry and issue patta. Now it is with the Settlement Office,” he said.

According to a source in the AMABD, the Moranapalli land was selected, and they were told last week by the Hosur Tahsildar Senthil Kumaran that the proposal had been prepared and forwarded. “We are hopeful the land will be sanctioned this week,” the official said.

“The proposal has been prepared and sent to the DRO (District Revenue Officer), after which the land will be inspected and the Collector’s orders passed,” he added.

However, when contacted, Collector S. Prabhakar, taking details on the project from his assistant, said, “I don’t remember the name of the village, but the site is on the National Highway. The file is under circulation and the Government Order is awaited, after which tenders will be floated.”

But Mr. Senthil Kumaran, whose proposal is key to the progress of the project, contradicted both the Collector’s statement and AMABD’s claims. Asked to name the site of the project, he said: “There were 2-3 locations and [there is] no clarity on the land as yet. I am yet to prepare the proposal.”

But when told about the Collector’s understanding, Mr. Kumaran said he needed to “discuss with his higher officials” and refused to entertain more questions.

District Revenue Officer Shanti did not respond to messages asking if she had inspected the land and if there was merit in allegations that there was an attempt to get the project located at the hometown of Mr. Reddy.

‘Not decided’

When contacted, Mr. Reddy dismissed accusations of any lobbying. “There are two or three locations, and where ever land is available, the auction market will come there. It [the site of the market] is not decided yet.”

Asked specifically if he had made any representation for Bagalur, Mr. Reddy said the market would come up in Hosur because Hosur has flowers.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/qcbdm9/article30813669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB14FLOWERSITE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/no-progress-on-hosurs-proposed-international-flower-auction-market/article30813670.ece
237,2020/02/13,Headmaster of primary school held for sexual assault on students,"The arrest comes in the wake of an inquiry by the District Child Protection Unit

After three days of furore, the Negamam police in Coimbatore arrested the headmaster of a primary school near here for alleged sexual assault on minor girls.

The arrest of the headmaster, A. Makaliappan, 52, from Vinayagar Nagar near Sulthanpet in Coimbatore, came in the wake of an inquiry conducted by the District Child Protection Unit, which found that he had allegedly subjected three minor girls to sexual assault in school.

Makaliappan was arrested late on Wednesday for offences under Sections 9 (f) (whoever being on the management or staff of an educational institution or educational institution, commits sexual assault on a child in that institution), 9 (l) (whoever commits sexual assault on a child more than once or repeatedly), 9 (m) (whoever commits sexual assault on a child below twelve years) read with 10 (punishment for aggravated sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. He was produced before a magistrate and remanded in judicial custody.

According to the police, Makaliappan was working as headmaster for ten years at the panchayat union primary school on Pollachi-Palakkad Road.

On February 2, the District Child Protection Unit received information on alleged sexual harassment by the accused on girl students. Sudhamani, a counsellor with the District Child Protection Unit, went to the school and conducted an inquiry. During the enquiry, three students gave statements accusing the headmaster of having touched their private parts.

The officer later lodged a complaint with the police, which led to the headmaster’s arrest around 11.30 p.m. on Wednesday. The arrest of the headmaster comes in the wake of a series of protests by parents of students since Monday evening.

On Tuesday, the then Coimbatore Chief Educational Officer P. Ayyanan ordered the transfer of Makaliappan and said that departmental inquiry would be initiated against him. Makaliappan was transferred to a nearby primary school, although he was on medical leave when the transfer order was issued.

Hours after the transfer of the headmaster, the Department of School Education issued an order transferring Mr. Ayyanan to Namakkal on Tuesday evening.

A total of 32 students, comprising 17 girls and 15 boys, are currently studying in the primary school according to education officials.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/headmaster-of-primary-school-held-for-sexual-assault-on-students/article30813656.ece
238,2020/02/13,Learning Japanese to land jobs in Japan,"A centre in Salem prepares students to tap opportunities in various sectors

C. Muthukumar, M. Sivagopal, C. Abirami and their friends graduated in 2019 and are awaiting job offers like many other engineering graduates in the country. But, they are not waiting for any offers from within the country but from firms in Japan.

The expected shortfall in labour force in Japan and the country opening its doors for migrant work force has turned out be a boon for engineering graduates elsewhere across the globe. By passing the requisite Japan language proficiency test, landing a job in Japan seems to getting a lot more easier than in in India.

Takahiro Nishida, Deputy Manager of a renowned technology company in Japan, recently visited the Japanese language centre at Sona College of Technology where over 1,000 students at different levels of engineering studies are learning Japanese. He told The Hindu that his firm would require about two lakh engineers in the long-run and anyone who had technical knowledge and Japanese language skills would match their profile. “Recent studies conducted in Japan showed that the service sector alone would face a shortfall of six million workers by 2030, the healthcare sector would require about four million and so is the state in almost every other sector”, he said.

There has been a decline in birth rates in Japan and it has opened opportunities to rest of the globe. The Sona Group, which stumbled upon this opportunity through one of its professors S. Saravanan, Head of the Centre for Photonics and Nano Technology and convener of Japanese language centre, who has worked for over 12 years in Japan.“Learning Japanese language is easy and anyone could learn it within six to eight months”, Mr. Saravanan said.

The possibilities of landing a job in Japan are higher as there are 1.67 opportunities to each candidate. “An Indian firm, after several rounds of interview hires three persons, while a Japanese firm, after interviewing 50 persons, has short-listed about 21 candidates, he said.

A graduate would earn between ₹18 lakhs to ₹22 lakh per annum”, he said. A candidate must complete N3 level of Japanese language proficiency test. The students here are also taught Japanese culture and lifestyle. The centre at the college is open to all, he said.

Native Japanese speakers have also been working at the centre to teach students all aspects of Japanese life. Shibayama Hiromi, one of the tutors, said Indians were capable of picking up the language easily. When asked what are some of the basic qualities Indians should learn from Japanese culture, Mr. Hiromi said, “being punctual and saying sorry and thank you.”

For students, beyond handsome salaries, landing a job in Japan is also about getting to learn modern technologies. “We get to access and get trained in most modern technologies like artificial intelligence. The firms have offered to train us and they are ready to hire even freshers with technical knwoledge”, says K. Aishwarya, an IT graduate.

Chocko Valliappa, Vice-Chairman of Sona Group of Institutions said “Based on our interactions with Japanese firms, we are ringing in changes in our curiculum and training them in most recent technology. From the upcoming year, we are planning to have a member from Japan in our curriculum board.”",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/emqpn0/article30813640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB14JAPAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/learning-japanese-to-land-jobs-in-japan/article30813641.ece
239,2020/02/13,Last remaining deer in Ooty park face uncertain future,"With a steady number of annual deaths, the last remaining deer at the Ooty deer park continue to face an uncertain future, with no decision yet being made about their relocation to another facility.

According to forest department officials, the number of Sambar deer and barking deer, which had been at 19 individuals in 2017, has fallen to just 14 over the last couple of years mostly due to the animals dying of old age.

Even though the park has been officially closed to visitors for around half a decade, with the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) deeming the facility to not meet the required standards to continue operations, the fate of the remaining deer at the park has been up for debate.

A few years ago, there was a proposal to transfer the remaining animals to the Tiruchi Zoo, but concerns over the safety of the deer, which are known to be prone to shock and sudden death in high-stress situations has discouraged such a solution, officials said.

“The decision on what to do with the remaining deer at the facility remains unresolved, with top forest department officials still unsure about what to do with the remaining animals,” said a senior forest department official.

The management of the park is being undertaken by the forest officials and staff of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR). Officials said that one forester, and a few other staff posted with the department are stationed at the deer park to look after the well-being of the animals.

“There is also a proposal to release the animals back into the wild, where they could help bolster remaining deer populations, or serve as a prey base for carnivores,” an official said, adding that once the remaining deer are moved out, further decisions about what do to with the facility can be resolved.

“A proposal to transform the deer park into a rehabilitation centre for the endangered Nilgiri tahr, where injured animals can be brought and treated is also being considered,” the official added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/gz8wpq/article30813628.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB14ZOO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/last-remaining-deer-in-ooty-park-face-uncertain-future/article30813629.ece
240,2020/02/13,Textile Secretary urges industry to focus on MMF sector,"Textile and clothing industry should tap opportunities in the man-made fibre (MMF) sector, Ravi Capoor, Secretary, Ministry of Textiles, said here on Wednesday.

The Secretary was on a two-day visit to Coimbatore. On Thursday he visited Texvalley in Erode.

Addressing the textile and clothing industry representatives, in a meeting organised by Confederation of Indian Textile Industry on Wednesday, Mr. Capoor said India is pushed to the fifth position in global textile trade though earlier it was in the second position. The textile industry should grab opportunities in the polyester sector and the garment cluster of Tiruppur should take steps to brand the garments and products produced there.

Representatives of as many as 48 textile associations in south India and the textile export promotion councils interacted with the Secretary at the meeting.

T. Rajkumar, chairman of CITI, said in a press release that the government is expected to announce schemes to develop textile parks for technical textiles and textile machinery manufacturing to promote import substitution products. The government is also exploring the possibilities of setting up research and development centres for each segment of the textile industry.

On Thursday, the Secretary visited the Centres of Excellence for Industrial Textiles and Medical Textiles at PSG Institute of Technology and Applied Research and South India Textile Research Association respectively. He also held meetings here with members of Indian Texpreneurs Federation (ITF) and South India Spinners’ Association.

At the meeting with ITF, he urged the participants to focus on emerging sectors in the textile value chain.

241,2020/02/13,Temporary relief shelters constructed to people affected by natural calamities,"The shelters are being constructed at a cost of ₹ 49 lakh

Temporary relief shelters are being constructed at Emerald and Naduvattam in the Nilgiris by the district administration to provide housing for people if and when heavy rain hit parts of the district again.

The rain last year had let to damage to buildings and many densely populated settlements becoming endangered by landslips, necessitating evacuation of people living in these areas to temporary relief shelters. These relief shelters had been set up mostly in government schools and wedding halls.

Officials from the district administration said that one of the main issues faced by people when heavy rain hits the district last year was finding safe places for communities to stay in. Moreover, as many of the people, who were evacuated from their houses, had to be housed in school buildings, they had to once again be moved out when schools had to be reopened. In order to prevent such a situation from arising, temporary relief shelters are being constructed in Emerald and Naduvattam areas.

In Emerald, which was one of the areas that had borne the brunt of the intense rain last year, leading to landslips in many places, temporary relief shelters to house at least 70 people are nearing construction. The shelters are being constructed at a cost of ₹ 49 lakh.

Nilgiris District Collector J. Innocent Divya said that the relief shelters being set up in these areas will allow people whose homes are damaged in rain or other natural calamities to be housed safely and comfortably till their houses are repaired or are rebuilt. “The relief shelters are to ensure preparedness, so that people who cannot stay in their homes during heavy rain or other natural calamities can be housed suitably,” said Ms. Divya, who added that permanent housing is also being built for people whose homes were damaged in last year’s spell of heavy rains in the district.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/x1w2li/article30807262.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB13SHELTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/temporary-relief-shelters-constructed-to-people-affected-by-natural-calamities/article30807263.ece
242,2020/02/13,Vellalore bus stand project may ‘land’ Corporation in trouble,"The land is in the possession of Coimbatore Integrated Waste Management Company Private Limited

Coimbatore Corporation has started work to build an integrated bus stand in Vellalore on a land that it does not possess. The Corporation is investing on the land around 50 % of the ₹ 168-crore project to develop the bus stand, spread over 61.62 acres, in its dump yard in Vellalore. But the Corporation had leased out the land and another 120 acre to the company that process a part of the city's waste, Coimbatore Integrated Waste Management Company Pvt. Ltd.(CIWMCPL).

The Corporation had leased out the land in 2008, for which the State Government issued an order – G.O. (Ms) 76 of May 9, 2008. Thereafter, the Corporation entered into a lease agreement with the CIWMCPL on October 6, 2008. The lease clearly says that the entire land (181 acre) shall be in the CIWMCPL’s possession for 20 years from the date of commissioning the waste management project.

Sources familiar with the development say that as CIWMCPL started operations on April 1, 2011, it will possess the land till 2031.

The CIWMCPL has established a waste processing plant on the land to manage nearly 50% of the city’s waste – around 500 tonnes a day, erected temporary sheds for its 150-odd workers, mostly migrant labourers, and built a school for their children.

Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani kickstarted the bus stand project by participating in the ground-breaking ceremony on January 24.

Sources say that after the Minister kick started the construction, a few persons asked the CIWMCPL to vacate a part of the 181 acre that is in its possesses. In response, the company has complained to the Corporation and district administration.

Citing its lease agreement with the Corporation, the CIWMCPL has said that the land in its possession is integral to its waste management operation and disturbance will hamper its operations.

Clause 6 of the agreement says if CIWMCPL comes across any construction or encumbrance on the land in its possession it can ask the Corporation to clear it and the civic body will have a legal obligation to do so. If the Corporation fails, the company can go ahead to demolish the construction.

This, technically, means that the company can ask the Corporation to stop or demolish any construction and the latter will be obliged to do so, the sources say.

Further, Clause 13 of the lease agreement gives full, free and uninterrupted possession, enjoyment/occupation and use of the 181 acre to the CIWMCPL throughout the term, without any obstruction, interference or disturbance. And, more importantly in Clause 14 the Corporation guarantees the CIWMCPL that the grant of the 181 acre is irrevocable for as long as the waste management agreement remains in force and it shall not terminate or seek to terminate the agreement unless the concession agreement expires.

Pointing to these clauses, the sources say that unless the Corporation terminates its agreement with the company, it cannot take back possession of the land and that puts a question mark on what to do with the 500-odd tonnes waste that the company process everyday.

Criticising the Corporation for landing itself and the city's residents in such a situation, DMK MLA N. Karthik asks who is the Corporation trying to please by rushing through the project and it does not appear to be the public.

Consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon says this yet again shows that the Corporation has not thought through the bus stand project. It has not consulted the public, who will be least benefited given the site chosen. This calls for a complete rethink of the project, he adds.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/20zypk/article30804401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB13SPECIALSCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/vellalore-bus-stand-project-may-land-corporation-in-trouble/article30804402.ece

Stating that delay in disposal of waste dumped for segregation in their area leads to bad odour emanating and cause fire outbreak, residents of Sakthi Nagar in Veerappanchatiram urged the corporation to relocate the dumpyard.

Over 140 houses are located in the area in Ward 23 in the corporation limits where many power loom units, garment units and a private school are located.

As part of solid waste management, the corporation collects solid waste from the households and dumps it along the road in the area that is segregated by the conservancy workers.

Later, the municipal solid waste is transported in lorries to the compost yard at Vairapalayam.

Saravanan (32), a resident, said that waste, including poultry waste and industrial waste, are collected from other areas and are dumped in their area. Since segregation of waste is not done on weekends, garbage gets accumulated causing bad odour.

He said that poultry waste are dragged by dogs and are dropped in front of houses causing panic among the people. Also, during night hours, garbage is set on fire by anti-social elements creating fear among the residents,

he added. Residents said that they had petitioned corporation officials many times asking them to relocate the yard. However, no steps were taken so far.

Organised by the Democratic Youth Federation of India, Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Movement and the All India Democratic Women’s Association, members condemned the administration for failing to demolish the wall at Kattumara Kuttai village in Sanyasigundu Panchayat Union even after the court ordered to do so.

They said that 70 members of Adi Dravidar Community were residing in the village for four generations and were using the pathway all these years to reach the main road.

However, construction of the wall five years ago had prevented them from using the stretch as they were forced to cover additional distance to reach the road.

“The court ordered officials to demolish the wall and officials failed to implement the court order”, they added.

Protesters wanted the wall to be demolished and people be allowed to use the common pathway.

248,2020/02/13,Continuing connection,"Sage Vasistha’s son was Sakti, whose son was Parasara. Parasara was the author of the Vishnu Purana. His son was Badarayana, also known as Veda Vyasa, and Vyasa’s son was Suka. Just as Vyasa gave us the Mahabharata, his son Suka gave us the Bhagavata Purana. It emerged as his narration to Parikshit, who was awaiting death. Given but a few days to live, Parikshit decided to spend the little time left to him, in listening to Krishna’s deeds. Suka’s narration to Parikshit, of the story of Krishna, is called Bhagavata Purana. Srimad Bhagavatam can be considered a continuation of the Vishnu Purana. So, Suka, the grandson of sage Parasara, continued what his grandfather had begun. Since it is Lord Krishna who plays the major role in all the happenings in the Mahabharata and since Srimad Bhagavatam is also about His exploits, Suka may also be said to have continued his father Vyasa’s work.

Parikshit was the son of Abhimanyu and the grandson of Arjuna. So, the Vyasa-Pandava family connections continued in Suka’s time also, said Velukkudi Krishnan, in a discourse. Vishnu dharma was told by sage Saunaka to King Sataneeka. Saunaka was a student of Suta Pauranika. Suta Pauranika was the son of sage Romaharshana. Romaharshana was a disciple of Vyasa. So, the sage who advised King Sataneeka also had a Vyasa connection. As for king Sataneeka, he was the son of Janamejaya and the grandson of Parikshit. So here again we find the Vyasa-Pandava association continuing. Rishis were advisers to kings of yore, because the sages were learned men, who could guide kings in not just matters of religion and belief, but also in administration.

The divine bell from the sanctum of Tirupati is believed to have been incarnated as Venkatanatha (1268 CE), known as Sri Vedanta Desika.

A Vaishnava guru, Desikar propagated the principles of Vishistadvaitha. Panchajanya Trust and Dr. Sri. U.Ve. Mukundagiri Vankeepuram Anantha Padmanabhachariar (‘APN Swamy’) have written and directed a film on the philosopher titled, Ghantavadharam.

Though a theatrical release was not envisaged, from December 2019, the film has seen about 100 screenings across the globe.

Ghantavadharam transports viewers to the 13th Century and through a duration of three hours throws light on Desikar’s life, tutelage and moksha.

Backed by interesting anecdotes, the film also talks about His notable works. One such incident is how when a poisonous snake advanced towards Him, Desikar composed Garudadandakam, hymns in praise of Lord Garuda. Other notable incidents that have been depicted in the film include, the composition of Sri Stuti, where Goddess Malahakshmi showers coins of gold, Turkish invasion and Desikar’s efforts to protect Lord Ranganatha’s idol, and how an epidemic led Desikar to compose Sudarshanashtakam.

250,2020/02/13,He is impartial,"The Supreme One is impartial. He punishes those who go against dharma, even if they happen to be His bhaktas. He says so in the Pancharatra Agamas. Those who violate rules are called asuras and those who adhere to His rules are devas. It is by one’s conduct that one becomes an asura or a deva. Kakasura is an example, said M.A. Venkatakrishnan, in a discourse. He was the son of Indra, who was chief of the celestials. But Kakasura was a demon, not a deva, because of his evil acts and intentions. He pecked at Sita’s breast and wounded Her. Kakasura’s life was spared, because Sita, the embodiment of compassion was by Rama’s side.

But Ravana made the grave mistake of separating the Lord and Sita. Rama, separated from Sita, was unsparing of His enemies. Why does the Lord as Trivikrama send Bali to patala? What wrong had Bali done? He was not wicked like Hiranyakasipu or other demons. But Bali had grabbed Indra’s territory. Bali had his own territory. Had he been content with that, he would not have been punished. Indra complained to the Lord about Bali taking away his land and asked the Lord to recover it for him. Bali was doing a yaga, and for the yaga to yield the desired results, he had to give whatever anyone asked of him. So, the Lord asked Indra to go and ask him for return of his land. But Indra felt it would be a blot on his status. So, the Lord went on his behalf to beg for land from Bali. It was this simplicity of the Lord which elicited praise from the Azhvars, who celebrated the Trivikrama avatara. The Lord assumed the form of a short Vamana, because He was sorry to see His devotee Indra suffer. So, His body shrank in sorrow. He changed His form into the huge Trivikrama, because He was joyous over recovery of His devotee Indra’s land from Bali.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/he-is-impartial/article30805583.ece
251,2020/02/13,BJP accepts defeat with humility: Amit Shah,"He says the party views elections as an opportunity to widen its ideological base

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, speaking at an event organised by Times Now, said the BJP “accepted its defeat” in the recently-concluded Delhi Assembly elections with “humility.”

Arguing that the party viewed elections as an opportunity to “widen its ideological base,” Mr. Shah said the BJP didn’t contest elections “solely to win” them.

“For some political parties, elections may be an opportunity to form government or replace an incumbent government but for the BJP, which is an ideology-based party, victory or loss certainly have their respective meanings but these are not the reasons for which the BJP contests elections,” he said.

“Since I entered national politics, I have hit the ground and contested them with all I have... this is not the first time we have lost an election... or... results have been the opposite of what was expected... I accept this defeat with all humility and we will ensure that we sit in opposition responsibly and ensure that the government functions properly,” he said.

Elections, the former BJP national president said, were a combination of “several factors including ideology.”

The results of the Delhi Assembly elections, he argued further, did not mean that the BJP’s “ideology had been rejected.”

“It would be erroneous to say that the election results seek to convey that the BJP’s ideology has been rejected... by that logic [Delhi Chief Minister Arvind] Kejriwal came third in the Lok Sabha elections — does that mean the people had rejected him? And if that was the case what explains the Delhi results?” the Union Home Minister asked.

“...since the party was formed in 1950 till 1977 we sat in opposition but we never abandoned it [the party’s ideology]... we demanded that Article 370 be removed then and we believe the same now,” Mr. Shah said further.

Speaking about the Shaheen Bagh protests, Mr. Shah said, “these are not democratic protests... if those protesting have the democratic right to say what they are, so do we.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m8p9is/article30569223.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TH-THGRP-SHAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-accepts-defeat-with-humility-amit-shah/article30813639.ece
252,2020/02/13,Plea in HC for court-monitored CBI probe into molestation of Gargi students,"Ten people, between the ages of 18 and 25 years, were arrested by police on Wednesday in connection with the incident

A plea was moved in the Delhi High Court on Thursday seeking a court-monitored CBI probe into the alleged molestation of students during a cultural festival at the all-women Gargi College last week.

The Supreme Court, earlier in the day, had refused to entertain the petition and had directed the petitioner, a lawyer, to move the high court. Hours after the apex court’s decision, the lawyer filed the petition in the high court.

The petition, by advocate M.L. Sharma, has sought preservation of all video recordings and CCTV camera footage of the college campus. It has also sought arrest of the people behind the “planned criminal conspiracy“.

Ten people, between the ages of 18 and 25 years, were arrested by police on Wednesday in connection with the incident.

On February 6, a group of men broke into the Gargi College during the ‘Reverie’ fest and allegedly groped, harassed and molested the attendees, who claimed that security officials stood watching when the incident took place.

The incident came to light after some students took to Instagram to narrate their ordeal and alleged that security personnel did nothing to control the unruly groups. Mr. Sharma, in his plea, has alleged that it was a planned political and criminal conspiracy hatched in the backdrop of the Delhi elections and no action was taken after the incident.

“It is a clear criminal conspiracy hatched by the political party to deploy accused persons to provoke the Delhi public for effecting voting in their favour. Despite presence of Delhi Police ... on February 6, neither principal nor other state authorities tried to stop and arrest the accused persons,” the PIL claimed.

The petition further claimed that “deliberate chants of Jai Shri Ram discloses that it is a political, planned conspiracy” and blamed the chief minister of Delhi for not taking any action against the accused.

Besides the security arranged by the college, the area had Delhi Police and paramilitary personnel who were stationed there for the Assembly polls.

According to the police, a case was registered under IPC sections 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2esakv/article30810672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI2102020000058B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/plea-in-hc-for-court-monitored-cbi-probe-into-molestation-of-gargi-students/article30810673.ece
253,2020/02/13,Delhi court appoints lawyer for Nirbhaya case convict,"He refused legal aid from Delhi State Legal Services Authority.

A Delhi court on Thursday appointed a lawyer to represent Pawan Gupta, one of the four convicts sentenced to death in the December 16, 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, as he refused to take legal aid offered by Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA).

Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana later posted the hearing in the pleas seeking fresh death warrants against the convicts for Monday.

DSLSA had provided Gupta’s father with a list of its empanelled advocates to chose from. Tihar Jail authorities informed the court that he had refused to have a lawyer via the DSLSA.

The victim’s parents and the Delhi government have moved an application seeking fresh death warrants for the four convicts after the Supreme Court granted liberty to the authorities to approach the trial court for issuance of a fresh date for the execution of the convicts.

The trial court had on January 31 stayed the execution of the four convicts in the case — Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31).

Remedies exhausted

Except Pawan Gupta, all the convicts have exhausted the legal remedies available to file a curative petition before the Supreme Court. The President has also rejected the mercy pleas of Singh, Kumar and Sharma.

255,2020/02/13,Runaway couple to reunite on V-Day eve,"HC allows man to meet wife, newborn child lodged at shelter home since last year

On Valentine’s Day eve, a runaway couple, who were separated following a complaint by girl’s father, will be reunited for the first time since May last year when the man was arrested. His wife, in the meantime, gave birth to their daughter at a women’s shelter home here.

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday allowed 27-year-old Ankit Kumar to meet his wife and four-month-old daughter during “reasonable hours’ at Nirmal Chhaya home for women here.

A Bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and I.S. Mehta also asked the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) to decide on the plea made by Mr. Kumar seeking the release of his wife and daughter within five working days.

“In the meantime, Superintendent, Nirmal Chhaya Complex, where the mother-daughter are currently lodged, is directed to permit the petitioner, Ankit Kumar, to interact with them at all reasonable hours, in accordance with law and the rules,” the Bench said.

Mr. Kumar, a Delhi resident, had moved a habeas corpus petition before the High Court urging that his wife and daughter be produced before the court and seeking permission to take them home.

Advocate Amresh Anand, who represented Mr. Kumar, submitted before the court that to date his client “has not even seen his child, forget about caressing her”. Mr. Anand urged the “kind indulgence” of the High Court in reuniting the small family.

He said that Mr. Kumar and his wife had known each other for the past few years as they were residing in the same area. Over a period of time they became very close and fell in love.

Fled after marriage

When the girl turned 18, Mr. Kumar and she secretly solemnised their marriage at Birla Mandir here on February 18 last year. A week later, fearing that her father had come to know about their marriage, the girl ran away with Mr. Kumar, said the advocate. The couple rented a flat in Noida and started living there as husband and wife.

The girl’s father lodged a police complaint saying his daughter was less than 18 years old and had been kidnapped. Based on the FIR, Mr. Kumar was arrested and his wife was sent to the shelter home.

After about seven months of legal proceedings, Mr. Kumar was acquitted of all charges by a local court here. Immediately after the release he tried to speak to his wife, but was denied permission.

Mr. Anand said the mother-daughter are not allowed to go outside the shelter home and she cannot even make any calls.

Mr. Kumar wrote to the CWC and also to Nirmal Chhaya seeking the release of his wife and daughter in December last year. When his plea remained unanswered for about two months, he moved the High Court.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sfasc2/article30805437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL13-HC2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/runaway-couple-to-reunite-on-v-day-eve/article30805493.ece

257,2020/02/13,High Court dismisses petition seeking voting rights for prisoners,"Court says right to vote was only provided by a statute

The Delhi High Court has rejected a petition seeking voting rights for prisoners noting that the right to cast vote was neither a fundamental right nor a common law right and was only provided by a statute.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar remarked that the facility was provided under the law and it can be taken away by law as held by the Supreme Court.

The Bench noted the right to vote provided under the statute — Representation of the People Act — was subject to restrictions imposed by the law, which does not allow prisoners to cast vote from jails.

The decision came on a plea by three law students — Praveen Kumar Chaudhary, Atul Kumar Dubey and Prerna Singh — seeking voting rights for all persons lodged in jails across the country.

The three law students contended in their plea that a blanket ban on the prisoners right to vote was a violation of the spirit and soul enshrined in the Constitution and the basic principle of equality.

They challenged the constitutionality of Section 62(5) of the RP Act, which deprives prisoners of their right to vote.

Earlier, the Election Commission of India (ECI) had informed the High Court that prisoners do not have voting rights under the Representation of People Act.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sfasc2/article30805437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL13-HC2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/high-court-dismisses-petition-seeking-voting-rights-for-prisoners/article30805438.ece
258,2020/02/13,Man held for robbing ₹1.5L from bank,"Scooter used by accused helps police nab him

In a daylight robbery, a masked man entered a public sector bank in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar on Wednesday and robbed ₹1.5 lakh at gunpoint. However, he was arrested a few hours after the incident, said the police.

The accused, Pankaj Narang, is a resident of Tilak Nagar, they said.

When the bank opened for regular business, the masked man, wearing a black jacket, entered the building and overpowered the security guard. He took away his gun, threatened the bank staff and demanded ₹1.5 lakh. Fearing for his life, cashier Jaiprakash gave him the money. He escaped from the spot in a scooter with the gun, a police officer said.

During probe, police found the gun on the roadside. CCTV footage from the bank and nearby areas were scanned. The scooter used by the accused led the police to his doorstep.

The scooter used in the commissioning of crime and money looted from the bank have been recovered from the accused, the police added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/man-held-for-robbing-15l-from-bank/article30805428.ece
259,2020/02/13,Foreign currencies worth ₹45L seized from Dubai-bound flier,"It was concealed in cooked meat pieces, peanuts and eatables

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officials have seized foreign currencies worth ₹45 lakh hidden in cooked meat pieces, peanuts and biscuit packets from a passenger at the Delhi airport, officials said on Wednesday.

The unique modus operandi of currency smuggling came to light on Tuesday evening when the security personnel intercepted a passenger, Murad Ali, at Terminal-3 of the Indira Gandhi International Airport over his “suspicious” behaviour. He was there to board an Air India flight to Dubai.

“Upon checking the passengers’ baggage, high volume of foreign currencies were found concealed in cooked mutton pieces, peanuts, biscuit packets and other eatables,” CISF spokesperson Assistant Inspector General Hemendra Singh said.

“This is a unique and peculiar way of concealing foreign currency for smuggling,” Mr. Singh said.

A video of the interception provided by the force showed the security personnel cracking peanuts, unzipping sealed biscuit packets and digging into oily meat pieces to extract an assortment of Saudi Riyal, Qatari Riyal, Kuwaiti Dinar, Omani Riyal and Euro rolled and wrapped neatly inside.

The estimated worth of the seized cache is ₹45 lakh and the passenger has been handed over to the customs authorities for further investigation, the CISF spokesperson said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1q2pon/article30805408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL13-PEANUTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/foreign-currencies-worth-45l-seized-from-dubai-bound-flier/article30805409.ece
260,2020/02/13,Pleas in High Court challenge Central Vista project,"Court issues notice to Centre and Delhi Development Authority seeking their response within 2 weeks

In a first major legal hurdle to the redevelopment of the Central Vista project, the Delhi High Court has taken cognisance of two separate petitions which raised common issues on the changes, including land-use, proposed by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).

Justice Rajiv Shakdher issued notices to the Centre and the DDA and sought their response within two weeks. The court also directed the DDA to approach it before taking a decision to notify the proposed changes in Master Plan Delhi 2020-21.

Eight new government office buildings, a new Parliament House and a residential complex near the South Block that could house the homes of the Prime Minister and the Vice-President are among the projects under consideration for the redevelopment of the Central Vista.

One of the petitioners, Rajeev Suri, has asserted that there is change in land-use in as much as the green areas which is described as “recreational”. District Park is proposed to house the new government house. Mr. Suri’s plea claimed that the DDA has relied upon 2001 Zonal Development Plan in respect of the proposed changes. His plea contended that the alterations which are proposed will involve the change of land-use and standards of population density.

“Such a change in land use will deprive Delhi of its most iconic Central Vista, steeped in historicity and known for pomp and pageantry of the Republic of India,” the plea said, claiming that the DDA is not vested with the requisite power to bring about such changes,

The second petition by Lt. Col. Anuj Srivastava (Retd.) and others challenges the public hearing which was held subsequently terming it as a “mere formality”. The DDA had invited comments or objections for the change of land use for the project. In the petition,he argued that about 1,292 objections were submitted to the DDA out of which 200 objections were dealt with summarily.

The plea pointed out that “extremely short notice” was issued to the parties for the public hearing.

“A one-day notice for public hearing does not allow people to make arrangements to be present at the public hearing,” the plea said. It said about 1,292 people were called for hearing within a few hours over just two days during the middle of the week. It submitted that 200 people were called within time slots of just an hour, rendering any public hearing completely “meaningless and impractical”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pleas-in-high-court-challenge-central-vista-project/article30805404.ece
261,2020/02/13,Family of five found dead at their home,"Bodies were badly decomposed and sent for post-mortem; police register case of murder

Decomposed bodies of an e-rickshaw driver, his wife and three children were found inside their house in north-east Delhi’s Bhajanpura area under mysterious circumstances on Wednesday morning, police said.

The deceased have been identified as Shambhu Chaudhary (43), Sunita (37), Shivam (17), Sachin (14) and Komal (12).

Ved Prakash Surya, DCP (North East), said the bodies have decomposed so badly that injuries, if any, are not visible. “We have registered an FIR under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC at Bhajanpura police station. The case is under investigation. We have requested a medical board to conduct post-mortem examination,” he said.

Police said they received information at 11.16 a.m. from neighbours, who complained of a foul smell emanating from the house. A police team reached the location and found the door locked from outside. The team broke open the door and found the five decomposed bodies.

“The bodies of the husband and wife were in one room and those of the three children in the other. The family used to live in two rooms located on the ground floor of the house. The building has two entrances. The main entrance was locked from outside while the door of the other was bolted from inside,” said a police officer.

Joint Commissioner of Police (East) Alok Kumar said it is too early to pinpoint the reason of death. “The cause of death will be ascertained after the autopsy,” he said.

A forensic team is inspecting the rooms. Mr. Kumar said the police are trying to recover the mobile phone used by Shambhu. “He was the only one in the family using it. We have not recovered any weapon from the house. It was also not ransacked. No note has been recovered from the spot,” he said.

Preliminary investigation has revealed that Shambhu used to own a juice stall earlier but closed it and bought an e-rickshaw to earn his livelihood. He took the house on rent around five months ago. “He hailed from Supaul district in Bihar,” said the DCP.

Srikant Sharma, a neighbour, said he sensed something was wrong because of the foul smell. “Some people thought it was coming from the sewer but I was sure that the smell emanated from the house,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/7ah17/article30805401.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL13-BHAJAN2-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/family-of-five-found-dead-at-their-home/article30805402.ece

Sanjeev Chawla, who was allegedly involved in a cricket betting scandal, will be extradited to India from London on Thursday.

A police officer confirmed that the London Police will handover Chawla to the Delhi Police at the Heathrow airport on Wednesday night. He is expected to arrive at the Delhi airport at 11.30 a.m.

This would mark the first high-profile extradition of its kind to India and will add a feather in the cap of Delhi Police.

An officer in the rank of Deputy Commissioner of Police and an Inspector-rank officer, who is also the investigating officer in the case, left for London on Tuesday night.

Legal formalities over

“The paperwork and other legal formalities have been completed and he will be handed over to Delhi Police on Wednesday late night,” said the officer.

The officer added that Chawla will be taken to Tihar jail and will be kept as per the Indian government’s assurances to the U.K. court.

Tihar jail authorities said that Chawla will be treated as any other prisoner and the concerns raised by him will be addressed. He will be kept in a separate cell as he had prominently raised concerns over his safety and security in the India jail.

Chawla was allegedly involved in a match-fixing scandal that was busted by Delhi Police in 2000, and involved former South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje.

265,2020/02/13,‘Tiwari offered to step down but party told him to wait’,"State BJP chief contacted senior leadership of the party on Tuesday evening, claim sources

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit chief Manoj Tiwari has offered to step down in the wake of the drubbing received by it in the Delhi Assembly polls, but has been asked by its national leadership to hang on, party insiders said on Wednesday.

The North East Delhi MP, who met the eight BJP legislators who managed to win the elections, had contacted the party’s senior leadership on Tuesday evening, said sources. “Mr. Tiwari has offered his resignation but was asked to hang on for the moment,” said a party insider privy to the development.

Tiwari contradicts

Mr. Tiwari, however, told PTI: “Neither have I been asked to resign nor have I offered my resignation.”

“The party’s State unit will be overhauled as part of a national exercise soon. Sunil Yadav, who contested against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and Ravinder Singh Negi, who fought a tough election against Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, are likely to get responsibilities as part of a national team,” claimed another source in the party.

Meanwhile, the newly elected BJP MLAs held a meeting with Mr. Tiwari at the State unit headquarters.

Congratulating all the newly elected MLAs on their victory, Mr. Tiwari said that the party respected the mandate given by the people of Delhi and hoped that those who have got the chance to run the government “meet the expectations of the people”.

“During the Assembly elections, BJP workers worked hard due to which the BJP has won more seats and the vote percentage has also increased. The people of Delhi have given a mandate to the party to play the role of Opposition. We will strongly raise the problems of Delhi in the House and play the role of a responsible Opposition,” Mr. Tiwari added.

266,2020/02/13,"Congress appoints interim Delhi in-charge; Chacko, Chopra resign","They had taken responsibility for party’s dismal performance

A day after the Congress put up a miserable performance in the Delhi Assembly elections failing once again to win a single seat, Congress president Sonia Gandhi accepted the resignation of State AICC in-charge P.C. Chacko and Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra.

The senior leaders had taken moral responsibility for the party’s performance.

“Congress president has accepted the resignations with immediate effect,” read a communication from the AICC. It added that Shakti Sinh Gohil has been appointed the interim AICC in-charge of Delhi along with his present assignment of Bihar.

‘Downfall began in 2013’

Mr. Chacko’s resignation was accepted hours after a statement of his created a controversy. In an interview to news agency ANI, he reportedly said that the downfall of the Congress started in 2013 when former CM Sheila Dikshit lost power to AAP.

Several Congress leaders, including former Mumbai Congress chief Milind Deora, party spokesperson Pawan Khera, senior party leader Anand Sharma criticised Mr. Chacko’s comments.

“Shiela ji was a popular leader and Chief Minister for three consecutive terms. The credit of building Delhi’s infrastructure goes to her. She can not be blamed for losing an election after long incumbency. She is fondly remembered by the people and the entire @INCIndia family. Disrespecting her memory is unacceptable,” Mr. Sharma tweeted.

Voices from within the party also questioned its performance with AICC national spokesperson and Delhi Mahila Congress president Sharmistha Mukherjee asking whether the party should “close shop” if it had decided that others would take on the BJP across the country.

Replying to a tweet by P. Chidambaram, who welcomed AAP’s win as “defeat of bluff and bluster”, Ms. Mukherjee asked: “With due respect sir, just want to know- has @INCIndiaoutsourced the task of defeating BJP to State parties? If not, then why r we gloating over AAP victory rather than being concerned abt our drubbing? And if ‘yes’, then we [PCCs] might as well close shop! [sic].”

The former Finance Minister had tweeted: “AAP won, bluff and bluster lost. The people of Delhi, who are from all parts of India, have defeated the polarising, divisive and dangerous agenda of the BJP I salute the people of Delhi who have set an example to other states that will hold their elections in 2021 and 2022 [sic.]”

Ms. Mukherjee has been vocal since the party’s defeat on Tuesday, saying that the time for introspection was over and it was time for action. “BJP playing divisive politics, Kejriwal playing ‘smart politics’ and what r we doing? Can we honestly say that we’ve done all to put our house in order?” Ms. Mukherjee said, adding that the Congress was busy capturing Congress whereas other parties were capturing India.

267,2020/02/13,MLAs with criminal cases have nearly doubled from 2015: ADR,"61% of newly elected MLAs declared criminal cases as opposed to 34% in 2015

The seventh Delhi Assembly, which was elected on Tuesday, will have almost double the number of MLAs who have declared criminal cases against them compared to the sixth Assembly that was elected in 2015.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) won 62 out of the 70 seats while the BJP won the remaining eight seats. In 2015, AAP had won 67 seats and the BJP had got three.

According to an analysis by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), 43 out of the 70 newly elected MLAs, or 61%, have declared criminal cases.

After the 2015 Assembly elections, 34%, or 24 out of 70 MLAs, had declared criminal cases, stated the report by the ADR.

The number of MLAs who declared serious criminal cases, including crimes against women, murder, assault and corruption, has jumped from 14, or 20% of the total, in 2015, to 37, or 53%, in the newly-elected Assembly, the ADR added.

Of the 62 AAP MLAs, 38, or 61%, have declared criminal cases against themselves in their election affidavits.

Five of the eight BJP MLAs, or 63%, declared criminal cases against themselves, the ADR added.

Nine of the newly elected Delhi MLAs declared convictions in various cases.

Rich legislators

In terms of their financial backgrounds, 74% of the newly elected MLAs declared assets of over ₹1 crore, an increase from 63% in 2015. This time, 73% of AAP MLAs and 88% of BJP MLAs declared assets of over ₹1 crore. The average assets of MLAs increased from ₹6.29 crore in 2015 to ₹14.29 crore now.

Three AAP MLAs were the ones with the highest assets, with Mundka MLA Dharampal Lakra declaring assets worth ₹292 crore, followed by R.K. Puram MLA Parmila Tokas, who declared ₹80 crore in assets, and Patel Nagar MLA Raaj Kumar Anand who declared ₹78 crore in assets, the ADR report stated.

A total of 42 out of 70 MLAs, or 60%, declared educational qualification of graduation and above; and 56%, or 39 out of 70 candidates, are aged between 25 and 50 years.

268,2020/02/13,Ten arrested for ‘molesting’ Gargi College students,"Accused are students of DU, private universities: police

Ten people were arrested on Wednesday in connection with the alleged molestation of Gargi College students by a group of men who had gatecrashed a cultural festival on campus last week.

Over 11 police teams were looking at technical details and also visited various sites in NCR in connection with identification of the suspects and investigation of the case, said the police.

Several other people are being questioned and multiple suspects have been identified, they added.

“We examined footage of 33 CCTVs installed on the college premises. In three CCTVs, we found that a large group of youth pushed a catering van to damage the gate. After the gate was damaged, they all rushed in by climbing over the barricades and started molesting women,” said a police officer.

Atul Thakur, DCP (South), said that the arrested persons are from various colleges of Delhi University and other private universities in NCR. The accused are in the age group of 18 to 25 years.

“Investigation is still on and more people will be arrested. We identified the arrested persons with the help of CCTV footage,” he added.

The incident came to light after some students of Delhi University’s Gargi College took to social media to narrate their unpleasant experiences during a college fest on February 6 and alleged that security personnel did nothing to control the unruly groups.

A police officer said that a famous singer was about to perform in the college where around 5,000 students had gathered. The college authorities had not informed the local police station about the event, he added.

Delhi Police registered a case on February 10 after it received a complaint from the college authorities.

A case had been registered at the Hauz Khas police station under IPC Sections 452 (House-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention).

Protest continues

Meanwhile, college students boycotted classes for the third consecutive day on Wednesday. They are demanding strict action against the intruders and resignation of principal Promila Kumar. A fact-finding committee comprising faculty as well as students has begun gathering testimonies and is expected to release its findings on Saturday.

269,2020/02/13,"Police stomped on us, hurled abuses at us: Jamia students","DCP denies allegations, says no force used against anti-CAA protesters on Feb. 10

At least 20 students from the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) on Wednesday alleged that they were brutally beaten up by security personnel, stomped on, and harassed with communal slurs during an attempt to march to Parliament from Jamia Millia Islamia on Monday to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Denying the charges, DCP (South-East) R.P. Meena said: “All allegations levelled against us are untrue. The entire protest has been videographed by us. In fact, some of our men were manhandled and they received injuries during the scuffle. No force was used against the protesters.”

Recalling the day’s events, the students said that during the rally, as hundreds of protesters started to march, authorities deployed multiple lines of security personnel near Holy Family Hospital. Barricading had also been set up, they added.

“The students had not seen the barricades behind the scores of police and paramilitary personnel, and initially thought that they would be allowed through. But when we started moving forward, the police force showed their true colours. Since there were many media personnel around, the police used a new strategy. They hit us with their boots, with their knees, and the hooks of their batons” a student, who was injured in the protest, said.

A resident of Jamia Nagar who took part in the rally said that when she climbed on to a barricade to help her friends, “a male police officer pulled my hair”. She also alleged that women police officers pushed her off the barricade. “I fell on the feet of a few policemen, whom I even identified later. They hit me. They kicked me multiple times, which led to a hairline fracture on my third rib,” she added.

The protester was later admitted to ICU at Al Shahfa for a day.

Other protesters also complained of being beaten up by the security personnel and being harassed with communal slurs. “They were targeting us,” said another woman protester.

Abu Darbha said his clothes were torn and security personnel kicked him in the face, dragged him across a barricade and even hit him using a grenade launcher while hurling abuses at him.

Protesters said that up to 60 people were injured in the incident. Twelve students were reportedly admitted in the ICU, Jamia panel members added.

The protesters on Wednesday said they had tried several times to get police permission for the march. They even tried reaching out to several top officials but were denied.

They claimed that they were being targeted by the police, with individual students being “isolated” and threatened.

The JCC also appealed to the police to grant them permission to take out a march from the campus to a destination of their choice at least once in the next 15 days.

270,2020/02/13,Man held over shooting at AAP MLA convoy in Delhi,"Party worker killed when a gang shot at an AAP MLA’s car.

The Delhi Police arrested one of the accused within a few hours after a group of assailants allegedly fired at the open car of Naresh Yadav, Aam Aadmi Party MLA for Mehrauli, on Tuesday.

A party volunteer was killed and another injured in the shooting on Aruna Asif Ali Road when Mr. Yadav was returning home from a temple following his victory in the election, the police said.

Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (South West) Ingit Pratap Singh on Wednesday identified the arrested person as Dharamvir, alias Kalu

A country-made pistol and two live cartridges were recovered from him. “Several police teams have been formed to arrest the suspects. We have identified all persons who were with Dharamvir during the incident. The hunt is on for the two other accused,” Mr. Singh said.

At 11.16 p.m. on Tuesday, the police received a call at the control room from Fortis Hospital in Vasant Kunj about the admission of two persons with gunshot injuries.

“Ashok Maan, 45, was admitted with gunshot injuries, but doctors declared him brought dead. Harindar was admitted with gunshot injuries in the right thigh, and he is under treatment. Both are from Kishangarh and distant relatives,” Mr. Singh said.

Investigation revealed that the assailants were known to the victim. The complainant (the injured man) had said the three had threatened Ashok Maan 15 days ago over petty quarrels, which were never reported to the police. In November 2019, a First Information Report for attempt to murder was registered at the Vasant Kunj (North) station after the son of one of the accused was allegedly shot and injured by an acquaintance of Ashok Maan.

Meanwhile, an AAP insider said the party would focus on strengthening the organisation beyond Delhi, and the government would focus on governance in Delhi.

‘Take a pledge’

A meeting of the party’s national executive will be called within a month of the oath-taking ceremony to decide on plans for elections in other States, he said. AAP spokesperson Jasmine Shah said the party had received five lakh missed calls to a number announced on Tuesday for the people to be part of the AAP for “nation-building”.

He said the party’s focus would be on keeping its promises, and the Delhi municipality election in 2022.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said, “...I appeal to the people of Delhi to reach [the venue] in large numbers and give him [Mr. Kejriwal] your love and blessings. I appeal to the people to take a pledge... that we all will take Delhi above politics of hatred and make Delhi a model of development, where education, health, water and electricity will form the core of politics.”

But Mr. Sisodia did not reveal who will be part of the Cabinet. However, the party has “decided to retain the present Cabinet as it considers the mandate as a vote for continuity,” a party insider said.

Calling the victory a bumper win, Mr. Sisodia said, “Today, patriotism’s meaning is to provide good healthcare for everyone in the country. Today, the meaning of nationalism is to give affordable electricity, water, and security to women. And the people of Delhi have approved this type of politics...”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ujf4hg/article30804777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13TH-SISODIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/man-held-over-shooting-at-aap-mla-convoy-in-delhi/article30804778.ece
271,2020/02/13,Decoding manuscripts on mathematics,"The K.V. Sarma Research Foundation has an excellent collection, which includes ancient texts and commentaries

Writing about the significance of the Hindu numeral system, Keith Devlin of Stanford University and a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, points out that it is much easier to read symbolic expressions and know what a number means, than to read a description in words. He quotes a study conducted by experimental psychologists, where brain lesions were found to have destroyed number and language capacities. “This demonstrated that our brains store numbers along with — and arguably through — symbols that represent them. Our sense of numbers depends on symbols. The modern symbolic notation for numbers is the world’s only truly universal language,” he says. And it was India that gave the world this universal language.

A look at Indian contributions to mathematics shows the richness of the scientific tradition in India. Even the word ‘sine’ has its etymological origin in India. Indian mathematicians used the term caapa or dhanus for the arc, and jyaa or jeevaa, for the chord. When the Arabs picked up these concepts, jeevaa became jiba. Europeans mistook jiba for jaib, an Arab word which means an opening in a garment at the chest. Europeans translated jaib to the Latin “sinus,” which means chest. Sinus became sine!

In 2016, Donald Knuth, in a speech at Stanford University, while talking of the Knight’s tour problem, drew attention to the works of Rudrata, Ratnakara, Bhoja, and to Someswara’s Manasollasa and Vedanta Desika’s Paduka Sahasram. Knuth said that his “major failing as a teacher” was that he was not able to get a single one of his 28 Ph.D. students to realise “what a thrill it was to work on source material.”

And if not for manuscript libraries how can one get source material? Dr. M.D. Srinivas, retired professor of Theoretical Physics, Madras University, is Vice-President of the K.V. Sarma Research Foundation, which has an excellent collection of manuscripts. In an interview, Srinivas threw light on the ancient Indian mathematical tradition. Excerpts:

Can you give an approximate date when a written symbol for zero originated?

The concept of zero is present in the notion of lopa in Panini’s Ashtadhyayi (prior to 5th century BCE). Pingala (prior to 3rd century BCE) mentions the symbol for zero — ‘rupe shunyam.’

What would be the earliest date for the Indian place value system?

You find decimal place value nomenclature for numbers in the Vedas, which speak a number as a place value. Aryabhatiya (499 C.E.) gives all the rules for calculations in a decimal place value system. In 30-odd verses, Aryabhatta covers most of high school maths taught today and more. Epigraphs show the use of decimal place value notation from the 6th century onwards in India and South East Asia.

One criticism against Indian mathematics is that there are no proofs. Did we use reductio ad absurdum?

Much of modern scholarship on Indian mathematics dealt with only the original works, but not the commentaries, and this led to the misconception that we had no proofs. Bhaskaracharya I, Bhaskaracharya II, Nilakantha Somasutvan, Ganesa Daivajna, Muniswara and Kamalakara wrote commentaries for their own works, and in the commentaries, we find upapattis (demonstrations) of the results discussed in the original text. Govindaswamin (800C.E.) gives upapattis in his work. Bhaskaracharya II in his Siddhantasiromani, says without upapattis or proofs, a mathematician will not be respected in an assembly of scholars. Nor will he be free from doubts. Ganesha Daivajna says upapattis are needed for buddhi vriddhi - elevation of the intellect.

Indian logicians did not consider reductio ad absurdum, known as tarka, to be an independent means of valid knowledge. They occasionally used it to prove the non-existence of something. Krishna Daivajna used it to show that a negative number has no square root among the known numbers. But Indians never used this method for proving the existence of an entity, whose existence could not be established by any other direct method. They followed a constructivist approach to the existence of mathematical objects.

How many source texts in maths and astronomy have been translated/ analysed? How many source texts remain to be translated from manuscripts?

American scholar David Pingree, who published several volumes of Census of Exact Sciences in Sanskrit, estimated jyotish sastra manuscripts alone to be around 100, 000. Of these at least 30,000 pertain to mathematics/astronomy, and these in turn are associated with roughly 9,000 source works on astronomy and mathematics in Sanskrit. During the last two and a half centuries, 450 source works on mathematics/astronomy have been edited. Of these only 95 source works have been translated and analysed for their technical content.

At least 190 well-known source works are yet to be edited and published. Looking at the bibliographies of David Pingree and K.V. Sarma, we know that manuscripts for these are available. But this is merely indicative of the huge corpus of source works on mathematics/astronomy which are available, but are yet to be studied.

Tribute to scholarship

Krishna Venkateswara Sarma was born in Chenagnnur, Kerala in December 1919. Graduating in Physics and Chemistry, he did his Masters in Sanskrit. He worked for some years in the Manuscripts section of the Kerala University Oriental Research Institute. Later he worked in Madras University’s Sanskrit department, Visveshvarananand Institute of Indological studies, Hoshiarpur, and Adyar library. In 1997, he established the Sree Sarada Education Society and Research centre. He published a survey of Sanskrit manuscripts on sciences found in repositories in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where he listed over 450 Sanskrit works on Mathematics and Astronomy from Kerala. Sarma’s grandson — Dr. S.A.S. Sarma is continuing the work on surveying manuscript repositories.

Prof Siniruddha Dash

Sarma copied out manuscripts in the possession of various families in Kerala. His monumental efforts resulted in a collection of 900 manuscripts, of which about 400 are on astronomy. “Some of his early publications were Grahacaranibandhana of Haridatta, Siddhantadarpana of Nilakantha, Venvaaroha of Madhava, Goladipika and Grahanashtaka of Parameswara. While at Hoshiarpur, he published more than 50 books, mostly on Kerala astronomy, like Parameswara’s Digganita, Golasara of Nilakantha, Tantrasangraha of Nilakantha with the commentaries Yuktidipika and Laghuvivritti of Sankara,” says Dr. M.S. Sriram, retired Professor of Physics, Madras University, and President of K.V. Sarma Research Foundation. Sarma published more than 20 important source works of Kerala mathematicians and astronomers. He brought out 104 books and 450 research papers.

K.V. Sarma Research Foundation was established in 2010, in memory of Sarma’s scholarship, and it houses his manuscripts collection. Prof. Siniruddha Dash, former Head of the department of Sanskrit, Madras University, is the director of the Foundation. Dash has edited two volumes of articles by K.V. Sarma, who had translated Jyesthadeva’s mathematical and astronomical treatise in Malayalam — Ganita Yuktibahsa (1530 CE). Sarma wanted the translation to be supplemented by explanations, diagrams and notations. So, he roped in Dr. M.S. Sriram. Dr. K. Ramasubramanian of IIT Bombay and Dr. M.D. Srinivas. The book, published in 2008, has a foreword by mathematician Dr. C. S. Seshadri and was released at the Chennai Mathematical Institute, and Fields medallist Dr. Mumford was present during the release.

K.V.Sarma

Dr. Mamata, secretary and managing trustee of the Foundation, is working on Laghumanasa, a commentary by Suryadevayajvan on Munjala’s Laghumanasa. Dr. Rama Kalyani is doing an English translation of Buddhivilasini, a commentary on Lilavati. Dash is guiding Prabha Rajagopal, with a Survey of Lexicons on different subjects available in Pali, Prakrit and Sanskrit. All three projects are funded by the TATA Trust. Awaiting publication are some translations and explanatory books — Lagnaprakarana of Madhava, Panchabodha with Sankara Variar’s commentary, Drkkarana, Selected Works of Parameswara, and Selected Works of Puthumana Somayaji. Aditya Kolachana, K.Mahesh, Venkateswara Pai, Veena Bhat and Dinesh Mohan Joshi, have collaborated with Sriram and Ramasubramanian on these texts.

Stressing the importance of preservation of manuscripts, Dash says, “The more manuscripts of a work a scholar refers to, the more authentic is his research. Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute in Pune collected 4,500 manuscripts of the Mahabharata from all over India. Of these, they used 734 to come up with a critical edition. The TV serial ‘Mahabharata’ was based on this edition, and may therefore said to be an authentic version of the Itihasa.”",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/m5j5do/article30809670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14FRSARMA5,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/decoding-manuscripts-on-mathematics/article30809672.ece
272,2020/02/13,Exclusive Thirumurai Thevaram patashala in Chidambaram,"For young Saivite scholars, the exclusive Thirumurai Patashala in Chidambaram, is a boon

While Veda Patashalas have sprung up across the State in recent years, there has been a dearth of Thirumurai Patashalas. Currently there are only 120 odhuvars, who have graduated through the five-year Gurukulam model of Thirumurai education, a number that is less than half of the 274 Padal Petra Sthalams, hailed by Saivite saint-poets.

Historically, the kings revered odhuvars and ackonwledged their significant contribution. Under royal patronage, the odhuvars gained prominence. However, over the years, low income and cutting down on provisions that were once handed out in large quantities, the number of odhuvars began dwindling drastically. Most of the new generation odhuvars prefer the three- year course offered by music schools as against the traditional gurukulam model of the Thevaram Patashalas.

Fifteen years ago, S. Manivasagan, an entrepreneur from Chennai, was captivated by the Tirumurai rendition of the odhuvars and decided to contribute towards the betterment of the community.

Trust for odhuvars

He formed the Aalavai Annal Trust to help the odhuvars, especially those attached to temples in remote areas.

As a first step, Manivasagan brought together odhuvars from across the State to participate in kumbabishekams. He also got them to render the sacred verses during temple processions, particularly during Brahmotsavams.

With an aim to preserve the tradition, Manivasagan started the Thirumurai Patashala six years ago in Chidambaram. He roped in Muthukumaran Odhuvar, who had been at the Madurai Meenakshi temple for over a decade, to be a member of the Trust. Sivakumar Odhuvar, who is at the Mayuranathar temple, Mayiladuthurai, joined the Thirumurai Patashala as the Acharya.

For the last six years, the Trust has been busy choosing interested candidates and initiating them into Tirumurai. The day at the patashala starts at 5 a.m. and ends at 9.30 p.m. Interested students have to undergo a voice test before seeking admission.

Every Margazhi, a group of 20 students are taken on a ten-day trip to the Padal Petra Sthalams, where they recite the relevant verses sung by the saint-poets.

Muthukumaran Odhuvar says that there are great opportunities awaiting young odhuvars. “Earlier, there were many odhuvars at ancient Thevaram temples and they were given immense prominence. But now as most of the Padal Petra Sthalams do not have even one odhuvar, efforts are being made to revive this beautiful tradition by offering training.”

Muthukumaran Odhuvar

Nagaswaram recital, chanting of Vedas and geetham were part of daily rituals in temples, of which the Tirumurai presentation by the odhuvars was an important component.

Muthukumaran Odhuvar is hopeful that the HR & CE Department will appoint odhuvars at Padal Petra Sthalams and bring back this traditional practise.

At an event held in December, odhuvars from across the state gathered to celebrate the inauguration of the biggest Thirumurai Patashala, near the historical Ilamaiyaakinar temple in Chidambaram.

The CBI, in a counter affidavit filed before Justice G. Sridevi bench of Telangana High Court, opposing 11 writ petitions filed by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, said that Mr. Reddy cannot seek exemption from court appearance by virtue of his position as Chief Minister.

If exemption was granted to him, the likelihood of influencing the witnesses cannot be ruled out, the CBI authorities stated in the affidavit. They recalled that in the past the HC had dismissed Mr. Reddy’s petitions filed with similar prayer. They said that it was close to eight years since the first charge-sheet was filed against Mr. Reddy. The last of the 11 charge-sheets was filed nearly six years ago. Yet, the trial had not yet begun in those cases, they stated. Mr. Reddy was attempting to be above the law by seeking exemption from court appearance despite being accused of complicity in serious financial crimes.

It would not be difficult for him to travel from Vijayawada to Hyderabad in the backdrop of availability of modern transport systems to appear before the court once a week. The CBI officials said that Mr. Reddy had cited the example of Dalmia, who was granted exemption from court appearances by the Supreme Court, in this petitions.

275,2020/02/13,Playing mentor to talented underprivileged children,"Gnana Saraswathi Foundation offers free residential facility every year to give special and focused coaching

It is not due to lack of talent and merit that keeps many promising students from poor and underprivileged sections from doing well in life but lack of resources and exposure to garner opportunities at the right time to make their mark in this competitive world.

Yet an individual, Sada Venkat Reddy, made it his mission to spot the talented students from government schools and offer free residential camp facility for 45 days in a year to give them that special and focused coaching, conducive academic ambience and motivate them to do well despite their economic and social backwardness.

Over 530 government schools in Rangareddy, Vikarabad, Medchal, Nalgonda and Mahbubnagar districts recommend three students each for the residential camp. Among them, 300 students are selected through a written test every year. Permission is taken from the District Education Officer for the students to attend the camp and the State government sends its resource persons and government teachers to take classes.

For the rest of the time, Gnana Saraswathi Foundation’s (GSF) team of volunteers and mentors guide the children.

Many of the students who attended the camp since 2011 did well and pursued higher education.

Mr. Venkat Reddy (45), a post-graduate and social worker, made this possible for the poor students of government schools by setting up GSF in 2008 with the help of donors who contribute their mite. “I started organising camps for rural students in three categories - sports, academics and cultural (SAC) activities. The students are selected through competitive test for different categories based on their area of interest.”

About 200 to 300 volunteers and experts in various fields offer their free services to GSF to run the residential camps.

Mr. Reddy’s goal is to give 1,000 talented students from underprivileged sections to society every year in these categories and help them achieve their goals.

What motivated him to choose this service activity of helping government school students?

Mostly children of weaker sections and daily wagers attend government schools. If not for the generous teachers and mentors who spotted the brilliance of B.R. Ambedkar and Abdul Kalam Azad when they were students and gave them opportunities to excel, the nation would not have realised their worth and benefited from their immense contribution to the nation.

“Who knows what these students can achieve and give back to society if given right opportunities and support,” is his conviction.

Involved with ongoing ‘Lakshyam’ residental camp for SSC students, an annual affair for 45 days for government school students, ahead of their public examination at the peaceful Sadhana Kuteer at Vinobhanagar, Ibrahimpatnam in Rangareddy, he said the land was leased to run the residential camps.

The residential camps for sports and cultural events are organised for 45 days in a year but in three or four spells coinciding with the school vacation.

277,2020/02/13,Andhra IPS officer moves CAT over suspension order,"Seeks release of salary, benefits withheld by government

Senior IPS officer of Andhra Pradesh cadre A.B. Venkateswara Rao moved the Central Administrative Tribunal here on Thursday, challenging the suspension order issued by AP government on February 8.

Observing that his suspension was in violation of Rule 3 of All India Service (Discipline and Appeal)-Rules of 1969, Mr. Rao requested the tribunal to set it aside. He submitted to the tribunal that AP government had withheld his salary and other monetary benefits since May 31, 2019 and appealed to the tribunal to instruct the government to release the same.

While the suspension order violated principles of natural justice, withholding salary and other monetary benefits was not only arbitrary but also deprivation of fundamental rights, the petitioner said. Mr. Rao, who worked as Chief of AP Intelligence wing in the rank of Additional Director General of Police, was promoted as DGP on March 10, 2019 and posted as Anti-Corruption Bureau Director General 10 days later.

On May 30, 2019, he was transferred and directed to report to the General Administration Department. Mr. Rao stated that complying with the order, he reported to GAD the next day. He stated in the petition that the government did not post him anywhere thereafter. Salary was also not paid. The transfer and withholding of salary coincided with the change of guard in the State government, the petitioner said.

He submitted to the tribunal that he had given two written representations to the government on January 6, 2020 and January 28, 2020 asking for posting and release of salary. On February 8, (which was a holiday being a second Saturday), the government issued the order suspending him. Mr. Rao stated that he downloaded the order from the government website.

The order stated that Mr. Rao was involved in the process of procuring security equipment which was a serious misconduct. Noting that procurement of equipment was only an incident of service, the officer said the procurement was done in compliance with the procedures and subject to financial clearance by the department concerned.

He submitted to the tribunal that he was suspended due to political reasons, personal bias and malafide intentions and without finding any prima facie evidence in the allegations made against him.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/andhra-ips-officer-moves-cat-over-suspension-order/article30813680.ece

279,2020/02/13,"Tapping solar power, 13 railway stations go ‘energy neutral’","SCR anticipating generation of around 1.3 lakh units annually from SPV panels

South Central Railway (SCR) has become the first on Indian Railways to come up with the concept of ‘Energy Neutral’ railway stations, capable of meeting 100% energy requirements by tapping natural solar power through Solar Photo Voltaic (SPV) panels commissioned on about13 station buildings.

Energy neutral stations are: Ghatkesar (Secunderabad - Bibinagar section), Dharur (Secunderabad - Vikarabad), Raghunathpalli (Secunderabad - Kazipet), Mellacheruvu (Motumari - Vishnupuram), Ontimitta (Kadapa - Renigunta), Guntakal, Kadiyam (Rajamundhry - Duvvada), Vijayawada, Dwarapudi, Godavari (Nidadavolu-Rajamundhry), Dharmabad (Nizamabad - Mudkhed), Hyderabad, Sivungaon, Umri, Karkheli & Bolsa.

Eco-friendly concept

Senior officials informed that a railway health unit service building at Parli Vaijnath under Secunderabad division in Maharashtra is also in the same category. This eco-friendly concept is based on the principle of developing railway station buildings with total solar power tapping capabilities commensurate to exact load requirements of those particular stations.

This is done by installation of SPV panels on the rooftops which are integrated with the on-grid (or) off-grid solar energy plants to derive power supply to the entire station. The total capacity of solar panels installed at the 13 ‘energy neutral’ stations is 99 kWp with the cost incurred, being around ₹50 lakh.

The anticipated energy generation from these stations comes to around 1.3 lakh units annually and it is expected that solar power will also lead to savings of ₹13 lakh each year. In addition, the generation of clean solar energy will help reduce carbon footprints to the tune of 1,170 tonnes per annum, they explained.

All the power needs of 13 stations like lighting, fans, pumps and other electrical appliances are met through the solar energy generated and this is bringing down the net traditional energy consumption at these stations to zero, said senior officials said.

SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya said special focus is on environment protection measures and so far 8.2MWp solar power plants, 1.75 KWp solar hybrid plants, 2.18 lakhs LPD solar water heating, 570 kWp water pumping and 52 KW equivalent day pipe light system in offices were commissioned.

Since the zone is located in a hot terrain, the climatic conditions should be tapped abundantly for solar energy and more stations should be brought into the ‘energy neutral’ conditions, he told his senior officials in a recent meeting.

The ‘Solar Roof’ for Kamareddi on booking office (Hyderabad division) and ‘solar cover over platform’ at Vijayawada station where the roof was designed incorporating SPV panels are innovations worth getting replicated in other zones, added CPRO Ch.

288,2020/02/13,100 vacancies less in Civils notification,"796 vacancies for positions in 24 services this year

As widely expected, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has released the notification for Civil Services 2020 exam with 100 vacancies lesser than last year.

The notification has been issued for 796 vacancies for positions in 24 services this year as against 896 positions last year. In fact, fewer vacancies were expected with the government now focussing on lateral entry in the Civil Services with an argument that it would prefer experts of various kinds in the administration.

Down trend

In fact, the down trend in vacancies is not new and has been seen in the last four years. Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh had in fact agreed in RS that the vacancies were down.

In 2015 only, 1,164 vacancies were notified followed by 1,029 in 2016 and 980 in 2017. The number reduced further to 782 in 2018. But, it saw a slight increase to 896 last year.

The two Telugu States are likely to see 80,000 aspirants taking a shot at the exam going by the previous trends. At the all-India level, about 8 lakh candidates are likely to apply. But generally just about 50% of candidates actually appear for the examination.

72 centres for Prelims

There are 72 centres for Prelims on May 31, of which six are in Telangana and AP — Anantapur, Hyderabad, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Warangal.

Civil Services trainers say candidates should exercise due care while filling in the Prelims form as they cannot change the provided information later. Apart from usual information, candidates are expected to give various details like optional selected, medium of examination for Main, General Studies and medium of examination for the optional.

“Due diligence should be exercised in case a candidate is claiming reservation under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category as the UPSC had sought clarifications from many aspirants last year,” cautions V. Gopala Krishna, Director, Brain Tree.

The maximum age limit is 32 years for candidates belonging to the General Category and EWS, 35 years for Other Backward Classes and 37 years for candidates belonging to the SC and ST categories.

291,2020/02/13,Electricity unions seek power tariff hike,"Power tariff unchanged in State for the past five years and, for some slabs, it’s for more than a decade

Half a dozen electricity employees unions have insisted with the Telangana State Electricity Regulatory Commission that power tariff hike is a necessity to protect the interests of power distribution companies (DISCOMS) as increase in their input cost could be offset only by tariff hike.

At the meeting of the State advisory committee of the commission under the chairmanship of T. Sriranga Rao recently, the unions highlighted that the tariff increase will reduce the financial burden on DISCOMS.

It may be recalled that the power tariff had remained unchanged in the State for the past five years and, for some slabs, it’s more than a decade.

Also, the State government did not file its annual revenue requirement with the commission either for the current or the next years.

Financial crunch

M.A. Vazeer of Telangana State Power Employees Union highlighted that the DISCOMS face severe financial crunch and as a result they availed loans to pay salaries of staff.

Mr. Vazeer requested the commission to take up the matter with the State government.

Staff shortage

The unions also raised shortage of manpower, particularly field staff, which affected supply of quality power. The last recruitment of junior line men was in 2007. On the other hand, the installed generation capacity in the State had increased from 6,500 MW when Telangana was formed to the current level of 14,000 MW.

Mounting power dues of government departments was another point raised by unions with a rider that the commission recommend advance payments by them.

E. Srinivasa Chary of the Energy Conservation Mission of the Institution of Engineers said 99% of the 25 lakh agricultural pumpsets in the State were rewound and consume more power. There is scope for reduction in power consumption by 30% and a saving of ₹ 2,563 crore if the pumpsets are replaced.

Recommendations

He recommended the appointment of Energy Service Companies for replacement of existing pumpsets with energy efficient ones. A pilot project could be taken up to ascertain savings and field-level difficulties.

Procurement of energy efficient equipment with five star rating should be made mandatory for licencees. The schemes proposed for conductor replacement should be taken up keeping in view the future load growth also. The members voiced concern at increase in accidents due to poor distribution infrastructure of low tension power lines and lack of awareness among field staff to check the problem.

The accompanying increase in the GST, estimated to be ₹8 on each subsidised domestic cylinder, is something consumers have to bear, Telangana LPG Distributors Association general secretary Jagan Mohan Reddy said. Post the increase, an Indane cylinder in Hyderabad costs ₹917.50 as against ₹769 each until Tuesday.

As per the existing system, households who have not given up LPG subsidy will get 12 cylinders in a financial year and the subsidy amount gets credited to their bank account. As per an estimate, the subsidy amount will increase to nearly ₹346 per cylinder as against ₹204.53.

From the 13th refill onwards, and for those who opted out of the subsidy, only non-subsidised domestic cylinder is supplied. In other words, they have to pay almost ₹150 more per refill.

According to Mr. Reddy, in many of the urban households, especially with more than four members, LPG consumption is more. On day one of the increase, there were no reports of consumers turning away delivery boys when they went to supply, sources in the trade said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lpg-refills-turn-dearer/article30804374.ece
296,2020/02/13,‘I’m a completely different person on stage’,"The legendary singer Lorna Cordeiro on why she took that long sabbatical, stage fright and singing with Mohammad Rafi

Just before our interview, Konkani singer Lorna Cordeiro announces, “I am very scared of answering questions by reporters. I’m not a very effective speaker, you see.” Reassured that she won’t be allowed to feel nervous, she smiles, displaying a tiny bit of confidence. “I’m a completely different person on stage. I don’t even rehearse before a show. The band keeps practising and I don’t interfere. I just go up and sing,” she says, adding that this wasn’t always the case. “When I was young, I did have a bit of stage fright, but that disappeared,” she recalls.

The singer, who goes by the stage name Lorna, has been described as the Nightingale of Goa. She turned 75 last August, and is ready to do as many shows as possible. After receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award and performing at the World Konkani Music Awards in Goa last week, she is ready to take Mumbai by storm, at the Music of Goa show organised by Goan Outreach Association this Saturday.

On favourites and comebacks

“I will play all my hits, including the crowd favourites ‘Nachom-ia Kumpassar’ and ‘Bebdo’. There will be breaks where other singers will perform. I can sing 18 or 19 songs without a break but my band thinks I need rest. Though I keep ‘Bebdo’ for the end, the audience requests it all through the show. But I don’t budge. On stage, I am the boss,” she says.

For someone who totally gave up singing for 25 years, Lorna’s comeback in 1995 was seen as remarkable. She stopped because her mentor, saxophonist, trumpeter and composer Chris Perry, didn't allow her to sing with anyone else. “Early in my career, Chris Perry really encouraged me and I am what I am because of him. But in my contract, I had agreed not to sing with anyone else. It was tough to quit singing, but once I decided, I stuck to it,” she explains. Lorna says she has no regrets about that period. “What’s the point? Forget about live music, I didn’t even practise or hum my songs. It’s not easy but I did it,” she beams.

Familial talent

Hailing from Saligao in Goa, Lorna was encouraged to sing by her father, Teofilo Cordeiro. She reminisces, “My father’s family was full of crooners. All my siblings got into singing. My sister Jean sang in restaurants.” Lorna began as a jazz vocalist, and was promoted by Perry. After Goa, she performed a lot in Mumbai, in hotels and nightspots like the Taj, Ritz, Ambassador, Talk Of The Town, Venice and Blue Nile. In Delhi, she was a regular at Gaylord’s. She says, ""I followed the golden age of jazz, my favourites being Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong. I was totally inspired by Ella, though people felt I sounded more like Bessie Smith. They would know better.”

Initially, she was hesitant to sing in Konkani. She says, “Chris insisted, and gave me two songs. Everybody loved them, and a new journey began.” ‘Bebdo’, ‘Tuzo Mog’, ‘Pavsachea Tempar’, ‘Nachom-ia Kumpassar’, ‘Red Rose’, ‘Lisboa’, ‘Sorga Rajeant’ and ‘Calangute’ became hot favourites. “Initially, HMV only promoted singer Alfred Rose, but once I clicked, they came to me.”

Milestones

Lorna says one of her career highlights was to record Konkani songs, including the hit ‘Maria’, with ace playback singer Mohammed Rafi. She explains, “It was Chris’s idea. Rafi believed in knowing the meaning of each word in order to get the perfect expression. So he would write the lyrics in Urdu, memorise them and practise mentally. He said I had a great voice.”

Once she became used to staying away from the glory, Lorna never wanted to return. She says, “Pianist Ronnie Monsorate was very keen that I come back but I refused. He approached my mother who told him to keep persisting till I relented. That’s what I did eventually.” Her 1995 comeback concert at Goa’s Miramar Beach received a rousing response. “I initially thought I’d do only one show and stop. But seeing the response I decided to continue. Today I am happy singing. After the Mumbai show I head to Mangalore,” she says.

Lorna has been the subject of two films. The heroine’s role in Anurag Kashyap’s Hindi movie Bombay Velvet was inspired by her. “I haven’t seen it. I was scared to see what Anushka Sharma would do,” she quips. Regarding the Konkani film Nachom-ia Kumpassar, directed by Bardroy Barretto and based on the lives of Perry and Lorna, she says, “The director says he has paid me ₹10 lakh but that is wrong. He didn’t even ask me before making it. My friends told me to go to court but who has the time? People are enjoying the film, so it’s fine. Who am I to stop them?”

Though she visits Goa often, Lorna spends most of her time in Mumbai, at her home in Dhobi Talao or her sister’s house in Mazagon. She listens to music regularly but wishes young Konkani musicians come up with something new, instead of using tried and tested sounds. She adds, “I like singers Sonia Shirsat and Nephie Rod. They are good. As for jazz, you tell me, is there any jazz today?” When asked whether she spends her time reading, praying, watching television or cooking, Lorna laughs, “I don’t have any plus points. If I had, I’d have been a different person.” It’s a far cry from the start of our interview when she talked about being nervous.

297,2020/02/13,Anupama,"In memory of her guru, Pt. Bimalendu Mukerjee, sitarist Anupama Bhagwat presents Eulogium, an eveningof music

EULOGIUM, a musical tribute to Acharya Bimalendu Mukherjee, doyen of the Imdadkhani gharana, organized by Kailas Sangeet Trust features his son and foremost disciple Pandit Buddhaditya Mukherjee, tabla wizard Ustad Zakir Hussain and the acclaimed music-couple Vidwan Kumaresh and Dr. Jayanthi Kumaresh, on February 16, Algorythm, by Forum, Thigalarapalya, Hoodi, Bengaluru, 6 p.m.

Pandit Bimalendu’s disciple, the versatile sitarist Anupama Bhagwat, who has absorbed the intricacies and fine elements of the Imdadkhani gharana that her guru embodied, shared her rich experience. She detailed the personality of ‘the highly principled, saintly’ musician through his words and mode of teaching, facets that have enriched her individual music and being, more as lived experience than overt lessons. She described his teaching as ‘compassionate’, a quality that qualified his music as well. In fact, openness and generous imparting, with no forbidding tendencies characterised his liberal personality.

Bimalendu’s father, a civil surgeon in Bengal, was a sitar-enthusiast and his mother, a vocalist. For a child of his age, his musical mind was highly developed and he took to singing even before he began to speak. A disciple of Ustad Enayat Khan at Calcutta, the little boy easily grasped all that the guru taught. He also learnt from several other distinguished gurus, widening his music canvas and sharpening his playing skills.

The maestro’s instrumental expertise included the surbahar, surshringar, sarangi, sarod, esraj and Saraswati veena. His inventions, Aditya veena and Bijoya veena named after his son and grandson were backed by immense research. His ability in music-making with multiple instruments positively influenced his approach and skills with his primary delight, the sitar. Anupama shared how while teaching sitar, he would employ the surshringar or sarangi, and the fine vocalist that he was, he would also sing occasionally. While teaching gayaki compositions, Bimalendu ensured that the emotion of the lyric was transported into the instrumental rendition by an in-depth understanding of the sahitya, which in turn guided the stroking patterns. In the context of gayaki-ang, the clarity with which he articulated the technical aspects of sitar-playing was a revelation. Exploring the gayaki-ang through the tappa form has been one distinct mark of identity for the Imdadkhani Bimalendu stream, as borne out by the renditions of Pandit Buddhaditya on sitar. Individual expression was Bimalendu’s keyword for music-teaching. His individualised approach made each disciple unique and enabled original exploration even through common compositions of the gharana. Ragasagar, an extempore chain of ragas, normally played in mehfils, was a challenging musical exercise that he inherited from Enayat Khansaab.

His understanding of music and humility were amazingly well-knit and organically woven into his personality. How else can one understand his response to his prized disciple when she thanked him for his lessons? “Do not thank me. When you are learning from me, I am also learning something else through you!”

Bimalendu was a complete musician, performing extensively, while also teaching and organizing music at Bhilai, then a culturally sapless town. By his undying love for art and untiring efforts, he converted Bhilai into a vibrant centre, where music legends converged for performance and creative interaction, earning Bimalendu the laurel of a Renaissance figure. Disciples came to Bhilai from France, Italy, Japan and from all over India as well. Legendary musicians Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Amir Khan, Vilayat Khan, Ravishankar …several of them visited Bimalendu’s home and he was continually engaged in an intellectual dialogue with them all.

A serious thinker and practitioner, he got down to the core of things whether as a geologist, musician or teacher. Two premier institutions in Chattisgarh benefitted by Bimalendu’s honest commitment, the Bhilai Steel Plant where he served as the General Manager and the Indira Kala Sangit Vishwavidyalaya at Khairagarh, that he headed as vice-chancellor for two terms. A single individual handling such diverse roles with outstanding efficiency is indeed amazing. His role in bringing mammoth profits to the BSP by his commitment and acumen is a tale in itself.

His nature reflected a passionate search, intense and profound. As an instrumentalist, intense riyaz from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. the next morning, with a tabla-player stationed right in his home speaks of Bimalendu’s steadfast rigour. He survived with three hours of sleep for over twenty years, a superhuman feat indeed! At the Khairagarh University, he took up a comparative study of music-education in Western and Indian universities. That he travelled to Canada and USA at his personal cost to pursue this project, speaks of honesty and intellectual curiosity at their best.

Guru Bimalendu once said, “Whenever you close your eyes and play, you will always have me with you”. Holding his word close to her heart, Anupama plays on with passion and devotion, as do other disciples, keeping the maestro’s legacy alive.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/1qa09f/article30810781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGFMASTERSOFPERCUSSION,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/anupama/article30810789.ece
298,2020/02/13,Three Indian art forms enter Guinness World Records,"Dedicated to Tyagaraja, a marathon team effort brought the record home in three categories

Saxophone artiste E.R. Janardhan is on cloud nine. The initiative that the Thyagayya Channel, a part of Thyagayya Charitable Trust, has borne fruit with three Indian performing art forms entering the Guinness World Records. Carnatic music, Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi were presented in a unique show of solidarity, all three categories winning the contest for the maximum number of performers on a single stage.

Guinness Certificates

“It was a three-year plan, which yielded result thanks to the efforts and cooperation of leading artistes such as Sudha Raghunathan, A. Kanyakumari, Parvathi Ravi Ghantasala and Krishnamurthi,” says Janardhanan, a disciple of Kadri Gopalnath and a busy performer and sought after teacher. What prompted him to think of a Guinness? “It has never been attempted before and the Trust wanted to turn the attention of art lovers at the global level,” says Janardhan. Each participant got a certificate. According to Janardhan, that would give them great boost because participation required a standard in terms of talent and presentation.

Guinness Certificates being handed over to the musicians

The show originally planned in December did not take place because of the CAA agitations. The atmosphere was not conducive for the jury to travel. On February 1, the landmark event took place at Ramachandra Convention Centre, Chennai and all the three Indian contingents aced the tough test.

Says Parvathi Ravi Ghantasala: “It was a year-long effort, which culminated in a cliffhanger like situation. With the jury members walking up and down as the dancers performed, we were anxious.” The judges were not experts in the subject but knew what was required to make the grade. Their trained eyes could catch any lapse or faux pas. The category was the biggest ever learning session. Parvathi counselled the participants, whose age ranged from 5-50, to calm them down. “They were nervous. The given song was ‘Entaro Mahanubhavulu’, not easy to perform. They had practised for six months but on that day were overwhelmed by the crowd and the venue,” adds Parvathi, who had choreographed the Tyagaraja Pancharatnam. M.V.N. Murthy and Krishnakumar were the Kuchipudi experts, who trained the band, largest among the three at 1,200.

“Most of them were from Andhra and to them impressing a Chennai audience and more importantly, an international panel was forbidding. Having come that far, we had to put our best foot forward. The dancers in front did very well but those in the deeper rows had to match the quality. Huge screens showed the choreography – pallavi, anupallavi and charanam in that order – and the participants had to repeat,” explains Parvathi.

‘Entaro’ with all those charanams is not easy to present. “Tough task and I was a taskmaster,” laughs Parvathi. “Because it was a golden opportunity to be a part of a golden moment. Winning or losing didn’t matter, we wanted togive our best,” she says. The dancers understood and rose to the occasion.

“The minutes before the announcement were literally electrifying. Everybody waited with a prayer on their lips. When it was announced that with … candidates, we were the largest Bharatanatyam group to learn, the hall erupted,” she says describing the moment.

Dedication to Tyagaraja

“Entire credit to Janardhan for this dream come true. The Trust is the result of his dedication to Tyagaraja Swamy and without the Trust, this collective achievement wouldn’t have been possible,” says A. Kanyakumari, who was one of the frontline participants, along with T.V. Gopalakrishnan, Sudha Raghunathan and Unnikrishnan. “He worked tirelessly for this, spent his own money. He persevered after the event was cancelled on December 29. As elders, we just guided and encouraged him. I was especially moved that 95-year old Annavarappu Ramaswamy travelled all the way from Vijayawada to be present,” she says.

Kanyakumari underlines that the record did not come easy. “Headcount did matter but participation was mandatory. Everybody had to sing. Two senior musicians monitored the performance. We were informed later that several observers unobtrusively watched our performance. It was after all of them gave a clean chit that the announcement was made,” she explains.

A part of ICMDA (International Carnatic Music and Dance Association), Thyagayya Charitable Trust was started in 2017 by Janardhan to propagate Carnatic music and serve society through community work and music events. Thyagayya TV, an offshoot of the Trust is a 24/7 channel streaming cultural events, especially Carnatic music. “This was started in order to give opportunities to aspiring musicians and reach programmes to drawing rooms. Many programmes during the recent Chennai Music Season were telecast,” says Janardhan.

Constantly on the move, Janardhan travels to many countries to perform and conduct workshops. “The money earned is ploughed back into music.

“We musicians owe everything to Tyagaraja Swamy. The Trust and Channel are ways to pay tribute to him. The Guinness recognition is his blessing,” says Janardhan, whose ultimate aim is to build a Manimantapam for the bard in Tiruvaiyaru.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/f9346/article30810268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14frJanardhanjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/guinness-record/article30810270.ece
299,2020/02/13,Baby Sreeram has a penchant for aesthetics,"Imbibing music from several stalwarts has helped the vocalist explore the depths of the art

There is a lot more to Dr. G. Baby Sreeram, faculty member at The Music Academy’s Advanced School of Carnatic Music, than meets the eye. With a sparkling, confident on-stage persona, she is known for weighty classicism in her vocal music. She grew up in a large, orthodox Brahmin family in Thiruvananthapuram with 11 children. Music was enmeshed in the fabric of her life with practically every family member attuned to it. They were not well off. As she puts it, “Our family had music. But nothing else.” Her paternal grandfather, Bhagavathiswara Bhagavathar, and his ancestors, had been vidwans at the Travancore court while her maternal grandfather had been a palace cook.

Baby’s natural proclivity to music was found early. Even at the age of 7 or 8, she could elaborate ragas correctly after merely hearing a phrase. However, a severe asthmatic, being in and out of hospitals did not allow for any regular lessons. Her father insisted on his daughter’s listening to every Carnatic radio programme. She intently followed teaching lessons on the radio. “One kriti would be fully taught in two weeks.” Her uncle, working in All India Radio, would procure the notations. She learned many pieces in this manner. From the eighth standard, she began teaching to supplement the household income.

For about a year, Ananthalakshmi Venkataraman, one of her grandfather’s students, taught Baby some compositions. Baby’s elder sister learned violin at the Sri Swathi Thirunal College of Music and would bring back the material to practise at home. Baby would learn it quickly and then help her sister, both spending about four hours on the exercise daily. “So many stalwart musicians like Harikesanallur Muthiah Bhagavathar, G.N. Balasubramaniam and Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer had worked in the college and set an excellent syllabus with several varnams and krits,” she says. During weekends, she would practise with Sekhar, a student of Vechoor Hariharasubramania Iyer.

Formal learning

Baby’s unusual pitch of 2.5 meant that she was constantly dismissed from participating in music competitions. She took part in exactly one, in college, at the insistence of her classmates, and won the first prize. Baby graduated in Music in 1992 from the Kerala University. The same year, she got the Indian Government’s CCRT scholarship impressing the judges T.N. Krishnan and Guruvayur Dorai. She was asked if she would relocate to Chennai. She replied that if she received the scholarship, she would. It was given on the spot with the suggestion that she learn from T.M. Thiagarajan (TMT). At the age of 20, she embarked on her first formal tutelage under a guru.

With no family in Chennai, Baby stayed as a paying guest in several homes. “Living in a hostel would not have allowed me to practice”. She would go to TMT’s house in the morning. “He would give excellent notations -- so good that one could sing the song directly from it”. She would then go to the Kapaleeswarar temple and practise. She would spend the rest of the afternoon at the Sampradaya Library, then in Luz. “That library was such a treasure trove. It had an excellent collection of recordings archived,” she recalls. She would select and notate at least two to three songs daily from the library’s collection and learn those as well. She taught music to a few students to make ends meet. Baby also composed songs and Sampradaya asked her to perform a concert exclusively of those. That, in January 1993, was her maiden concert in Chennai, accompanied by R.K. Shriramkumar on the violin and K. Arunprakash on the mridangam.

Later that year, she performed for Nadopasana at Sastri Hall. “I used to attend concerts there practically everyday. When asked, I mentioned I was TMT’s student. They then asked me to perform.” The following year, she won the All India Radio competition, which gave her a Grade B certification. Meanwhile, she completed her Master’s in music from the Kerala University through correspondence. Sangeetha Sivakumar asked her to meet Maitreyee Ramadurai of the Music Academy After an audition, she got a slot in the Spirit of Youth competition in 1996 and went on to win the best performer award. Unaware that the winner gets a slot in the December season, she never applied for it. She sang for the first time at The Music Academy in 2012 at 1.30 p.m. and remained there until 2017 when she was moved to the first morning slot.

In 1997, AIR moved her to A Grade directly. After the CCRT scholarship concluded, she learned from P.S. Narayanaswamy for about a year. In 1995, she married musician Palakkad K.L. Sreeram, who is proficient in playing many instruments. She started on her Ph.D., having got a Junior Research Fellowship – “The fellowship funds I received were more than the combined income of all the members of my family,” she says. She researched bhashanga ragas (ragas with additional notes not belonging to the identified parent raga).

TMT had said that many bhashanga ragas had actually been upanga ragas earlier. They had probably been influenced by therukoothu, harikatha and kalakshepam where songs had to be heard over distances without amplification, resulting in many sanchara-s in upper octaves. When emotional content had to be added, other elements were augmented “There are practically no rare bhashanga ragas. They are almost always popular.” Baby extensively researched 44 bhashanga ragas, exclusively through compositions of renowned vaggayekkaras and stalwart musicians. She notated 77 songs, distilling the best through listening. She explains how a raga can be expounded using those kritis as benchmarks. “A student can get a picture of the raga and learn compositions through my book,” she says. In 2004, she was awarded her doctorate by Kerala University.

Baby is known for her vivid imagination, clarity and thoughtful delineation of manodharma aspects, all of which she attributes to a long list of veterans — vainika R Venkataraman, flautist K.S. Gopalakrishnan, violinist K. Venkatachalam, vocalists Parasala Ponnammal, Prabhakar Varma, Vechoor Hariharasubramania Iyer, M.D. Ramanathan, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, M.L. Vasanthakumari, D.K. Jayaraman, D.K. Pattammal and artistes at Sri Swati Tirunal Sangeetha Sabha and Navaratri Mandapam. She stresses that music aspirants should engage in active, analytical listening. TMT is known to have said that Baby and E. Gayatri were students of his with karpoora budhdhi — as quick as camphor.

Baby prefers to teach a student a ragam’s lakshana with a varnam in that raga. She follows up with several kritis in the same raga, going from simpler to the more nuanced. That way, she says, the crux of the raga, its contours and characteristic phrases, get imprinted. Taught this way, she believes that even similar sounding ragas such as Poornachandrika and Janaranjani or Mandhari and Amritavarshini can be clearly distinguished. “Going by arohanam and avarohanam can inhibit thought processes,” she says.

Alapana structuring

Raga alapanas should be structured using songs of recognised composers as a guide, she explains, making learning many pieces crucial. “The clues are all in the songs themselves,” she says. The opening phrase of any major kriti, according to her, is a perfect start to bring out the crux of the raga instantly. The charanam illustrates delineation of the lower sancharas. The anupallavi is a roadmap for the upper notes and combining all the octaves provides more dimension. According to Baby, niraval is an art, finding different expressions from different musicians. TMT pointed out K.V. Narayanaswamy for his clarity combined with excellent sense of laya. She took inspiration from Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer on how to fill in a line beautifully. Students would definitely find it helpful to be given pointers from a trained teacher, for niraval can seem forbidding, she says. “Niraval is not just giving different tunes to a line,” she insists. “It is giving a different dimension of the raga to add to the essence of the lyric”.

The aesthetics of the music is of great importance to Baby. She explains how a plain sangathi is necessary to provide contrast. “One should also know where and what to abstain from.” She pays a lot of attention to the volume — “If I sing a phrase softly, it is because I intend it to be so. Sahitya is important here.” Baby knows the meaning of every word of the song she sings.

Baby has composed prolifically since the age of eight and in rare ragas like Ambasri, Komalangi, Charukuntalam, Amarasenapriya and more. She has also composed kritis with swaraaksharam (where syllables of notes and lyrics match), three swarajatis in the style of Syama Sastri, Ata tala varnams, thillanas, etc. She has, however, abstained from composing for a decade.

Baby does even household chores, like laundry and cooking, singing all the while. It is when she teaches her son, 20-year-old Bharath Narayan, that she actually sits down to sing. “I don’t go seeking name or fame . I also firmly believe that God will take care of things.” This leaves Dr. Gurumoorthy Baby Sreeram mentally free to explore the depths of music.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/mcua1q/article30809616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14FRBABYSREERAM3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/baby-srirams-penchant-for-aesthetics/article30809617.ece
300,2020/02/13,"The Crossover Project in Kerala capital blends jazz, Carnatic and flamenco music","The musical event in Thiruvananthapuram on February 14 brings together mridangam and khanjira exponent Charu Hariharan, Spanish vocalist and composer Carola Ortiz and guitar maestro Santhosh Chandran

A troika of talents and a triad of musical traditions. Certainly, it’s a treat of crossovers in store. The Crossover Project, which brings together mridangam and khanjira exponent Charu Hariharan, Spanish vocalist and composer Carola Ortiz and guitar maestro Santhosh Chandran this Valentine’s Day, is perhaps a first-of-its-kind gig that fuses the best of jazz, Carnatic and flamenco music.

Charu points out that the project is more than just a fusion. “We have named it so as we need a crossing over, considering the breath and depth of the amalgamation. I feel the definition of ‘fusion’ sort of conveys the idea of merely a meeting point. But this project endeavours to venture beyond that contour for an organic musical blend rather than a sequenced mixture,” she says.

The concert, organised by Women of Rhythm, in the city marks the musicians’ final pit-stop of the six-city country-wide tour that has taken them to Mumbai, Baroda, Pune, Chennai and Kochi.

Charu speaks about the “discovery” of friendship and “a musical symbiosis” that is at the heart of the project’s genesis. “I first met Carola during the 2016 International Guitar Festival in Kolkata at an event by (slide guitarist and former Grammy nominee) Debashish Bhattacharya. We developed a good vibe right away, perhaps due to the shared aesthetics and love for music,” remembers Charu.

Their first collaboration came for an album they worked in for vocalist Anandi Bhattacharya, daughter of Debashish. “As we started collaborating, we didn’t want to stay in our comfort zones and pushed the envelope,” explains Charu.

By then, Carola had already released a solo album, Sirin, the title a reference to an eponymous half-human, half-bird figure in Russian mythology. The duo then banded together for Carola’s 10-song, second album, Spirala, predominantly based on jazz and instrumentation, infused with pop and Indian ragas, that came out in January last year. It was partly inspired by Mediterranean music as well.

Though The Crossover Project is headlined by only three artistes, Charu says its musical canvas is sweeping and features original compositions by all three. “Carol is trained in western classical and jazz and my strong point is Carnatic. And it’s not just a blend of songs but a blend of elements too from the respective musical tradition. Each of us will be playing or singing the others’ works,” says Charu, calling the one-and-a-half-hour long performance an “experience.” Charu’s brother and vocalist Sreekanth Hariharan and keyboardist Bhuvanesh Narayanan joined the trio in some of the previous performances of the tour.

Carola, who sings and composes in English, Spanish and Catalan, hopes that, on a personal level, the project marks the “beginning” for further fruitful collaborations. “This has inspired me to come more often to India and try and collaborate with not only Charu but other musicians as well,” she says. “This endeavour by two women from such different cultures, doing something for love and respect for each other and connecting beyond the music is a novel experience for me,” adds the Barcelona-based musician, who also plays the clarinet. Having her base in jazz and classical, Carola says she has now been focussing on folk music of the Mediterranean region.

For Santhosh Chandran, part of the crossover band Arka, joining hands for the project was an easy decision as “the idea was something I could easily relate to”, apart from his friendship with Charu with whom he has collaborated for his Tamil songs previously. “I have worked on crossover pieces on numerous occasions and I found the novelty of this package alluring as a guitarist, especially rendering Indian ragas in flamenco-style,” adds Santhosh, who formerly strummed the guitar for Kochi-based rock band Motherjane.

‘The Crossover Project’ will be held at Ganesham, Thycaud, at 6.30 pm today (February 14). Tickets are available on Paytm Insider and also at the door.

301,2020/02/13,This Malayalam protest song raises voice against abuse inflicted upon children and women,"Conceptualised and directed by techie-cum-filmmaker Baburaj Asariya, ‘Voice of the Voiceless’ has actor Kannan Nayar leading the on-screen performance

Techie-cum-filmmaker Baburaj Asariya feels that one way of effectively raising one’s voice against growing iniquities in the society is through creative expressions. His thematic song ‘Voice of the Voiceless’, which he conceptualised and directed, is a protest number “against the increasing incidents of abuse against children and women.”

Apart from going viral on social media, the song video received a ‘theatre release’ of sorts along with Prithviraj Sukumaran-starrer Ayyappanum Koshiyum at MT Cineplex at Pothencode where the number is currently played before every show of the movie. “The idea is to raise awareness about abuse against children and women. With such an overt title, we aim to send the message loud and clear,” says Baburaj.

Actor and theatreperson Kannan Nayar leads the on-screen performance of the song, crooned by Franco Simon. The lines, set to tune by T S Vishnu, are penned by Sabareesh Parameswaran, a techie. The video was shot at Mar Ivanios Vidya Nagar. Baburaj says the team is attempting to have the song video played in more theatres to reach out to a wider audience. His earlier work, The Unsung Heroes, a documentary about ambulance drivers for which he interviewed over 100 drivers, had gained notice.

302,2020/02/13,Cupid strikes the Mumbai stage,"A round-up of the dramas in the city that deal with many-splendoured romance, this Valentine’s Day

The spate of Valentine’s Day theatre specials this week, all presented by men, might be an happy accident but it does call attention to how even a phrase as innocuous as, “Will you be my Valentine?” is a gendered proposition. In the natural kingdom, where mating rituals are often described in hetero-normative terms, females preen and males strut. Conventional courtship is usually a male domain where the onus or agency of initiation and protraction ostensibly remains with the man, although some studies have indicated that the non-verbal behaviours of women could trigger and control courtship, but these notions are being constantly challenged and dismantled. That said, it is perhaps less than empowering for women theatremakers to kowtow to notions of courtship that originate in a patriarchy that has oppressed women for millennia (even if roses and chocolates are to be had). This is not apparently a conflict for men.

Through a modern prism

However, the sheer diversity of works on offer this week takes the commodified ethos of February 14 into somewhat edgier territory, where under the surface might lurch offbeat persuasions. While not explicitly billed as Valentine’s fare, a good place to begin could be the Amir Khusrau musical Jo Dooba So Paar which continued its run in the fringe circuit last weekend. Written by Ajitesh Gupta, the play intersperses rousing qawwalis attributed to Khusrau with narrative interludes fashioned along the lines of traditional dastangoi. The intense bond between Khusrau and his pir Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, is shrouded in language that is quite unambiguously romantic — one takes this by default as being ensconced in the realm of the spiritual, even if the connotations of unbridled love cannot be denied or not seen through a modern prism that is decidedly more sexualised. Gupta’s soaring vocals, ably supported by a team of musical accompanists and vocalists, provide his play several stirring moments of musical panache, even if the relatively prosaic dastaan portions merely amble along and could be extensively pruned. It works best if seen as a concert with a difference, even if Khusrau’s aphorisms could themselves have been worth the price of admission.

Agony and rapture

Among this week’s offerings are Deshik Vansadia’s Shakespeare’s Lovers and Nikhil Katara’s Letters of Love, another instalment in his Readings in the Shed series of rehearsed readings. Vansadia’s play has emerged out of Actors’ Club, a space where actors meet to hone their craft and keep “their creativity in motion”. It is an outing that is in keeping with his longstanding focus on the bard’s plays. From the ‘arranged marriage’ of Petruchio and Kate from The Taming of the Shrew, to the gender-crossed affair between Orsino and Viola in Twelfth Night, to the rhapsodic circumstances of Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare’s Lovers touches upon agony and rapture equally through a series of vignettes performed by an eight-strong ensemble, including director Vansadia. For his epistolary evening, excavated with Himali Kothari, Katara has brought together three actors — Meher Mistry (fresh from her soulful turn in Rehaan Engineer’s Sounding Vanya), Keith Sequeira and Tavish Bhattacharyya — to give voice to love letters originally ascribed to figures as diverse as Simone de Beauvoir, Richard Feynman, Leonard Cohen, Carl Sagan and Rabindranath Tagore, among others. The evening unfolds through the gaze of Cupid himself, flustered by the erosion of love in these hate-ridden times.

Perhaps the cherry on top could be Javeda, a play written and directed by the upcoming Navaldeep Singh. It is a star-crossed (and deeply felt) love story between two men (Ahan Nirban and Aaryan Deshpande), one Hindu and one Muslim, set in a 1990s Mumbai riven by communal tension. That blurb might well have been preceded by a spoiler alert because the publicity campaign for the play comes across as a tad straight-washed — in the same way as Brokeback Mountain was initially showcased as a film about happy families. For many, a queer angle must still be introduced as a great revelation to purportedly insular audiences. Standard tropes of melodrama and comedy notwithstanding, Singh’s play gets its breathtaking preciousness from the choice of having the ‘female’ spirits of the men, played by Khushi Kothari and Yashaswi Gandhi, orchestrate a love affair for the ages all of their own.

303,2020/02/13,"Monologue is a great learning exercise, says Pratik Gandhi","The actor and director is enjoying the best of both worlds — film and stage

More often than not, an actor who has gathered a fan following from films, attracts audiences to his plays. “With me, I think it has been the other way round,” says Pratik Gandhi, who has starred in many successful Gujarati films, stage actor and director. “Whenever I am out promoting one of my films, radio stations and newspapers first ask about my plays, because I am better known for theatre.”

Of the many plays he has acted in, his monologues, directed by Manoj Shah, Hun Chandrakant Bakshi, Mohan’s Masala (in Gujarati and Hindi) have taken him to several places in India and abroad, and established his reputation as an actor of immense talent.

“Mohan No Masalo is a play very dear to me,” he says. “I had this idea about Gandhi in my mind — everybody knows the Mahatma, but how many know what went into making him great? Everybody is interested in success, but nobody cares about the process behind it. I find it very exciting, because that’s where you get the ingredients of anything in life. I discussed this with Manojbhai and he said let’s explore it. He did the research, the writer (Ishan Doshi) put it together, we did it in three languages and travelled widely with it. I explored new territories like the Leh Ladakh Siachen Glacier base camp where we performed for the army; at naval bases in Chennai and Mumbai, at the Sabarmati jail for the inmates.”

Pratik Gandhi in the plaay ‘Mohan No Masalo’

Pratik had performed a short monologue in a production of Saat Teri Ekvees (Seven Times Three Is Twenty-one), and found the format suited him. “The monologue is an interesting space for an actor,” he explains, “I have to explore myself in a minimalistic setting, where all eyes are on me. So there’s no cheating, just pure performance. There were a lot of things that worked for me; in my early days of struggle, I used to compere shows for quick money, where I had to capture the audience’s attention without a script. This experience helped me a lot on stage; I can sense when I am losing an audience, and how to get them back in tune with the character’s intensity and the text. Acting solo honed my craft and helped me grow.”

However, for a young man from Surat, reaching this position was a mix of struggle, serendipity, fighting the odds and taking tough decisions. After years of exposure to theatre in school, he trained as an engineer and came to Mumbai, which, he believed was the only place that would allow him to indulge what he calls his “multiple passion disorder” for plays, films and engineering and management.

Surviving in Mumbai on just an income from theatre is well nigh impossible, so he took up a well-paid job with a large company, which immediately ruled out commercial Gujarati plays, that demanded daily shows and travel. “Besides, in the family dramas that were and are popular, there was not much for me to do. I was searching for something that could keep me connected with theatre. Luckily, Manoj Shah does plays that deal new subjects and works under no pressure to perform every day or give an average number of shows to the producer. When we worked on Hun Chandrakant Bakshi (about a famous Gujarati writer), he was kind enough to adjust rehearsal timings with my work schedule. We rehearsed very early in the morning before I went to work, and late in the evening when I returned. On the very long commute to and fro, I learnt the lines, so I didn’t waste anybody else’s time.”

When Pratik did his first two films — Bey Yaar (Two Friends) and Wrong Side Raju — which were trendsetters in Gujarati cinema, he took leave from office to shoot. This hectic way of working eventually made him realise that he was losing out on opportunities. “I had to turn down films and plays because I had a job, and I could not take up better job offers that required me to relocate, because I did not want to lose the link with theatre. It was a huge decision for me to quit my job. I had just taken a loan and had EMIs to pay, so it was a weird thing to do, but I went with my gut.”

Versatile approach

Had he not met Manoj Shah, his theatre career might have been very different. “We have a karmic connection. He is willing to taken on new ideas and I am able to do plays in which I am not jut delivering lines, but constantly feeling the resonance of an audience. Every time I do the same play for a different audience, Iearn something new. Like when I performed Mohan’s Masala at the naval base, everybody came in uniform and sat in pin drop silence. I know at which points the audience usually responds and this rattled me. Afterwards, there was loud applause and a standing ovation! I wish I had known earlier. When we did the play for prison inmates, their attention spans were short. But at the end, one of them came to me and wept. And I thought if I can speak to even one person, theatre is worth my while.

“I have made it a point that after every film, I do a new play or at least shows of a play . Theatre is like an akhada (wrestling arena) for an actor. This is where you sharpen your skills. Doing films is helping me get a younger audience into Gujarati theatre.”

Directing Womanologues (a series of monologues with women) was a “natural progression” ; he intends to direct a play by a new writer soon, and act in the next Manoj Shah production.

And finally, he wants to do something for Gujarati experimental theatre. “We have no place to perform regularly. We need equal, parallel opportunities. It’s time we fight for Gujarati theatre.”",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/kuo3u6/article30809564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15frtheatre1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/monologue-is-a-great-learning-exercise/article30809565.ece
304,2020/02/13,Rohingya can’t be kept in jail after serving term: HC,"The refugees will have to be taken to a safe place and continue to be monitored, says Bench

Once Rohingya refugees complete their jail term after being caught as illegal immigrants, they cannot be kept in prison, said Calcutta High Court. The refugees will have to be taken to a safe place, said the lawyer of four Rohingya petitioners who have completed their jail term in 2018.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice T.B. Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Bandopadhyay said once the jail term of a convicted person was over, he could not be kept in the prison. The government could shift them to a safe place and continue to monitor but jail was not the place to lodge them, Sudip Ghosh Chowdhury, counsel of the Rohingya refugees, said quoting from the court’s observation.

Mr. Ghosh Chowdhury had moved the court on behalf of an organisation that filed a habeas corpus petition to produce the arrested Rohingya refugees. The petition said the refugees, who were arrested in 2016, completed their jail term in the summer of 2018. However, even nearly two years after their term completion, the four refugees were still lodged in the Dum Dum Correctional Home which was unacceptable, the court said.

The authorities have identified to pull down another temple and a club house located on these two roads leading from Ranihat Bridge to the teaching hospital as part of the eviction drive for the hospital expansion, said Deputy Commissioner of Cuttack Municipal Commissioner A.C. Rout.

Wednesday’s eviction was the third phase of the ongoing drive and the authorities were very conscious and concerned, for it involved places of worship. However, the demolition drive went off peacefully without any untoward incident.

306,2020/02/13,Calcutta HC permits live streaming of hearing involving Parsi community,"The proceedings involving religious rights would have ramifications for the community across the country, the court said

The Calcutta High Court on Wednesday allowed live-streaming of a hearing in a case of a Parsi woman, saying the proceedings would have ramifications for the community across the country.

The woman had moved the Calcutta High Court seeking an order permitting her children to enter the Fire Temple, the Zoroastrian community’s place of worship.

The woman’s children were not being allowed to enter the Temple as she had married outside the community.

Along with the petitioner, her mother is also a co-applicant in the case filed against late Ervad Dhunjeebhoy Byramjee Mehta’s Zoroastrian Anjuman Atash Adaram Trust and the Parsi Zoroastrian Association of Kolkata.

The Parsi Zoroastrian Association of Kolkata had earlier prayed for live-steaming of the court proceedings before the High Court which was rejected by the the Division Bench of Justices Sanjib Banerjee and Kaushik Chandra.

Cost of live-streaming

“The court said as the case will have ramifications across India, it should be streamed live. The court also said that the Association, which wants it to be streamed live, will bear the entire cost,” Phiroze Edulji, the lawyer represented the Parsi Zoroastrian Association of Kolkata, told journalists.

As per the arrangement suggested by the court, two cameras will be installed. These will be integrated for live-streaming on YouTube.

Mr. Edulji said that it is was the first instance of live-streaming of a hearing being allowed in Bengal.

The Odisha government on Wednesday constituted Odisha State Commission for Backward Classes (OSCBC) under the chairmanship of Justice Raghunath Biswal, former judge of the Orissa High Court.

The other members of the Commission are Navneeta Rath, Mitali Chinara and Prasanna Kumar Patra.

310,2020/02/13,Congress to stage protest against proposal to hike taxes,"Move will be a heavy burden on commoner, says Siddique

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) vice president T. Siddique said here on Wednesday that the Congress would organise a protest on February 15 at all 26 village offices in Kozhikode district against the proposal in the State budget to impose steep hike in taxes.

Addressing a press conference, Mr. Siddique said the hike in taxes would be a burden on the common man already facing high prices of essential commodities and items.

Meanwhile, the KPCC has decided to step in to end the unrest brewing in the Kozhikode District Congress Committee following the exclusion of two senior party leaders from the reconstituted KPCC.

Former DCC president K.C. Abu and the one of the KPCC general secretaries P.M. Suresh, both owing allegiance to the ‘A’ faction, were excluded from the reconstituted KPCC. At the same time, outgoing DCC president T. Siddique, also belonging to the ‘A’ faction, was elevated to the post of KPCC vice president.

“Both of them are senior leaders and they will be suitably accommodated in the party,” a party functionary said.

Three names, K.M. Ummer, U. Rajeevan and V.M. Chandran, have been considered for the post of DCC president.

Now, Mr. Rajeevan appears to have got an upper hand after he was considered based on his factional allegiance. The Congress high command is already facing a tough task choosing a fresh face to head the Kozhikode district unit of the party.

However, organisational restructuring of the DCC would be done balancing factional equations.

312,2020/02/13,GAIL pipeline work reaches final stage in Kozhikode,"95% of project completed; trial run likely by March-end

Despite protests by various forums and challenges posed by two floods, Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) has completed about 95% of its pipe-laying works in Kozhikode district hoping to conduct trial run by March-end. The remaining works mostly include pipe-laying works beneath the Iruvazhinji river and the connection of the already laid pipelines under Chaliyar and Kuttiyadi rivers.

The construction of three valve stations at Puthur, Kottur and Ayancheri is also in the final phase. According to GAIL officials, the pigging station of the project will come up at Unnikulam and its construction work is in full swing now.

“As the season is very favourable for us, we are sure to achieve the construction target by March-end and prepare the pipelines for trial run. In Kozhikode district, the pipeline will cover 80 kilometres,” said M. Viju, project Manager, GAIL. He added that local protests against the project execution had already come to an end in villages as all genuine demands related to compensation and possible realignment were duly considered.

Mr. Viju also said the highest amount of compensation for the speedy execution of works was disbursed to landowners in Kozhikode district.

“More than ₹60 crore was disbursed here as compensation for eligible land holders,” he said.

Meanwhile, C.P. Cheriya Mohammed, who was the State convener of an action committee against GAIL project, claimed that the compensation amount disbursed by GAIL was not sufficient for the majority of small land holders in the State. “In reality, it could compensate only the loss of trees or other affected agricultural ventures in the project area. Though the State government has promised to address the concerns of small landholders with a separate package, it is still a non-starter,” he said.

Mr. Mohammed also said the impact of the gas pipeline project on agriculture land was clearly visible in the rural areas of Kozhikode. “We stepped back from the protests as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act dominated public discussions.

The venture is by Reji Bhaskaran, another expatriate. Banners were put up against the service station allegedly at the behest of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) there. However, later it turned out that the DYFI had no objection but it was the CPI(M) leaders who had placed them.

“The service station has all the required sanctions from the authorities, including a licence. The allegation that it would pollute the river is unlikely to be true as it is not an industrial unit, but just a service station. I need to go through the report of the Pollution Control Board before taking a final decision,” Mr. Mohanadas said.

316,2020/02/13,Teachers stage sit-in protest,"Point out that HC order has stayed G.O. on their re-deployment to far off schools

Some 30 teachers of Sivakasi Panchayat Union schools on Thursday staged a sit-in protest in the office of Block Education Officer here demanding their transfer back to schools where they were working following a High Court Bench order staying the Government Order on their re-deployment to far off schools.

The teachers, led by Tamizhaga Primary School Teachers’ Federation district secreary, Kannan, were inside the BEO office here till late in the evening.

“The High Court on February 6 stayed the order of re-deployment based on an appeal made against a single judge order that had earlier dismissed our petition. We have mailed the stay order to the Chief Educational Officer, District Educational Officer and BEO last week. But, they are not allowing us to re-join the schools where we were working earlier,” said one of the teachers.

After the government ordered re-deployment of the teachers based on the teacher-student ratio, the officers transferred some 35 teachers from various schools under Sivakasi Panchayat Union in 2019.

Basic rule not followed

“However, during the re-deployment, the basic rule for transfer based on seniority list was not followed. The seniority list of teachers of all schools in panchayat union should have been prepared taking the union as a single unit. Instead of following this rule, officials redeployed the junior most teachers at school level,” the teacher said.

While some teachers who had put in 20 years of service had been transferred to schools that are located over 50 km to 80 km distance, junior teachers in the union have been spared, they alleged.

317,2020/02/13,Ban on use of plastic bottles in Kodaikanal from April 1,"Movement of plastic containers to be monitored at specially erected check-posts

From April 1, drinking water and beverages filled in plastic bottles will be banned in the hill station, said Municipal Commissioner Narayanan here on Thursday.

It was decided to ban plastic bottles in the hill station at a recent consultative committee meeting held with various stakeholders, presided over by Collector M.Vijayalakshmi and other senior officers.

The State government, which had banned single use plastics since 2019 had succeeded in the programme to an extent. While the officials conducted raids and seized the banned goods, the consumption had declined in small cities and towns, officials said.

The Kodaikanal Municipality, in a bid to move closer to better living, had proposed to ban carrying drinking water or beverages in plastic containers.

Officials, in association with NGOs, educational institutions and other service outfits, took out a rally from Moonjikal to the municipal office. Placards carrying ‘save environment’ and ‘protect mother earth’ were displayed. Many of them spoke in support of the ban in the hill station at a discussion held later.

The Kodaikanal RDO Surendran said stakeholders would be sensitised to the need to look for alternatives and cooperate in keeping the hill station free from plastic goods from March 15. Officials would closely monitor movement of plastic containers used for potable water and beverages at specially erected check-posts at the foothills of the ghat section.

Like Udagamandalam in Nilgiris district, municipal and other officials in Kodaikanal would display 21 types of banned plastics, which was seven more than the existing ones in hill stations.

319,2020/02/13,HC allows termination of 24-week pregnancy,"The woman with special needs was sexually assaulted by her neighbour

MADURAI

Taking into account the fact that the Union Cabinet had recently approved the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill (MTP Bill) – 2020, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday allowed termination of 24-week pregnancy of a woman with special needs.

Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana observed that one of the comments on the MTP Act – 1971 was that it had failed to keep pace with the advances in medical technology and allow removal of foetus at a relatively advanced state of pregnancy.

The Cabinet had approved the MTP Bill – 2020 that sought to extend the pregnancy period from 20 weeks to 24 weeks for allowing termination, making it easier for women to safely and legally terminate unwanted pregnancies. But unfortunately, the Bill was pending before Parliament for approval, the judge said.

“It is pertinent to point out that there should be a permanent committee constituted for setting up a protocol procedure or permanent mechanism for expediting the termination of pregnancy involving rape victims and abnormal foetus cases”, the judge said.

The court was hearing the petition filed by the mother of the woman, seeking to terminate the pregnancy of her daughter, who was sexually assaulted by their neighbour. The accused, Kasi, was arrested and remanded in judicial custody.

Taking cognisance of the reports filed by medical experts that a complete physical examination of the woman was conducted and she was fit for termination of the pregnancy, the court allowed the termination.

“Considering... the mental and physical condition of the victim and in order to respect the personal liberty of a woman, welfare of the unborn and after perusal of the report submitted... in the case, this court permits the petitioner’s daughter to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy,” the judge said.

The procedure should be done by a team of medical experts, including experts in obstetrics and gynaecology, under the supervision of the Dean of Government Sivaganga Medical College and Hospital. The DNA of the foetus should be preserved for the purpose of criminal trial, the court said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dlfhfy/article30795923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12MADURAIBENCHOFMADRASHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-allows-termination-of-24-week-pregnancy-madurai-sivaganga/article30813034.ece

322,2020/02/13,"Reduce production cost, coconut farmers told","The district administration organised a seminar-cum-awareness programme here on Thursday inviting coconut growers to examine scope for producing value-added goods from coconuts

Instead of selling coconuts, farmers were suggested to learn from a group of progressive farmers from Pudukottai district, who were part of Farmers’ Producers Organisation and manufactured various products from coconut through a cluster.

Collector K Veera Raghava Rao said the district cultivated coconut on 8500 hectares. Farmers should get new ideas and share their experience on controlling pest management, productive use of water for irrigation and right quantity of fertilizers to be used for the crop. With State government offering a number of sops to farmers, they should look for new ways and adapt methods which would reduce cost of production and improve their profits.

With summer fast approaching, the demand for tender coconuts would be high. Farmers should try to achieve higher yield to make use of this opportunity. The quality of coconuts could be enhanced by adopting integrated nutrient management. It would make more consumers to consume natural drink during thirsty time and avoid beverages and other juices, said Joint Director (Agriculture) S S Sheik Abdullah.

Farmers from various parts of the district witnessed exhibition of products and subsidies displayed at the seminar. The Agriculture Engineering Department fabricated a gadget with which farmers can climb the coconut trees and pluck coconuts with ease was kept for demonstration.

Now, the corporation has planned to supply science kits to 10 schools – 4 middle schools, a high school and a 5 higher secondary schools.

“As these science kits are based on scientific principles, the students, by operating them, can easily understand even the most difficult principles since they are learning by doing. Moreover, retention of these principles learnt through this play-way method will be longer. So, we’ve planned to supply the kits each costing anywhere between ₹75,000 to 1 lakh,” Mr. Kannan said.

Students of corporation schools are encouraged to read newspapers everyday by supplying them to schools. It is essential to get ready for entrance examinations to pursue higher studies or competitive examinations to get jobs.

325,2020/02/13,41 ‘Black Spots’ identified along highways in southern districts of T.N.,"Automatic number plate recognition system to be deployed to check rash driving: Transport Commissioner

The Department of Transport has identified 41 ‘Black Spots’ along highways in Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Thoothukudi and Kanniyakumari districts where fatal accidents have happened on multiple occasions, Transport Commissioner Tenkasi S. Jawahar said here on Wednesday.

He was speaking to reporters after holding a review meeting with Collectors and top police officials of the four districts.

Mr. Jawahar asserted that the department was making efforts to minimise the number of fatalities in road accidents by stringently enforcing road safety regulations besides creating awareness among road-users.

Tamil Nadu witnessed the death of 17,218 persons in road accidents in 2016. However, this number was brought down to 10,525 in 2019 through stringent enforcement of law, awareness campaigns and other allied precautionary measures.

In order to cut down the fatal accidents by 50% from last year’s number, the State government was organising review meetings to appraise measures being taken in every district by enforcement agencies.

Reeling out statistics, Mr. Jawahar said the State had 1.90 lakh km-long highways that was used by 2.90 crore vehicles including 2.40 crore two-wheelers.

“The government hopes to achieve its objective by stringently enforcing road safety rules such as action against bikers without licence and helmetless and drunken driving,” the senior official said.

The ‘Black Spots’, which were inspected jointly by officials of police, public health, transport and highways departments following every fatal accident, should be reduced drastically through precautionary measures and ensured that they did not get shifted to other places.

A team, after inspecting a ‘Black Spot’, would submit its findings to the district administration about the accident and recommend measures for total prevention of similar incidents on the spot.

Accident victims were rushed to hospital within the ‘Golden Hour’ by summoning ambulance to the spot within 14 minutes.

Further, installation of speed governors in vehicles had been made mandatory.

Mr. Jawahar said 3,35,152 driving licences in 2018 and 1,19,978 driving licences in 2019 were cancelled temporarily for violation of road safety rules.

“We have planned to deploy automatic number plate recognition system (ANRS) along highways, including the four-lane national highways, so that rash driving, the prime reason behind mishaps, can be checked effectively,” he noted.

When it was pointed out that the condition of the four-lane national highway between Kanniyakumari and Madurai was in worst shape though hefty toll was being collected at four places, Nanguneri, Kayathar, Sattur and Kappalur, Mr. Jawahar said the Department of Transport would write to National Highways Authority of India asking it to maintain the road properly.

However, he did not mention any steps taken by his department to improve the motorability of the highway used by thousands of vehicles everyday.

Collectors Shilpa Prabhakar Satish (Tirunelveli), G.K. Arun Sundar Thayalan (Tenkasi), Sandeep Nanduri (Thoothukudi) and Prashant M. Wadnere (Kanniyakumari) participated.

Inspector General of Police (Traffic and Road Safety) Pramodh Kumar, Commissioner of Police, Tirunelveli City, Deepak M. Damor, Deputy Inspector General of Police, Tiruneveli Range, Praveen Kumar Abinapu attended the review meet.

328,2020/02/13,‘Dilution of Constitution only to realise BJP’s dream of Hindu nation’,"Tirumavalavan says abrogation of special status to J&K was a historic blunder

Dilution of the Constitution of India was a long-term dream of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which wanted to make India a Hindu nation, said Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan.

Addressing a public meeting here on Wednesday, Mr. Thirumavalavan said that the BJP had been formulating new legislations to target Muslims. Abrogation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir was a historic blunder. It was a betrayal by the BJP government.

Along with Pakistan and Bangladesh, Sri Lanka was also part of the British India, he said and wondered why the island nation was not included in the Citizens (Amendment) Act. He also asked why the BJP had discriminated against the refugees on the basis of religion. It was against the spirit of the Constitution.

Granting of citizenship to the refugees should be based only on humanitarian consideration, according to the Constitution, Mr. Thirumavalavan said, adding National Citizens Register would affect Hindus too.

While the details of population census were always confidential, the National Population Register would be made public. Inclusion of Christians in the CAA was only a ploy to create a wedge between Christians and Muslims, he said.

Stating that the CAA was the first attempt to create a Hindu nation, he said it would not become a reality. Mahatma Gandhi had raised his voice for Hindu-Muslim unity. He had shed tears during communal clashes following partition of India. Gandhi was assassinated only because he tried to uphold Hindu-Muslim unity, he said.

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan said that those who were trying to protect the Constitution were being branded as traitors by the ruling party. The college students who were protesting for their rights were not indulging in violence, but only the BJP leaders were saying that the protesters should be shot down. The people would chase away the BJP that was acting with arrogance like the way they drove away the British rulers.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/agm83l/article30807071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Madurai-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dilution-of-constitution-only-to-realise-bjps-dream-of-hindu-nation-madurai/article30804420.ece
329,2020/02/13,Anganwadi workers given smart phones to monitor POSHAN work: Minister,"‘Smriti Irani and I can see progress made from our offices’

Smart phones are being given to anganwadi workers as part of the steps being taken by the State government to effectively monitor development of children, pregnant women and lactating mothers under the Prime Minister’s Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nourishment (POSHAN) Abhiyan, Women and Child Development Minister Shashikala Jolle said here on Wednesday.

Some concern

Speaking at a district-level meeting of Stree Shakthi groups here, Ms. Jolle said that while there are no complaints about implementing the scheme in the coastal region, there are concerns over its implementation in North Karnataka and Hyderabad Karnataka regions. “There have been instances of inflating the number of beneficiaries there,” she said.

Using smart phones, she said, anganwadi workers will upload attendance and details of development of children aged less than six and also pregnant and lactating women. “Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani and I can monitor the progress of beneficiaries sitting in our offices,” she said. The State was late by two years in taking up the Abhiyan, she added.

Allowances

Ms. Jolle said that action has been taken to increase allowances for anganwadi workers. Facilities at anganwadis are being changed to make them look like playhomes.

The Minister said that the forthcoming State Budget will have schemes that will strengthen the Stree Shakthi groups. Action was being taken to provide marketing facilities for products made by these groups. She called upon members to join hands with the government in reaching out Central and State welfare schemes to the people.

330,2020/02/13,Yoga-naturopathy students and teachers go on hunger strike,"They are demanding that yoga and naturopathy be included in the proposed NCISM

Students, teachers and professionals of yoga and naturopathy staged a silent hunger strike in Ujire and Moodbidri on Wednesday urging the Union government to include yoga and naturopathy under the Draft National Commission for Indian Systems of Medicine Bill 2019. (NCISM).

Speaking to presspersons on the occasion in Ujire, Prashanth Shetty, national general secretary, Indian Naturopathy and Yoga Graduates Medical Association (INYGMA), said that the NITI Aayog had proposed to add yoga and naturopathy in the proposed NCISM. The Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM) too had in 2014 and 2016 agreed to include both these subjects and regulate education and clinical practice on par with the other AYUSH system. But the Ministry of AYUSH is refusing to regulate yoga and naturopathy either through NCISM or through its own proposed Bill called the National Commission for Yoga and Naturopathy.

If the government went ahead with the NCISM without including yoga and naturopathy, the two systems of medicine will be left out of all forms of regulation of professional medical education and clinical practice, he said. Dr. Shetty said that the Prime Ministers Office should intervene immediately to protect the interests of 42 yoga and naturopathy medical colleges in the country and more than 5,000 yoga and naturopathy physicians in India.

“While the government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promoted yoga and naturopathy, it is unfortunate that the government has failed to recognise and treat yoga and naturopathy system of medicine on par with other AYUSH systems of medicine, including Unani medicine and the newly added Sowa-Rigpa medicine (traditional Tibetan medicine),” he said.

He said that the Parliamentary Standing Committee for Health and Family Welfare constituted to review NCISM has unanimously recommended the inclusion of yoga and naturopathy. Hence, there are no legal hurdles to include them under the proposed NCISM.

At a time when there is worldwide acceptance of yoga and as India is poised to lead the world in the field, the professional medical education and practice of yoga and naturopathy as a composite system of medicine can enable the country to become the global leader in Mind-Body Medicine/Lifestyle Medicine, Dr. Shetty said.

If yoga and naturopathy system of medicine is not regulated through NCISM, it would be a regressive step undermining the development that has happened in the last 30 years. Unregulated system of medicine cannot have a uniform standard professional education and accreditation process. Then, BNYS graduates will not have national medical registration for legal clinical practice, he said.

Dr. Shetty said that students and teachers from all the 42 colleges concerned took part in the nation-wide strike on Wednesday.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/ok58hk/article30804446.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MNYOGAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/yoga-naturopathy-students-and-teachers-go-on-hunger-strike/article30804447.ece

334,2020/02/13,"Parasites, poverty and privacy","The themes of the Oscar-winning film are all too familiar to the global South

One of the first things that strikes you about Parasite, the brilliant South Korean social satire that swept up four Academy Awards this week, is how familiar it feels to Indian viewers. Bong Joon-ho directs it like a perfectly timed high-wire act, but grounds it deeply in his understanding of the class divide.

The untouchability of class

The deep differences between the Park and the Kim family that Parasite focuses on mirrors the enormous income gap in India and, interestingly, takes the shape of what is essentially untouchability; only, it’s the untouchability of class. The wealthy Mr. Park’s one abiding fear is that his chauffeur Kim Ki-taek might “cross the line”. The line is left undefined — but it needs no definition for Indians, into whose homes chauffeurs and gardeners might enter, but might not sit on the sofa. We might foot the driver’s bill when we go out, but seldom will he share our table.

If the upper-class Indian justifies this by talking about ‘hygiene’, the young son of the Kim family has fewer inhibitions — he simply points out that all four members of the Kim family smell the same. There’s a poignant scene where Ki-taek’s daughter says this smell can never be scrubbed out because it’s the smell of the basement they live in. What’s left eloquently unsaid is that this is the distinctive odour of poverty. It sharply recalls the scenes from the Tamil play Manjal, where manual scavengers lament that the smell of sewage never leaves their skin. And it seems entirely apposite that it is the sight of Mr. Park recoiling from Geun-sae, hand covering nose, that finally pushes Ki-taek over the edge.

Bong extends the implicit untouchability of poverty with the metaphor of the toilet, that familiar forbidden ground. Two vivid scenes demonstrate how close to that reviled toilet the poor lead their lives. First, when searching desperately for an Internet signal to tap, it’s by sitting on the WC and holding phones above their heads that the Kim siblings are able to read their WhatsApp messages. Then, when their basement home gets flooded, Ki-jeong runs to slam down the lid of the WC to keep the rising sewage from spewing out, but later she’s forced to crouch on the same lid, smoking a cigarette, oblivious to the slime around her.

Secluded toilets, privacy and personal space are unaffordable luxuries for the poor. In fact, not long ago, India’s Attorney General had argued that “it’s not right to talk about the right to privacy for poor people”. Although the court ruled that privacy is a fundamental right, real life seldom offers it to people whose homes are pavements and cardboard-walled shanties.

This awareness makes the contrast between the Kims’ squalid basement and the Parks’ soaring, airy home even more stark. In one significant scene, the Kims, caught unawares by the Park family returning home early, hide under the drawing room table, unable to escape even as the Parks make love on the couch. Jammed there, they are forced to listen to an act of intimacy that mocks the lack of privacy for intimate acts in their own life. It reminds us inexorably of Indian chawls and slums — of people who must carefully time their return home to avoid interrupting others; of tiny rooms divided by saris to create the illusion of space; of couples who crowd beaches and parks desperate for solitude.

Universal theme

Parasite’s bottom-up, unromantic, searing take on poverty couldn’t have come from anywhere but the global South. But its triumph lies in how fluidly it universalises the theme, making it impossible for privileged juries to look away. The film’s fantasy and caprice give it a surreal air, but the mortifications it portrays are only too familiar not just to us, but to audiences everywhere in the developing world.

335,2020/02/13,"In Kashmir, abnormal is the new normal","Placing senior leaders under detention robs them of the opportunity of queering the normalcy pitch

Three months ago, Home Minister Amit Shah assured the Rajya Sabha that “normalcy” had been restored in Jammu and Kashmir. Yet, the leaders of the two main parties in J&K — Omar Abdullah of the National Conference (NC) and Mehbooba Mufti of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) — have not only been under detention for more than 200 days, but have also been slapped with the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act.

As Minister of State for External Affairs in Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s government, Mr. Abdullah defended India’s position on Kashmir to the world, hurled diplomatic epithets at Pakistan in international fora, and wore the national flag on his heart as it were. But now, according to the Public Safety Act dossier prepared by the J&K administration, he stands accused of coddling militants and mobilising the people of Kashmir to defy Pakistan-backed militants and vote in elections. Like Mr. Abdullah, Ms. Mufti has also been deemed “anti-national”. Given that she ran J&K as Chief Minister with her party in alliance with the BJP for three years, it is very strange that the same BJP overlooked her leanings then.

Extending the shelf of normalcy

To show the world that the people of J&K participated in elections used to be the Indian government’s primary goal. The government used to go out of its way to obtain diplomatic certification for turnouts in elections as a measure of the genuineness of the exercise. The usually abysmal turnouts made it all the more necessary for such measures to be taken. An election in J&K is not going to take place any time soon, but proving that such an election is genuine, when it is held, will still be the main aim of this government. The steady chaperoning of foreign diplomats into the new Union Territory is an indication of this. With every lot of them that enters the territory, the shelf of “normalcy” in J&K is extended. Since the situation is “normal”, the question then is, when will an election take place?

The Public Safety Act dossier states that the capacity of Mr. Abdullah “to influence people for any cause can be gauged from the fact that he was able to convince his electorate to come out and vote in huge numbers even during peak of militancy and poll boycotts”. Does this mean that it is now normal for a District Magistrate to complain that a politician is able to persuade his constituents to come out and vote? In Kashmir, schools and colleges were open for months after the dilution of Article 370 on August 5, 2019, but nobody attended them. Is that also now normal? Every now and then, U.S. President Donald Trump reminds India that he is ready to mediate between India and Pakistan, even though New Delhi insists that Kashmir is an internal matter. For the American President to repeatedly make that offer was the norm in the worst of times in Kashmir; now it has become a routine in the best of times as well. Is this too the new normal?

Impressions

The government has been conducting focused, narrowly guided tours in batches for foreign diplomats to assess and make a broad certification of the normalcy that prevails in J&K to their home constituencies. These diplomats go to Srinagar and no doubt send rosy, impressionistic cables back to their capitals: ‘Shops are open; there are no barbed wires on the main streets; and no menacing soldiers either. There are upwardly mobile politicians and green shoots of political activity. There is an upward tick in developmental trends. No one is complaining of the absence of the sham that was Article 370. There are myriad plans with timelines and bar charts and plenty of projects in the pipeline. Comparisons with the situation in West Bank are definitely far-fetched. And no one got killed’.

On the other hand, Indian politicians who cannot go to Kashmir and determine for themselves just how normal the situation is probably have to request the foreign missions to put out regular updates, in the form of newsletters or health bulletins, to get a better sense of the situation. The promotion of regular diplomatic tourism to Kashmir is apparently very different from the internationalisation of Kashmir, which happens, for example, when China intercedes on behalf of Pakistan at the UN and Indian diplomats exert themselves to temporarily dissolve that crisis.

The challenge ahead

If making “unacceptable statements” can merit invocation of the Public Safety Act, especially when elections are nowhere in view, how much has the crisis in J&K really dissolved? The government can probably take heart that there have been no major instances of violence since August 5, 2019, and no major upheavals or killings. Terrorists have not run rampant. Meanwhile, six months of New Delhi’s charm offensive notwithstanding, alienation is omnipresent, as is the keen sense of hurt, betrayal, anger and resignation.

To hold an election, the delimitation hurdle first needs to be crossed. With new political map-making in the region, there will be seven more Assembly constituencies in J&K. These have to be artfully identified and demarcated, which will be done on the basis of the 2011 Census. A delimitation commission is yet to be constituted. Even the panchayat polls, which the Prime Minister declared a resounding success, left half the seats empty because of the absence of candidates and boycott calls.

The challenge for the government then is how to balance the semblance of peace, which is a result of detentions, deployments and restrictions, and provide a platform of very modest political activity that is sanctified by New Delhi, in a manner that can give the seething resentment controllable political vent over what has been done to J&K. This alone explains the calibrated release of minor political leaders. It is presumable that they have been set free on the implicit understanding that they will not be crossing any red lines drawn by New Delhi. The diplomatic tourists hear and see exactly what New Delhi wants them to hear and see. New Delhi’s hope is that the local leaders of the PDP and NC come forward, give heft to the process, and grow into major politicians. The expulsion of PDP politicians can only be a marker for the inroads government agencies are making in signing on new political recruits. It is probably easier to alienate PDP politicians given the divisions already extant in that conglomeration, although it is odd that politicians associated with an “anti-national” like Ms. Mufti should escape that taint. The continued detention of Ms. Mufti and Mr. Abdullah is being done with the intention of starving them of the oxygen of a following, forcing upon them political atrophy, and robbing them of the opportunity to queer the normalcy pitch. In Kashmir, it could soon be argued that the more things are normal, the more abnormal they really are.

336,2020/02/13,Riding on data for mobility,"Data-based governance can assist in reducing traffic congestion, as illustrated by a pilot study in Hyderabad

The digital revolution has made interactions between humans and machines, and among citizens, governments and businesses, seamless and efficient. Today, e-governance enables and empowers citizens to directly engage with the state, thereby eliminating barriers in the delivery of public services. The next wave of transformation in digital governance is at the intersection of data and public good. The key to this transformation lies in incorporating data as a strategic asset in all aspects of policy, planning, service delivery and operations of the government.

Transportation is one such critical area, where data-based governance is expected to provide a solution to the ever-growing threat of congestion to urban economies. Congestion caused an estimated loss of $87 billion to the U.S. economy and $24 billion to the four metro cities in India in 2018. Given the limited land resources available, the key to solving congestion lies in improving the efficiency of existing transportation systems.

Multiple sources

An efficient transportation system would help ease congestion, reduce travel time and cost, and provide greater convenience. For this, data from multiple sources such as CCTV cameras, automatic traffic counters, map services, and transportation service providers could be used.

A study by Transport for London, the local body responsible for transport in and around the U.K. capital, estimates that its open data initiative on sharing of real-time transit data has helped add £130 million a year to London’s economy by improving productivity and efficiency. In China, an artificial intelligence-based traffic management platform developed by Alibaba has helped improve average speeds by 15%.

Closer home, the Hyderabad Open Transit Data, launched by Open Data Telangana, is the country’s first data portal publishing datasets on bus stops, bus routes, metro routes, metro stations, schedules, fares, and frequency of public transit services.

The objective is to empower start-ups and developers to create useful mobility applications. The datasets were built after an intensive exercise carried out by the Open Data Team and Telangana State Road Transport Corporation to collect, verify and digitise the data.

Hyderabad has also begun collaborating with the private sector to improve traffic infrastructure. One such partnership followed a Memorandum of Understanding signed between the Telangana government and Ola Mobility Institute. Under this collaboration, Ola has developed a tool, Ola City Sense, to provide data-based insights that can monitor the quality of Hyderabad’s roads and identify bad quality patches.

The data is provided to city officials on a dashboard, and updated every 2-3 weeks to capture the nature of potholes/roads. The information thus given is useful not only for carrying out road repairs, it also helps officials take initiatives to improve road safety, monitor quality of construction, and study the role of bad roads in causing congestion.

Planning road repair work

A pilot was implemented in a municipal zone to gauge the efficacy of the data in supporting road monitoring and prioritisation of repairs. The early results of this pilot project were encouraging. The dashboard helped city officials plan the pre-monsoon repair work and budget for repairs last year.

The pilot also demonstrated the willingness of government departments to apply data-based insights for better decision making. This tool is now being adopted across all municipal zones under the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. This could also serve as a model for other cities to emulate.

The Hyderabad example shows that governments can make their departments data-centric by institutionalising data collection, building technology platforms and helping the departments develop capacity to handle the insights generated from the data. Command and control centres under the ‘smart cities’ initiative can be an ideal starting point. Such interventions, however, also need to address genuine concerns around data security and privacy.

The Telangana government has declared that the year 2020 will be the Year of Artificial Intelligence. It aims to run hackathons and masterclasses with AI as the theme. Discussions are on to include AI for Traffic Management. At the core of AI-based algorithms is good data, and partnership with key stakeholders can only help build such algorithms. Insightful data will be the key to transform Hyderabad into a ‘world-class city’ in terms of mobility.

337,2020/02/13,Birds of a feather: On Trump-Modi chemistry,"India cannot peg its strategic plans on the chemistry between Trump and Modi

When he visits India for the first time later this month, U.S. President Donald Trump can expect thronging crowds in Gujarat and perhaps a substantive discussion on trade policy in New Delhi, but more than anything, it is his growing bonhomie with Prime Minister Narendra Modi that is expected to steal the limelight. Indeed, this chemistry was evident during the four times that they met in 2019. The pinnacle of those encounters for Mr. Modi was undoubtedly the public relations victory that he won when Mr. Trump graced the ‘Howdy Modi!’ event in Houston before some 50,000 Indian-Americans. Now Mr. Modi is returning the favour perhaps, as he has, in Mr. Trump’s words, promised an attendance of five to seven million, from the airport to the new Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel cricket stadium, the world’s largest; here, they will address the “Kem chho Trump!” event before an expected 1.25 lakh people. While there will always be areas of untapped potential in bilateral cooperation, things could hardly be better between the two nations at this time of global turbulence, in trade and security. On the former issue, despite skirmishes surrounding tariffs in specific sectors, such as medical devices, and counter-tariffs following the U.S.’s termination of its Generalised System of Preferences toward India last year, there is hope for at least a limited trade deal — pegged at $10-billion — that could take a measure of stress out of the protracted closed-door negotiations. Prospects look brighter still on defence cooperation. India is reportedly moving toward approving a $2.6-billion deal for 24 Lockheed Martin-built MH-60 Seahawk helicopters. An agreement to buy a $1.867-billion integrated air defence weapons system is also on the cards.

Notwithstanding this slew of positive, if incremental, cooperative advances, it is the deeper fault lines across the two countries’ domestic polities that could, in the longer-term, impact the prospects for smooth cooperation in the bilateral space. For instance, the Indian government’s recent policy shifts regarding special status for Kashmir as well as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register have spooked some U.S. Democrats, including Senators and lawmakers in the House of Representatives. Some have explicitly voiced concerns about the impact in terms of India’s commitment to remaining a tolerant, pluralist democracy. In this context, if the November 2020 presidential election puts a Democrat in the White House, it could potentially impact some of India’s plans. Even if Mr. Trump wins a second term, deepening Congressional opposition to India-friendly White House policies could endanger bilateral prospects. In this sense, there are limits to how much India can peg its strategic plans on the personal chemistry between its leader and the U.S. President.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/birds-of-a-feather-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-chemistry-between-us-president-donald-trump-and-prime-minister-narendra-modi/article30803725.ece

339,2020/02/13,40% progress on road-cum-rail flyover,"The structure is on Marenahalli Road

The Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) has made 40% progress on the ambitious road-cum-metro rail flyover on the 3.2 km stretch between Ragigudda, J.P. Nagar and Central Silk Board on Marenahalli Road as part of the Bommasandra to R.V. Road line of Phase 2 of Namma Metro. This includes the erection of 2.5 km of metro rail spans and 0.8 km of road level central spine spans.

In a press release issued on Thursday, BMRCL announced that it had successfully completed launching and fixing the wings to the first spans of road-level flyover, and making a 20-metre wide road section. It marks the beginning of the most important and complex activity of fixing the wings to the spine of the road-level flyover.

This is the first such flyover being constructed in the city. The ₹330 crore flyover has a four-lane flyover at a height of eight metres above the ground, and a metro corridor at a height of 16 metres above the ground. The four-lane flyover and six lanes at grade level below the flyover) – three lanes on each side – is expected to decongest the stretch.

Suspension of services

BMRCL has announced that metro train services on the Green Line between R.V. Road and Yelachenahalli stations will be suspended on Sunday. This is to enable taking up the drawing of 33 kV power cables from the Yelachenahalli receiving sub-station to Yelachenahalli station and beyond for powering the Reach 4 extension line from Yelachenahalli to Anjanapura station.

Train services will be available between Nagasandra and R.V. Road stations. Normal train services between Nagasandra and Yelachenahalli stations will be restored on Monday from 5 a.m., the release said and added that train services will run as usual on the Purple Line.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/v5onrg/article30813382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGNAMMAMETROFLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/40-progress-on-road-cum-rail-flyover/article30813383.ece
340,2020/02/13,HC asks whether metro project conditions were implemented,"Directs Centre to examine whether State and BMRCL complied

The Karnataka High Court on Thursday directed the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs to appoint a responsible officer to verify whether the conditions, imposed when metro project for Bengaluru was sanctioned, were complied with by the State government and the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) in letter and spirit.

The court also orally told the government counsel that it will not hesitate to stop the metro project if the Union government states that the State government and the BMRCL have not complied with the conditions to implement the Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) and the Integrated Traffic Ratio Rationalisation Plan (ITRRP).

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction while hearing a PIL petition filed by D.T. Devare and the Bangalore Environment Trust.

The bench also directed the Ministry to inform the court by March 20 what action it proposes to take against the State government and the BMRCL if it finds that they failed to implement these conditions in the already completed Phase 1 of the metro project.

The petitioners, while contending that it was mandatory for the State government to implement a CMP and ITRRP as they were preconditions imposed in the sanction letters and the memorandum of understanding singed between the Centre and the State government for both the Phase 1 and Phase 2, had alleged that these conditions were not implemented.

Earlier, when the petitioners’ counsel sought an interim direction from the court to stay the metro project and other infrastructure development projects in the city till the CMP and the ITRRP are in place, the bench questioned whether the petitioners were prepared to deposit the amount towards cost escalation in case the project is stayed. The counsel said that he will not seek an interim order to stay the project.

The bench adjourned further hearing till March 24 while directing both the State government and the BMRCL to file statements informing whether they have complied with the conditions imposed by the Union government.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-asks-whether-metro-project-conditions-were-implemented/article30813285.ece
341,2020/02/13,Flyover proposal by new minister draws ire,"The 14.2-km-long flyover is from Indiranagar BDA Complex to Medahalli via K.R. Puram

Days after taking charge, the new Urban Development minister B.A. Basavaraja has announced a plan for a 14.2-km-long flyover from Indiranagar BDA Complex to Medahalli via K.R. Puram. The minister pitched it as a solution to the traffic congestion to and from Kempegowda International Airport and said it would cost ₹200 crore. The flyover will integrate with the K.R. Puram flyover.

Incidentally, Mr. Basavaraja is the MLA of K.R. Puram. Sources in BBMP said initial feasibility study was under way.

However, it has drawn criticism from a section of citizens groups who have been championing public transport. Questions have also been raised as to how he could announce the project when it was the chief minister who held the charge of the Bengaluru Development Department.

“We have built 55 flyovers in the city over the last two decades, but the traffic congestion problem has only worsened. We appeal to all policy makers to take a flyover holiday, invest in public transport, give it a chance and if congestion is not reduced let them build flyovers again,” said Srinivas Alavilli of Citizens for Bengaluru. CfB emerged from the Steel Flyover Beda movement and has opposed the proposed 102-km-long network of elevated corridors as well.

Many residents of K.R. Puram, too, are sceptical of a flyover solving the traffic problem, as the hanging bridge built in 2003 — which they had championed — did little to ease congestion.

“I spearheaded a signature campaign and collected around one lakh signatures from Hosakote to Kengeri to demand a flyover at K.R. Puram in the early 2000s. But I have now learnt by experience that flyovers are not the solution. It creates a heat island and contributes to a rise in temperature in the vicinity. I do not think we need the proposed flyover,” said Purushottaman P., from K.R. Puram Rising.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/flyover-proposal-by-new-minister-draws-ire/article30813110.ece

343,2020/02/13,30 huts demolished illegally at Marathahalli,"Around 50 armed men were allegedly part of the drive, assaulted residents; three hospitalised

Labourers and migrant workers were again targeted, but this time their homes were not razed by the authorities. A group of 50 armed men, who came with JCB machines, allegedly attacked residents while demolishing 30 dwellings in Survey number 275 at Munnekolala near Marathahalli on Thursday morning.

Three people, including a woman and her six-month-old son, sustained injuries and were admitted to Bowring hospital.

The Marathahalli police, based on a complaint by K. Naveen Kumar, the owner of the plot, rushed to the spot. They arrested 10 persons, seized three JCBs and four bikes belonging to the accused.

At the time of the attack, most of the men who lived in the colony had gone to work.

“Around 9 a.m., a group of 50 men barged into the colony when male residents had left for work. They ransacked 30 huts. The JCB machines started crushing our huts,” said a woman.

Several women, including the caretaker of the property, were allegedly assaulted when they tried to stop the demolition.

“The men did not even allow us to collect our belongings, and beat up some of the residents. They threw a six-month-old baby on the ground,” one resident alleged.

10 people arrested

Passers-by saw the commotion and alerted Naveen Kumar.

According to the police, the demolition was carried out by Sandeep, a resident of Muthsandra, who claims that the land belongs to him.

“We have arrested Sandeep, who is the prime accused in the case along with nine of his associates. They have been charged with unlawful assembly, rioting, criminal trespass and assault. They have been remanded in judicial custody,” said a police officer.

“A legal procedure is to be followed for an eviction drive. Demolishing dwellings illegally is a serious offence,” a senior police officer said.

‘Lost IDs and other documents’

The people who lived in the plot of land said that they were not given time to collect their belongings when the men came with JCBs on Thursday morning.

Kaleemullah, a social activist who works with migrants, estimates that as many as 150 people were rendered homeless.

The accused allegedly threatened to kill the residents and snatched their phones when they tried to call the police.

“We have lost our IDs and other documents, valuables and money,” said some of the affected families.

Zia Nomani, a city-based advocate who is helping the victim, said, “We will approach the Human Rights Commission. The bigger fear among the residents is that many of them have lost documents and IDs, which are mandatory considering the present situation,” he said.

On January 19, authorities razed over 150 dwellings in Kariyammana Agrahara citing the presence of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants.

Entry: ₹500 at the door

In addition to a guitar workshop, New York City-based guitarist and composer Xander Naylor will be in India for a special performance alongside guitarist Vinay Kaushal and drummer Shreyas Iyengar at the Blue Room this week. Naylor, who can blend into a hardcore jazz-fusion space as well as post-rock territory in his guitar playing, will present groove-heavy tunes this time around. He is also likely to add a bunch of Hindustani classical influences into the mix, considering he has extensively studied the form under tabla artist and veteran Pandit Samir Chatterjee. He released his latest composition, ‘Pursuit’ last December, terming it “calculated chaos” in his notes. Expect experimental, free form jazz, atmospheric rock and meditative Indian classical music. While Naylor is a teacher at a music school in New York, his guitarist counterpart for the show, Vinay Kaushal, is also a music educator and alumnus of the Musicians Institute in Hollywood.

Although they gained another big push after collaborating with Pune electronic music star Ritviz on ‘Chalo Chalein’, Seedhe Maut are squarely in the space of buoyant, often aggressive music that heaps on pop culture references in every bar on songs such as ‘Shaktimaan’ and ‘Class-Sikh Maut Vol. II’. The gig also includes a performance from producer-rapper duo Warboy x DEVM, winners of the Red Bull Spotlight 2019 contest who recently released their début album, Out of the Blue last month.

345,2020/02/13,Three BBMP officials suspended for misappropriation of ₹4.42 crore,"Money due to contractor was allegedly diverted to another account

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is embroiled in yet another scam, this time involving the office of the Chief Accounts Officer (CAO). Three officials in the CAO office have been accused of misappropriating funds amounting to ₹4.42 crore. An FIR has been lodged against them with the Bengaluru Metropolitan Task Force (BMTF) and at the Halasuru Gate Police Station.

“Accounts officers R. Ramamurthy and Anitha, and second divisional assistant Raghavendra have been suspended and an enquiry ordered,” said civic chief B.H. Anil Kumar.

The officers allegedly diverted funds to an account that they had opened in the name of a contractor. The scam came to light when the contractor, C.G. Chandrappa from M/s CGC Infra Projects Pvt. Ltd., was informed that his dues had been cleared. He found out that the money had been deposited in an account that had been opened in his name in a cooperative bank in Hampinagar.

In a letter to the commissioner on February 12, Mr. Chandrappa stated that neither he nor his company has an account in the bank.

Mr. Chandrappa was to be paid for executing work pertaining to two different projects on improvement and resurfacing in different localities in Horamavu (ward number 25). The work was completed in March 2019. A detailed bill (total cost of projects was ₹4.42 crore) along with a cancelled cheque in the name of M/s CGC Infra Projects Pvt. Ltd., to which the money had to be credited, was submitted. Both bills were scrutinised and cleared for payment by the jurisdictional executive engineer.

It is alleged that Ramamurthy replaced the account details of the contractor in the Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) with that of the account that had been opened in the contractor's name in the cooperative bank. He then went on leave after sharing his high-security password with Anitha. On February 11, the money was transferred. Soon after the money was credited, it was allegedly withdrawn.

Past scams

In June 2019, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached properties worth ₹5.2 crore belonging to nine contractors accused in the BBMP fake bill scam.

In November 2019, a former BBMP assistant engineer (Mahadevapura zone) was arrested for allegedly playing a key role in a Transferable Development Rights (TDR) scam for road widening projects. Several civic officials were suspended by the then commissioner after the Technical Vigilance Cell under Commissioner (TVCC) report confirmed that they were involved in issuing fake bills. The scam, estimated to be to the tune of ₹1,500 crore, involved creation of fake bills by contractors pertaining to R.R. Nagar, Malleswaram and Gandhinagar Assembly constituencies between 2008 and 2011.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/three-bbmp-officials-suspended-for-misappropriation-of-442-crore/article30811436.ece
346,2020/02/13,Strange pairings make it impossible to celebrate,"Is there an antidote to Valentine’s Day? Scientists, I hear, are working on it, but card-makers, chocolate-manufacturers and jewellery-sellers keep getting in the way.

Last year, someone suggested a “Thoughtless Day” where you ignored your loved one, didn’t buy her or him chocolates and came home late at night having forgotten you were meant to have had dinner together. And clashed a couple of cymbals while you crept home so no one could sleep.

The idea didn’t catch on; and later, when the body of this unromantic man was found floating on a river with what looked like Cupid’s arrow through his heart, everybody said he deserved it. There was a card attached to it, I hear, but that may have been just a rumour.

You can’t speak ill of Valentine’s Day, just as you can’t of Christmas or Diwali or Secretary’s Day. But what was meant to be a private celebration between a couple in love has gone public and involves strange pairings: teachers and students, parents and children, CEOs and staff, carpenters and painters, sportsmen and fans, prisoners and guards, computer programmers and their computers. Love is crazy. But this kind of love is beyond crazy. To quote the philosopher Tina Turner, What’s love got to do with it?

It is all very well to love thy neighbour, but to send him a Valentine’s card is crass. Even if he receives it with undisguised enthusiasm. Two wrongs don’t make a rite.

For some years now, I have been receiving messages saying “Happy Valentine’s Day” from strangers: insurance agents, the guy I bought my spectacles from, my courier service, the chap who cuts my hair. Every year I explain to them that I am not romantically inclined in their direction; every year they think I am joking. I guess Gresham’s Law operates in such things too.

Gresham’s Law, for those who skipped that chapter in school, states simply that “bad money drives out the good”. For our purposes here, it suggests that ridiculous practices drive out the sensible ones. It has become so embarrassing that many otherwise romantic couples do not even acknowledge Valentine’s Day. They often switch their cell phones off till the storm passes, and insurance agents go back to trying to sell insurance and barbers return to their scissors.

The International Day of Love can be, like love itself, quite confusing. Does the boss expect to be wished Happy Valentine’s Day, and will he be disappointed if I don’t wish him? Will it affect my annual appraisal? Should I tell my girlfriend she is not the only one, but shares my love with my boss, my son’s school principal, the guy who overcharged me for fixing my car?

Valentine’s Day is a beautiful day – for greeting card makers who are looking at the next big thing. Like the International Greeting Card Day. It is easy to build a fake tradition around anything. After all, Valentine’s Day has nothing to do with St Valentine. But that’s another story.

347,2020/02/13,Increasing number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants a cause for concern: Bengaluru Police Commissioner,"Mr. Rao said there were cases of human trafficking from Bangladesh as middlemen lure them with job opportunities in the construction sector, and harass them after they come to the city. However, he did not specify the number of illegal Bangladeshis living in the city.

City Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao has said that increasing number of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh to the city is a cause for concern as they may turn sleeper cells for terrorist groups elsewhere.

Intelligence inputs suggest that at least 10 terrorist groups shifted to Bangladesh after the U.S. forces imposed curbs on such groups on the Pakistan–Afghanistan border, he said during an interaction with members of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry on Wednesday.

Mr. Rao said there were cases of human trafficking from Bangladesh as middlemen lure them with job opportunities in the construction sector, and harass them after they come to the city. However, he did not specify the number of illegal Bangladeshis living in the city.

He said Bengaluru, which currently has a police strength of 9,000, needs at least 10,000 more personnel. For patrolling from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. around 1,900 police personnel, including two DCP-level officials, had been deployed.

Speaking about the deployment of Hoysala vehicles, he said the government had been approached for induction of 500 to 600 vehicles in a phased manner.

“At present, Hoysala vehicles reach people in need within 10 minutes after a call to emergency service, and we are planning to reduce it to 6 to 7 minutes and gradually to 2 to 3 minutes.” Under the Nirbhaya scheme, the Police Department is planning to install 17,000 advanced CCTV cameras in the city.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/23rjtm/article30591524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17bgbgadbstabGHB709E923jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/increasing-number-of-illegal-bangladeshi-immigrants-a-cause-for-concern-bengaluru-police-commissioner/article30804647.ece
348,2020/02/13,"Karnataka bandh call: Some auto, taxi unions lend support","Normal life is unlikely to be impacted as most offices and commercials establishments will also function as usual. Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said on Wednesday that no official holiday has been declared for schools and colleges. Some schools have asked parents to arrange transport by themselves.

The State-wide bandh called by several Kannada organisations is likely to hit commuters who rely on cabs and autorickshaws to get to work as Ola and other aggregator services may be affected. Some drivers’ unions — both cabs and autos — are supporting the bandh, but public transport services in the city such as BMTC and Namma Metro said they would run on schedule.

Normal life is unlikely to be impacted as most offices and commercials establishments will also function as usual. Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said on Wednesday that no official holiday has been declared for schools and colleges. Some schools have asked parents to arrange transport by themselves.

The organisations that have called for the bandh are demanding the implementation of the Sarojini Mahishi report by providing more jobs for Kannadigas in the State. Namma Chalakara Trade Union president Somashekar said, “We have approached all the cab drivers part of Ola and Uber to take part in bandh. We want a better future for the next generation, and all drivers, including those who drive autos, are supporting this.” If the drivers of cab aggregators do take part in the bandh, finding transportation to Kempegowda International Airport will be difficult between 6 a.m to 6 p.m.

Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi said unions of employees of road transport corporations would not take part in the bandh. However, he added that depending on the situation, the officials concerned would take a call on operation of buses.

BMRCL chief PRO Yashwanth Chavan said BMRCL had already asked the police to make security arrangements at metro stations in view of the bandh call. He said the metro services would start as usual on the day.

Various organisations under Karnataka Sanghatengalal Okkoota are demanding the implementation of the Sarojini Mahishi report, and their protest at Mourya Circle will enter its 102nd day on Thursday. However, several Kannada groups and leaders have extended only moral support and refused to take an active part in the bandh.

On Wednesday, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa appealed to protesters to withdraw the bandh call and not inconvenience the public. He said he was ready to hold talks with Kannada organisations on implementing the report.

Maintaining order

Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao, at an meeting at FKCCI, said the police have taken all measures to ensure that law and order is maintained on Thursday. “We are not going to allow any groups to disturb normal life in the city. We appeal to all establishments to stay open and operate as usual.”

350,2020/02/13,‘Temple tanks once played well the role of water harvesters for the people’,"Chithra Madhavan gave a little bit of history behind the construction of the Veeranam Eri by the soldiers of Veera Narayana Parantaka Cholan.

Rapid urbanisation has ensured that water bodies in the city have all but vanished. While the city had copious rainfall in 2015 to quench the thirst of the residents for several years, the encroachments and poor maintenance of water bodies and temple tanks brought us to a water shortage situation within a few years, said historian Chithra Madhavan.

Giving a talk on 'The Role of Temple Tanks in South India's water management' organised by Smithsonian Institution and Water Matters held in the city on Thursday, Ms. Madhavan bemoaned the undoing of the wisdom and hardwork of the elders, who had constructed hundreds of temple tanks. Today garbage blocks the inlets, and the tanks soon dry up completely.

Taking the audience on a pictorial journey with nuggets of history behind the construction of the water tanks built by various kings, Ms. Madhavan showcased the advanced water harvesting and storing techniques developed even in dry Gujarat and Rajasthan. She said: “While people talk about the aquaducts of Rome, water ducts were constructed in temple tanks here ages ago but failed to get the recognition.”

Pointing to the different designs employed in the step tanks, Ms. Madhavan said the step tanks of Kamalapur Tank of Hampi in Karnataka, and Rani Ki Vav and Adalaj Stepwell in Gujarat, have intricately carved statues. The step tanks had layers and layers of waters and had served the visitors and the villagers well in those days.

Ms. Madhavan gave a little bit of history behind the construction of the Veeranam Eri by the soldiers of Veera Narayana Parantaka Cholan. She said King Parantaka Cholan had sent his son with an army to take on the invaders but finding the enemy failing to show up and to keep the soldiers engaged, a water tank was dug up. She also said there was a scientific purpose for having temple tanks, as the place where ‘soil tests’ needs to be done for constructing temples would be dug up and converted into water bodies.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/l9wzkc/article30809636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TEMPLETANK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/temple-tanks-once-played-well-the-role-of-water-harvesters-for-the-people/article30809637.ece
351,2020/02/13,LPG consumers are a worried lot as backlog goes up to 10 days,"IOC says with one lakh new cylinders arriving in a week, issue will be sorted out soon

Panic calls to cooking gas agencies have increased in the last couple of weeks with the consumers getting their liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) refill supplies after delays. The current backlog ranges between 5-10 days, which is much more than last month’s backlog of 4-8 days.

“The situation has been worsening since October last year; only consumers did not notice it. But between January and February, the delay has increased. While core city consumers are better off and get cylinders within 5-6 days, those on the outskirts get them in 10 days. In some rare cases, it even takes 15 days,” said a distributor, who did not want to be named.

Vatsala Kumar, a consumer, said she was worried about her refill supply. “I had waited for a week after the other cylinder got over to make the booking thinking that I would get the refill immediately since I needed to keep aside the required amount. Now I have an SMS saying four days to delivery. But it has been five days now. Hopefully, I will get it in a couple of days,” she said.

Oil industry sources said that the lack of supply of fresh stock of cylinders to the plants was the main reason for the delay. “The supplies have been stopped since October. Every month a certain number of cylinders have to get into the system so that older cylinders can be taken out for mandatory tests. Currently, a large portion of cylinders are being sent to consumers beyond the due date for such tests and they lead to leaks,” said a source in the know.

While admitting to backlog in supplies, official sources in Indian Oil Corporation said that it was limited to Chennai city and surroundings. “The rest of the State has not been affected. We are getting one lakh new cylinders in a week, which will ease the pressure. We are not compromising on safety aspects and are conducting the mandatory checks on bottles at the plant and also at the distributor point. We are also asking consumers to insist upon conducting pre-delivery checks before accepting the refills,” the official said.

On the complaint about commercial cylinders being given priority over production of domestic refills, the official denied it. “Our plants at Ennore, Chengalpattu and Athipattu supply LPG refills to Chennai area. Commercial cylinders bottling does not exceed 15 per cent,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lpg-consumers-are-a-worried-lot-as-backlog-goes-up-to-10-days/article30805558.ece

353,2020/02/13,‘Indian Meril valve costs half the price’,"At the international conference to be held in Tokyo next week, doctors from Madras Medical Mission (MMM) will present the results of implanting indigenous Meril valve.

MMM has been providing transcatheter valve therapy as non-surgical method of treating those with valvular heart disease. Once used for high-risk surgery patients, it is now used on low risk patients too, said cardiologists. So far, most of the transcatheter valve treatments have been performed in the replacement of damaged aortic valve. But other valves like the mitral valve and pulmonary valve can also be treated similarly now, doctors said.

The made-in-India Meril valve, has been approved by the Drug Controller General of India and its European counterpart. “This valve is now accessible at half the cost of the American or European valve and is affordable for Indian patients,” said Ajit Mullasari, director of Cardiology.

So far, 20 Meril mitral valve implantations have been done in the country, three of which were done at MMM, he said.

The initial results of this valve in aortic, mitral and pulmonary positions were excellent. The first 11 cases are being presented at the international congress next week, he added.

“Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation has evolved as a viable, safe, less morbid procedure of implanting a valve made from xenograft pericardial tissue into the pulmonary position” said K.Sivakumar, Head of Paediatric Cardiology. According to K.Sivakumar, Head of Paediatric Cardiology, so far, in the country, 47 pulmonary valves have been implanted, with MMM implanting 22 of them.

“The Madras Medical Mission had taken the lead for setting up the first core lab for intravascular imaging five years ago and is now setting up the first core lab in the country for structural therapy. The core lab will be named after Dr. Mathew Samuel Kalarickal, one of the pioneers of interventional cardiology in the country, who has trained multiple interventionists in coronary and structural therapy,” Dr. Mullasari said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/indian-meril-valve-costs-half-the-price/article30805538.ece
354,2020/02/13,HC miffed over Corporation’s failure to revise property tax for last 22 years,"Court summons Municipal Administration Secretary and Corporation Commissioner to answer a series of questions

The Madras High Court on Wednesday expressed serious concern over Greater Chennai Corporation not having revised the rates of property tax since 1998 and consequently suffering to generate the revenue required for improving civic amenities in the city besides not being able to employ adequate hands to keep the city neat and clean.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and P. Velmurugan said, the common man was the ultimate sufferer due to the inaction of successive State governments on the issue of revision of property tax rates. The judges observed in their order that ruling parties had deliberately omitted to revise the taxes “for their political interests” and with elections in mind.

The observations were made in an interim order passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate V.B.R. Menon accusing the Corporation of not following a transparent and uniform method for determining quantum of tax to be collected and instead ending up collecting much lesser amount from corporates and commercial establishments.

Pointing out that the law requires revision of tax rates once in every five years, the Bench said, such revisions in 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 would have augmented the income of the civic body multifold. Since the government had failed to do so, the court had taken the task upon itself and ordered revision of property tax rates in 2018.

That order too was passed by a Division Bench led by Justice Kirubakaran on July 17, 2018, and within two days, a government order was issued for revising the property tax for residential buildings by not more than 50% and for rented residential buildings by not more than 100 per cent. Similarly, the taxes were revised for non residential buildings by 100 per cent.

Despite doing so, the government took a quick u-turn and suspended the revision since the elections to civic bodies had to be conducted. It also constituted a three-member committee to look into issues relating to revision. Wondering what happened to the committee, the judges ordered that its report should be submitted at the earliest.

Further, the judges ordered action against “ corrupt” corporation officials who end up levying less taxes on commercial establishments and directed the Municipal Administration Secretary as well as Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner to appear before the court on Thursday to answer a series of questions posed by the court.

The judges wanted to know the quantum of property tax collected pursuant to the revision made in 1998, the yearly collection before the 2018 revision, the amount collected pursuant to the revision and till it was suspended, the reason for suspending the revision and by when would the three-member committee submit its recommendations.

The other questions posed by the Bench were: “How many shopping malls, IT corridors and commercial complexes are situated in Chennai? What was the amount levied on those buildings? How much was collected? What would have been the property tax collection in case revision done in 2003, 2008 and 2013?

“Whether all civic amenities are being provided to the extended areas of Greater Chennai? and how many cases of levy of lesser tax for commercial buildings have been so far deducted?”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/g49y8c/article30796071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADRASHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-miffed-over-corporations-failure-to-revise-property-tax-for-last-22-years/article30805531.ece

356,2020/02/13,16 Special Public Prosecutors appointed to POCSO courts,"In 2019, the Supreme Court had directed that special courts be set up in all districts with over 100 cases of child abuse and sexual assault pending trial under the POCSO Act.

The Prosecution Department announced the appointment of 16 Special Public Prosecutors (SPP) to try offences relating to the Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences(POCSO) Act, 2012 in 16 special courts across the State.

The Supreme Court had, in its order dated January 8, 2020, called for all States to appoint exclusive public prosecutors in all courts that were exclusively set up for POCSO cases.

In 2019, the apex court had directed that special courts be set up in all districts with over 100 cases of child abuse and sexual assault pending trial under the POCSO Act.

Following this, the Tamil Nadu government had constituted 16 special courts in Chennai, Coimbatore, Cuddalore, Chengalpet, Nagercoil, Madurai, Nagapattinam, Salem, Sivaganga, Thanjavur, Tirunelveli, Tiruvannamalai, Thoothukudi, Vellore, Villupuram and Srivilliputhur.

Vidya Reddy of Tulir, Centre for the Prevention and Healing of Child Sexual Abuse, said that the SPPs have a key role in ensuring that child friendly measures, stipulated under the POCSO Act, are adopted and rights of the child protected.

She also stressed that SPPs were needed to enable appreciation of medical evidence and forensic reports .

“It is also hoped that the prosecutors will ensure a better application of Rule 7 of POCSO, which provides for interim compensation to meet the immediate needs of the affected child,” she said.

Enabling experiences for the child and family will ensure that the witness is robust, which will further encourage victims and their families to cooperate with prosecutors and view the criminal justice system with less trepidation and apprehension, Ms. Reddy said. She added that this was essential to ensure the child’s engagement with the criminal justice process.

“Moreover, successful convictions will provide victims a sense of empowerment and safety,” she added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/16-special-public-prosecutors-appointed-to-pocso-courts/article30804827.ece

358,2020/02/13,MIOT Hospital celebrates 21st anniversary,"Staff, doctors honoured on the occasion

MIOT International Hospital celebrated its 21st anniversary on Wednesday by honouring its staff and a few local doctors for service beyond the call of duty. The hospital, founded by orthopaedic surgeon P.V.A. Mohandas, with a staff strength of 3,500 people had served people despite the hostile atmosphere it faced, said Managing Director Prithvi Mohandas. The hospital reflected the spirit with which his father and orthopaedic surgeon P.V.A. Mohandas worked, Dr. Prithvi said.

His father had cycled 12 km to his hospital from home on the day of former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran's death, when the entire city had shut down and there were riots.

Hospital Chairman Mallika Mohandas said the anniversary celebrations had reaffirmed her belief that they were on the right track. On the occasion two doctors from the hospital presented the treatment of two patients — an 18-year-old engineering student from Nagpur who fell from the fourth floor and suffered multiple fractures and a 10-year-old boy of Tuvalu Islands, who fell from a tree and became paraplegic.

While the 18- year-old boy had regained h’is ability to walk and carry on normal activity the child from Tuvalu is still under the hospital’s care. Tuvalu’s Health Minister Isaiah Tappe said with the help of the hospital, Tuvalu was setting up a dialysis unit, which would become functional in June.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/miot-hospital-celebrates-21st-anniversary/article30804772.ece
359,2020/02/13,"Fraudsters pose as genuine sellers online, dupe buyers","With no direct interaction with victims, they operate from far-off places like Delhi

A businessman in Mandaveli was tempted by an advertisement for the sale of a used car on an online portal. According to the ad, the car was on sale for ₹1.8 lakh, way lower than its market price. The seller, claiming to be an army personnel, had posted that he was selling the car since he was moving to Delhi.

As soon as the buyer evinced interest to buy the car, the seller sent a picture of the car, without its registration number, RC book or insurance records, through WhatsApp. He asked the buyer to pay an advance through mobile wallet or link-based payments. The seller promptly sent a gate pass for the vehicle from an army camp, so that the buyer could drive it away. Convinced, the businessman transferred the entire amount and the seller vanished. His mobile phone was switched off.

Likewise, another victim from Porur was keen on buying a high-end bike and checked online. A seller, who claimed to be from the Central security services, had advertised a picture of a his bike for sale, quoting ₹50,000 on an online portal. The market price for the bike was over ₹ 1.5 lakh. As he was attracted by the offer and showed interest, the fraudster sent him vehicle details over WhatsApp, and asked him to send an advance through mobile wallet. The seller sent a fake receipt of a courier company, indicating that the product had been shipped. After collecting all the money from the buyer, he switched off his mobile phone and vanished.

These are not isolated cases. In the last two months, the Cyber Crime Unit of the Central Crime Branch has received more than 60 complaints of such frauds.

A senior police officer said, “We are receiving too many complaints from victims who lost their money to fraudsters who posed as genuine sellers on sites such as OLX, Quikr and others, by listing goods at very cheap prices.”

Similar pattern

Fraudsters usually pose as armed forces personnel or personnel from central security forces and post fake or stolen identity cards and documents relating to cars/ two-wheelers.

They share fake Aadhaar and other identification details and ask buyers to pay the initial advance, and then the entire amount.

Another senior officer said, “All communication is through WhatsApp or other messaging platforms. There is no face-to-face interaction between the buyer and the seller. Overenthusiastic buyers are not ready to verify the credentials of the sellers and get cheated quickly.”

Sometimes, sellers who post their products for sale too are cheated by fraudsters. On seeing an ad posted by a genuine seller, the fraudsters come forward to pay the quoted price. Then they get the sellers to share the OTP for money transfer under the pretext of mobile wallet transfer and swindle the entire money, the police said.

In most cases, the fraudsters operate from far-off places such as Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan. “It is tough to crack these cases and trace the money trail, since all transactions are done through mobile wallets or the UPI mode. Online sale portal representatives also said that transactions were done outside the portal and so they had no control,” the police said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/70zso1/article30806708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-fraudsters-cybercrime,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fraudsters-pose-as-genuine-sellers-online-dupe-buyers/article30804735.ece
360,2020/02/13,"WRD plans to restore, improve storage in six waterbodies at a cost of ₹298 cr.","Fall in demand for silt from waterbodies pushes WRD to alter rejuvenation proposals

With market demand for silt from waterbodies becoming limited, the Water Resources Department is adopting a different approach to rejuvenate and create additional storage in lakes in the neighbouring districts. There are also plans to convey water for Chennai’s drinking water needs.

The Department has submitted a proposal to restore and improve storage of six waterbodies in Kancheepuram, Chengalpattu and Vellore districts, at an estimated cost of ₹298.38 crore. The aim is to address multiple issues, including the mismatch between the growing water demand and the availability of resources, increase in the number of intense rainfall days and seawater intrusion in coastal areas.

Less demand

Officials of the WRD said that it was found that sometimes desilting of lakes alone added only 10% to the storage capacity.

Moreover, there were limitations in transporting silt removed from lakes and less demand in the market. With the current demand, the storage capacity could only be increased by 700 million cubic feet (mcft).

Instead of just desilting the waterbodies, the Department plans to raise the height of the bund and weir — a structure that allows surplus water to flow out — by 3-5 ft.

This will boost the waterbodies’ storage capacity by 30-40% and save excess rainwater from draining into the sea, the officials said.

The Department plans to improve storage of large waterbodies in Madurantakam, Chengalpattu district; Uthiramerur, Thenneri in Kancheepuram district; Dusi-Mamandur in Tiruvannamalai district and Kaveripakkam and Mahendravadi in Vellore district. Most of these waterbodies have a capacity to store nearly 900-1,000 mcft each.

“Once the project is completed, the six waterbodies will have an additional capacity to store a minimum of 2,800 mcft of water,” said an official. For instance, the capacity of the Thenneri lake is expected to increase from the present 1,041 mcft to 1,997 mcft, after the project is completed.

As raising of the bund and the weir height may lead to inundation of land in the foreshore area of the waterbodies, the Department plans to fill land on the foreshore with silt, and raise their height as well. Once the State government gives its nod for the project, it will be completed in a year, officials added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wb8w96/article30804679.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THMADURANTAKAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wrd-plans-to-restore-improve-storage-in-six-waterbodies-at-a-cost-of-298-cr/article30804680.ece

362,2020/02/13,Trump’s march and the Sanders factor,"The U.S. President’s tenure and its baggage have given a new meaning to the term ‘American exceptionalism’

For approximately half the U.S. electorate, a nightmare that began with the unlikely election of Donald Trump to the presidency, is beginning to look as if it may continue into a second term. The U.S. President’s current approval rating (at 49%, in one poll) is the highest it has been since the day he took office. Initial hopes that his evident venality and incompetence may lead to an early termination of his presidency have gradually given way to a shocked realisation that no matter what he does, says, or tweets, there is no diminution in his support among those who voted for him in the 2016 election or in the Republican party. Indeed, as the abortive attempt to impeach him underlined, his command over the party is stronger than ever today.

Nothing stuns

The eruption of each outrageous scandal followed by Mr. Trump’s brazen strategy of a scorched-earth counterattack has led the U.S. to a point where it is now impossible to conceive of any scenario that could lead his supporters to rethink their allegiance. A seemingly hyperbolic comment made by Mr. Trump way back in January 2016, when he was a complete outsider among the aspirants for the Republican nomination (“I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn’t lose any voters”) is reality today.

This presidency and the scandals of the last three years, on both domestic and foreign policy fronts, have given new meaning to the term “American exceptionalism”. Where it once stood for the idea, at least among the patriotic faithful, that the United States was a beacon for democracy and human rights, a land of opportunity for all comers, and unvested in the social hierarchies of Europe, today it signifies a country that elected, and may re-elect, a bigoted, climate-change-denying carnival barker incapable of distinguishing public office from private pelf.

Sanders and the Democrats

If Mr. Trump and his supporters present a united bloc impervious to self-doubt, the opposite is true of the Democrats. A crowded field of contenders caught in a seemingly endless series of primaries and caucuses with arcane rules has meant no candidate has really pulled clear of the pack. More importantly, Democrats are deeply divided in terms of a strategy to defeat Mr. Trump. One of the front runners, Bernie Sanders, is running on an explicitly socialist platform that clearly energises racial minorities, youth, poorer sections of society, women, and liberals looking for an alternative to a two-party system bereft of ideas in the face of global warming, endless war, and unprecedented polarisation of wealth.

Yet, socialism or anything vaguely associated with the term has long been anathema for many in the U.S. Mr. Sanders’s ideas on socialised medical care, free college education for everyone, and a more progressive tax structure evoke incredulity. Similar incredulity, however, is never expressed about the irrationality of a trillion dollar defence budget year after year; nor is there much recognition that in other industrialised democracies, variants on “socialized” medicine vastly outperform the U.S., or that college education is highly subsidised and incomparably cheaper in such countries.

The mainstream media’s conviction that the candidacy of Mr. Sanders will ensure Mr. Trump’s victory — one evidently shared by many in the Democratic Party leadership — is perplexing. He is the one candidate who seems to genuinely energise those groups that were central to Obama’s victories in 2008 and 2012: racial minorities, youth, and first-time voters. The self-confident pundits who prematurely dismiss Mr. Sanders prospects may do well to remember that even as late as the evening of November 9, 2016, as the first results were coming in, none of them gave Donald Trump any chance of defeating Hillary Clinton.

Carceral state

In a form of slow violence that has escaped the attention of many both domestically and abroad, the U.S., with just 5% of the world’s population is now home to about 25% of the world’s prison population (2015 data), the overwhelming majority of whom are black or brown minorities. A criminal justice system thoroughly vitiated by racism has interacted with a prison-industrial complex to produce a situation in which a young black man has a higher chance of ending up in prison than he does in college. In deindustrialising States across much of the U.S., one of the few growth industries is prisons staffed by poor whites guarding poorer blacks and Hispanics.

Recent scholarship and quality investigative journalism have established beyond doubt that the emergence of the carceral state in the alleged “land of the free” was a bipartisan effort. Since the early 1980s, first Republicans and then Democrats competed fiercely to be seen as the party of “law and order”, of being “tough on crime”, and backing the relentless pursuit of the “war on drugs” — all euphemisms for appealing to the worst instincts, fears, and racism of whites seen as key to winning elections. At least three important remaining Democratic aspirants are tainted by their role in the creation and maintenance of this carceral state: Joe Biden, Mike Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg.

Mr. Biden was a high-ranking Senator and Chair of the Senate Judiciary committee during the 1980s and 1990s, and instrumental in passing legislation that produced the carceral state. The billionaire Bloomberg is former Republican Mayor of New York City and architect of the city police’s notorious “stop-and-frisk program”, which racially profiled blacks and Latin Americans leading to disproportionate levels of arrests, often for trivial degrees of drug possession or petty crimes, if even that. Mr. Bloomberg has very recently, and unconvincingly, apologised for the disastrous results of “stop-and-frisk”. Mr. Buttigieg pursued similarly “tough” (read racialised) policies during his tenure as Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, from 2012-20, and has been unrepentant, even proud, of this aspect of his record.

It is hard to see any of these three candidates energising minorities or the young given this track record. Meanwhile conservative whites susceptible to such dog-whistle politics may well stay with Mr. Trump and his unapologetically white supremacist views: why opt for the ersatz when you already have the real thing? (Mr. Trump’s faithful often cite the fact that he “says it like it is” as their reason for supporting him.)

Besides Mr. Sanders, at this moment the other seemingly strong and viable candidate in terms of appealing to the constituencies that could help the Democrats defeat Mr. Trump is Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Her impressive track record as economic manager (she was part of the committee that oversaw the post-2008 financial crisis recovery programme, and pushed for greater regulations over banking and finance, and for consumer protection) and the calm competence she radiates on matters of public policy could be an ideal complement to Mr. Sanders.

Trump’s cards

Besides the advantages of incumbency, Mr. Trump has a huge re-election war chest, the largest in U.S. history as a matter of fact; Republicans (like right-wing parties all across the world) have a pronounced advantage over Democrats in manipulating social media in their favour and against opponents; and polls indicate that as much as 63% of the electorate approves of the way Mr. Trump is handling the economy.

Those are dispiriting facts. Yet, if the long and unpredictable primary season ends with Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren (or Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders) as the Democratic ticket, they are likely to bring energy, the newest voters, and alienated minorities into the Democratic fold in a way that none of the other candidates is likely to do. All that may not be enough to unseat the current occupant — but at this point in time, it would appear to be the Democrats’ best bet.

363,2020/02/13,Nutrition and the Budget’s fine print,"While there are well-equipped schemes to address malnutrition, funding and policy gaps are problem areas

A few months ago, the Global Hunger Index, reported that India suffers from “serious” hunger, ranked 102 out of 117 countries, and that just a tenth of children between six to 23 months are fed a minimum acceptable diet. The urgency around nutrition was reflected in the Union Finance Minister’s Budget speech, as she referred to the “unprecedented” scale of developments under the Prime Minister’s Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nutrition, or POSHAN Abhiyaan, the National Nutrition Mission with efforts to track the status of 10 crore households.

Plan and allocation

There are multiple dimensions of malnutrition that include calorific deficiency, protein hunger and micronutrient deficiency. An important approach to address nutrition is through agriculture. The Bharatiya Poshan Krishi Kosh which was launched in 2019 by Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a recent attempt to bridge this gap. Existing schemes can well address India’s malnutrition dilemma. However, where are the gaps in addressing this concern? We analyse Budgetary allocation and the expenditure in the previous year to understand more.

First calorific deficiency. The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme provides a package of services including supplementary nutrition, nutrition and health education, health check-ups and referral services addressing children, pregnant and lactating mothers and adolescent girls, key groups to address community malnutrition, and which also tackle calorific deficiency and beyond. For 2019-20, the allotment was ₹27,584.37 crore but revised estimates are ₹24,954.50 crore, which points to an underutilisation of resources. The allocation this year is marginally higher, but clearly, the emphasis needs to be on implementation.

Another pathway to address hunger is the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, to enhance nutrition of schoolchildren. Here too, the issue is not with allocation but with expenditure. The 2019-20 Budget allocation was ₹11,000 crore and revised estimates are only ₹9,912 crore.

The second is protein hunger: Pulses are a major contributor to address protein hunger. However, a scheme for State and Union Territories aims to reach pulses into welfare schemes (Mid-Day Meal, Public Distribution System, ICDS) has revised estimates standing at just ₹370 crore against ₹800 crore allocation in the 2019-20 Budget.

Next is micronutrient deficiency. The Horticulture Mission can be one of the ways to address micronutrient deficiency effectively, but here too implementation is low. Revised estimates for 2019-20 stand at ₹1,583.50 crore against an allocation of ₹2,225 crore. In 2018-19, the Government of India launched a national millet mission which included renaming millets as “nutri-cereals” also launching a Year of Millets in 2018-19 to promote nutritious cereals in a campaign mode across the country. This could have been further emphasised in the Budget as well as in the National Food Security Mission (NFSM) which includes millets. However, the NFSM strains to implement allocation of ₹2,000 crore during 2019-20, as revised expenditures stand at ₹1,776.90 crore. As millets have the potential to address micronutrient deficiencies, the momentum given to these cereals needs to be sustained.

Moving to POSHAN Abhiyaan, the National Nutrition Mission which is a major initiative to address malnutrition, had 72% of total expenditure going into “Information and Communication Technology enabled Real Time Monitoring for development and setting up Common Application Software and expenditure on components under behavioural change” according to Accountability Initiative. The focus of the bulk of the funding has been on technology, whereas, actually, it is convergence that is crucial to address nutrition. The Initiative also found on average that only 34% of funds released by the Government of India were spent from FY 2017-18 to FY 2019-20 till November 30, 2019.

Impact of linkage schemes

With underspending, allocations for subsequent years will also be affected, limiting the possibility of increasing budgets and the focus on nutrition schemes.

Next is the agriculture-nutrition link, which is another piece of the puzzle. While agriculture dominated the initial Budget speech, the link between agriculture and nutrition was not explicit. This link is important because about three-fifths of rural households are agricultural in India (National Sample Survey Office, 70th round) and malnutrition rates, particularly in rural areas are high (National Family Health Survey-4). Therefore, agriculture-nutrition linkage schemes have potential for greater impact and need greater emphasis.

So how can we bring about better nutrition in India? With the largest number of undernourished people in the world, India needs to hasten to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 2 of ‘Zero Hunger’ by 2030. The Economic Survey notes that India should give special attention although the Budget has not explicitly spelt out nutrition in greater detail in many ways.

The following are suggestions to move forward: Focus on nutrition-related interventions, beyond digitisation; intensify the convergence component of POSHAN Abhiyaan, using the platform to bring all departments in one place to address nutrition; direct the announcement to form 10,000 farmer producer organisations with an allocation of ₹500 crore to nutrition-based activities; promotion of youth schemes to be directed to nutrition-agriculture link activities in rural areas; give explicit emphasis and fund allocation to agriculture-nutrition linked schemes; and ensure early disbursement of funds and an optimum utilisation of schemes linked to nutrition.

Nutrition goes beyond just food, with economic, health, water sanitation, gender perspectives and social norms contributing to better nutrition. This is why implementation of multiple schemes can contribute to better nutrition. The Economic Survey notes that “Food is not just an end in itself but also an essential ingredient in the growth of human capital and therefore important for national wealth creation”. Malnutrition affects cognitive ability, workforce days and health, impacting as much as 16% of GDP (World Food Programme and World Bank). In that sense, while Budget 2020-21 looks toward an ‘Aspirational India’, fixing the missing pieces on the plate, can make a difference not just to better nutrition but to build a wealthier nation too.

366,2020/02/13,The Delhi model,"The Delhi government has indeed revolutionised the public school education system by showing the political will to spend a large amount of money on an area that is often neglected in this era of populist politics. First, the government took steps to improve infrastructure. Next, it instituted school management committees, giving a sense of ownership to parents in the learning process of their children. These were not novel concepts, they were very much present in the Right to Education Act; what was needed to put them into action was political will. However, the face of education is not something that can be changed in a span of five years; it needs sustained investment, both financial and political (Op-Ed page, “The Delhi model of education,” Feb. 12).

Sandeep Kumar Meena,

New Delhi

Education is a crucial enabler, which will help people realise their dreams and desires. Hence, the role government needs to play in the educational sector — to make it affordable and accessible to even poorest of the poor — cannot be understated.

Government investment in the education sector can initiate pleasing and long-lasting chain reactions. For instance, it is Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s first Prime Minister, who played a pivotal role in establishing IITs in the 1950s. Subsequently, the premier institutions produced many illustrious alumni, including Arvind Kejriwal, bringing name and fame to our country. No wonder, Mr. Kejriwal inherently understands the importance of government investments in the education sector and the rich dividends they can deliver. And, this is reflected in the fact that nearly 25% of the State Budget of Delhi government is marked for education.

The AAP government made game-changing moves in the education sector. The overwhelming verdict of the Delhi people should only give the party more encouragement to carry its work forward.

The victory of the AAP in the Delhi elections is a pointer to the fact that divisive politics is subject to the law of diminishing returns beyond a point. No less importantly, it highlights how important it is to make quality education accessible to all, this having been one of the main planks of the AAP’s election campaign. Today, our education system suffers from a debilitating class divide. At one end of the spectrum, we have the private schools which impart quality education, boast excellent facilities and use English as the medium of instruction. Because of these schools charging hefty fees and collecting donations, they are normally out of reach of children from less privileged families. At the other end are the typical government schools where teachers hardly have the skills or motivation to do justice to their jobs. These schools normally use the regional language as the medium of instruction. Not surprisingly, they mainly cater to the the children from less privileged backgrounds. Children passing out from these schools often suffer from an inferiority complex due to their inability to handle English well. This is not surprising considering the disproportionate importance attached to the knowledge of English in our job market and the social set-up in general. The way the AAP government has worked to address the divide by improving the infrastructure and teaching standards in government schools is commendable indeed. In fact, it is learnt that in some areas of Delhi, government schools have started giving their private counterparts a run for their money. One hopes that the results of the Delhi election will start a new trend in Indian politics which is more about bread-and-butter issues and less about creating divides among people.

The electorate of Delhi delivered a mandate that is path-breaking. The AAP performed in its previous tenure and got rewarded with an astounding victory. The BJP played politics, almost divisive at that, and paid the penalty. But then, the point to note is that more than 40% of the electorate endorsed the BJP, which could increase its tally from 3 to 8. Nevertheless, the AAP did a great job and opened up the only way to win, that is, perform/deliver. Political rhetoric often indulged in by the BJP is passé by now. The mini-India that is Delhi dearly hugged the AAP for the manner in which it had implemented all its electoral promises despite several constraints and obstacles. However, freebies do not provide a long-term solution. All these freebies should be done away with in a phased manner so that all sections of the people feel proud to earn and spend for their own living, instead of depending on the government for everything. Democracy does not mean that the poor need freebies from the government. The poor need employment or livelihoods so that they can earn for themselves a decent living. For this, the state needs to educate the poor and make them work by providing necessary avenues. Ever after seven decades of Independence, India is still struggling in this regard, a pointer to the fact that there has been mismanagement of finances and, more importantly, wrong priorities in planning.

367,2020/02/13,Punishing hate,"The electorate in Delhi punished the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for its hate-filled campaign. On the other hand, the resounding victory of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was the outcome of the solid grassroots work done by the Arvind Kejriwal-Manish Sisodia duo. It is increasingly becoming clear, even to those in awe of the BJP-led Central government, that beyond the vast numbers in the Lok Sabha, the dispensation has nothing to offer to the people by way of positive economic agenda. Its arrogance, haughtiness and megalomania can barely conceal its cerebral emptiness (Front page, “AAP sweeps Delhi with 62 seats,” Feb. 12).

M.A. Siraj,

The BJP is closing Delhi with a single-digit score of eight seats, while Amit Shah said the party would clock 45. Had the BJP won even 25 seats, Mr. Shah would have been congratulated non-stop by all his ‘admirers’. But now, with the party having bagged a single-digit count, would his ‘admirers’ make him understand that his strategy of deploying 200 MPs, a host of Union Ministers and a few CMs of BJP-ruled States failed miserably? Where is the accountability in the BJP? Shaheen Bagh dominated the BJP’s campaign. With provocative slogans ringing out from its meetings and rallies, its campaign was mostly perceived to be based on communal polarisation. From “goli maaro...” to biryani jibes at Shaheen Bagh protesters and Opposition leaders, to calling Mr. Kejriwal a terrorist, the BJP’s campaign had very little to offer on the development front. On the contrary, the AAP focused on local issues and local connect, and refrained from using foul language. And there lies the real success.

C.K. Subramaniam,

The crushing defeat of the BJP is more significant and far-reaching than the emphatic victory of the AAP. The more tje BJP is weakened by erosion of popular support, the better it is for the country. The Delhi debacle is sure to put a dampener on the BJP’s resolve to go ahead with implementing its divisive agenda. More dangerous than the air pollution caused by carbon and exhaust emissions is the ‘toxic air’ created by ‘hate politics’. The AAP’s victory or, inversely, the BJP’s defeat, has dispelled some toxicity in the air and made us breathe and feel better.

It is true that the Congress has forfeited deposits in most of the constituencies it contested. But then it was a small price to pay to ensure the avoidance of a ‘triangular contest’ and the split in the secular or, more precisely, anti-BJP vote. The Congress did the right thing in ‘outsourcing’ the BJP’s defeat to the AAP.

Whether the results will awaken the BJP to the realisation that it needs more than jingoism, bellicosity and sabre-rattling to persuade people to vote for it; that it needs to take corrective action to halt the party’s degeneration into a hate-filled party; and that it cannot edge out other parties and occupy the entire political space, remains to be seen.

At the same time, the AAP’s spectacular win should not be underestimated. It is laudable that the party has made ‘development’ its political goal. The AAP’s commitment to people’s welfare is its defining characteristic and its policies and its governance with education and health care as top priorities can be beneficially used as the template by the rest of India.

No doubt, the AAP is staunchly secular for all the displays of piety by its supreme leader, but it is not enough; it should passionately defend secularism. It should not be found wanting in fighting to save the Constitution and the country. It is the AAP’s obligation too to ensure that India continues to be a secular and pluralist democracy.

368,2020/02/13,Masterly performances,"A staging of Kalyanasougandhikam Kathakali in Palakkad was a display of dramatic dynamism

Kalyanasougandhikam Kathakali, penned by Kottayathu Thampuran, is a popular attakkatha as the tale and the characters are familiar, and the literature, easy to understand. Thampuran has adapted the ‘Vanaparvam’ (life in exile) of the Pandavas from the Mahabharatha, for this play. While a total staging of the play takes six hours, usually, it’s the part where Bheema meets his brother Hanuman in the forest that is performed.

Palakkad Kathakali Trust recently organised the performance of Kalyanasougandhikam as part of their monthly programme. The play started with the padam ‘Panjala raja thanaye…,’ which shows Bheema and Panchali in a romantic interlude.

Apt improvisations

Kalamandalam Pradeep donned the role of Bheema. Pradeep strictly adhered to the framework in continuation of the Kalluvazhi tradition. He makes an entry on stage by holding Panchali’s hand. Next came the ‘nokkikkanal’ (usually, a nayaka’s or nayika’s appreciation of each other by using their eyes) and a padam in slow tempo. Pradeep’s gestures and expressions were in sync with the padam. His simple yet timely improvisation in the stanza ‘Chanchadi modam kalarnuu...’ was spot on. The gestures used to express the word ‘charu pavanan’ (cool breeze) provided symbolic glimpses of his father’s pervasive presence. Pradeep maintained the same level of energy and enthusiasm in the manodharmam too. The elephant-snake-lion episode conveyed Bheema’s inner turmoil.

Pradeep’s ability to handle tough roles was depicted in his scene with Hanuman. The padam ‘Kauravan marodu...’, displayed his annoyance towards Hanuman.

Kalamandalam Sooraj’s Panchali was, however, rather average. Although, the character looked beautiful on stage with a nice costume, his mudras were not in sync with the rhythm. Sadanam Bhasi did a fine job as Hanuman. In most plays depicting Hanuman, the character makes his entry at the thiranokku. In Kalyanasougandhikam, Hanuman enters the stage only after Bheema exits in the first scene.

Bhasi started his performance with a meditating Hanuman. His manodharma attam, which described the reason why Hanuman interrupted his meditation, was excellently staged. In the stanza ‘Khedena Kesarikal…’ in the padam ‘Aariha varunnathu evan…’, Bhasi did a fine job of acting like a lion. His ashtakalasam was a speciality of his performance.

While the actors tried to make the play a success, the percussion artistes could not meet their standards. Jishnu Orupulassery and Kottakkal Vineesh who sung the lyrics, seemed to be out of their depths. Jishnu, however, followed the strict discipline of ragas and tala while singing the padams.

Kalamandalam Vaishakh did a good job in accompanying the actors on the maddalam. Kalamandalam Raman Nambudiri was on the chenda. However, nothing dampened the performance by Kalamandalam Pradeep and Sadanam Bhasi. The duo took it as a challenge and made a mark of their own by producing a remarkable show.

369,2020/02/13,An emotional reunion,"Superb acting and subtle improvisations helped artistes breathe life into the characters of Nalacharitham — Part IV

A recent recital of the usually enacted five scenes from the fourth part of Nalacharitham was a treat. It showcased the solid foundation of systematic training the artistes received and their building on it.

Peesappilly Rajeevan (Damayanti), Kalamandalam Adityan (Kesini) and Ettumanoor Kannan (Nala disguised as Bahukan) were the actors. The opening scene presented Damayanti on the balcony of the royal palace in Kundina along with her friends. The heroine awaits her beloved Nala’s arrival in the palace as King Rituparna’s fastest charioteer. She shares the ebb and flow of her thoughts with her friend Kesini.

Articulate beats

Using a play of fingers on the left face (‘itam tala’) of the maddalam, the hoof-beats resembling Damayanti’s heartbeat, were perceivable to the rasikas. As the chariot comes closer, Damayanti is torn by confusion. Since the chariot’s speed resembles that of the wind, she feels it could be none other than her husband behind the reins. However, she doubts if it’s her husband when she finds a a dark-complexioned, short person in the charioteer’s seat.

In the next scene, Damayanti instructs Kesini to discover the charioteer’s true identity. How Kannan, as Bahukan, prepares his food and spends his leisure time, deserves special mention. The interaction between Kesini and Bahuka turns out to be a mutual test. While Kesini stealthily questions Bahuka to discover his identity, Bahuka in turn pretends indifference when he asks her about Damayanti’s eagerness to remarry.

True colours of Bahuka

After politely indicating to Kesini that it is time for her to leave him to attend to his duties, and after ensuring that she has actually left the scene, Bahuka starts preparing the king’s meal. Kesini, however, spies on Bahuka, who invokes the blessings of the gods so as to make water and fire available for cooking. He also has the power to revive withered flowers and make them fresh again.

Kesini describes to Damayanti what she had observed about Bahukan. Damayanti feels assured that Bahukan is Nala himself and decides to invite him to her guest room for an exchange of thoughts and views. Damayanti is convinced that Bahuka is Nala indeed. Bahuka who transforms back into Nala is sceptical of Damayanti’s fidelity. The couple is reunited thanks to the intervention of the Wind God, who bears testimony to Damayanti’s loyality towards Nala.

Discerning connoisseurs, however, will count this ending of the episode as the moral victory of a faithful wife over her husband who becomes momentarily blinded and unable to see the truth beneath the surface.

Although entitled Nalacharitham’ (‘The story of Nala’ or ‘nara’ meaning man, since l and r are often interchangeable in Sanskrit), the episode ends as ‘Damayanti vijayam’ or ‘Damayanti’s victory’.

All the actors did justice to their respective roles, excelling in all aspects of acting, including contextually appropriate improvisations. The rendition of the play-text into flawless classical music suitable to the stage by Nedumbally Rammohan and Srirag Varma was excellent, but for a few slips in pronunciation. The percussion team provided the ambience congenial to the performance. Kalabharati Unnikrishnan was on the chenda and Margi Ratnakaran was complemented by his disciple Margi Srijesh on the maddalam.

370,2020/02/13,Pet-friendly Willow Bake Shop in Hyderabad serves some very interesting food,"For a chat and a cake: The Willow Bake Shop is pet-friendly, loves humans and serves some very interesting food

What happens when a veterinary doctor, an auditor and taxation consultant and a clinical psychologist meet at a culinary school to pursue their passion for baking? The outcome is a beautiful cafe, informal and a lot of interesting things to bite on as one listens or attends to the events they conduct in their cafe. Sujit Seshadri, Chaitali Pednekar and Md Imad’s ‘The Willow Bake Shop’ on Banjara Hills Road Number 3 is a cafe where you will lose track of time as you sit with your book or a pal chatting over coffee and the home-baked goodies. It is a quaint place with music not interrupting your conversation or the silence you want to enjoy.

Interestingly, it was a cat-lover who recommended the place to me saying, “it is a pet-friendly cafe and they have cats.” I promptly reached the cafe with the hope of getting to cuddle a cat or two... or maybe more. Right at the entrance, I saw some rescued kittens basking in the afternoon sun after they successfully overturned their bowls following their meal.

I met Sujit at the counter with the warmest hello ever. I enquired about the kittens while continuously getting distracted with the dessert display. Sucker for tea cakes that I am, I couldn’t take the conversation ahead without ordering a slice for myself. But then I also noticed ‘potato and leek soup’ as today’s special. So, I asked the carrot cake to wait and instead sat patiently for my soup to arrive. In the meantime, Sujit and I settled for a chat and he shared that he met his partners at culinary school. “We hit it off instantly. Surprisingly all three of us were looking to start a cafe and were on the same page as what sort of a cafe it should be,” he recalls.

‘Happy vibe’

The cafe’s happy vibe comes from a lot of factors, one of them is the decor and the warmth from the team. In order to keep their patrons engaged, they do theme lunches and dinner even if it means going all out on a Halloween or a GoT theme. “I don’t know about the rest, but I have a lot of fun doing these theme dinners. The planning, reading and the preparation is just amazing,” adds Chaitali.

Just then my soup arrived and each spoon of the creamy soup thereafter made me a little more happier. Sujeet recommended I try the kimchi sandwich. Everything — including the sourdough bread and kimchi — except eggs, is made in-house. When ordering this sandwich let the yolk be runny. Along with the sandwich I ordered two different pizzas (before my appetite is judged, let me tell you, the pizzas at the cafe are small). Here again, apart from the universal sourdough pizza base, the different cheeses to be used on the pizza are made in-house.

Apart from the food, Imad also conducts regular talks on mental health. “The topics of discussion range from depression to anxiety to even extending a patient ear to those who need to be heard to make them feel assured. I conduct talks for small groups and keep it very informal,” informed Imad.

Since the cafe conducts fun events, are they planning anything special for Valentine’s Day? The trio laughed and said “we are doing anti-Valentine’s dinner for those who don’t like the love-is-in-the-air vibe. It is a ten-course-meal. Then we also have ‘dinner for two’ option. There is something for each of us.”

371,2020/02/13,Take a look at chefs across the country who whip up innovative sauces of their own,"Saucy experiments: Sriracha and aioli are old news. Chefs across the country are using desi ghee, pomegranate and more to whip up sauces of their own, highlighting both local flavour profiles and overseas traditions

A Hollandaise to add richness to your eggs Benedict; a smooth, tangy lemon dill sauce to add zest to a grilled chicken; a luscious sauce to turn your bland heap of boiled noodles into a rich spaghetti Bolognese. Sauces can elevate a dish instantly, introducing complementary or contrasting flavours, enhancing visual flair, adding moisture or even improving texture.

In busy restaurant kitchens, however, convenience is key and time is premium. Despite that, chefs find cooking their own sauces a worthy investment, in their endeavours towards creating well-rounded flavours. Today’s discerning consumers are concerned about ingredients — especially sugar, salt and artificial flavourings — that go into a sauce. So, although the variety of sauces available on shelves is mind-boggling, chefs are exercising restraint when it comes to readymade sauces.

Saurabh Udinia, corporate executive chef at Massive Restaurants (which runs restaurants like Masala Library, Pa Pa Ya, Farzi Café and Made in Punjab), says, “All the sauces we serve or use are made in our own kitchens. It is time-consuming, but it gives us the freedom to modify, use the right produce, know the source of each ingredient, keep our knowledge of exact allergens in mind and make sure that they are preservative and additive-free. Desi ghee hollandaise, bell pepper ketchup, mustard ketchup, and pomegranate are just a few of the many in-house sauces we make.”

Fresh is flavourful

Chef Nagraj Bhat of London Taxi, Mumbai, opines, “In-house sauces are always healthier, because we use fresh ingredients, don’t add any additives or preservatives. Our sauces have lower sodium content than the store-bought ones and are made fresh daily. Most importantly, we can alter the taste of each sauce depending upon the dish and guests preference.”

Nagraj’s raspberry jalapeño and fennel sauce, he says, “tastes like tamarind chutney. We serve the raspberry sauce along with our jalapeño cheddar chicken tikka.”

While Nagraj prioritises the blending of flavour, for Rohan Hastak, founder of Ground Up, Pune, the context of the ingredients is vital. He likes them locally sourced, as far as possible. “We believe that being able to influence every aspect of the condiment is not only fun and challenging for a chef, but also the best way to create food that really feels like our own. When a chef decides to make something from scratch, the process is much more rewarding.” From a milk-and-egg mayonnaise to a tahini, and a Mexican mole sauce to various salsas, all sauces are freshly made at Ground Up.

Chef Nagraj adds, “The flavour of the main ingredient should complement the sauce and the sauce should add depth, colour and enhance the overall taste of the dish. Sauces differ in each cuisine and even geographically, according to ingredients that are locally available and seasonal.” Intriguingly, his barbecue sauce is made with Granny Smith, an apple cultivar that has its origins in Australia but has been gaining ground in India over the past few years. “It is for our pork ribs, as apple-and-pork is a classic combination. The sharpness of the apples cuts through the richness of the pork without overpowering it,” he says.

Evolutionary tale

Marie-Antonin Carême, one of the forefathers of classical French cuisine, identified the original ‘mother sauces’: Béchamel, Espagnole, Velouté and Allemande. Chef Auguste Escoffier then replaced Allemande with Hollandaise in the 1900s. These sauces still hold an important place in many kitchens, but with the introduction of sauces from around the globe, the concept of sauces has changed and there are several modern variations.

Chefs unanimously agree that consumers are discovering cuisines, as they travel more, and are constantly seeking something new. Pasta sauce, BBQ sauce, salsa, are no longer exceptional, and newer gourmet sauces are beginning to make their presence felt.

Adobo, a cooking sauce from the Philippines which uses five ingredients — soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, peppercorns and bay leaf — is fast catching the fancy of chefs. So is the Korean ssamjang, a spicy, thick sauce made with gochujang, doenjang soy bean paste, sesame oil, garlic and sugar or honey for sweetness.

Concentrated and potent, a sticky ketchup-like sriracha has long been known to elevate Thai food and can be added to scrambled eggs on toast, as well. Yet, chefs are now opting for the closest relative of sriracha — sambal oelek, with a more vinegary tang and less garlicky sweetness, to add flavour to any dish that calls for a bite of heat. The punchy horseradish sauce is another one gaining popularity, and brings a sharp focus to the rich flavours of meat.

Says chef Nagraj, “At London Taxi, our smoked apple BBQ sauce is paired with our slow braised pork ribs as apple and pork is a match made in heaven.”

A masterful combination of flavours, sauces are often the final piece of the puzzle. No wonder chefs give sauces, so much thought.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/lcwj4y/article30810634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MPGroundUpPunejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/masala-library-pa-pa-ya-farzi-caf-made-in-punjab-marie-antonin-carme/article30810635.ece
372,2020/02/13,What you didn’t know about Sichuan food,"Just like her favourite cuisine, Fuchsia Dunlop’s book 'The Food of Sichuan' is fresh and lively, and delves deep into lesser-known treasures of the region

Most restaurants that serve ‘Chinese’ food around India will have some ‘Schezwan’ items on the menu. Non-vegetarian or vegetarian, the dish is identified by its oily, spicy nature. But Fuchsia Dunlop’s book The Food of Sichuan tells you that, while the use of red chillies and Sichuan pepper does increase the heat quotient, the food is “both sophisticated and amazingly diverse”.

Her introduction to this regional cuisine came when two friends in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, took her out to lunch at a small restaurant in the city. “It was the best Chinese food I’ve ever tasted,” she recalls. “The dishes included stir-fried pig’s kidneys, fish-fragrant aubergines and a fish braised in chilli bean sauce. That meal was one of the main reasons I decided I wanted to return to live in Chengdu. All the snack shops around the university served inexpensive food with spectacular flavours: fried guokui pastries, dan dan noodles and spicy wontons... It was addictive.”

In her introduction to the revised edition of her 2001 classic (Sichuan Cookery), Fuchsia talks about living in Chengdu in the 1990s and studying at the Sichuan Higher Institute of Cuisine (she was the first Westerner to study here). For this version, she “retested every single recipe and made many alterations to make them (I hope!) even better. I also wanted to add recipes that reflected the regional diversity of Sichuan itself, so I travelled around and ended up including 70 new recipes, including specialities from places like Leshan and Zigong.”

She mentions the changing culinary landscape and how dishes she loved in the 1990s have faded away. “It’s more difficult to find the simple, everyday folk cooking that I used to adore, including duck braised with konnyaku tofu and really good versions of the classic fish-fragrant pork slivers. In recent years, there’s been a craze for new, imported ingredients such as okra and ice plant.” But luckily, “local heroes are doing their utmost to honour and preserve their gastronomic heritage for another generation.”

This is not a book for someone looking for a quick fix or easy recipe, though some are simple to make. The first 60 pages introduce the reader to the cuisine, the kitchen, the larder and the table. The recipes are divided into 14 sections and each recipe has a note attached, some long and comprehensive. Fuchsia also dives into the MSG controversy. “I think many westerners have a paranoia about MSG that is unjustified,” she muses. “There is no scientific evidence that it is harmful, and the compound appears naturally in ingredients like parmesan cheese. Many excellent Chinese chefs use MSG to cook delicious food.” Having said that, she adds that she doesn’t use it. “I don’t think it’s necessary if you use good ingredients. I also think constantly eating food heavily seasoned with MSG can blunt the palate and make it harder to appreciate delicate tastes.”

Given that China is much like India in its regional food variations, I ask if she has a favourite. “Sichuanese,” comes the answer, “One of my favourite dishes of all time (and the most popular recipe in my book) is fish-fragrant aubergines.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/joe8hp/article30810277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Cold-dishes,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/discover-the-secrets-of-sichuan-cuisine-with-fuchsia-dunlop/article30810279.ece
373,2020/02/13,Making Australia swoon over fish mollee,"Former detective sergeant Ron Timmins left Chennai 58 years ago, moving to Australia to open a restaurant, make pickle and launch a book. Now, he’s back

It is now 58 years since Ronald Aubrey Timmins immigrated from the then Madras to Perth, Australia.

During this period, Ron not only served in the Western Australia Police Force as a Detective Sergeant, but also pursued his love for cooking Anglo-Indian cuisine. “Even during my schooling days at Montfort, Yercaud and college at Loyola, Madras, I was influenced by my mother’s cooking,” says Ron, who retired in 2014 after serving in the police force for 44 years. He adds, “Of course, my very first attempt to make kesari from my mother’s recipe, was a complete disaster! After I moved to Australia, it was a necessity and a yearning to satisfy my love for Anglo-Indian dishes that helped me hone my cooking skills.”

When his daughter Sarah-Jane told him that her husband Nathan had come across a small eatery that served fish and chips, up for sale, and that he would like to buy it and revive it as a new business venture, Ron’s ears perked up — here was an opportunity that would lend itself to all his years of pursuing his passion for cooking.

Ron made an alternative suggestion to Sarah-Jane: ‘Let’s look for another ideal place to reconstruct something closer to my speciality — Anglo-Indian cuisine’. “Scouting around, we zeroed in on a really run-down restaurant which was on the verge of closure. Sarah-Jane and Nathan quickly finalised the purchase and we went about refurbishing the whole place and, lo! Green Coriander was born in 2004!” exclaims Ron.

Ron was still serving as a Detective Sergeant in the Western Australia Police Force then. “I would finish my duty in the afternoon and head straight for the restaurant to cook; Green Coriander was a dinner-only restaurant. By then, I was already working in the force for 34 years and ever since I came to Australia, I had done almost all the cooking for the family (which included his wife, now separated, and his daughter, Sarah-Jane). I had a lot of recipes from my mother and developed many on my own, keeping the original style of Anglo-Indian cooking intact,” says Ron. He recalls how Green Coriander did a one-Sunday-a-month lunch of purely Anglo-Indian dishes, which would sell out well in advance.

Ten years after they opened Green Coriander, a couple of Indian entrepreneurs contacted Sarah-Jane and Nathan and made them an offer that they could not refuse. “It was saddening to know that all the efforts that I had put in to build a business were coming to an end. But at the same time, it was heartening to realise that these efforts were being recognised as a winning proposition. We decided that we should opt out when the going was good and sadly parted with Green Coriander,” recalls Ron.

Meanwhile, Ron had retired from the police force and he was already establishing a line of home-made pickles, chutneys and pastes under the brand name Rajah’s. He changed this name to Jackson’s when he started getting orders from abroad. “The name Rajah’s was too Indian and if I were to cater to a more cosmopolitan and international clientèle, it had to have a more westernised name. Hence, Jackson’s, which incidentally is my grandson’s name,” says Ron.

Meanwhile, Ron meticulously began to construct all the recipes for the dishes he was good at. His recent book, All-time Anglo-Indian Recipes, contains 123 recipes. Each one of them had been cooked and served at Green Coriander.

“After my retirement from the police force, I entered a major cooking competition by the Western Australian government. I was one of the four finalists and my dish was Fish Molee. According to one of the conditions of the contest — that one major ingredient should be an Australian produce — I featured a barramundi fillet, pan-fried and served with a molee sauce. Instead of the usual potato mash, I served potato buffarth, a traditional Anglo-Indian dish cooked in coconut milk,” says Ron, whose dish came a close second.

Presently in India on a holiday, Ron was invited to help select and suggest a range of Anglo-Indian dishes for possible incorporation in the menu at Taj Connemara, which has an Anglo-Indian section in the menu of their all-day dining outlet, The Verandah.

When he returns to Australia, Ron hopes to pursue his next dream of opening a café specialising in coffee and pies. “The idea is to serve typical South Indian filter coffee alongside popular Italian varieties,” he says. “Hopefully, just like how many Australians have taken to Anglo-Indian cuisine, filter coffee will become a rage.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/lfj802/article30810165.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MPRon-Timmins-1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/making-australia-swoon-over-fish-mollee/article30810169.ece
374,2020/02/13,"Khichdi Experiment, an option on food apps, reinvents India's humble meal","This experiment is home-style

Feel like having something light, something comforting? It should be tasty, of course, with a ‘familiarity of taste.’ For such a strict combination of food desire, khichdi fits the bill for many. Those who mostly rely on food apps to meet their day’s craving and hunger surely must have come across khichdi experiment. It is a flagship brand of Ola Foods, and the menu lists classic home-style meals “thus creating a differentiator from the clutter in the market. KE has given the humble dish a modern twist and redefined it into a wholesome, healthy, versatile and exciting everyday meal,” says Anshul Khandelwal, head of marketing and revenue at Ola Foods. To start off, the brand introduced 16 variants and along with two non-vegetarian variants on its menu.

The idea of starting khichdi was fuelled by the need to introduce a home grown Indian dish that would have mass appeal. “Given the current food trend that is mostly centred around healthy choices, there weren’t too many Indian options. Then the western healthy food doesn’t really match with out taste factors,” adds Anshul.

According to Ola, food discussions with a team of food experts aided with studies on Indian food categories, khichdi topped the highest amount of nutritional value, awareness and penetration with people of all ages.

“With KE we wanted to break the myths associated the dish like khichdi is bland or sick people’s food. But with more and more Indians opting for a better lifestyle and home-cooked meals, khichdi as a dish has become their go-to meal. KE is shattering all the misconception about khichdi by serving it in 18 different variations. The selections range from palak paneer, mumbaiya pav bhaji and kerala mathan khichdi to murg dalcha khichdi. Each flavour being a play on a classic dish from states across the country,” he adds. What is khichdi without papad and pickles. So each khichdi comes with a little accompaniment of that as well.

375,2020/02/13,Mei Kun for a range of palates,"Mei Kun manages to exude a family vibe despite being in a convention centre

Mei Kun is a place you want to go when you must please a wide range of palates.

Touted as a fine dining experience, the food and service is however more family-style: you wouldn’t feel uncomfortable choosing a spoon and fork over chopsticks, and the large bowls of rice and noodles that make up the ‘bulk’ of any Indian meal, taste of a sophisticated version of the kind of Chinese food with which most of us grew up.

Would I drive 25 km for it? Unlikely. Would I drop by if I’m in the vicinity? Possibly.

The vibe:What Mei Kun has going for it, is its large space and picture windows that look out onto trees — they help you ignore the somewhat outdated greige interiors.

Despite being in The Leela Ambience Convention Hotel, you can picture a large joint family come and while an afternoon away here. There’s no painfully loud music and no pretentiousness.

Do try: The white fungi coconut soup, which is really a meal by itself and takes good care of change-of-season colds.

The bao, which looked and tasted like a cloud; the succulent kung pao chicken. The star though, was a lotus stem ‘starter’, with a sweet-salty coating of oats. It’s the sort of taste and texture you want to keep nibbling on. The date pancake, though a tad sweet, had a crispy casing and soft heart.

Skip:The dimsums, which had too-thick ‘skins’ that overpowered the stuffing; the Singapore Crab that came in some red gravy, obscuring the sweet flesh of the crustacean.

Go with:Extended family.

376,2020/02/13,No action against motorists who get Marathi number plates: govt.,"State to introduce Bill to make Marathi mandatory in schools

Minister for Marathi Language Subhash Desai on Wednesday said no action will be taken against motorists who get number plates of vehicles in Marathi.

Though the Central government has time and again turned down the Maharashtra government’s request of making the changes in the existing law to allow number plates in Marathi, Mr. Desai said there was nothing wrong in using the State language. He said, “Marathi is the local language and there is no harm in promoting the language in various ways possible.”

The Minister said he has written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah urging him to ensure implementation of the three language formula. He said the Central government must ensure that Marathi as a language is promoted in Central offices, banks and post offices. “This has been a longstanding demand which has not been implemented by the Centre in the past decades. I have now written to the Union Minister to look into it.”

Mr. Desai also said the Maha Vikas Aghadi government will be introducing a Bill in the budget session to make teaching Marathi mandatory in all schools up to Class X irrespective of the board they are affiliated to.

Mr. Desai said the draft of the Bill is being prepared and the proposed legislation will be introduced in the budget session, which starts on February 24. Addressing reporters, he said, “There are 25,000 schools in Maharashtra that do not teach Marathi. [Once the Bill is passed] it will be mandatory for all schools to teach the Marathi language as part of their curriculum. The draft is being finalised. We are working on its intricacies.”

Besides schools affiliated to the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education, there are a number of schools that follow the syllabus prescribed by education boards such as ICSE, CBSE and IGCSE.

377,2020/02/13,Plan to cut Mumbai-Delhi travel time to 12 hours,"WR’s ₹4,011-crore Mission Raftar to convert the line into semi-high speed corridor

The Western Railway (WR) would be executing works worth ₹4,011 crore to convert the Mumbai-Delhi line into a semi-high speed corridor allowing trains to run at speeds of up to 160 km per hour. The 1,384-km corridor now takes 15.5 hours to cover and Mission Raftar aims to reduce it to 12 hours.

“The detailed estimate for the work on the WR portion is ₹4,011 crore. This includes upgrading tracks, bridges, signalling and overhead equipment installations and the removal of some permanent speed restrictions. A combined estimate for the entire project is being prepared and will be finalised soon,” Ravinder Bhakar, chief public relations officer, WR, said.

In the WR’s proposal, civil works amount to ₹1,933 crore, of which ₹660 crore will go towards building boundary walls and fencing of the corridor. “A semi-high speed rail network needs a high factor of safety from trespassing and cattle being run over. Not only the life of people trespassing or livestock but also the passengers aboard the train are put at risk,” a railway official said.

The other major civil work includes closing of level crossing gates by providing road overbridges and subways, which would cost around ₹4,400 crore and will be financed under a separate budgetary head. The bridge over Vaitarna creek in Palghar will be replaced at a cost of ₹330 crore.

The other major expenses are in the electrical works, which are expected to cost ₹1,237 crore and include critical upgrades to the current system. “To cater to high speeds, we will need to reduce the span of the overhead equipment structures. Old redundant structures will need to be dismantled. The other major cost would be another feeder line across the entire corridor to cater to the high power requirement of high speed trains,” a senior railway official said. The other costs would be to upgrade the signalling systems across the corridor to facilitate semi-high speeds.

WR officials, however, said speeds in the suburban sections of Mumbai would continue to run at the current maximum speed of 110 km per hour due to operational constraints. “Since long-distance trains share space with local trains, it is not feasible to run them at these speeds,” a senior railway official said.

Coordinating zone

The entire project is expected to cost ₹10,070 crore for which the Railway Board has allocated ₹1,000 for 2020-21. The project is expected to be financed through extra budgetary resources. There are four railways zones involved in the project — Northern Railway, North Central Railway, West Central Railway and WR.

The Railway Board has nominated WR as the coordinating zone for getting the combined cost sanctioned.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/oqxc8t/article30805396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMNEWRAJDHANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/plan-to-cut-mumbai-delhi-travel-time-to-12-hours/article30805397.ece
378,2020/02/13,City doctor conducts rare surgery through carotid artery,"Cardiologist replaces 65-year-old’s narrow aortic valve through blood vessel in the neck

A Mumbai-based cardiologist has carried out a rare Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) procedure on a 65-year-old man through his carotid artery, the blood vessel in the neck. Commonly, TAVR, a minimally invasive procedure to replace a narrow aortic valve, is carried out through the blood vessels in the leg or arms but in this case, the doctor had to opt for a new route to insert the catheter in the patient due to a blockage.

‘First TAVR in India’

“It wasn’t possible to introduce the catheter into the patient through the groin region or the arms due to severe calcification. Therefore, we had to approach it through the carotid artery,” said cardiologist Dr. A.B. Mehta, who operated on the patient in a south Mumbai hospital. Dr. Mehta claimed that this is first such TAVR procedure in India, carried out in October last year.

“The carotid artery supplies blood to the brain and any mishap with that could have led to a massive brain stroke,” said Dr. Mehta. It was also a high-risk case because the patient had earlier undergone a kidney transplant and also had diabetes, he said.

Aortic stenosis, which the 65-year-old man was suffering from, is a common valve disease. “When the aortic valve gets degenerated and starts narrowing, it restricts the flow of blood to the body, putting an additional burden on the heart to pump the blood. It can lead to symptoms like chest pain, fainting and breathlessness and after the development of these symptoms, the life expectancy is six months to two years,” Dr. Mehta said.

The cost of TAVR ranges from ₹25 lakh to ₹30 lakh in a private set-up. Affordability is thus a major factor in TAVR procedures.

“TAVR can be offered only to those who can bear the cost. A few hundred TAVR operations are conducted in the country every year but those through the carotid artery are rare,” said Dr. N.O. Bansal, cardiologist from the State-run J.J. Hospital.

Cardiologist Dr. Prafulla Kerkar from KEM Hospital agreed. “It is rare to carry out the procedure through the carotid artery and is commendable. Although the carotid artery is one of the ways, preventing a stroke is a major challenge,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cjot4k/article30805370.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13bm-Dr-A-B-Mehta,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/city-doctor-conducts-rare-surgery-through-carotid-artery/article30805372.ece

“We have taken a decision that the national anthem should be sung before college proceedings begin everyday. This will come into effect from February 19, on the occasion of Shiv Jayanti [birth anniversary of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj]. A letter pertaining to this directive will be sent to all the colleges,” Mr. Samant said.

The anthem will also be played at various programmes organised at college and university levels, said Mr. Samant,

“The decision to make the singing of the national anthem mandatory in colleges was taken unanimously… even if the attendance in colleges is 50% on a given day, no less than 15 lakh students would be singing the anthem before the start of classes,” said Mr. Samant, during his visit to the College of Engineering Pune (COEP) to take stock of new initiatives being undertaken by the institution.

Late last month, speaking at a function in Mumbai’s Elphinstone College, Mr. Samant had already made it clear that a directive would be soon be issued by the State government making it compulsory for educational establishments across the Maharashtra to sing the national anthem before commencement of classes.

380,2020/02/13,5-day week for government employees in Maharashtra from month-end,"Cabinet decides to increase working hours by 45 minutes on weekdays

In a bid to increase efficiency and reduce costs, the State government has decided to implement a five-day week for its employees from the month-end. The State Cabinet on Wednesday also decided to increase the working hours by 45 minutes on weekdays.

According to Central government guidelines, the five-day week has so far been implemented in Rajasthan, Bihar, Punjab, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. Maharashtra’s five-day week proposal will help the government save on electricity, water, diesel vehicles and petrol.

The move will also allow government employees to raise their living standards by spending more time with their families.

“This proposal has been pending for a long time. We are happy the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi government has implemented it,” said Cabinet Minister and Sena leader Eknath Shinde.

Under the new schedule, government employees will have to work for eight hours a day, 176 hours a month, 2,112 hours a year. A government official said, “Currently, the average working days in a year is 288. The work hours are seven hours 15 minutes per day, excluding 30 minutes of meal time. This leads to 174 working hours a month and 2,088 working hours a year. The extra work time will make up for the loss of working hours on Saturday and Sunday.”

Senior officials said the new working hours won’t be applicable for services deemed essential that come either under the Factory Act or the Industrial Dispute Act. They include government hospitals, police, prisons, water supply projects, fire brigade, cleaning workers. educational institutions, government colleges, medical colleges, schools, and technological institutions.

Other essential services include water resources workshops in Dapodi, Satara, Wardha, Akola, Ahmednagar, Ashti, Khadakwasla, Nashik and Nanded; regular establishment of regional works and projects under Central Resources and Water Resources and Public Departments in Nagpur and Bhandara; and regional workers on permanent and temporary employment.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/80hj3i/article30805324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMMANTRALAYAWORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5-day-week-for-government-employees-from-month-end/article30805325.ece
381,2020/02/13,Treat toys as essential commodity: retailers,"‘Revoke proposed hike in import duty’

The newly-formed United Toys Association of Mumbai (UTAM) has, in the wake of a proposed hike of 200% in import duty on toys, demanded that the government treat toys as an essential commodity having similar relevance for a child as an educational book.

Toy retailers in the city have come together to form UTAM to appeal to the government to revoke the proposed hike in import duty on toys to 60% from 20%. The association said the proposed hike of 200% in import duty on toys has left it with no option but to voice dissent.

“India imports 85% toys in the industry annually, of which 75% are from China. This step of proposing a 200% hike in import duty on toys has been a shock,” said Abdullah Sharif, vice-president, UTAM. In the past two years, import duty on toys has been increased by around 500%, he said. “This step will make toys unaffordable, decreasing sales tremendously and adversely affecting the livelihood of millions of people employed in the toy industry across India.”

UTAM said the Indian toy industry does not have a viable ecosystem to support toy production on a large scale in the country. It said domestic toy manufacturers contribute around 15% of the toys in the Indian market, and by curbing the import of toys, the toy business in India will suffer a major setback.

“Toys shops all over India shall not be able to sustain the blow of such a hike. This step will adversely affect more than one lakh retailers across India. A high duty will make toys unaffordable for the masses, resulting in closure of the businesses and a spur in of unemployment,” the association said.

UTAM also requested the government to treat toys as an essential commodity, having similar relevance for a child as an education book. STEM toys, flying toys, role-play toys, coding toys and model kits are now available over the world, and are considered to be educational tools teaching children the principles of science and enhancing their cognitive skills. Different kinds of role-play toys create aspirations among children to be pilots, scientists, doctors, engineers, astronauts and politicians, UTAM said in a statement.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a3oxf/article30805306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMTOYS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/treat-toys-as-essential-commodity-retailers/article30805307.ece

The National Alliance Against CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act), NRC (National Register of Citizens) and NPR (National Population Register) on Wednesday announced its biggest agitation in Mumbai to be held on Saturday.

‘MahaMorcha’ will be held from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. at Azad Maidan. The protest expects the support from various politicians from the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress.

Retd. Justice Kolse Patil, convener of the Maharashtra chapter of the alliance, at a press conference on Wednesday said, “It is not just Muslims but all poor people, OBCs, SCs and STs who will be adversely affected by CAA, NRC and NPR.”

The alliance members are visiting Buddha vihars, guruduwaras and NGOs in order to reach out to all communities and mobilise people for the agitation. Hasib Bhatkar, co-convener of the alliance, said, “There is panic in the country because of the wrong narrative that there are one crore intruders in Assam. Whereas the reality was contrary to this.”

Mr. Bhatkar said the census data is confidential, but data collected through NPR is transferable. “It can be shared with any one and is a threat to our privacy. NPR is also the first step to NRC. Therefore, we request the Maharashtra government to take a stand against it and ask the Centre to upgrade the data collected in 2010,” he said. Mr. Bhatkar pointed out that the government data mentions that 38% of the public does not have proper documents. “Then how are they expected to prove their citizenship?” he asked.

Maulana Aijaz Kashmiri, another co-convener, said the alliance did not belong to a single community. He urged people from every part of the city and from all the religions, castes and creed to join the protest. Advocate Rakesh Rathod, another co-convener, said it doesn’t matter which party passed the laws as the alliance is against the laws, not the political party.

“The government hasn’t yet explained the use of NPR. The boundaries of Bangladesh and Pakistan are not completely sealed. Once the count is done and NPR is prepared, the intruders will enter from the very next day. The people from backward classes and poor people, who work hard daily and earn wages, will get stuck in procedures and documentation and will not be able to provide basic necessities to their families,” he said.

At least one of three agencies passed an adverse remark on the product Notesheet Plus that promised to put in place a paperless office system at a certain cost.

The agencies approached by Mr. Barve’s son Sumukh and wife Sharmila were Maharastra State Security Corporation (MSSC), and Information Technology (IT) and Assessment departments of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).

On September 30, 2019, it sent a proposal to the State government, offering pro bono (work undertaken voluntarily and without payment) services to provide a paperless office system to the Mumbai Police. A copy of the proposal was marked to the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) and was approved before Assembly elections. in October.

Sources in the BMC told The Hindu that the consultant M/s KPMG Global had passed an adverse remark as did the then Director, IT, BMC, who was not in favour of ‘bypassing norms’. However, higher ups continued to build pressure to approve the product.

“I had clearly told my seniors even if it was Prime Minister’s or President’s son, this product could not be approved without following the due processes. There was immense pressure to clear it but I did not approve the product despite a complaint by Sumukh Barve to my seniors,” said a senior BMC official. The product did not go through in the IT department, but was later passed on to BMC’s Assessment department, which too did not like it. CrispQ later approached MSSC to successfully receive a work order.

385,2020/02/13,BEST conductor injured after slipping in double decker bus,"Administration endangering lives of staff: committee member

A conductor with the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking sustained leg injuries after falling inside a double decker bus, while it was plying on route no. 415 from Andheri station to SEEPZ. The route is one of four where BEST has assigned a single conductor on double decker buses.

The incident occurred on Tuesday around 8.30 a.m. “The bus was on its way from Andheri station to SEEPZ. I had finished issuing all the tickets on the top level and was climbing down when I slipped and injured my left leg,” Sunil Gaikwad, the conductor, said.

Mr. Gaikwad said since the implementation of the single conductor policy, his workload had increased tremendously.

After an industrial court refused to stay the administration’s plan to run double decker buses with only one conductor, the BEST selected four routes to implement the same — Spl 1, BKC (Bandra Kurla Complex) 1, BKC 3 and 415. All of them are short routes and provide feeder services from stations to a commercial hub.

The BEST has nearly 120 double decker buses in its fleet. “This is just the beginning. The administration is endangering the lives of passengers and its staff,” BEST committee member Sunil Ganacharya said.

A BEST official said having one conductor was the only way to reduce the current deficit. “For the double decker buses at BKC, we needed to deploy 63 conductors. Now the figure is 40. The routes contribute nearly ₹30 lakh revenue per month, but the salaries of the conductors itself is the same,” he said.

“The transport commissioner has given permission to run conductor-less operations on buses which have closed doors. However, they have been running all buses in complete contravention of the permissions,” Jagnarayan Gupta, BEST Kamgar Sanghatana, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/86iwh5/article30805074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13bm-BEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/best-conductor-injured-after-slipping-in-double-decker-bus/article30805075.ece
386,2020/02/13,"Transplant coordinators are the mid-way helpers for families, public hospitals","Coordinators work in private hospitals but are co-opted to help with paperwork, counselling and facilitating the process in State-run hospitals

Transplant coordinator Bhavana Shah was at a restaurant in Ghatkopar having dinner with friends when her phone rang last Friday. A member from the Zonal Transplant Coordination Centre (ZTCC) informed her about a potential organ donor, a 25-year-old severely injured accident victim, admitted to the State-run JJ Hospital in Byculla.

Ms. Shah, who is attached to the Mumbai Central’s Wockhardt Hospital, was asked to step in to counsel the family and hand hold the doctors and staff at the hospital with the procedures. She left her dinner mid-way and went to Byculla to facilitate the organ donation. As it happened, the donation gave a new lease of life to five critically-ill patients, including a seven-month-old baby who was transplanted with a small part of the donor’s liver. It also marked the second organ donation in a public hospital this year.

“Since organ donations are not happening in public hospitals, they don’t know all the procedures and documentation,” said Ms. Shah, who counselled the family about the noble cause, the procedures involved and the time it requires. She also helped the doctors with the documentation like the family consent form, brain stem death certification and a no objection certificate.

A transplant coordinator for the past 16 years, Ms. Shah said counselling the family is one of the main tasks but they also have to be prepared for the time involved in the coordination, medical examinations, allotment and retrieval of organs.

“Relatives are under the impression that it will be a quick procedure after they give their consent. But the entire process takes a lot of time, starting from two apnea tests (a mandatory examination for determining brain death) in a gap of six hours to cross matching and coordinating with the other hospitals who have recipients on the waiting list,” she said.

What is ZTCC?

The ZTCC is a State government agency that coordinates organ-sharing between hospitals, and its member are hospitals in Mumbai and Thane that are registered to carry out transplants. The ZTCC has senior doctors at its helm and manages a list of patients on the waiting list for various organs. After the Human Organ Transplantation Act was passed in 1994 in India and Maharashtra adopted it in 1995, government officials and senior doctors thought it was important to regulate transplants at various levels. ZTCCs were proposed in four cities: Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad. The ZTCC in Mumbai was formed in 2000.

When the organ donation programme started in 1997 (the first transplant with a cadaver kidney was carried out at Sion hospital), all donations in the first three years were from public hospitals: KEM, Sion and Nair. Thereafter, contributions from the public hospitals became rare. For example, Mumbai recorded the highest number —79 — organ donations in 2019, and all were from private hospitals. While JJ Hospital last recorded an organ donation in 2017, KEM Hospital recorded one in 2016.

The year 2020, however, started on a positive note, with KEM Hospital contributing to the pool of organs in January after the family of a 52-year-old man who had suffered from a stroke, consented to donate his organs. To facilitate the donation, the ZTCC called in Rahul Wasnik, a transplant coordinator attached to Global Hospital in Parel.

“The family had shown willingness but they had many queries. I sat them down and answered everything,” said Mr. Wasnik, who was at home in Belapur when he got the call at 8.15 p.m. on a Sunday. He was at the hospital in Parel by 10.30 p.m. “Since the paperwork and coordination was new for KEM doctors, I helped them,” said Mr. Wasnik, a transplant coordinator for the past six years.

The ZTCC is willing to provide coordinators and even train the doctors and nurses from public hospitals who show willingness to carry out organ donations. “At present, we borrow transplant coordinators from private hospitals to facilitate donations in public set-ups. Since private hospitals are a part of the programme, the process is smooth and one doesn’t have to wait for extra permissions. That’s the beauty of the system,” said Dr. S.K. Mathur, president, ZTCC.

“But if public hospitals show willingness, we can provide them with a small group of coordinators. We can also get funding for them so that the public hospitals are not burdened,” he said.

ZTCC’s former president Dr. Gustad Dave said if organ donations in public hospitals can be sustained, it is a very good sign. “So many lives can be saved with donated organs,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kt8jv1/article30805028.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13bmTransplant-coordinatirs1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/transplant-coordinators-are-the-mid-way-helpers-for-families-public-hospitals/article30805029.ece
387,2020/02/13,"Indian fashion world loses pioneering, multifaceted designer Wendell Rodricks","Wendell Rodricks — Padma Shri awardee, environmentalist and tireless supporter of LGBTQI+ rights — was best known for infusing modern aesthetics with traditional Goan influences

Fashion designer Wendell Rodricks passed away at his home in Colvale village in Goa on Wednesday evening at the age of 59. A champion of his home State and its textile traditions, Rodricks was hard at work on his dream project: Moda Goa — a museum dedicated to the history of Goan costumes, which is slated to open in March. His most recent Instagram post was a series of photos documenting work at the museum.

A Padma Shri award-winning designer and best known for infusing modern aesthetics with traditional Goan influences, Rodricks was also an environmentalist and tireless supporter of LGBTQI+ rights. An animal lover, he had recently adopted two stray puppies from a local shelter. Apart from fashion, he was also an author, and had written Moda Goa - History and Style, his memoir The Green Room, and Poskem: Goans in the Shadows.

The news of Rodricks’s death was received with shock by attendees at Lakme Fashion Week (LFW). “The entire fashion industry is shocked. People did notice a little change in his health, but nobody realised it will lead to this. It’s too sudden. He was a legend,” Fashion Design Council of India chairman Sunil Sethi said on the sidelines of the ongoing LFW in Mumbai.

Born in Mumbai, Rodricks studied fashion designing in the U.S. and France from 1986 to 1988. He is often credited for pioneering the concept of ‘resort wear’ when it was not a popular idea in India. He worked on the planning of the first ever Lakme India Fashion Week and often showcased his collections at subsequent editions. In 2010, he revived the weaving of the traditional Goan Kunbi sari and showcased the design at the Wills Lifestyle India Fashion Week.

Rodricks is described in warm brushstrokes by all who knew him. His neighbour and friend from Colvale, designer Gopika Chowfla, said it was a shock to hear of his demise, “He seemed to have been ailing in a dignified manner.” Supermodel Sheetal Mallar, who has worked with him for more than two decades, said, “He was a very generous friend and host. His home was like an open house – a bundle of love.” Photographer Rafique Sayed said, “I could write a book about him. He was an amazing person who was supremely talented and gave me a lot of freedom. I worked with him for more 25 years.” Mr. Sayed, who had just photographed Rodricks’ latest collection two weeks ago, lamented that his friend and colleague would not see the fruition of his dream – Moda Goa. His second cousins, Mumbai-based Anil and Laxmi Lobo, credited Rodricks with maintaining family ties, “He was a trained chef and loved to cook and feed people. He would make an effort to reach out and keep in touch.”

Rodricks lived in Goa with his life partner, Jerome Marrel.

In memoriam

Onir, filmmaker: We have worked together professionally, but we were also friends. And our friendship was also about being out and proud about our identities. He’s been one of the few voices in the fashion industry that speaks up. He also designed the clothes for my film [Shab]. He’d always tell me, “Anything you want to do, I’ll be there for you.” Without charging anything and he would send me things from his personal wardrobe knowing that I am an independent filmmaker. He’d been telling me for years to come and spend time with him in Goa, and this November I actually did it. He was as always absolutely loving and pampering. Knowing that I love food and he would teach me his recipes. What is really sad is that his dream project, the Museum of Goan Costumes, is almost ready. He took me through the entire house and showed me all the things he has collected over the years. It’s really sad that he won’t be there when the museum will be inaugurated. He’s always been so kind and full of love. He was such a giving person and full of life.

Sridhar Rangayan, filmmaker and founder Festival Director of Kashish Mumbai Queer Film Festival: It is quite shocking to learn about Wendell Rodricks passing away. The news is yet to sink in as just a few days ago I was interacting with him. He chose the winner of the Kashish poster contest two weeks ago. I can’t yet believe this news can be true. He was such a giant of a man, so full of compassion and love. He was a champion of the rights of the LGBTQ community and lived by example. We have lost a great human being and a very dear friend. Myself and the entire Kashish team mourns his demise.

Apurva Asrani, filmmaker: Wendell was an extremely kind and generous soul. When he was at the top of his game as a designer, he made clothes for plus size women, referring to them as voluptuous goddesses. He worked bravely for LGBTQ rights and gave people like me hope for long lasting same-sex relationships. He was a fine author and created magic with his book Poskem. He was a reservoir of knowledge and spoke eloquently about arts, politics and culture. He was a gifted musician, and as you can [in] this video, sang with so much passion. He was an animal lover and having observed his bond with his Boxer, Sophie, I knew her death last month would have broken his heart. But he was not the kind to mope, to stop, to give up. He marched on and fought the good fight. He was working really hard to realise the dream of his Moda Goa museum, his gift to Goa, for which he gave up his own home and years of his life. He looked exhausted from all the roadblocks that come with starting something so ambitious in India, but he never stopped being the kind and loving friend that he was. India has lost a wonderful artist and human being ... and I have lost a very dear friend. I will miss you deeply dear, Wendell. Now enjoy your ‘Summertime’ for eternity.

Payal Khandwala, designer: I’m so sad to hear of Wendell’s sudden passing... and in spite of our differences in the recent past, I have always held him in high esteem as a teacher and designer. This is a big loss not just for his family and friends, but also his students and the entire fashion fraternity. He is in my thoughts and prayers. His sharp wit, humour, talent and generosity will certainly be missed.

Ujjwala Raut, NYC-based supermodel

I have known him since I was 18. I have stayed in his house so many times, with his many cats and all the food and parties. We would sit on his terrace and have all-night conversations. His house was open to all. He introduced me to everyone in Goa. He was family.

He was a gentle soul and nothing got to him. He always kept it together. As for his clothes, he knew how to make women look breathtaking. They were so minimal. When I had my De Beers shoot at 18, I was new to the industry. He sensed that I was uncomfortable [about having men adjust my clothes; it took a few years to get used to that!]. He would tell me kindly, ‘If you are not cool with it, please do it yourself’. He never gave you an attitude just because you were being paid to do his shoot. He was almost parental, during the million shoots we did, him and Farrokh [Chothia]. I don’t think he ever made anyone’s life uncomfortable. He came up with the name for my daughter, Ksha. I’m so glad she got to meet him at least once [in Pune]. I still can’t believe he is gone. It was always good to know that people like him existed, who helped without thinking of what they could get out of you. We have to treasure those moments now. Wendell was such a gentle human being, had a lot of respect for others, valued his space, and was fun … he was a Gemini, perhaps why I could relate to him!

Neeta Lulla, fashion designer

There was a touch of humanism in his work, and his fabrics. You saw his heart in it. He was a great teacher when he taught with me and Hemant [Trivedi]. He taught very easily [a class on the history of world costumes at SNDT Women’s University] and made it a point that they understood him.

Much later, he would reach out every month at least, with a message or a call. Every time I visited Goa, he would lay out a huge spread. And no matter when you last met him, he was one of those people who would take up easily where we left off. Today, you don’t see that with many people. My prayers go out to Jerome [Marrel] and his family. It is a really sad day for the industry.

Sheetal Sharma, Bangalore-based Show Director

I began my career as a choreographer with him, and he was an angel to deal with. I used to feel like a fool sometimes when things weren’t going the way it should. He would step in, make a few small tweaks and turn the choreography around. And he never took the limelight. He trusted me with his Goa Carnival show. He took Anushka Sharma to Mumbai for her first show there, and that was the beginning for her. He was a real person, a veteran gone too soon.

Nina Manuel, former model now based in the U.K.

I first met him in 1995 and went on to open and close many shows for him. His shows and shoots were so futuristic, but not in an alien way. I recall a shoot with him and Farrokh, with me coming out of a Louis Vuitton suitcase…it was fabulous! I’ve never seen Wendell stressed out. His shows and shoots were always fun, comfortable and light-hearted. And his partner Jerome was equally down to earth. Right from one of the first Fashion Weeks in Mumbai, I recall that he never had a fitting issue and knew exactly who would wear what. He had a great eye. I still have many of his clothes; they made me feel like a complete woman. When I moved to New York, he introduced me to many people. Even after my modelling years, he maintained a relationship when there was no benefit to him. Conversations with him never changed. Loved seeing his photos of his travels and his recipes on Facebook. And he didn’t just open his home to us, but that of his friends too, like Mario Miranda.

388,2020/02/13,"Fliers from Japan, S. Korea to be screened for Covid-19","Over 27,000 fliers checked so far

Mumbai airport on Wednesday extended compulsory thermal screening of passengers for signs of coronavirus, now officially known as Covid-19 by the World Health Organisation, to those coming from Japan and South Korea as well.

This will be in addition to passengers arriving from China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore. Mumbai International Airport Ltd. said it had till date screened 27,894 passengers with no case being detected. Between Tuesday and Wednesday, doctors from the Airport Health Organisation (AHO) screened 2112 passengers from 16 flights.

The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) has been thermal-screening passengers from January 18. All Nippon Airways operates one flight between Mumbai and Tokyo, while Korean Airlines flies from Mumbai to Seoul.

In case any traveller is detected with the symptoms in question, the passenger will be shifted to Kasturba Hospital, the designated isolation hospital earmarked for CSMIA, on the AHO team’s advice.

The AHO team in Mumbai has activated a health counter and thermal scanners at the pre-immigration area for the arriving passengers.

Signages have also been put up asking passengers arriving from any place other than mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, Japan and Korea but who might have travelled to any of these areas recently, to report to the doctors.

“Thermal cameras are effective only to the point of knowing who has a higher body temperature or is running a fever. It may not mean the person is infected with the virus. Studying thermal images is also not as simple as observing a camera image. It requires training and understanding of thermal colours and their patterns,” an airport official said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fliers-from-japan-s-korea-to-be-screened-for-covid-19/article30804959.ece
389,2020/02/13,What procedure is followed on pleas seeking ban on outfits?: Bombay HC,"Two-judge Bench was hearing a petition for banning Sanatan Sanstha

The Bombay High Court on Wednesday sought to know from the Union government what procedure is followed before deciding on a representation seeking ban on an outfit for alleged unlawful activities.

A Division Bench of Justices R.V. More and S.P. Tavade was hearing a petition filed by one Arshad Ali Ansari, seeking a direction to the Maharashtra government and the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to ban activities of the right wing organisation Sanatan Sanstha.

Mr. Ansari, in his petition, claimed that he filed a representation before the State and the Central government in September 2018, seeking that a ban be imposed on Sanatan Sanstha under Section 3 of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

However, till date there has not been any response.

On Wednesday, the State government informed the Bench that the competent authority to decide was the Union Ministry of Home Affairs.

The Union government, however, told the court that the State government will have to first send a report on its findings on the outfit, after which the MHA will look into the issue.

“What is the procedure that is normally followed? Show us that procedure,” the court said and posted the petition for further hearing on March 4.

As per Mr. Ansari’s plea, filed by advocate Rajesh Khobragade, the Sanatan Sanstha’s name cropped up in some bomb blast cases in Maharashtra, and in the killings of rationalist Narendra Dabholkar and activist Govind Pansare.

“Members of the Sanatan Sanstha have been arrested for allegedly planting bombs in auditoriums at Thane and Vashi,” the plea said.

The petition has sought a direction to the State and the Centre to decide Ansari’s representation at the earliest and ban the Sanatan Sanstha.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kzjvuf/article30804930.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BMBOMBAYHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/what-procedure-is-followed-on-pleas-seeking-ban-on-outfits-bombay-hc/article30804931.ece
390,2020/02/13,Class X boy who ran away fearing low maths score lands in Chennai,"Police get him after he called home from someone’s cell phone

A Class X student from Khar Pethambe in Poynad, Alibaug, who had run away from home fearing that he would not get a good score in mathematics in the board examinations, has been brought back from Chennai by the police.

Saahil Patil (15) was found missing on February 5 by his mother. “At 6.15 a.m. every day, he goes to tuition, then to school, again to tuition, and then comes home. On that day, he did not have school but tuition. When I came back from work in the evening, I did not find him at home. I called his tuition teacher but he said that my son had not shown up for the tuition,” Swati Patil, Saahil’s mother, said.

Panicked, she started looking for him everywhere. “I looked for him at the theatre and called our relatives in Mumbai, but no one had any clue. Later in the day, I filed a case of kidnapping with the Poynad police,” she said.

On the night of February 6, Saahil rang up home and said that he was at a railway station in Chennai. “We heaved a sigh of relief when we heard his voice. He had borrowed someone’s cell phone to call me. I spoke to the man and he told me that he would hand over Saahil to the child help centre at the railway station,” Ms. Patil said.

A team consisting of assistant police inspector Suhas Avhad and constable Vijay Mhatre from Poynad police station, Saahil’s father Vilas Patil, and advocate Prathamesh Patil left for Chennai and after completing the formalities came back with the boy on Sunday.

“We took him into confidence, and after a lot of talking, he finally opened up. He said that he was not good in maths and since his board exams were due next month, he was afraid that he would score less and felt like leaving home,” Mr. Mhatre said.

After leaving the house on February 5, Saahil took a ST bus to Rewas and from there he went to Bhaucha Dhakka via boat. He then reached Lokmanya Tilak Terminus and got into the next available train, which was for Chennai. “While leaving home, as usual he had taken his tiffin box. He was given food at the help centre. He had never travelled alone anywhere and we never thought he could travel that far. We are glad that he did not end up in wrong hands,” Ms. Patil said.

While Ms. Patil works in a bag manufacturing unit owned by her brother-in-law, her husband works in Mumbai at a private firm and comes home once in a week. Ms. Patil said they had never pressured Saahil for studies and he had always scored more than 70% marks.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/class-x-boy-who-ran-away-fearing-low-maths-score-lands-in-chennai/article30804885.ece
391,2020/02/13,Society warns members against bogus official of health scheme,"Ayushman Bharat officer orders visit to Wadala building, suggests police complaint

Acting on rumours that an unidentified man, who claims to be attached to the Ayushman Bharat, is collecting thumb impressions of people, a housing society in Wadala’s Bhakti Park has issued a circular cautioning its 165 residents.

The manager of Odyssey Cooperative Housing Society said in the circular that the man carries a laptop, biometric machine, and claims to be from the Home Ministry.

“I got to know about such a person going on house visits. Therefore, I immediately warned the residents of my building,” said manager Nikhil Pawar, clarifying that they have not witnessed any such incident in their building as yet.

The circular said the unidentified person also carries a list of names of people and enters the premises stating that he has come to collect the photo and fingerprints for the Ayushman Bharat.

“All are requested to be alert and do not allow such person to enter the society. The same have been reported bogus with a aim to looting people (sic),” it said.

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) under the Ayushman Bharat is a medical insurance scheme for the poor, which covers a family for up to ₹5 lakh per year for secondary and tertiary hospitalisation.

Dr. Sudhakar Shinde, chief executive officer of the Mahatma Phule Jan Arogya Yojana that is integrated with PMJAY in Maharashtra, said staff from common service centres do visit households in remote areas and slums. “They mainly reach out to people working in unorganised sectors. The upper class is not the beneficiary of the scheme and therefore there is no question of anyone visiting such buildings.”

He also said, “I have asked one of my staff to visit the society. They should lodge a police complaint because someone is using the name of the scheme as a pretext for entering the premises.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/o0qpsa/article30804828.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13bmayushman-stry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/society-warns-members-against-bogus-official-of-health-scheme/article30804794.ece
392,2020/02/13,Haji Ali set to get a ₹35-crore makeover,"Mughal garden, healthcare centre planned; demolition of illegal shops a challenge

The State government wants to beautify the area around Haji Ali dargah at a cost of around ₹35 crore. The plan includes a revamp of the pathway leading to the shrine, a Mughal garden, beautification of the entrance, demolition of illegal shops, licensed shops and a healthcare centre.

The Bombay High Court, while hearing a petition by socio-legal and educational forum Sahayak Trust, had ordered the formation of a joint task force to remove encroachments on the approach road to the dargah.

In August 2017, the Supreme Court ordered authorities to take a final decision in the matter related to beautification of the dargah’s premises. It had directed the collector to take a final decision on the beautification plan submitted by the trust, either by accepting it or by modifying it. It had directed the authorities to place the plan before the SC Bench along with an affidavit and execute it before the end of that year.

Three years have passed but the plan has not yet been finalised. Authorities are hopeful it will be done soon. Mumbai City Guardian Minister Aslam Shaikh held a meeting with relevant officials on Wednesday in the matter and asked them to expedite the process of securing permissions and start execution.

“We have proposed beautification of the entire premises at a cost of ₹30 crore to ₹35 crore. The existing reclaimed area around the dargah will be utilised for creation of various amenities for the people so that visitors can pray and later spend time on the premises that overlooks the sea,” said Mr. Shaikh.

The plan consists of a Mughal-style garden, health centre, and a revamped entrance on the lines of a Buland Darwaza.

The existing pathway will be paved again and the premises will have a themed archway but the biggest challenge will be the demolition of unauthorised structures and creation of a vending zone. In 2017, 908 sq. m. of the premises were encroached upon.

“We are hopeful that we will get all the necessary permissions as the revamp was proposed in 2016. The shrine sees tourists from across the world and it is not only a religious site but also a tourist attraction. We want to streamline hawkers and demolish encroachments first. Hopefully, this plan will be approved soon,” said Mohammad Ahmed Tahir, administrative officer of the trust.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lstt0g/article30804787.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13bmhaliali2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/haji-ali-set-to-get-a-35-crore-makeover/article30804752.ece
393,2020/02/13,"Builder forges papers to claim 80 acres, arrested","More than a year after a case of forgery and cheating was filed against Bhupendra Shah, director of Bhumiraj developers, the police arrested him on Wednesday. He was produced before a Panvel court which remanded him in police custody till February 15.

Ashok Dudhe, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone II, said they had already arrested four people, including a talathi from Karjat, in the case.

On December 3, 2018, Vikram Bhange, an official of Regal Habitat Pvt. Ltd., had filed a complaint with the Nhava Sheva police against Haroon Aleem Yusuf, chairman of Mohammad Yusuf trust in Panvel, Mr. Shah, Ramesh Bhalerao (54), a talathi from Karjat, and others.

According to the complaint, Abdul Patel, an official of the trust, had entered into a lease agreement for a 80-acre land at Gavhan in Nhava Sheva with Regal Habitat in 1998. While the complainant’s firm was the official lease owners of the land, it learnt in 2007 of Mr. Shah’s claims that he had purchased the land in 1995 for ₹4 lakh.

Mr. Bhange alleged that Mr. Yusuf had made a conveyance deed with Mr. Shah using back-dated papers of 1995, and to make the conveyance deed with the trust, Mr. Shah had produced a farmer’s certificate which said that he was a farmer and had an agricultural land in Latur. Mr. Bhalerao had allegedly posed as a witness for Mr. Shah to get the farmer’s certificate.

“To procure the farmer’s certificate, an agricultural land was purchased in Latur using a fake farmer who signed as Mr. Shah. We had arrested the fake farmer as well. Using the certificate Mr. Shah made the conveyance deed. The photo and signature on the farmer’s certificate is different from the one on the conveyance deed which shows that the ‘Bhupendra Shah’ who purchased the agricultural land in Latur is different from the one who did the deed,” Mr. Dudhe said.

The accused who were arrested earlier were Anil Sawant (45), Krishna Gawli (35), Mr. Bhalerao, and Satish Shirke (47). While Mr. Bhalerao and Mr. Shirke were arrested on December 6, 2019, Mr. Sawant and Mr. Gawli were arrested on December 20 and December 21, 2019.

395,2020/02/13,22 Bangladeshi nationals held for staying illegally in Palghar,"None of them could produce proof of citizenship, say police

The anti-terrorism squad and the anti-human trafficking unit of the Palghar police on Wednesday morning arrested 22 Bangladeshi nationals who were staying illegally in Rajodi village in Palghar district.

According to the police, 12 men and 10 women were arrested from a temporary settlement near Pardhi Wadi. They have been charged under the Indian Passport Act 1920 and the Foreign Act 1946 for entering the country without passports and building temporary huts for settlement.

“We received a tip-off that several Bangladeshi nationals are living in the jurisdiction of Arnala police station by constructing temporary huts. We raided their residences at 1.30 a.m and arrested 22 people who could not present any citizenship proof,” police inspector Bhaskar Pukale, in-charge, anti-human trafficking unit, said.

“We have found that the accused are from different districts in Bangladesh. Some have illegally settled in the area for the last few months while some have been living there for years,” he said. The accused were in the age group of 19 to 52.

According to assistant police inspector Mansingh Patil from the anti-terrorism squad, when they raided the village, the resident began showing them one or two proofs of identify that proved their citizenship. “However, the 22 accused could not present a single document. We also checked their call logs and found regular calls made on Bangladeshi phone numbers using various mobile applications.”

He also said, “Many of them insisted that they were Indians and their documents were kept at their home towns but after interrogating them till the morning, all of them confessed that they were from Bangladesh.”

Padalkar, who is slated to retire on February 28 this year.

Six people were killed and over 100 sustained injuries when an explosive device strapped to a motorcycle went off near a mosque in Malegaon, a town in north Maharashtra, on September 29, 2008.

The six-page letter said the trial in the blasts case was moving at snail’s pace before Judge Padalkar took over. It said the accused were ‘high-profile personalities’ like Member of Parliament Pragya Singh Thakur, Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit, Sameer Kulkarni, retired Major Ramesh Upadhyay, Sudhakar Chaturvedi and Ajay Rahilkar, and, “despite immense effort by accused persons to derail the trial, the present presiding officer, Judge V Padalkar, has managed to depose 140 prosecution witnesses in a fair and just manner. There is no complaint against him even by the accused persons.”

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Wednesday agreed to probe the donation by Vedanta Ltd. to India Vision Foundation, an NGO.

Replying to a statement made by government whip R.K.R. Anantharaman during a discussion on the resolution on declaring Karaikal and Bahour as protected agriculture zones, the Chief Minister said the government was not aware of the owner of the foundation. The government would hold a detailed probe, he said.

Mr. Anantharaman said the NGO had received ₹2 crore from Vedanta Group at a time when the Union Territory was opposing the hydrocarbon exploration project by the company.

Displaying an annual report of India Vision in the House, he said, “Everyone knows who founded the NGO. The person is holding a constitutional position in the U.T. and has been championing environmental causes.”

Seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Anantharaman said the government should find out whether the donation was linked to sanctioning of hydrocarbon exploration project to Vedanta in the Union Territory.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/qk9aw2/article30804998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THPONDYCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/cm-promises-probe-into-vedantas-donation-to-ngo/article30804999.ece
399,2020/02/13,Pondicherry Heritage Festival comes to an end,"One of the significant outcomes of the event is the initiation of a process to make a bid for Unesco world heritage city status

After stirring the melting pot of Franco-Indian culture over an event-packed three weeks, the sixth Pondicherry Heritage Festival 2020 drew to a close on Tuesday, with a reception hosted by the French Consulate, a posthumous honouring of a French historian, and a changing of guard that will see youth drive the future editions of the festival.

PHF 2020, which was launched on January 25 with a bio-play, Bharathi Yaar based on Mahakavi Subramania Bharati, who had sought refuge in the city during the freedom struggle, had featured an eclectic mix of events. The experience included events focused on the natural heritage of the city, ranging from heritage quiz and painting contests for children, heritage walk, cycle rides in town and out to the suburban waterbodies, street play, food trail, music and dance.

One of the significant outcomes of the festival was the initiation of a process to make a bid for Unesco world heritage city status.

The process of framing a dossier kicked off with a preliminary meeting involving Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar, Unesco Director Eric Falt, Town and Country Planning secretary Mahesh Kumar and architect Rabindra Vasavada, who was involved in Ahmedabad’s Unesco application exercise.

“It’s a long journey ahead, but an important first step nonetheless,” said French Consul General Catherine Suard.

“From next year, we would like to raise PHF to the level of a regional festival involving not just Puducherry but Auroville, Villupuram and Cuddalore,” said Sunaina Mandeen of PondyCan.

It is also proposed to maintain a continuum of heritage-based events through the year, she added.

Since 2015, when the People for Pondicherry’s Heritage, PondyCan and INTACH joined hands to conceive the first festival as a community-involved effort to preserve the city’s unique heritage, the festival has grown in terms of volunteer proportions, diversity of experience and community outreach. The Department of Tourism, French Institute of Pondicherry and the Alliance Francaise have been supporting the effort.

The idea of the PHF was triggered by the fall of the 144-year-old Mairie, a French-era seat of municipal administration in 2014, and the urgency to evolve a collective campaign to preserve the city’s heritage from ruin, she noted.

“The festival has been a volunteer-driven effort and it is heartening to see the involvement of so many youngsters coming up with imaginative ideas and work tirelessly to manage the events,” Ms. Mandeen said.

One of the high points of the evening was the awarding of the ‘Guardian of Pondicherry’s Heritage’ plaque.

In the presence of Ms. Suard, Janine Deloche received this year’s plaque awarded posthumously to her spouse and historian Jean Deloche from V. Nallam, the title’s first recipient.

The citation presented by Kakoli Banerjee of People for Pondicherry’s Heritage, summed up the contributions of the luminary.

Jean Deloche, who was senior associate member of Ecole Française d’Extrême Orient (EFEO) (French School of the Far East), and French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP), and later the Director of Alliance Française of Madras, was conferred with the Hirayama Prize by the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres, Paris.

His first publications focused on the history of traffic in India (chariots, boats), and especially that of transport routes, including a memorable study on Indian bridges. For the place he called home, the historian created a CD documentary, ‘Pondicherry Past and Present’, detailing the history of the former French enclave since its creation in the 17th century to the present day with texts, illustrations, photos and maps preserved in French archives.

Textile centre

It summarises the history of erstwhile Pondicherry from the struggle between the French and British in establishing colonial empire in India, the territory’s dazzling growth as a modest textile centre to its subsequent denigration by the British in 1761.

On the creation of Pondicherry, he showed that the city grew according to a rigorous urban plan designed by a Dutch mapmaking engineer in the late seventeenth century. The final part of the CD details the efforts taken by the government and other institutions in preserving the rich heritage of the tiny former French enclave and the territory’s emergence as an important tourist destination in the country today.

The documentary is now a valuable inventory of monuments and a guide for the residents, domestic and foreign tourists.

Jean Deloche’s second field of research concerned the history of Indian technology. His meticulous research on transportation techniques, cars, boats, bridges, has been the subject of an extensive synthesis published in French and English and partly reproduced in Volume II of History of Technology in India. Finally, it should be noted that, based entirely on the use of iconographic material, his investigations of military techniques in the Hoysala period, the harnessing of the horse, and daily life in the Nayaka period represent a methodological novelty.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/wlc5dl/article30804956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13PONDYAUDIENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/pondicherry-heritage-festival-comes-to-an-end/article30804958.ece

403,2020/02/13,L-G threatened FCI chairman: Power Minister,"Minister says FCI chief agreed to government’s request to procure paddy

Minister for Power R. Kamalakannan accused Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi of threatening the chairman of the Food Corporation of India for offering to help the Union Territory in procuring paddy, at the special session of the Assembly on Wednesday.

In a suo motu statement after tabling a resolution declaring Karaikal district and Bahour region as a Special Protected Agricultural Zone, Mr. Kamalakannan said the Lt. Governor threatened the official after the FCI chairman agreed to procure paddy in consultation with the Cabinet during his recent visit to the U.T.

He also accused the Lt. Governor of instigating the Union Ministry of Home Affairs to prevent the FCI from going ahead with procurement.

Giving a detailed response, Mr. Kamalakannan, who holds the Agriculture portfolio, said the government had been trying to procure paddy from farmers at the minimum support price fixed by the Centre. The marketing committee had stopped procurement of paddy for want of funds for the last several years.

Distress sale

In the absence of procurement by the government, farmers were selling paddy for ₹15 a kg when the MSP fixed by the Centre was ₹18.17 per kg.

After these attempts failed, the government tried to sell an unused vacant land owned by the marketing committee to GAIL, a Central government undertaking. GAIL agreed to buy the land for ₹12 crore. The government’s plan was to use the amount for paddy procurement but that too was opposed by the Lt. Governor, the Minister said.

As a last resort, the government started talks with FCI for initiating paddy procurement. “The Chief Minister and myself met FCI chairman recently here. He found our demand genuine and agreed to procure the rice. In two days, the Lt. Governor called the FCI official and threatened him. Her only aim is to prevent the government from doing anything good for the people.”

Intervening, Social Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy said the conduct of Ms. Bedi was unbecoming of a Lt. Governor. “I sometimes think about the need to continue as a Minister when my hands are tied,” he said.

The government had not been able to provide salary to hundreds of workers in cooperative societies because of objections raised by the Lt. Governor.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/3c68os/article30804455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THPONDYKAMALAKANNAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/l-g-threatened-fci-chairman/article30804456.ece
404,2020/02/13,The inspiration behind food@₹25 programme,"Similar initiatives in Alappuzha for providing food at the price have been found to be a success

Minister for Finance T.M. Thomas Isaac’s announcement in the Budget that Kudumbashree will start 1,000 hunger-free hotel initiatives to provide food at a fair rate of ₹25 is inspired by the success of similar initiatives in Alappuzha.

At Pathirapally in Mararikulam South panchayat stands a roadside hotel Snehajalakam where anyone can eat food three times a day. At the end, they can drop any money they feel inclined to in a box at the counter or even not.

This is not the only novel thing about Snehajalakam. Food for 450-odd bedridden and palliative care patients in nearby panchayats gets made here and is delivered every morning. The food is sufficient for two meals. The dirty casseroles are brought to the hotel and cleaned and made ready for the next day. Funding for this initiative, under way for the past seven years, is raised through public sponsorship of food for the beneficiaries in connection with special events such as birthdays or anniversaries of the sponsors. This is done every day, without any break.

The hotel also takes up outdoor catering of conferences and small functions such as engagements and the income from it is used for funding the free hotel initiative and food for bedridden patients.

Many also reach out for sponsoring food for a specific number of people through their website and other sources without being aware of the help extended for the bedridden patients. Money transaction is through bank accounts.

Another interesting model is a people’s kitchen near Mararikulam Junction which supplies food for 600 people under Snehajalakam. At their hotel, food is served for a reasonable ₹25.

In Cherthala town, there is another venture that supplies cooked food to bedridden patients.

From a kitchen that began in the backyard of a house to a well-established network, Snehajalakam has come a long way. Kudumbashree with its vast network enjoys a definite advantage when it comes to implementing a similar initiative as part of the hunger-free project of the State government.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/wwre7f/article30804843.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TV13ISAACSS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/the-inspiration-behind-food25-programme/article30804835.ece

411,2020/02/13,Making cloth bags to keep the city free of plastic menace,"There are 78 cloth bag units in the district under Kudumbashree

Marykutty Jose, president of the Karunya Kudumbashree unit in Kalliyur panchayat, is looking forward to the opening a building in the Santhivila market where the panchayat has given her a room. This is where Marykutty hopes that her team of seven can focus on making paper and cloth bags. She is also excited about an offer by Suresh Gopi, MP, for five sewing machines for her unit.

Marykutty’s is one of the several cloth and paper bag units functioning under the umbrella of the Kudumbashree in the district.

Kudumbashree is partnering in the fight against plastic in association with other government agencies. After the ban on single-use plastic came into effect on January 1, the cloth bag production per day has nearly doubled while the paper bag production has more than doubled. There are 78 cloth bag and 38 paper bag units in the district under Kudumbashree. The cloth bag sales have increased from ₹49,300 a month to ₹1.25 lakh a month, while paper bags sales have risen from ₹27,950 a month to ₹59,670.

14 years ago

Marykutty started her unit 14 years ago manufacturing paper bags, and then paper boxes. It was not very long ago that she started manufacturing cloth bags after bagging a quotation to use the leftover cloth from a Hantex showroom.

The seven people in her unit are able to stitch nearly 150 bags a day. Enough is made that they can even accept bulk orders such as one from the Tourism Department. They also print the bags, if needed.

Since the ban on plastic carry bags, the orders have been going up. Even vegetable vendors have approached the unit for cloth bags. The downside, Marykutty says, is that they want to bags for as low as ₹8. With the increase in price of cloth, the unit needs to sell the bags for at least ₹10 for it to remain viable.

Since they have set up a shop with the Kudumbashree board, orders have increased, but that alone is not enough to pay the shop rent and meet their own expenses. The subsidy they received has been spent in setting up shop. While some of the members supplement their income through MGNREGS work, one person sells readymade garments and in the process manages to sell a few bags too.

600 bags a day

Another unit with 12 members has six power machines and produces around 600 bags a day, besides products such as paper bags and file bags. They sell bags in different price ranges and quality, and the finished product is taken away by consumer products delivery vans for sale. The power machines were bought with a loan of ₹1 lakh.

Kudumbashree district mission coordinator K.R. Shaiju said they had given ₹2 lakh to 20 units in various panchayats as part of women entrepreneurship scheme, but perhaps optimal use of the funds was perhaps lacking. Training too had been given to the units to keep the venture afloat, most recently to 35 people in Cherunniyoor panchayat. A closer look at the operations of the units will be done, he said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/making-cloth-bags-to-keep-the-city-free-of-plastic-menace/article30804628.ece
412,2020/02/13,Corporation to auction cows of private trust,"HC had ordered Corpn. to take steps to protect the cattle

The city Corporation on Wednesday temporarily entrusted with a private farm in Kuttichal 35 cows and calves which were found to be held in pitiable conditions, without enough feed, in a goshala (cow shelter) owned by a private trust near the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple in the city.

Though the civic body had tried to take the cattle to the now defunct waste treatment plant premises at Vilappilsala, the officials had to abandon the plan following opposition from some people in the locality. The civic body now plans to auction them off.

The condition of the cattle had come to light in July last year when Dewaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran visited the cow shelter following complaints regarding its running. He had found the cows with skeletal bodies struggling to stand up. The cow shelter located near the Kuthiramalika is owned by the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple Goshala Trust to supply milk to the temple.

The High Court had ordered the city Corporation to take necessary steps to protect the cattle. The Corporation officials’ plan was to use the defunct Vilappilsala plant premises for the purpose and to feed the cattle with the help of the security personnel posted there. However, on Wednesday morning, when the cattle were taken there in trucks, a group of people opposed the move, forcing the Corporation to look for other alternatives.

“As of now, our plan is to auction them off. Some of these cattle are of much sought after breeds, like Vechoor and Gir. So, we expect some demand for these. The Corporation had to intervene in this only because the private trust, which has Rajya Sabha MP Suresh Gopi among its trustees, failed to take care of them. Even after the pitiable condition of these cattle came to light last year, the trust did not take any step in protecting them,” said Mayor K.Sreekumar.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/corporation-to-auction-cows-of-private-trust/article30804617.ece

Gokulam, on the other hand, has been prolific in front of the goal, scoring 31 times across five group-stage matches and one last-four clash. Talismanic forward Sabitra Bhandari and Kamala Devi have combined to score 28 of their team’s goals.

“It’s a wonderful feeling to be in the final,” said Gokulam coach P.V. Priya.

“The semifinal win against Sethu wasn’t easy, given that they are the defending champions and our southern rivals.

“Getting that result has given us immense confidence.”

417,2020/02/13,AIFF launches FMP,"It is a specific football masters course, says Kushal Das

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Thursday launched its Football Management Program (FMP) by signing an MOU with Spanish La Liga SmartBank co-leader Cadiz CF.

The iFMP will enable students to study in three cities over the course of a year — New Delhi, Mumbai and Cadiz (Spain).

According to AIFF general secretary Kushal Das, “such a program was needed keeping in mind the signficant growth of football. It is a highly governed sport and requires the stakeholders to have a thorough knowledge of how to administer. It is a specific football masters course and the response so far has been very good. The emphasis is clearly on professionalism in football.”

“The program,” insisted Das, “will be the first to be conducted by any sports federation in India. It will give a structured insight into governance of world football as laid down in FIFA and AFC statutes and an understanding of the plethora of rules and regulations for managing football in India in line with best practices across the world including player status, regulations, competition regulations, terms of reference and functioning of standing and judicial committees, finance and budgetary control, integrity, anti-racism and anti-doping regulations.”

“The AIFF Masters,” Das added, “will provide students complete hands-on experiential training on every aspect of football in India and abroad through live tournament exposure, match staging, clubs and team management, data management and analysis, leadership and project management skills, contractual and legal obligations, sponsorship marketing and business communication. This program will provide exemplary football managers to meet the needs of Indian football.”

The AIFF will conduct a Common Admission Test to ensure that every interested candidate gets an equal opportunity to enroll in the limited seats on offer each year. It will also have a strong line-up of global football faculty to share their knowledge and experience.

AIFF president Praful Patel observed: “Football is without any doubt the number one global sport and is growing very quickly in India. We felt that such a Program was much needed to help students understand the nuances and global practices involved in managing football not only in India but across the world. With the curriculum combining theoretical and practical knowledge, there will be a paradigm shift in football management in the country.”

The fee for the one-day course will be ₹2 lakh with Das promising “very good placements.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/aiff-launches-fmp/article30811181.ece

Modus operandi

“The accused would pose themselves as passengers and target women travelling in general compartments. Some gang members would block entrance of the compartment to create a rush-like situation, while the others would snatch gold chains from the women when they try to board the train,” GRP DSP (Visakhapatnam Sub-division) R.

423,2020/02/13,Sexual harassment complaints against professors shock AU,"‘Such incidents are tarnishing reputation of the nine-decade-old institution’

The Andhra University campus is in shock after sexual harassment allegations involving three senior professors surfaced on Tuesday.

Students, alumni, former professors and faculty say that such incidents are tarnishing the reputation of the nine-decade-old university which is ranked among the top 25 universities in the country.

“Andhra University has a glorious history. It has flourished under the tutelage of Vice-Chancellors such as Prof. C.R. Reddy and Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan. Such incidents are tarnishing the image of the institution. The authorities concerned should have been vigilant, especially when similar cases were reported from the campus in the past,” said a former professor of AU requesting anonymity.

Chequered history

Several sexual harassment allegations were reported in the past. In 2017, a senior professor of was booked for alleged sexual harassment of students in Department of Sanskrit. Similar charges were levelled against him in 2014 and the university authorities had to strip him off the headship.

In 2012, a professor from Department of Economics of AU School of Distance Education was exposed by a TV channel in a sting operation for allegedly seeking sexual favours from a student who had come to collect her pass certificate.

In 2011, the then principal of College Arts College, AU, was embroiled in a similar controversy, when a research scholar alleged sexual harassment.

“Such behaviour from professors are unacceptable. What will the students think of their teachers and how will the teachers face the students? However, before jumping to conclusions, a proper inquiry needs to be done, giving fair chance to both the parties,” said a senior professor of the College of Arts.

Meanwhile, DCP (Zone I) S. Ranga Reddy appealed to the students and research scholars to come forward to lodge complaints in case of any misbehaviour or harassment.

“There are chances of professors taking advantage of students and research scholars as their project or marks will be in their hands. Students should shed fears of consequences and lodge complaints. We assure that their identities will not be revealed,” said Mr. Ranga Reddy. He also advised the students to make use of ‘Disha app’.

Counselling sessions

Mr. Ranga Reddy, who is handling the two sexual harassment cases involving the professors said that there were likely to conduct counselling sessions for the students and the staff of the university.

“Vice-Chancellor P.V.G.D. Prasad Reddy is very serious about the issues and co-operating with the police. We should conduct counselling sessions for students and staff to create awareness about such issues,” the DCP added.

‘Suspension the accused’

Student Federation of India (SFI) activists staged a protest on the campus of Andhra University, demanding action against the three professors who were facing sexual harassment charges.

Raising slogans against the professors, the protesters demanded suspension of the professors with immediate effect.

SFI president B. Gowtham said the way the professors behaved with the women should be condemned. “The higher authorities should take strict action against the professors and ensure safety of girls on the campus,” he said.

424,2020/02/13,History as it affects common people,"Writer Vasudhendra’s new novel, Tejo Tungabhadra, ran into second edition even before its release in January. Currently in its fourth edition, the novel is concerned primarily, with man-made systems and the suffering they cause to the common man

Vasudhendra, an established writer of fiction in Kannada, charts a new path with this novel -- a historical novel that traces the happenings in India and elsewhere between 1492 A. D. and 1518 A. D. These dates are significant: in 1492 Columbus landed in America, and in 1518 a son was born to Krishnadevaraya. The novel opens with a reference to Vasco de Gama having returned just then from India through the sea route, and it ends with the death of a lenka.

Tejo-Tungabhadra has a huge canvas: it begins in Lisbon, moves on to Goa and then to Hampi, moving back and forth. The varied happenings in these three capitals within a period of 25 years are framed by a love story of Gabriel (Christian) and Bella (Jew). In order to amass huge wealth as demanded by Bella’s father, Gabriel leaves for India with Albuquerque’s ships. Of course, both of his ambitions are thwarted. There are scores of characters, rich and poor, and kings and queens, but none of them can be called the protagonist of the novel. Tejo and Tungabhadra are the rivers flowing in Lisbon and Hampi respectively, the mute witnesses to what man does to man, in the name of religion and nationality.

The novel is concerned, primarily, with man-made systems and the suffering they cause to the common man. All the systems are dressed up with attractive values such as love, tolerance, and peace; however, once they are stripped off, deep down all the systems, be it religious or economic or national, only lust for power, wealth, and violence gape at one as rotting wounds. It is this daunting task of exposè that the novel takes up, relentlessly.

Although systems are classified as religious or economic or social, the novel reveals, all the systems are intertwined and mutually nourishing. One king of Portugal allows Jews all freedom in his country, only because they are good at business and bring wealth to the country; his son compels the Jews to convert into Christianity also because, in order to marry the Spanish princess, he has to appease her anti-Semitism. Similarly, Krishnadevaraya, the illustrious king of Vijayanagara, befriends the Christian Portuguese generals not because he respects their religion but only for the horses and cannons they supply.

And, most importantly, the narrative exposes the inhuman cruelty lying at the core of all systems. Thousands of Jews in Lisbon, for no apparent reason, are forced one day either to become Christians or meet instant death. In Goa, hundreds of Christians and Hindus are compelled by the Sultan of Bijapur to convert into Islam or meet death; even those who accept Islam are forced to undergo Sunnat, instantly and in public. Later, the same people are horribly punished by the Christian Albuquerque for having become Muslims — their ears and noses are chopped off mercilessly. Krishnadevaraya, a god-fearing Hindu, kills 60 prisoners with no second thought so that, as foretold by astrologers, a tank gets filled with water. Tembakka gets buried alive after her husband’s death because of long-standing practice of Sati in the name of religion; for the same reason, Hampamma gets ready to die on her husband’s pyre; Keshava, as a lenka, cuts off his own head and dies only because an emperor whom he hasn’t ever met gets a son . . . this is an endless list. These incidents are depicted so vividly and in such detail that they fill us with horror – and shame.

In a very interesting manner, this narrative reflects contemporary ethos. Bella, in the beginning of the novel, sighs: ‘I hate this India which, because of its fabulous wealth, is stealing my lover.’ In modern times, the US has taken the place of India and it is the Indian/African dream to go to the US and earn money and fame. The proud declaration by a Christian during the massacre of the Jews that he stabbed a pregnant Jewish woman and killed both the woman and her foetus brings to mind similar happenings during Gujarat riots, two decades ago.

Krishnadevaraya’s attempt to change the name of Tembakapura as ‘Krishnarayapura’ and the villagers’ resistance to it reflect similar attempts in India, in the last two decades. The king of Calicut respectfully conducts the Christians inside his palace, but refuses entry to Jacom because he is a dalit. The caste-hierarchy doesn’t seem to have changed much even today.

History, asserts the eminent historian Romila Thapar, is not a tale of kings and emperors but of the lives of common people and the powerful discourses that control and shape their lives. Leaning toward this view of history, as a historical novel, Tejo-Tungabhadra depicts the life and death of common people, at a particular period, shaped by influential discourses. What Purandaradasa, coming as a character in the novel, sings sums up the novel’s ideological undercurrent: ‘Pearls and rubies are baubles, / royal umbrellas and flags are baubles, / forts and moats are baubles, / good kingship is but a worthless bauble.’",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/yuzh4f/article30811019.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14bgfrBook1-2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/history-as-it-affects-common-people/article30811020.ece
425,2020/02/13,"Gender biases do exist in how women’s writing is viewed, says author Aruna Nambiar","The writer says both her novels revolve around the family because it plays such a crucial role in India, and even love stories can’t avoid the family angle

Moving away from her corporate career, Aruna Nambiar nurtured her flair for words and became an author in 2014. Her first book, Mango Cheeks, Metal Teeth, a satire, was a coming-of-age story about a young girl’s discovery of the world around her during a vacation in her ancestral house in Kerala. Her second one, The Monsters Still Lurk, is about living, loving and dealing with loss. Covering a period of 25 years, the book, set in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Chennai and in a small town in Kerala, punctuates milestones in the protagonist Vivek’s life with important events in India’s political, social and economic landscapes.

Aruna was in the city to attend a literary fete. In an email interview, Bengaluru-settled Aruna says though she had always been scribbling diary entries and poems, “writing was never a career I entertained seriously, and so I did the whole engineering-management-corporate career thing — an experience I am very grateful for, although I soon got tired of the rat race.” That is when writing came back into her life and soon the two novels and many short stories, published and unpublished, followed.

Edited excerpts from the interview...

The Monsters Still Lurk deals with the ups and downs of an upper-middle-class family in India, all narrated with a light touch. Even death and illness have a matter-of-fact tone about it...

My natural inclination has always been to write in a light, humorous tone. When I set out to write The Monsters Still Lurk, it was with the intention of writing a funny story about life and ageing. The subject naturally meant I would need to confront some dark themes, but I was determined that I would keep the tone light and unsentimental. To me, being able to write about dark circumstances in a light vein represents a triumph of humour, just like being able to laugh during troubled times represents the triumph of the human spirit. Part of the reason I wanted to write this book was because I wanted to capture the essence of some of the delightfully stoic, practical and upbeat people who deal with all of life’s travails with a shrug and a wink.

Any reason why you chose a male voice to narrate the story?

I thought it would be interesting to change things up — as a writer, you want to constantly challenge yourself, and to write authentically in the first person in an almost memoir style as a male narrator would test my skills, I thought. The male voice also lends itself well to the unsentimental narration I was striving for — although men feel as deeply as women, they often tend to express themselves less emotionally.

Both your books centre around the family and its trials and tribulations.... and small-town Kerala features in both.

Family, nostalgia and humour have been common to both my novels although this was quite by accident. When I set out to write The Monsters Still Lurk, I meant to write a funny story about ageing but as I developed the story, I realised that there were so many aspects of ageing I wanted to explore, that I needed multiple characters and a longish span to tell the story — and thus the multi-generational family saga was born. I suppose it’s because family is such a central part of Indian life that even a love story seems incomplete without a family angle. And for someone who writes in a humorous tone, families are irresistible — with their quirky characters, hypocrisies and idiosyncrasies, families are ripe for satire!

Kerala is, of course, in my blood — although I’ve always been a non-resident Keralite, it has been the locale of many happy childhood vacations and more recent visits and holidays, so it definitely holds a special place in my heart. It seems inevitable that it would feature in at least some of my fiction.

A few of my favourite reads This is a list that is ever-changing and always incomplete. All-time favourite authors include PG Wodehouse, Roald Dahl, Daphne du Maurier, RK Narayan, Vikram Seth and Bill Bryson — I like almost everything they have ever written.

My other all-time favourite reads include: To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee; Angela’s Ashes by Frank McCourt; English August by Upamanyu Chatterjee; Em and the Big Hoom by Jerry Pinto; Evening is The Whole Day by Preeta Samarasan; Elizabeth is Missing by Emma Healey; We are All Completely Beside Ourselves by Karen Joy Fowler; The Help by Kathryn Stockett; The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon; A Long Way Down by Nick Hornby; On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan and The Lemon Table by Julian Barnes.

Any plans to move to a new genre?

New themes, certainly. I’m still in the very early stages of weighing new ideas, but I feel the next novel will probably be more modern and perhaps not so family-oriented. I’ve also been writing the odd short story, but publishers are lukewarm about short story collections these days – so who knows?

There is a tendency to categorise books written by women about women and families as chick lit while similar books by men haven’t been bestowed such epithets...

Labels are diminishing, sometimes dismissive (as in the case of ‘chick lit’) and they serve only to limit your readership. The Monsters Still Lurk, for instance, is a family story, certainly, but being set against the backdrop of a quarter century of post-liberalisation India, it also captures a lot of the social, economic and cultural transformation that Indian society has gone through.

It touches on many themes, as well, from social change to loneliness and depression. But it is also a humorous story – I’ve discovered that humour is something many people don’t expect women to write. But the best ‘chick lit’ is often very witty — remember Bridget Jones’s Diary? If it had been written by a man, or about men, it would probably have been hailed as a comic classic. So, gender biases do exist in how women’s writing is viewed as compared to men’s writing, and perhaps dropping labels will be the first step to levelling the field.

Do you think Indian writing in English has come of age with writers of all ages getting published and publishers making a profit as well?

It is heartening to see book stores and libraries brimming with Indian writing, and to see readers connecting with Indian themes and stories. The increasing popularity of regional works translated into English is also an encouraging sign. However, I do think that publishing is still in its teething stage – we need more professionalism, less quantity and better quality of books being published and we need to sell books in much larger numbers before it can be a sustaining, profitable business in the long term. I expect we will see much flux in the publishing industry before we can truly say it has come of age.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/sc7giw/article30809369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvmaruna12,https://www.thehindu.com/books/author-aruna-nambiar-on-writing-about-families-and-her-craft/article30809370.ece

Made of wood, with a big head and no arms and legs, the Kokeshi doll has a few painted lines to indicate facial features while the body has floral designs covered with a wax layer. A collection of this traditional Japanese doll will be among the exhibits on display at Discover Japan Festival beginning today.

Japanese dolls come in various shapes and sizes and are integral to the nation’s culture with even a festival dedicated to them.

All dolled up

“There will be geisha dolls, modelled after traditional female entertainers, wearing the kimono popularly worn by Japanese women; paper dolls made from Washi, handmade paper, is another highlight,” says Asok Kumar, chairman, programme committee of the event organised by Alumni Society of AOTS, Trivandrum Centre (ASATC).

He will be exhibiting over 20 Kokeshi dolls from his collection. “I learnt to make the dolls. The dolls will be exhibited by members of ASATC. While some have made it on their own, a few got them as souvenirs from Japan,” he says.

Asok adds that Japan celebrates Girls’ Day every year, during which they showcase a set of ornamental dolls. “The arrangement looks like the bommakkolu we have for Navarathri,” he says. Similarly there is a Boys’ Festival when they display carp-shaped flags, since the carp is revered by the Japanese. Also check out Japanese costumes, umbrellas, souvenirs and the like.

Another highlight of the festival is Bonsai trees exhibited by D Ravindran, a Bonsai enthusiast. Ravindran, who runs a one-of-its-kind bonsai farm at Padmanabhapuram in Kanyakumari district, will showcase a few varieties of Bonsai at the festival such as Australian Casuarina (choola) and Premna microphylla (munja) in addition to different kinds of ficus. The oldest in the collection is the 40-year-old Ficus Nuda.

He will also be demonstrating the techniques of wiring, which helps in shaping the trees in the classical shapes of Bonsai.

Among other elements of Japanese culture and tradition that are part of the festival are Japanese cultural artefacts, utility art work and paintings and photographs. There will also be a demonstration of origami, the traditional Japanese art of paper folding, ikebana, the Japanese system of flower arrangement, and Japanese calligraphy. Discussions on Japanese language and literature have been included. “Washoku, a food festival featuring Japanese dishes will be another attraction,” Asok adds.

427,2020/02/13,The urban songbird: On the Red-whiskered Bulbul,"The Red-whiskered Bulbul is never alone, and can bring great joy with its song

Have you ever wondered what a bird with whiskers would look like? The Red-whiskered Bulbul (Pycnonotus jocosus) is a sprightly and commonly found garden songbird that likes urban gardens, scrubland found on the outskirts of the city, and even humans. This bird was often traded in Asia, so a number are escapees.

A slender medium-sized bird (20 cm), it is dark brown above, white below, with a conspicuous white patch on the cheeks and an elegant black crest. It has crimson tufts below the eye, a crimson red vent (undertail coverts), black beak and legs.

The bird’s diet consists of mostly fruits and the unfortunate odd invertebrate. You’ll find them in pairs or small groups in gardens with fruiting trees. Their flight is strong, but slow and jerky. Their lively nature always livens up gloomy days. Their calls include loud and musical notes that sound like ‘pettigroo’ or ‘kick-pettigroo’.

For someone who finds urban ecology fascinating, full of surprises and of prime importance, I went to the length of mapping their seasons for a year. When they start singing more than usual, we may assume that the bird is trying to pair up and the breeding season is about to commence. This is usually from February to May.

The Great Backyard Bird Count India This is the Indian Implementation of the global great Backyard Bird Count, which runs for four days every February. Numerous birders have participated year after year. Last year for example, had 1,786 birders take part, uploading 22,273 lists. During these days, bird counts are conducted in different areas across the city. Alongside, the Campus Bird Count runs where bird counts are organised in college campuses and schools, involving several young minds to celebrate the life of birds, and to fuel citizen science. These counts help us understand bird distribution, changes in habitat and weather, and if the population and distribution is changing. This is an all-India engagement — last year, while only 40% of all of India’s districts were covered, nearly every state was represented — with birders collecting relevant data. Birdcount.in/event/gbbc2020; ninox.edu@gmail.com

However, I noticed a bird singing away in my backyard in January last year, and observed that it was trying to woo a female nearby. As the days went by, I saw them both spending more time with each other and indulging in theatrics together, which seemed to give life to the garden. Soon I heard less of them and later, in April, saw two immature birds being guarded by the parents. To know that the birds had successfully bred in my own backyard, brought me immense happiness.

The next two months went in observing what the parents taught the two novices. The life lesson of hunting or being hunted has always been transformative in a bird’s life.

They move away slowly to areas with greater tree density in the city post the monsoon season and then you see much less of them until the next breeding season. The nest is cup-shaped, loosely but strongly built of grass, roots, fibres, thin stalks and is lined with finer grass stems and roots. They are mostly placed in bushes.

Seeing them grow every day were the happiest days spent last spring. I hope you have your own Red-whiskered Bulbul moments this year.

428,2020/02/13,"China coronavirus COVID-19 | No major change in trajectory of outbreak, says WHO","The dramatic increase in cases is largely “down to a change in how the cases are being reported”, a WHO official said.

The World Health Organisation on February 13 said a sharp rise in reported COVID-19 cases in China, due to a change in counting methods, did not represent a big shift in the epidemic.

China’s official death toll from the new coronavirus and the number of cases reported soared dramatically on February after authorities altered the way they tally infections.

“This does not represent a significant change in the trajectory of the outbreak,” Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme, said at a press conference. “We’re not dealing, from what we understand, with a spike in cases of 14,000 on one day,” he said. “This increase that you’ve all seen in the last 24 hours is largely, in part, down to a change in how the cases are being reported.”

Dr. Ryan also said he expected members of a WHO-led international mission to China to arrive over the weekend.

In Hubei Province and its capital Wuhan, where tens of millions of people are trapped as part of an unprecedented quarantine effort, 242 new deaths were reported on February 13. Another 14,840 people were confirmed to be infected in Hubei alone, with the new cases and deaths by far the biggest one-day increases since the crisis began.

Outside Hubei, there were 12 more deaths but the number of new cases fell for a ninth day in a row, with 312 extra patients.

Hubei authorities said the increases were because they had broadened their definition for infection to include people “clinically diagnosed” via lung imaging.

429,2020/02/13,"Government notifies medical devices as drugs, industry cautious","Decision aimed at ensuring that all medical devices meet certain standards of quality and efficacy

The Union Health Ministry has notified medical equipment used on humans as drugs under Section 3 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act with effect from April 1, 2020. The Ministry, through a gazette notification, also released the Medical Devices Amendment Rules, 2020, for mandatory registration of medical devices.

Aimed at ensuring that all medical devices meet certain standards of quality and efficacy, the notification will also make medical device companies accountable for quality and safety of their products, noted a senior health official.

Stating that most small manufacturers cannot comply with the rules, Rajiv Nath, Coordinator of Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AIMED), said all low-risk equipment made by small manufacturers would find it tough to comply with and to have qualified regulatory staff to meet the Medical Device and Diagnostic Rules (MDR) Schedule 5. “The Health Ministry has been unwilling to amend this, though NITI Aayog is supportive and has assured to make a provision in its draft Bill,” said Mr. Nath.

Welcoming the move, the Medical Technology Association of India (MTaI), association of global and Indian medical devices, said this move was a continuation of the Medical Devices Rules 2017.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/udp4kg/article30812789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-medical-device-equipment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/government-notifies-medical-devices-as-drugs-industry-cautious/article30812704.ece
430,2020/02/13,Skipper Manpreet Singh gets FIH Male Player of the Year award,"Becomes first Indian to win the honour

National men’s team captain Manpreet Singh on Thursday became the first Indian to win the International Hockey Federation’s (FIH) Player of the Year award, capping a memorable 2019 season in which he led the side to Olympic qualification.

The 27-year-old midfielder, thus, became the first from the country to win the accolade since the awards were introduced in 1999.

He beat competition from Belgium’s Arthur van Dorren and Lucas Villa of Argentina, who came second and third respectively.

Manpreet polled a total of 35.2 per cent of combined votes, which includes national associations, media, fans and players.

Van Dorren, on the other hand, got combined vote share of 19.7 per cent while Villa polled 16.5 per cent in his favour.

Other players who were nominated for the award were Victor Wegnez of Belgium and Australian duo of Aran Zalewski and Eddie Ockenden.

Manpreet, who had represented India at 2012 London and 2016 Rio Olympics, has enjoyed a long career in the national team since he made his debut in 2011. He now has 260 international appearances under his belt.

Talking about the last season, Manpreet said: “If you look at our year, we did well in every tournament we participated in. Be it the FIH Series Finals in June or the test series in Belgium where we played the hosts as well as Spain and beat them.

“Our biggest goal in 2019 was to book our berth at the Olympics.”

India achieved that goal in style, beating Russia in the Olympic Qualifiers over two legs — 4-2 and 7-2.

Manpreet dedicated the award to his teammates, saying without their support it wouldn’t have been possible.

“I am truly honoured to win this award and I would like to dedicate this to my team. I also thank my well wishers and hockey fans from around the world for voting in my favour. It is truly humbling to see so much support for Indian hockey,” he said.",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/5taokq/article30813088.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14MAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/skipper-manpreet-singh-gets-fih-male-player-of-the-year-award/article30813089.ece
431,2020/02/13,All set for exciting finale,"In all, 12 races have been scheduled for this weekend.

A clutch of hungry teenagers from across the globe, besides a couple of veterans, will be again going head-to-head as the third and final round of FIA-approved MRF Challenge, organised by the Madras Motor Sports Club, gets underway at the MMRT here on Friday with a card of six races.

The previous two rounds witnessed thrilling battles while bringing to the fore some exciting young talent like championship leader Belgium’s 17-year old Michaelangelo Amendola, Britain’s Joshua Mason, and first-timer in MRF Challenge Indian-American Yuven Sunderamoorthy, 16, who chalked up a fine win in Dubai.

MRF Tyres vice-chairman and managing director Arun Mammen said: “We have had some exciting races in the previous two rounds in Dubai and Bahrain.

“Now with the championship still wide open, we expect more close and thrilling competition up and down the grid in the final round here.

Amendola well-placed

After two rounds, Amendola, with three wins in Dubai, is well-placed at the top with 143 points. He is followed by Australia’s 30-year old Dylan Young (127) who notched his first and only win so far in seven MRF Challenge seasons. Behind the pair is Mason (115) who notched four podium finishes in the Dubai round.

With six races to be run, there are plenty of points on offer and it puts premium on consistency given the close competition.

National championship

The weekend racing bouquet also includes the first round of MRF MMSC Fmsci Indian National Car Racing Championship for saloon cars (ITC, IJTC and Super Stock) besides two support events, the MRF F1600 and Volkswagen Ameo Super Race.
