0,2020/02/18,Golf great Mickey Wright passes away,"Wright, who accumulated 82 LPGA Tour titles during a career which stretched from 1954 to 1969, died in Florida

Thirteen-time Major winner Mickey Wright, often described as the greatest woman golfer of all time, died aged 85.

Wright, who accumulated 82 LPGA Tour titles during a professional career which stretched from 1954 to 1969, died in Florida after a heart attack, reports said on Monday.

“We’re saddened to learn today of the passing of Mickey Wright, a 13-time Major Champion and 82-time winner on the @LPGA, just three days after celebrating her birthday,” the World Golf Hall of Fame announced on Twitter. “One of the best to ever play the game, she will be greatly missed. #RIPMickey.”

Born Mary Kathryn Wright in San Diego, California in 1935, Wright enjoyed a stellar amateur career which included a US Girls Junior Championship in 1952.

She won the 1954 World Amateur Championship before turning professional the following season.

Her haul of 13 Major victories included four US Women’s Open titles and four US Women’s PGA Championships. Only Patty Berg, who had 15 Major wins, has won more.

Her retirement in 1969 shocked women’s golf, coming at the relatively early age of 34.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/x22lt2/article30854028.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19MICKEY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/golf-great-mickey-wright-passes-away/article30854029.ece

2,2020/02/18,Madras HC sets aside AICF office-bearers’ election,"The Madras High Court on Tuesday set aside the unopposed election of Ajay Patel, Vipnesh Bhardwaj, Bharat Singh Chauhan, Arun Singh and Naresh Sharma as the president, vice-president, secretary, joint secretary and treasurer of All India Chess Federation (AICF) and ordered conduct of fresh elections by convening a special general body meeting.

Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy passed the order on a clarification petition filed by P.S. Venketrama Raja who pointed out that the nominations filed by him and his team were rejected and the rival group was declared elected unopposed on February 11 due to some misconception in understanding an order passed by the Division Bench on February 3.

Making it clear that the intention of the court was to ensure a contested election, the judges requested retired Supreme Court judge F.M. Ibrahim Kalifulla, who had been appointed as the Returning Officer by the Bench, to conduct the entire election process afresh after sending notices to all members of the federation for convening the special general body meeting.

“All candidates shall file nominations only in person strictly as per the National Sports Development Code of 2011,” the judges clarified after finding that the nominations of Raja and his team had been rejected precisely on the ground that they had not filed their nominations in person though they could not do so due to circumstances revolving around the previous court order.

To challenge order

The order is set to be challenged by Bharat Singh and others.

“We are awaiting the copy of the order. We will move the Supreme Court against the order,” said Chauhan.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/madras-hc-sets-aside-aicf-office-bearers-election/article30853825.ece
3,2020/02/18,Sunil Kumar grapples his way to glory,"It is India’s first Greco-Roman Asian championship gold in 27 years

India had managed a grand total of one gold in the previous edition of the senior Asian wrestling championship.

On Tuesday, Sunil Kumar ensured there won’t be any less this time around, opening the gold tally for the host with a 5-0 win in the 87kg final against Azat Salidinov of Kyrgyzstan.

It was not just an improvement on Sunil’s own silver-winning performance in 2019 but also India’s first Greco-Roman gold in the competition after 27 years. The last time it happened was in 1993, when Pappu Yadav won the 48kg title.

“It feels great to better your own performance and change the medal colour from silver to gold. I have worked a lot on my ground wrestling techniques in the last one year and improved my defence. That helped me today,” Sunil said after the bout at the K.D. Jadhav Indoor Stadium.

National coach Hargobind Singh hoped the win would help bring more focus on Greco-Roman, often reduced to shadows against the more popular freestyle category.

Halakurki wins bronze

In the 55kg, 21-year old Arjun Halakurki won bronze with a 7-4 win against Dong Hyeok Won of Korea.

Leading 7-1 in his semifinal bout against 2018 junior World Champion and eventual gold-medallist Pouya Mohammad Naserpour of Iran, Halakurki paid for his aggressive play to go down 7-8 in the final few seconds.

“I played the way I have always done in junior and under-23 levels but there is a big difference at the senior level. I have now learnt that you need to hold on and go a bit slow at this level. That is what the coaches also said after the semifinals and I tried to avoid my mistakes,” said the Karnataka wrestler, competing in his maiden senior tournament.

Having won the U-23 and the senior National championships last year, Halakurki’s biggest disappointment was missing out on a promotion. “I had been promised a Naib Subedar rank if I reached the final here. But now I will have to wait,” he said.

Mehar misses out

The other medal contender, Mehar Singh, lost out narrowly 2-3 in the 130kg bronze-medal playoff to Kyrgyzstan Roman Kim.

The other two Indians, Sajan Bhanwal and Sachin Rana, failed to advance past the league stages.

The results (Greco-Roman): 55kg: 1. Pouya Mohammed Naserpour (Iri), 2. Jasurbek Ortikboev (Uzb), 3. Arjun Halakurki (Ind) & Khorlan Zhakansha (Kaz).

63kg: 1. Elmurat Tasmuradov (Uzb), 2. Jinsueb Song (Kor), 3. Meysam Karamali Dalkhani (Iri) & Mubinjon Akhmedov (Tjk).

77kg: Tamerlan Shadukayev (Kaz), 2. Pejman Sultanmorad Poshtam (Iri), 3. Hussein Ali Muksr Albidhan (Irq) & Renat Iliaz Uulu (Kgz).

87kg: 1. Sunil Kumar (Ind), 2. Azat Salidinov (Kgz), 3. Azamat Kustubayev (Kaz) & Behrooz Mohammedali Hidayat (Iri).

4,2020/02/18,Hall of Fame golfer Wright dies aged 85,"She enjoyed 13 victories in 1963, which remains the LPGA Tour record

Hall of Famer Mickey Wright, the only Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) golfer to hold all major titles at the same time, died on February 17, the LPGA said. The American was 85.

Wright won 82 tournaments, second only to compatriot Kathy Whitworth (88), and claimed 13 majors in a career that stretched from 1955 until retirement in 1969 because of foot problems.

“She was the best I’ve ever seen, man or woman,” Whitworth once told ESPN. “I’ve had the privilege of playing with Sam Snead and Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer and all of them. Nobody hit it like Mickey, just nobody. She had 82 wins, but she would have won over 100 with no trouble if she had stayed on tour.”

The great Ben Hogan said Wright had the finest golf swing he ever saw. LPGA Commissioner Mike Whan echoed that sentiment on Monday. “We are deeply saddened to learn about the passing of Mickey Wright,” Whan said in a statement. “We lost a legend, but we may also have lost the best swing in golf history today.”

Wright, who began playing golf at age 12, was inducted into the Hall of Fame of Women's Golf in 1964 and the LPGA Tour Hall of Fame when it was created in 1967, She became a member of the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1976.

She enjoyed 13 victories in 1963, which remains the LPGA Tour record, and the next season won 11 times, which was tied by Swede Annika Sorenstam for second most victories in a season.

“It was a lot of pressure to be in contention week after week for five or six years,” Wright told Golf World in 2000. “I guess they call it burnout now, but it wore me out.”

She moved to Florida in 1974 and enjoyed gardening, fishing, playing the stock market and crossword puzzles.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/i9i13y/article30849024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OBITMICKEYWRIGHTGOLF,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/hall-of-fame-golfer-wright-dies-aged-85/article30849025.ece
5,2020/02/18,Wasn’t surprised that Sania became a top player: Pierce,"The four-time Grand Slam champion Mary Pierce will visit Delhi next week to inspire Indian boys and girls

Mary Pierce was 20-years old when she won the Australian Open in 1995, dropping a mere 30 games in seven rounds.

It took her five more years to win her favourite Grand Slam on clay at the Roland Garros in Paris, even though she had grown up on clay.

In fact, the tall and power-stroking Pierce had looked ready to win the French Open in 1994 itself, when she reached the final, dropping a mere 10 games along the way, which included a 6-2, 6-2 triumph over Steffi Graf.

However, Pierce was beaten in the final by Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario in straight sets.

The four-time Grand Slam champion, who won the Wimbledon mixed doubles title with Mahesh Bhupathi in 2005, will be in Delhi to inspire the Indian boys and girls who will be competing in the Oppo Roland Garros junior wildcard event in Delhi from February 24 to 26.

“I am very happy to be coming to India. It is one of my favourite countries,” said Pierce, in a telephonic conversation from Paris.

Throwback

She distinctly remembered competing in the WTA tournament in Hyderabad in 2003, and partnering the 16-year-old Sania Mirza in doubles.

“Mahesh was organising that tournament and wanted to know whether I would like to play with a local girl. It was Sania’s first tournament at that level.

“She was not that well known then. I saw her hitting the strokes well. There were a lot of mistakes. But, I knew that once she started keeping a lot of balls on court, she would be good. I wasn’t surprised when she developed into a top player,” said Pierce.

In fact, Sania won her first WTA tournament two years later in Hyderabad when she had a breakthrough season, playing fearless tennis against Serena Williams in the third round of the Australian Open, on the Asian wildcard.

Even as she conceded that she had seen many good Indian girls at the lower levels of the ITF circuit, especially during the tournaments organised by her in Mauritius, Pierce was unable to pinpoint the reason for other Indian girls not being able to follow in the footsteps of Sania into the big league.

“It is a good question, but there is no answer. Some players have natural gift. Indian tennis has had great champions. Am sure there will be more in future. Yes, passion for the game, hard work, dedication, sacrifice and very supportive people... are all important. You need good structure, training and sponsors to help you travel for tournaments,” said Pierce.

Lot to learn

Pierce was understandably thrilled to promote clay court play. “I developed my game, playing on clay. You need to have strong legs and patience to play long rallies. Clay teaches you a lot. It is so special to me. It is great to promote the event,” said Pierce.

The 45-year-old Pierce does follow women’s tennis closely, and was happy that Sofia Kenin won the Australian Open with her fearless game. “It is too early to assess the chances for Roland Garros. We will see how the girls, so many of them and so good, compete in the clay season, before we take a pick,” said Pierce.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/tw51jm/article30853756.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th18Mary-Pierce-one,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/wasnt-surprised-that-sania-became-a-top-player-pierce/article30853757.ece
6,2020/02/18,WTA Dubai | Clijsters ‘feels good’ despite loss,"Sania-Garcia pair through to the second round

Kim Clijsters said she is going to plough ahead with her tennis comeback despite losing her return match 6-2, 7-6(8) to Garbine Muguruza in the opening round of the WTA event here.

Four-time Grand Slam champion Clijsters, 36, had been out of the game for seven years before the clash with Muguruza, who reached the final of the Australian Open last month, and is keen to push ahead after an encouraging display against the World No. 16 Spaniard.

“I had a good feeling out there, I felt a pace I can handle. I felt like I was able to go toe-to-toe with her from the baseline,” said Clijsters. “I wouldn’t have done this if I didn’t have that belief somehow. It might take 10 matches to get the way I played in the second set, might take me 10 matches to get that from start to finish.

“I have patience. I’m going to work my way into it and fight. We’ll see what happens.” Clijsters did not say where she will continue her comeback, not mentioning any future tournament entries after taking part here as a wild card.

In doubles, Sania Mirza and Caroline Garcia overcame the Russian-Slovenian combination of Alla Kudryavtseva and Katarina Srebotnik 6-4, 4-6, [10-8].

9,2020/02/18,"Instagram’s new policies for 2020: ‘Unlabel India’, hiding likes, mental health awareness","Instagram’s new ‘Unlabel India’ scheme aims to impact half a million people through a 20-city roadshow educating young netizens about online safety and digital hygiene

When was the last time you wondered about the safety of a friend online? Whether someone has slid into their DMs or sent them unsolicited pictures, or even been the victim of pervasive bullying, safety online should be as much of a priority as it is offline.

That said, this year’s Safer Internet Day (February 11) was appropriately themed ‘Together For A Better Internet.’ Given there are about a billion monthly users globally, Instagram has decided that, instead of just a single day, this should be a full-fledged part of the online population’s day-to-day routine; the Facebook-owned platform has announced ‘Unlabel India’, an offline initiative to democratise the platform further and catalyse a safer social media experience.

This is Instagram’s response to the bullying and harassment that has permeated profiles on countless occasions.

Tara Bedi, Public Policy and Community Outreach Manager, Instagram, India

In an email interview with MetroPlus, Tara Bedi, public policy and community outreach manager at Instagram, India, explains how the safety and well-being of our community is the platform’s top priority with ‘Unlabel India’, adding, “We will lead a country wide conversation with students to spark a movement of kindness, empathy and respect, that is core to our platform and hopefully percolates to the entire community.”

Batting for mental health

Instagram, which turns 10 this year, has teamed up with Yuvaa (a youth media and insights company) to approach this in a phased manner. “The first phase will be a roadshow to 20 cities — Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Bengaluru included — in 50 colleges, where young Indians will be encouraged to speak up on issues such as mental health, bullying, safe spaces and gender sensitivity.”

Tara adds that the next phase will be about having “a sustained engagement with the colleges through ‘kindness clubs’, ‘kindness ambassadors’ and targeted digital campaigns. We aim to reach half a million people via online and offline engagements by the end of the year with this initiative.” Basically, the idea is to spread the good word of the Internet’s more positive aspects.

Posting in the time of strife India’s digital space is swirling with political and social dissent — centred around the CAA and NRC conflicts. Instagram remains neutral while keeping hate speech off its pages.

Tara Bedi explains, “To do this, we have dedicated content reviewers who are based around the world and who speak India’s majority languages natively, and we’ve also invested significantly in proactive detection technologies to help us find violating content on our services more quickly. We also publish a Community Standards Enforcement Report, which shows how we’re doing at finding and removing violating content on Facebook and Instagram.”

“We also have the Counter Speech Fellowship which is run with our partner, Young Leaders for Active Citizenship (YLAC),” adds Tara, “to engage creative teens to use the power of visual storytelling to start meaningful conversations on issues that are important to young citizens around the world. Mental health is a strong theme covered in this fellowship.”

Declining mental health (leading toissues such as depression, isolation, body image dysmorphia, etc) unfortunately, is a given when it comes to the pressures of social media. Tara says the Time Spent tools on Instagram and Facebook which include an activity dashboard, a daily reminder and a new way to limit notifications are part of this scheme. “We developed these tools based on collaboration and inspiration from leading mental health experts and organisations, academics, our own extensive research and feedback from our community.”

On October 10’s World Mental Health Day last year, Instagram and Facebook announced a global donation of up to US$1 million to a group of mental health organisations, of which Goa-based Sangath’s ‘It’s Okay To Talk’ initiative, a strong Instagram partner, is one of them, points out Tara.

Hiding likes?

Last November at Wired25 in San Francisco, USA, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri announced that US audiences would be the first testing grounds for the ‘hiding likes’ feature. Predictably, the Internet pretty much imploded, and other countries started following suit.

Enter the Private Likes Counts test; a recent addition to Instagram’s framework. “We rethought the whole experience of Instagram and recently announced [this feature], which we also expanded globally... This includes helping people to focus on the photos and videos they share, not how many likes they get. While the feedback from early testing has been positive, this is a fundamental change to Instagram, and so we’re continuing our test to learn more from our global community. We hope that by making the number of likes private, people will be able to focus more on the photos and videos posted in Feed, and that this will ultimately drive deeper engagement.”

Instagram also recently launched a new way for people to manage their followers, depending on their offline interactions; basically one can decide who of their followers can see certain parts of their content... liken it to the Close Friends feature, but on steroids.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/cc8hlk/article30851028.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy19Smartphone,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/unlabel-india-tara-bedi-facebook-instagram-interview-new-policies-hiding-likes-mental-health-awareness/article30851029.ece
10,2020/02/18,"COVID-19 | WHO urges calm as China virus death toll nears 1,900","Chinese study of 72,000 patients reveals that 81% of them had only mild infections

The death toll from the COVID-19 outbreak rose again on Tuesday but Chinese and international health officials sought to calm global nerves, citing a study showing that most cases are mild and warning against excessive measures to contain the epidemic.

Nearly 1,900 people have died and more than 72,000 others infected by the virus in China, with hundreds more cases in 25 countries.

The situation remains dire at the epicentre, with the director of a hospital in the central city of Wuhan becoming the seventh medical worker to succumb to the illness. But Chinese officials released a study showing most patients have mild cases of the illness, and the World Health Organization officials said the mortality rate was relatively low.

Also Read Envoy Sun Weidong says China will win battle against coronavirus

The epidemic has triggered panic-buying in Singapore and Hong Kong, concerns about cruise-ship travel and the postponement of trade fairs, sports competitions and cultural events in China and abroad.

The outbreak is threatening to put a dent in the global economy, with China paralysed by vast quarantine measures and major firms such as iPhone-maker Apple and mining giant BHP warning it could damage bottom lines.

Several countries have banned travellers from China and major airlines have suspended flights.

Authorities have placed about 56 million people in hard-hit central Hubei and its capital Wuhan under an unprecedented lockdown. Other cities far from the epicentre have restricted the movements of residents, with a 14-day self-quarantine for people returning to Beijing.

President Xi Jinping, in a phone call with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, said China’s measures were achieving “visible progress”, according to state media.

'Less deadly' than SARS

The official death toll in China hit 1,868 on Tuesday after another 98 people died — most in Hubei and Wuhan, where the virus emerged in December.

Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, became its latest victim, sparking an outpouring of grief online.

Earlier this month, the death of Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang — who had been punished by authorities for sounding the alarm about the virus in late December — triggered anger and calls for political reforms on social media.

Officials figures, meanwhile, showed there were nearly 1,900 new COVID-19 cases. New infections have been falling in the rest of the country for the past two weeks.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus cautioned that it was too early to tell if the decline would continue.

A study among 72,000 confirmed, suspected and clinically diagnosed cases showed that 81% of patients had only mild infections. Those most at risk were the elderly, and people with underlying medical conditions.

The study released by China’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention also showed that the death rate stood at 2.3%, falling below one per cent for people in their 30s and 40s.

Zhong Nanshan, a prominent expert with China's National Health Commission, told reporters that 85% of patients can improve “if they have good life support, treatment conditions, and nutrients”.

The research was cited by WHO officials, who said the COVID-19 illness was “less deadly” than its cousins, such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).

But it is higher than the mortality rate for the seasonal flu, at around 0.1% in the United States.

Michael Ryan, head of WHO’s health emergencies programme, said the outbreak was “very serious” and could grow, but stressed that outside Hubei the epidemic was “affecting a very, very tiny, tiny proportion of people”. There have been some 900 cases around the world, with five deaths.

Cruise concerns

Another 88 people tested positive for the virus on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan, raising the number of infections to 542.

The U.S. repatriated more than 300 American passengers on Monday and Britain became the latest country to offer its citizens a way off the ship after similar plans by Canada, Australia, Hong Kong and South Korea.

Attention was also turning to the Westerdam, a cruise ship in Cambodia, where many of the 2,200 people aboard passengers were allowed to disembark after all initially received a clean bill of health.

An 83-year-old American woman was later diagnosed with the virus in Malaysia, raising concerns that other passengers might have been infected before flying to other countries.

The WHO rejected the suggestion that all cruises should be halted after hundreds of passengers were infected on one vessel off Japan.

Sri Lanka’s former President Maithripala Sirisena, who defected from the Mahinda Rajapaksa government to the rival political camp before being elected to office in 2015, has re-joined his former colleague and current Prime Minister Mr. Rajapaksa.

Mr. Sirisena’s Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) on Monday formed an alliance with the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP or People’s Party) to contest the general election scheduled this summer.

Significantly, President Sirisena — who remained neutral in the November presidential election though the SLFP backed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa — will contest the parliamentary election as part of the new alliance in his home constituency Polonnaruwa (North Central Province), according to SLFP general secretary Dayasiri Jayasekara, who is also a State Minister.

“President Sirisena and our team are scheduled to meet with the SLPP leadership to chalk out the strategy for our alliance,” Mr. Jayasekara told The Hindu on Tuesday. “This must be one of the most powerful coalitions in our history, with three Presidents at the helm,” he said, referring to former Presidents Mr. Sirisena and Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, and his younger brother and current President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.

Re-consolidation

The formation of the new alliance effectively signals a re-consolidation of forces that were earlier aligned to the SLFP, one of Sri Lanka’s foremost national parties that has produced three Presidents in the past, including Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa .

It was after Mr. Sirisena’s defection — he formed government with the rival United National Party (UNP) in 2015 — that the Rajapaksas founded their own party, the SLPP, in 2016.

Mr. Sirisena was left with the SLFP rump, as many of its members joined the Rajapaksas, who pitched the SLPP as their new political vehicle.

The SLPP made its first, big impact when it swept the local government polls in February 2018. Building on that momentum, and subsequently on the incumbency and the perceived failings of the Sirisena–Ranil Wickremesinghe administration, the party mounted what proved an effective campaign, leading to Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s big win in November.

“Though SLPP and SLFP may have had some differences in the past, they hold similar policies. Basically, all the left-wing forces have re-united now,” said Keheliya Rambukwella, a Minister and government spokesman. In the 1950s, the SLFP emerged as a centre-left party challenging the economically right-wing UNP. Over the decades, the SLFP’s support grew among Sri Lanka’s Sinhala-nationalist base and the party drew criticism from others who contested its leftist claim.

“The alliance will work out a mechanism,” Mr. Rambukwella said. Asked who would call the shots — Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa has been named leader of the alliance, while Mr. Sirisena has been designated its chairman — he said: “According to the party structure it has got to be general secretary Basil Rajapaksa,” referring to the third Rajapaksa brother, a former Minister, and the key election strategist of the Rajapaksa camp.

The alliance is eyeing a two-thirds majority in Parliament in the general election likely in April.

Opposition campaign

Meanwhile, Leader of Opposition Sajith Premadasa is leading the oppositional campaign through an alliance that some political parties representing the hill country Tamil and Muslim minorities have pledged to support.

The development comes after differences emerged within the UNP over party leadership that Mr. Wickremesinghe currently holds and deputy leader Mr. Premadasa reportedly sought. Following internal discussion, Mr. Premadasa was named leader of the UNP-led alliance, while Mr. Wickremesinghe will continue as party leader.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7u4w9v/article30853686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18RDSIRISENA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/maithripala-sirisena-joins-the-rajapaksas-in-pre-poll-alliance-in-sri-lanka/article30853687.ece
12,2020/02/18,"Benjamin Netanyahu’s trial to begin on March 17, says Israeli Justice Ministry","He is the first sitting Israeli prime minister to be charged with a crime and has denied any wrongdoing in the three corruption cases against him

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s corruption trial will start on March 17, two weeks after Israel holds its third national election in less than a year, the Justice Ministry said on Tuesday.

Mr. Netanyahu, the first sitting Israeli prime minister to be charged with a crime, has denied any wrongdoing in the three corruption cases against him.

In addition to his legal battle, Mr. Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, is fighting for his political life in a March 2 election, after inconclusive ballots in April and September.

In a statement, the ministry said Mr. Netanyahu, in power for the past decade and Israel’s longest-serving leader, will be required to attend the Jerusalem District Court for the first session to hear an indictment against him. A three-judge panel will hear the case.

Mr. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in three corruption cases. Charges, which were formally filed with the court three weeks ago, include bribery, breach of trust and fraud.

Mr. Netanyahu, 70, is accused of wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts, which prosecutors said included cigars and champagne, from tycoons, and of dispensing regulatory favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by a popular news website.

He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xaxn6n/article30852900.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BENJAMINNETANYAHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/netanyahus-trial-to-begin-on-march-17-says-israeli-justice-ministry/article30852901.ece
13,2020/02/18,Sub group of terror financing watchdog FATF recommends continuation of Pakistan in ‘Grey List’,"The global terror financing watchdog will take the final decision on Friday

The International Co-operation Review Group (ICRG) of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on Tuesday recommended that Pakistan be retained on the “Grey List”, given its failure to completely implement the 27-point action plan to check terror financing.

The final decision would be announced on Friday, at the end of the five-day FATF Plenary session in Paris, sources aware of the proceedings said.

Also Read FATF to review Pakistan status today

It is understood that most of the group members were in favour of continuing the pressure on Pakistan to execute all the measures suggested against funding to banned terror outfits and United Nations designated global terrorists operating from its soil.

Turkey, Malaysia’s support

Speaking in favour of Pakistan, Turkey and Malaysia said Islamabad could be taken off the “Grey List” in coming June. Leaders of these two countries have already gone public on their plans to back Pakistan in the FATF.

According to the sources, Pakistan's Minister for Economic Affairs Hamad Azhar assured the group that all the objectives would be achieved as early as June 2020. He claimed that since the last FATF Plenary, the country had taken all possible measures against terror financing.

Pakistan was presented with the 27-point action plan in the previous FATF meet in October last.

Mr. Azhar said Pakistan had acted against trans-national terror funding operations a priority and that it had convicted unprecedented number of persons, which includes Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) chief Hafiz Saeed. All the shortcomings identified in the mutual evaluation report would also be addressed soon, he added.

India had countered Pakistan's claims, saying the recent action taken by Islamabad against Saeed and others was an attempt to evade further FATF sanctions. While the LeT chief was recently convicted of terror financing, the Pakistani authorities had claimed that a large number of terrorists were arrested, the accounts of banned outfits frozen and the institutions run by them were taken over by the government.

‘Terror funding still on’

India asserted that the terror funding operations were still on and outfits such as the LeT and Jaish-e-Mohammed, whose chief Masood Azhar's location as per Pakistan is “unknown”, were having a free run in Pakistan.

In November last, when Pakistan complied with only five of the 27 action plan points, the FATF asked it to “swiftly complete its full action plan by February 2020”.

The FATF statement said: “ ...Otherwise should significant and sustainable progress not be made across the full range of its action plan by next Plenary, the FATF will take action, including urging members to advise their financial institutions to give special attention to business relations/transactions with Pakistan.”

About a month ago, at the Asia Pacific Joint Group meeting in Beijing, Pakistan was adjudged to have cleared 14 points.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/osg8es/article30853699.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FATFWeekjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sub-group-of-terror-financing-watchdog-fatf-recommends-continuation-of-pakistan-in-grey-list/article30852467.ece
14,2020/02/18,"Ashraf Ghani named winner of Afghanistan presidential election, loser Abdullah Abdullah contests result","Afghanistan’s independent Election Commission announced that Mr. Ghani garnered 50.64% of the vote that took place on September 28, 2019.

Afghanistan incumbent President Ashraf Ghani won a second term, the country’s independent Election Commission announced on February 18, more than four months after polls closed. The Commission said Mr. Ghani garnered 9,23,592 votes, or 50.64%, in the election that took place on September 28 last year. His main challenger, the country’s Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah received 7,20,841 votes, or 39.52%.

But, Mr. Abdullah contested the results and vowed he would form his own parallel government. “Our team, based on clean and biometric votes, is the victor and we declare our victory. The fraudsters are the shame of history and we announce our inclusive government,” Mr. Abdullah said at a press conference in Kabul.

Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah head a fragile national unity government that was put together under U.S. pressure after both leaders claimed victory in Afghanistan’s 2014 elections.

Results delayed

Election results were repeatedly delayed amid accusations of misconduct and technical problems with counting ballots. The final vote tally was originally to be announced November 7.

On election day, many Afghans found incomplete voters’ lists, unworkable biometric identification systems aimed at curbing fraud, and in some cases hostile election workers.

In Kabul, it was rare to see a crowded polling centre. Afghans who had patiently lined up before voting centres were opened, in some locations found that election officials had yet to arrive by opening time.

The Election Commission tried to launch a ballot recount in November, but Mr. Abdullah halted the attempt, saying he would not let his observers participate. Thousands of his supporters rallied against what they said were fake ballots and the controversial recount had seemed set to favour Mr. Ghani.

In December, however, Mr. Abdullah agreed to allow a ballot recount in provinces where his supporters had stopped the process.

The government’s push to hold the vote in itself had been controversial. In an interview before the election, former Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned the election could be destabilising for the country at a time of deep political uncertainty.

The February 18 election results came days after U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper announced a truce agreement between the United States and the Taliban that could lead to the withdrawal of American troops from the country.

The agreement was expected to be formally announced on February 23 and the reduction in violence would begin on February 24, according to people familiar with the plan. That would be followed by all-Afghan peace talks that envision the phased withdrawal of U.S. forces over 18 months, ending 18 years of war.

Mr. Ghani has been critical of the way U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has conducted the talks with the Taliban, complaining about being kept in the dark.

Mr. Ghani, from central Logar province, was born May 19, 1949. He holds a doctorate in Anthropology from Columbia University and first went to the U.S. as a high school exchange student.

Except for a brief teaching stint at Kabul University in the early 1970s, Mr. Ghani lived in the United States, where he was an academic until joining the World Bank as a senior adviser in 1991.

Mr. Ghani returned to Afghanistan after 24 years when the Taliban were ousted by the U.S.-led coalition. He was head of Kabul University until he joined President Hamid Karzai’s government as Finance Minister. In 2010, he led the lengthy process to transfer security of the country from U.S.-led coalition forces to the Afghanistan National Security Forces, which took effect in 2014.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/70wil6/article30545118.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12-DESPATCH-RUCHI21,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ashraf-ghani-secures-second-term-as-afghan-president-election-commission/article30852387.ece

16,2020/02/18,"Michael Bloomberg qualifies for next Democratic debate, and rivals are getting ready","The debate on Wednesday will be the ninth in the contest for who will challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Tuesday qualified for this week's Democratic presidential debate in Nevada, putting him on the same stage as his rivals for the first tie in the race for the party's nomination.

The debate on Wednesday will be the ninth in the contest for who will challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election.

A late entry to the race, Mr. Bloomberg, 78, has risen in public opinion polls as he pours money from his estimated $60 billion personal fortune into a national campaign, spending hundreds of millions of dollars on television ads.

When he takes the stage on Wednesday, he is likely to be challenged directly by rivals over his use as mayor of a policing policy widely seen as discriminatory and of supposed sexist practices at his company.

“There's a lot to talk about with Michael Bloomberg,” former vice president and candidate for the nomination Joe Biden said on Sunday.

Mr. Bloomberg had support from 19% of the people surveyed in a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released on Tuesday.

With that result, he met the Democratic Party's requirements for debate qualification by receiving double-digit support in four national polls recognized by the party, his campaign said in a statement.

While Mr. Bloomberg is not competing in the first four nomination contests — Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — he hopes to start winning delegates beginning on Super Tuesday on March 3, when 14 states will vote.

At least five other candidates have qualified for Wednesday's debate ahead of Nevada's Feb. 22 caucuses: Mr. Biden, Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, and former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg.

Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders charge that Mr. Bloomberg is trying to buy the election. He responds that he is playing by the rules and has offered to fund the Democratic effort to beat Mr. Trump even if he doesn't win the nomination.

He will likely be grilled about his support while New York mayor of a policing strategy that ensnared blacks and Latinos disproportionately.

Mr. Bloomberg apologized for that policy, known as “stop and frisk,” just before announcing he was running for the Democratic presidential nomination.

His campaign has declined to comment on criticism over 2008 remarks in which he tied a housing market collapse to a ban on a discriminatory housing practice known as redlining.

He has also expressed regret over making inappropriate jokes.

“Did I ever tell a bawdy joke? Yeah, sure I did. And do I regret it? Yes. It's embarrassing,” Mr. Bloomberg had said on Jan. 15. “But, you know, that's the way I grew up.”

The Washington Post on Saturday published what it said was a copy of a 32-page booklet distributed at a party in 1990 that included sexist remarks by Mr. Bloomberg, reportedly compiled by his colleagues.

The Post also chronicled numerous discrimination lawsuits filed against Bloomberg LP, a major provider of news and financial information, over the last three decades.

In one case, a saleswoman filed a lawsuit alleging that when she told Mr. Bloomberg she was pregnant in 1995, his response was, ”Kill it.” Mr. Bloomberg has denied making the remark, and the lawsuit was settled. The Washington Post published comments by a man who said he witnessed Mr. Bloomberg's remark.

Mr. Bloomberg said in an interview that his company had experienced “very few” cases of sexual harassment given its large size, and said he thinks “most people would say we're a great place to work.”

He said the company would not release women from non-disclosure agreements that were part of legal settlements, some of which stemmed from allegations of sexual harassment. Ms. Warren has called on Mr. Bloomberg to release the women from the agreements.

On Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg campaign spokeswoman Julie Wood said in an emailed statement regarding the allegations in the Washington Post: “Virtually all of this has been reported over the past two decades. In any large organization, there are going to be complaints but Mike simply does not tolerate any kind of discrimination or harassment, and he's created cultures that are all about equality and inclusion.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ne5ij2/article30851571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MICHAELBLOOMBERG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bloomberg-qualifies-for-next-debate-and-rivals-are-getting-ready/article30851572.ece

18,2020/02/18,Death toll from toxic gas leak rises to 14 in Pakistan,"The apparently odourless gas, which causes severe breathing problems, has sickened hundreds since the leak first struck in Karachi’s coastal neighborhood of Kamari on Sunday

A gas leak in the southern port city of Karachi has killed 14 people and sickened hundreds more, Pakistani Health officials said on Tuesday.

The leak set off a panic in Karachi and raised concerns because city officials could not immediately identify the source and the type of gas involved. Officials said there was no suspicion of sabotage.

The apparently odourless gas, which causes severe breathing problems, has sickened hundreds since striking Karachi’s coastal neighborhood of Kamari on Sunday night when residents began rushing to local hospitals.

Zafar Mahdi, a senior Health official, put the death toll at 14 on Tuesday.

Authorities said they were planning to evacuate residents from Kamari to safer places by Tuesday evening. Scientists and chemical experts from the army and navy were deployed to the affected area to detect the source of the leak.

Syed Murad Ali Shah, Chief Minister in Sindh province, acknowledged that authorities were still unable to determine what caused the toxic gas leak, which he said had not spread to other parts of the city.

All of the stricken people — hospitals said they had treated more than 650 — were residents of Kamari.

A patient in a Karchi hospital, Babar Bahadur, said on Monday he first felt an ache in his eyes and pain in chest.

""My heart started beating suddenly very, very fast,” he said. He recounted how he immediately was rushed to the hospital where he was treated and felt better “after quite some time”.

Port officials insisted no gas leaks occurred at any of their facilities.

Australia has appointed former New South Wales premier Barry O’Farrell as the next high commissioner to India, one of Canberra’s closest and most significant partners in the Indo-Pacific, an official statement said on Tuesday.

O’Farrell, 60, will succeed Harinder Sidhu who has been in the office since 2016.

23,2020/02/18,Using peacekeeping operations’ funds for other purposes ‘bad faith’: India,"The UN owes India $38 million as of March 2019 which is among the highest it has to pay to any country for peacekeeping operations

India, which is among the largest troop contributors to the UN peacekeeping force, has voiced concern over the delay and non-payment of funds to contributor countries and closed missions, terming it as “bad faith” if the reserves are used for other purposes.

India has been among the few countries to have fully paid its dues to the UN on time. The UN, however, owed India $38 million, which is among the highest it has to pay to any country, for peacekeeping operations as of March 2019.

Highlighting India’s priority issues for deliberations in the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, Permanent Representative Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said the financial situation of the UN Peacekeeping, particularly the non-payment or delayed payment of arrears to the Troop/Police Contributing Countries (T/PCCs) remains a cause of concern.

While some ameliorative measures, introduced last year, did provide a temporary reprieve, he said the dismal practice of delaying payments to T/PCCs seems to be making a come back.

He also highlighted the festering matter of payments for so called closed peacekeeping missions, saying non-payment of peacekeeping dues, for years after the end of peacekeeping missions, ensures that there is no closure to this matter.

Using funds of such peacekeeping operations for other requirements, while payments for peacekeeping remain, is not only bad accounting practice, but also tends to be interpreted as bad faith, Akbaruddin said.

The Indian envoy also called for an institutionalisation of an approach, saying it is essential that all key actors are associated in a consistent and predictable manner in the decision-making matrix.

He voiced concern that in practice, we have not moved beyond perfunctory efforts. We need to agree on practical measures to institutionalise engagement and cooperation between the TCCs/PCCs, the Security Council and the Secretariat.

He also asserted that there can be no substitute for professional competence of those engaged in all aspects of UN peacekeeping. The performance of peacekeeping operations should be measured in relation to political and operational realities, priorities set for implementing mandate, adequacy and appropriateness of resources.

The phenomenon that exist today of mandates following budgets is not sustainable. Budgets should follow mandates, he said.

India called for assessment of instances of reported under-performance, saying such assessment needs to examine whether there were units available at higher levels in the Peacekeeping Capability Readiness System (PCRS) that were overlooked during selection.

It also needs to be examined whether caveats have impacted performance; whether poor performance is due to lack of resources, including equipment; or whether the mandate, including guidelines, were not clear, resulting in unsatisfactory implementation.

Honest assessment and feedback is essential to have an effective accountability system. Assessing performance without determining accountability will leave us open to repeating errors, Akbaruddin said.

He voiced criticism that established mechanisms for discussion and agreement seem to be hollowing out, noting that there is a visible reluctance to revise the reimbursement parameters, even after following the agreed revision procedures. During the recent discussions at the Contingent Owned Equipment (COE) Working Group, there was no consensus amongst key partners to increase the COE reimbursement rates, while the available National Cost Data estimates clearly suggested an upward revision of the scales.

Akbaruddin said the triennial COE Working Group has met seven times so far during nearly 20 years.

The highest increase agreed so far was in 2001 (7.43%), during the first meeting and the last agreed increase was in 2017, a mere 0.6%. However, no consensus was reached in January this year, which is a throwback to 2004.

It is not a good augury to avoid data based decision making on technical issues such as equipment costs. Let us not forget, appropriate equipment is a must for effective mandate implementation, safety and security of personnel, protection of civilians and overall performance of the mission, he said.

Voicing support for The Action for Peacekeeping (A4P), an initiative of UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Akbaruddin said the initiative is a commonly agreed template to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of peacekeeping within the contours of shared understandings.

He pointed out that the areas of the A4P that require effective follow-up and implementation include inclusion of all stakeholders and all phases of peacekeeping operations in the Performance and Accountability Mechanism, development of a common culture of UN Peacekeeping, without the privileges of caveats, enhancing participation of women by prioritising offers of women peacekeepers and medical mapping of all missions comprehensively so that existing gaps are attended to.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pvh043/article30849783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UNITEDNATIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/using-peacekeeping-operations-funds-for-other-purposes-bad-faith-india/article30849784.ece
24,2020/02/18,"Nissan shareholders furious at Ghosn scandal, dismal results","New Chief Executive Makoto Uchida apologized to shareholders for having “allowed the misconduct” of Ghosn and promised better governance, transparency and financial results, but pleaded for more time.

Nissan shareholders vented their outrage at the Japanese automaker’s top management Tuesday for crashing stock prices, zero dividends and quarterly losses after the scandal-ridden departure of former Chairman Carlos Ghosn.

They got up, one by one, at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting, demanding that Nissan Motor Co. quickly fix diving car sales, work harder to repair its battered brand and have executives give up their pay.

Ghosn, a superstar executive who had led Nissan for two decades, was arrested in November 2018. He was awaiting trial on financial misconduct charges in Tokyo when he skipped bail late last year and escaped to Lebanon.

New Chief Executive Makoto Uchida apologized to shareholders for having “allowed the misconduct” of Ghosn and promised better governance, transparency and financial results, but pleaded for more time.

""We are in a disastrous situation,” Uchida said of the Ghosn scandal. “It was shocking, and I denounce it.”

Also Read Ghosn seeks release of internal documents

Uchida is among the four directors whose election was up for vote at the meeting held at a conference center in Yokohama, near Tokyo, where Nissan is headquartered.

Moves after Ghosn’s exit

Uchida was tapped in December to replace Hiroto Saikawa, who was Ghosn’s successor.

Saikawa tendered his resignation last year after allegations surfaced about his own dubious personal income. Saikawa’s resignation becomes final at the end of the shareholders’ meeting.

One shareholder asked if Saikawa was giving up his retirement pay.

Another asked why Jean-Dominique Senard, chairman of French alliance partner Renault SA and Nissan board member, was seen leaving a previous shareholders’ meeting in a Toyota.

Saikawa did not reply. Senard apologized and said it was a mistake that had upset him as well.

Global sales of Nissan vehicles have plunged. Nissan recorded red ink for the quarter through December, the first such quarterly loss in 11 years.

Nissan’s prized technology, such as electric vehicles and automated driving, will be featured in planned models, Uchida said.

Also up for approval at the meeting was the appointment of Nissan Chief Operating Officer Ashwanti Gupta, who joined Renault in India in 2006, and has since worked for the alliance, which also includes smaller Japanese automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp.

The appointment of Nissan’s production expert Hideyuki Sakamoto and Pierre Fleuriot, a risk management specialist and independent director at Renault, was also up for vote.

Renault owns 44% of Nissan and so the proposals were certain to pass. The appointments were welcomed by clapping at the end of the two-and-a-half hour meeting, and the executives took a bow on stage.

Plummeting fortunes

But hanging over the entire meeting was Nissan’s plummeting fortunes, its reputation tarnished over not only the Ghosn scandal but the shaky way it was handled at the company.

Shareholders said they saw confusion in management.

One argued no one would want to buy a car from a company that looked as disorganized as Nissan. At one point, several shareholders began shouting at each other.

Another shareholder proposed putting a bounty on Ghosn’s head so he could be brought back from Lebanon to stand trial. Japan and Lebanon do not have an extradition treaty.

Ghosn, who has insisted on his innocence, has said he was targeted with trumped up charges because of what he called a conspiracy at Nissan to block a fuller merger with Renault.

""Profitability outlook is negative from worsening operating leverage, heavy discounting trends from heightened competition, and rising R&D cost as a percentage of revenue,” said Bahari.

Uchida repeatedly tried to assure shareholders the company was standing up to wrongdoing, leveraging the Renault alliance and working on products to highlight “intelligent mobility.”

""I am confident we can achieve all this,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/fzfqz2/article29623510.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JAPANNISSAN-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nissan-shareholders-furious-at-ghosn-scandal-dismal-results/article30849754.ece
25,2020/02/18,"One policeman killed, two injured in IED blast in Pakistan","The explosive device went off near a police mobile van deployed for the security of polio workers

At least one policeman was killed and two injured on Tuesday when an improvised explosive device (IED) went off near a police mobile van deployed for the security of polio workers in northwest Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, officials said.

This year’s first nationwide polio vaccination drive began on Monday, aiming to vaccinate approximately 39.6 million children. The campaign involves nearly 265,000 polio workers going door-to-door to inoculate children under the age of five.

The incident took place in Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan city in the province where the van was deployed for the security of the polio workers canvassing the area, District Police Officer Wahid Mahmood was quoted as saying by the Dawn News.

One policeman was killed and the two injured have been shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, where their condition is said to be stable, Mahmood said.

The area has been cordoned off, while a search operation is under way, he added.

However, no group has claimed responsibility for the attack.

26,2020/02/18,Boy Scouts of America files for bankruptcy,"By going to bankruptcy court, the Scouts can put those lawsuits on hold for now. But ultimately they could be forced to sell off some of their vast property holdings, including campgrounds and hiking trails, to raise money for a compensation fund that could surpass a billion dollars.

Barraged by hundreds of sex-abuse lawsuits, the Boy Scouts of America filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday in hopes of working out a potentially mammoth victim compensation plan that will allow the hallowed, 110-year-old organization to carry on.

The Chapter 11 filing in federal bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware, sets in motion what could be one of the biggest, most complex bankruptcies ever seen. Scores of lawyers are seeking settlements on behalf of several thousand men who say they were molested as scouts by scoutmasters or other leaders decades ago but are only now eligible to sue because of recent changes in their states’ statute-of-limitations laws.

By going to bankruptcy court, the Scouts can put those lawsuits on hold for now. But ultimately they could be forced to sell off some of their vast property holdings, including campgrounds and hiking trails, to raise money for a compensation fund that could surpass a billion dollars.

""Scouting programs will continue throughout this process and for many years to come,” said Evan Roberts, a spokesman for the Scouts. “Local councils are not filing for bankruptcy because they are legally separate and distinct organizations.””

The Boy Scouts are just the latest major American institution to face a heavy price over sexual abuse. Roman Catholic dioceses across the country and schools such as Penn State and Michigan State have paid out hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years.

The bankruptcy represents a painful turn for an organization that has been a pillar of American civic life for generations and a training ground for future leaders. Achieving the rank of Eagle Scout has long been a proud accomplishment that politicians, business leaders, astronauts and others put on their resumes and in their official biographies.

The Boy Scouts’ finances have been strained in recent years by declining membership and sex-abuse settlements.

The number of youths taking part in scouting has dropped below 2 million, down from more than 4 million in peak years of the 1970s. The organization has tried to counter the decline by admitting girls, but its membership rolls took a big hit Jan. 1 when The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints - for decades a major sponsor of Boy Scout units - cut ties and withdrew more than 400,000 scouts in favor of programs of its own.

The financial outlook had worsened last year after New York, Arizona, New Jersey and California passed laws making it easier for victims of long-ago abuse to file claims. Teams of lawyers across the U.S. have been signing up clients by the hundreds to sue the Boy Scouts.

Most of the newly surfacing cases date to the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s; the organization says there were only five known abuse victims in 2018. The Boy Scouts credit the change to an array of prevention policies adopted since the mid-1980s, including mandatory criminal background checks and abuse-prevention training for all staff and volunteers, and a rule that two or more adult leaders be present during all activities.

In many ways, the crisis parallels the one facing the Catholic Church in the U.S. Both institutions boast of major progress over recent decades in combating abuse. whether by priests or scout leaders, but both face many lawsuits alleging negligence and cover-ups, mostly decades ago.

Among the matters to be addressed in bankruptcy court- the fate of the Boy Scouts’ assets; the extent to which the organization’s insurance will help cover compensation; and whether assets of the Scouts’ more than 260 local councils will be added to the fund.

""There are a lot of very angry, resentful men out there who will not allow the Boy Scouts to get away without saying what all their assets are,” said lawyer Paul Mones, who represents numerous clients suing the BSA. “They want no stone unturned.”

Amid the crush of lawsuits, the Scouts recently mortgaged the major properties owned by the national leadership, including the headquarters in Irving, Texas, and the 140,000-acre Philmont Ranch in New Mexico, to help secure a line of credit.

Founded in 1910, the Boy Scouts have kept confidential files since the 1920s listing staff and volunteers implicated in sexual abuse, for the avowed purpose of keeping predators away from youth. According to a court deposition, the files as of January listed 7,819 suspected abusers and 12,254 victims.

Until last spring, the organization had insisted it never knowingly allowed a predator to work with youths. But in May, reported that attorneys for abuse victims had identified multiple cases in which known predators were allowed to return to leadership posts. The next day, Boy Scouts chief executive Mike Surbaugh wrote to a congressional committee, acknowledging the group’s previous claim was untrue.

James Kretschmer of Houston, among the many men suing for alleged abuse, says he was molested by a Scout leader over several months in the mid-1970s in the Spokane, Washington, area. Regarding the bankruptcy, he said, “It is a shame because at its core and what it was supposed to be, the Boy Scouts is a beautiful organization.”

""But you know, anything can be corrupted,” he added. “And if they’re not going to protect the people that they’ve entrusted with the children, then shut it down and move on.”

Ahead of the Chapter 11 filing, lawyers said that because of the organization’s 50-state presence, as well as its ties to churches and civic groups that sponsor scout troops, a bankruptcy by the Boy Scouts would be unprecedented in its complexity. It would be national in scope, unlike the various Catholic Church bankruptcy cases, which have unfolded diocese by diocese.

“A Boy Scout bankruptcy would be bigger in scale than any other child abuse bankruptcy we’ve ever seen,” said Seattle-based attorney Mike Pfau, whose firm is representing scores of men nationwide alleging they were abused as Boy Scouts.

Illustrating the depth of its problems, the organization in 2018 sued six of its insurers for refusing to cover its sex abuse liabilities. The insurers said their obligation was void because the Scouts refused to take effective preventive measures such as warning parents that boys might be abused.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fwbkwz/article30849703.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOYSCOUTSBANKRUPTCY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/boy-scouts-file-for-bankruptcy-due-to-sex-abuse-lawsuits/article30849705.ece
27,2020/02/18,Wuhan hospital director dies of COVID-19,"Liu Zhiming is the second prominent Chinese doctor to have succumbed to COVID-19

The head of a leading hospital in China's central city of Wuhan, the epicentre of a coronavirus outbreak, died of COVID-19 on Tuesday, state television said, becoming the second prominent Chinese doctor to have succumbed to the outbreak.

Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuhan Wuchang Hospital, died at 10:30 a.m., it said.

Earlier this month, millions in China mourned the death of Li Wenliang, a doctor who was previously reprimanded for issuing an early warning about the coronavirus.

Tens of thousands of medical workers have been fighting to contain the spread of COVID-19, believed to have first surfaced in a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of the central province of Hubei.

As in the case of Li's death, there was confusion on the Chinese internet about Liu's condition on Monday night.

On Monday night, the Communist Party propaganda department of the Hubei Health Commission wrote in a social media post that Liu had died.

But it said in a subsequent post that Liu was alive.

“According to Liu's relative, the hospital is still trying its best to rescue him,” the commission said in the second post, adding that the previous misinformation was from a good friend of Liu who was not aware of the latest situation.

It has not posted any message since state television announced Liu's death on Tuesday morning.

Beijing was accused of covering up the full extent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. In the current coronavirus outbreak, Beijing has called for transparency.

28,2020/02/18,Killing of 7-year-old stokes anger in Mexico over femicides,"Mexico City prosecutor Ernestina Godoy said the girl’s murder would not go unpunished. The investigation is focused on identifying the woman seen walking away from the school with the girl.

The killing of a 7-year-old girl on the southern outskirts of Mexico City has stoked rising anger over the brutal slayings of women, including one found stabbed to death and skinned earlier this month.

The city prosecutor’s office said on Monday that investigators identified a body found over the weekend as that of Fatima, a grade-school student who was taken by a stranger on Feb. 11. By law, prosecutors don’t give the full name of victims.

Mexico City prosecutor Ernestina Godoy said the girl’s murder would not go unpunished. The investigation is focused on identifying the woman seen walking away from the school with the girl.

Guillermo Anton Godţnez, the girl’s grandfather, said on Monday that his daughter arrived at the school 15 or 20 minutes after the woman led the girl away. He added that his granddaughter had left the school wearing her uniform, but the woman had put a green shirt and pants on her.

Prosecutors’ spokesman Ulises Lara offered a $100,000 reward for information on the person who picked her up when she left school.

Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum personally accompanied the girl’s mother during the legal paperwork involved in filing charges and picking up the girl’s body. “We are going to accompany the family, and justice must be done,” Sheinbaum said.

The girl’s mother, Maria Magdalena Antūn, appeared angry and distraught outside prosecutors’ offices. “Justice has to be done, for my daughter and for all women,” she said.

She said investigators made the family wait hours and travel across the city to even file a missing person report. Other relatives accused police of not acting quickly enough.

""She could have been found alive, but nobody paid attention to us,” said Sonia Lūpez, the girl’s aunt. Lūpez also said there had been longstanding questions about the mother’s ability to care for her children, but that city health and family welfare agencies had not helped them.

Later, family and friends gathered for a wake at the family’s home to mourn the girl.

Many relatives and commentators called for urgent changes to primary school safety protocols. At government schools in urban areas of Mexico, children simply walk out on the street after classes end. Although their parents are often waiting outside, it is not the school’s responsibility to make sure someone is waiting to meet them.

The abduction and killing of the child came just two days after Ingrid Escamilla, a young Mexico City resident, was allegedly murdered by a boyfriend.

The man, who has been arrested and purportedly confessed to killing Escamilla with a knife, mutilated her body and flushed part of her corpse into the sewer.

Indignation grew after some local media published horrific photos of the skinned corpse, apparently leaked by city police officers.

Protesters read a statement Friday saying, “It enrages us how Ingrid was killed, and how the media put her body on display.” On Monday afternoon, the Interior Ministry said in a statement that media should not publish personal details or images of children in relation to a crime whether they are the authors, victims or witnesses.

The Mexican capital has seen a series of angry demonstrations over killings of women over the past few months, including several in which protesters have vandalized major monuments and buildings.

The killings have proved a politically difficult issue for President Andrşs Manuel Lūpez Obrador, who said protests over the killings were an attempt to distract attention from his social programs.

Last week, Mr. Lūpez Obrador showed little patience for those who questioned him about the government’s commitment to fighting violence against women.

""This issue has been manipulated a lot in the media,” the president said Monday, adding that “I don’t want the issue just to be women’s killings.”

On Monday, Mr. Lūpez Obrador defended his record, saying “we are working so that there won’t be any more women’s killings.”

But referring to protests last week over Escamilla’s killing in which demonstrators spray-painted the doors and walls of the colonial-era National Palace, the president said, “They shouldn’t paint our doors and walls.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/t57h1r/article26371656.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-MEXICOELCHAPO-LOPEZOBRADOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/killing-of-7-year-old-stokes-anger-in-mexico-over-femicides/article30848689.ece
29,2020/02/18,Niger stampede kills 20 at handout for refugees,"The region which abuts Nigeria and Chad has been repeatedly hit by attacks by Nigeria's Boko Haram jihadist group since 2015

Fifteen women and five children were trampled to death on Monday in a stampede for food and money for refugees in southeast Niger, a regional governor said.

The accident occurred at a youth and culture centre in Diffa, the main town of a region of the same name that hosts more than a quarter of a million refugees and internally displaced people.

""Unfortunately, fifteen women and five children died... in this regrettable drama,"" Issa Lemine, the regional governor of Diffa, said on television after visiting the injured in hospital.

Aid workers confirmed the death toll and said about 10 people had been injured.

The region which abuts Nigeria and Chad has been repeatedly hit by attacks by Nigeria's Boko Haram jihadist group since 2015.

It hosts 119,000 Nigerian refugees, 109,000 internally-displaced people and 30,000 Nigeriens who have come home from Nigeria because of the instability in its northeast, according to UN figures released in October.

The aid being distributed had been given by Babagana Umara Zulum, the governor of Borno state in northeast Nigeria, a Nigerian official told AFP.

He had come to the region to visit camps for refugees and the displaced, and had already left the town when the stampede occurred.

Crowd

A large amount of food, cooking oil and clothing, as well as money, was due to be distributed, a Diffa municipal worker told AFP.

""Thousands of people were in the courtyard of the MJC (Culture and Youth Centre) and nearby,"" he said.

""As soon as the first people received their rations, the compressed crowd started to get excited, the organisers were swiftly overwhelmed and then it all kicked off -- women, children and the fit ones started to push,"" the employee said.

""The weakest people fell to the ground. Some were injured and others were crushed to death.""

A local resident told AFP that aid workers were distributing 5,000 naira ($13.75, 12.7 euros), referring to Nigeria's national currency.

Diffa governor Lemine said a successful distribution had taken place on Sunday.

""Thousands of people, most of them refugees, heard about the handout and left the camps, sometimes travelling up to 100 km to get to Diffa,"" the source said.

A local official said he was astonished at the situation: ""Normally, people who are entitled to the handouts send a representative to Diffa to pick it up. But this time, the refugees themselves decided to come and get it, travelling dozens of kilometres (miles).""

Another resident said: ""Even ordinary inhabitants of Diffa rushed there in the hope of getting the handout.""

A local journalist said the emergency services arrived swiftly, taking wounded people to local treatment centres, while bodies were taken to the morgue of the nearby Diffa hospital.

Floods

Mr. Zulum visited three sites housing more than 100,000 Nigerian refugees -- camps at Bosso, Garin-Wazan and Toummour.

In addition to a crisis sparked by jihadist violence, Diffa is also battling floods caused by the Yobe River, which delineates part of Niger's border with Nigeria.

The floods have left more than 20,000 people without shelter, according to the local authorities.

They have also devastated rice and pepper fields, whose harvests provide the backbone of the local economy.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/q539l7/article30283393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIGER-SECURITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/niger-stampede-kills-20-at-handout-for-refugees/article30848509.ece

31,2020/02/18,Jeff Bezos launches $10 billion fund to combat climate change,"Hundreds of Amazon employees last month signed a blog criticizing the online retail giant’s climate policies and demanding it do more to tackle climate change

Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon and the world’s richest man, said he was committing $10 billion to a new fund to tackle climate change.

In a post to his 1.4 million followers on Instagram on Monday, the e-commerce tycoon said the Bezos Earth Fund would “fund scientists, activists, NGOs— any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world.”

“Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet,” said Mr. Bezos, whose net worth is estimated to be around $130 billion.

Hundreds of Amazon employees last month signed a blog criticizing the online retail giant’s climate policies and demanding it do more to tackle climate change.

Amazon has been accused of creating vast amounts of waste from the packaging it uses for doorstep deliveries, as well as for the greenhouse gas emissions from huge fleets of vehicles.

The company, which in December said its workforce had hit 750,000, has also been denounced over its carbon footprint because of the high energy consumption of its server farms for its lucrative cloud computing activities.

“I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share,” Mr. Bezos said in his announcement on Monday.

32,2020/02/18,"COVID-19: death toll passes 1,800 in China","More than 12,000 people have recovered and been discharged, according to health commission figures

The toll from China's coronavirus epidemic jumped to 1,868 on February 18 after 98 more people died, according to the National Health Commission.

Nearly 72,500 people nationwide have been infected by the new COVID-19 strain of the virus, which first emerged in December before spiralling into a nationwide epidemic.

There were 1,886 new cases reported Tuesday — a decline on Monday's figure, and the lowest single-day figure of new cases so far this month.

Most of the deaths were in Hubei province, the hard-hit epicentre of the outbreak, with five reported elsewhere in the country. Hubei has been locked down to try to contain the virus, with tens of millions of people placed under effective quarantine in the province.

The number of new cases reported outside Hubei province was just 79, down from 890 on February 4. It marks the lowest number of new cases outside the virus-struck province since January 23.

China's national health authority has said the declining numbers are a sign that the outbreak is under control.

However, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the trend ""must be interpreted very cautiously"". ""Trends can change as new populations are affected. It is too early to tell if this reported decline will continue. Every scenario is still on the table,"" he told reporters on Monday.

Chinese health officials have urged patients who recovered from the coronavirus to donate blood so that plasma can be extracted to treat others who are critically ill. Plasma from patients who have recovered from a spell of pneumonia triggered by COVID-19 contains antibodies that can help reduce the virus load in critically ill patients, an official from the National Health Commission told a press briefing Monday.

33,2020/02/18,"Sanders, Bloomberg trade insults as Democratic White House race heats up","‘Mr. Bloomberg, like anyone else has a right to run for president. He does not have a right to buy the presidency’, Mr. Sanders told thousands of supporters at a rally in Richmond

Democratic White House contenders Bernie Sanders and Michael Bloomberg stepped up their attacks on each other on Monday, with Mr. Sanders accusing the media mogul of trying to buy the election and Mr. Bloomberg saying the senator and his fervent supporters were hurting the party.

Mr. Sanders compared the former New York mayor with Republican President Donald Trump, saying both were billionaires trying to use their wealth to bend a corrupt political system.

“Mr. Bloomberg, like anyone else has a right to run for president. He does not have a right to buy the presidency!” Mr. Sanders told thousands of supporters at a rally in Richmond, near San Francisco, who booed vehemently at the mention of Mr. Bloomberg's name.

The attacks in California, including criticism of Mr. Bloomberg's record on race, echoed a series of attacks that Mr. Sanders, a self-identified democratic socialist who regularly rails against the political influence of billionaires, leveled at Mr. Bloomberg over the weekend in Nevada and Colorado.

That drew a response on Monday from Mr. Bloomberg, who tweeted a video featuring alleged Sanders supporters - his fervent online backers known as “Bernie Bros” - attacking other candidates and their supporters on social media.

We need to unite to defeat Trump in November. This type of ""energy"" is not going to get us there. https://t.co/bPuUZMs2d6 pic.twitter.com/Tdp6mpWjcX — Mike Bloomberg (@MikeBloomberg) February 17, 2020

It ended with a clip of Mr. Sanders calling for “civil discourse,” followed by the question “Really?”

“We need to unite to defeat Trump in November,” Mr. Bloomberg said in the tweet. “This type of 'energy' is not going to get us there.”

Mr. Bloomberg's campaign said the attacks from Mr. Sanders were ”shameful” and compared him with Trump for also unfairly criticizing Bloomberg. It said the attacks were a sign of the growing political threat Bloomberg posed.

Mr. Bloomberg has risen sharply in recent opinion polls in the race for the Democratic nomination to challenge Mr. Trump in the Nov. 3 election after pouring hundreds of millions of his own dollars into advertising in states that vote in March or later.

Mr. Sanders leads polls nationally and in Nevada, where the next nominating contest will be held on Saturday, after strong finishes in the first two contests in Iowa and New Hampshire.

“At this point, the primary is Bernie's to lose, and ours to win. Bernie knows this. Trump knows this. That's why they are united in the campaign against Mike, said Kevin Sheekey, campaign manager for Bloomberg.

“This campaign will not sit idly by and allow these false attacks to stand without response,” Sheekey said in a statement.

Stop-and-frisk

Mr. Bloomberg skipped the four early voting States in February - South Carolina will also vote on Feb. 29.

At the rally in Richmond, Mr. Sanders also criticized Mr. Bloomberg's past support in New York of “stop-and-frisk” police policies during his time as mayor that disproportionately hit African Americans. Mr. Bloomberg has apologized for his support of that tactic.

Mr. Sanders also said Mr. Bloomberg had in the past opposed a minimum wage and had called for cuts to government-run social assistance programs.

“Imagine a multi-billionaire opposing a raise in the minimum wage. Imagine a multi-billionaire asking for cuts to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,” Mr. Sanders told the crowd.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6lvnn4/article30848297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SANDERSKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sanders-bloomberg-trade-insults-as-democratic-white-house-race-heats-up/article30848298.ece
34,2020/02/18,Million Dollar Quartet comes to Bengaluru from February 26,"Get ready to groove to iconic rock ‘n’ roll numbers such as ‘Blue Suede Shoes’ and ‘Walk the Line’

December 4, 1956 was an important date for rock and roll fans as it was the day Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins played together at Sun Records Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, for the first and only time. That impromptu jam session spawned an album, a book by Colin Escott and Floyd Mutrux, and a musical on Broadway in 2010 and West End in 2011. The musical, which features 24 classic numbers, including ‘Blue Suede Shoes’, ‘Hound Dog’, ‘Great Balls of Fire’, ‘Fever’, ‘Folsom Prison Blues’ and ‘Walk the Line’ came to Mumbai in December 2017. The musical will be on at Bengaluru from February 26.

Peter Duncan, who plays Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Records, writing over email, says: “I performed some dates on the 2016 production and then took over for the 2020 tour.” Talking of the challenges of bringing a musical to India, Duncan says, “The logistics are quite hard. Getting all the equipment and instruments here and back safely and adjusting to new venues that we have little time to rehearse at is also tough. Last time, it worked a treat.”

In the musical, each musician when he enters the stage for the first time sings a verse and all actors on stage freeze. Phillips then introduces the singer, there is dialogue between them and then Phillips asks him to play something for him — the second verse of the song. The actors then unfreeze.

The 65-year-old actor, presenter, documentary maker, former Chief Scout and two-time Blue Peter presenter, says: “Not a note or harmony is recorded... it is all live.”

The reception to Million Dollar Quartet in Mumbai was great, says Duncan. “The audience were so up for having a good time and they love Elvis of course.” The Bengaluru audience, Duncan says, can look forward to “a wonderful true story, great music and A whole lotta shakin’.”

Of the Quartet — Cash, Presley, Lewis and Perkins, Duncan says his favourite is “Carl Perkins because without him there probably would have been no Beatles.” On the research for his role, Duncan says, “I discovered that like all revolutionaries Sam could see and hear things that others couldn't. Music changes the world while governments try to stop any kind of change until it is too late. Sam was ahead of the curve.”

The most difficult thing about the role is, Duncan says, “Making sure that the audience gets the story as well as the great music.”

Million Dollar Quartet will be performed at St. John’s Auditorium, Koramangala, from February 26 to March 1, with one show on weekdays and two shows on Saturday and Sunday.

After their high-energy act, the team stood on stage shaking nervously, waiting for the big announcement. When it came after a hushed silence, there was an explosion of excitement, tears and a standing ovation in the Las Vegas studio. A 34-member dance group from the fringes of Mumbai, V Unbeatable, had won America’s Got Talent: The Champions Season 2.

The dancers aged 12 to 27 were touted to be a favourite with the show’s judges — Simon Cowell, Heidi Klum, Alesha Dixon, and Howie Mandel. They came under the spotlight when they participated in the fourth season of the Indian reality show, Dance Plus in 2018.

Moments after winning the show, the group said on Instagram: “It is a feeling of immense pride when you get a chance to represent your country at [an] international platform with a group [which is] like family.” Actors Ranveer Singh and Akshay Kumar congratulated the ensemble on social media. In the show’s second season, Mr. Mandel gave the group a Golden Buzzer, elevating them to the semi-finals. “I knew V Unbeatable was special from the moment they walked on stage. Thank you for opening up the world to us. You deserve this incredible moment,” tweeted Mr. Mandel.

Watch their performance of Marana Mass here.

Videos of V Unbeatable went viral in the weeks leading up to the final, notably one on Marana Mass from Rajinikanth’s Petta, composed by Anirudh Ravichander. Before the results were out, finalists gave a performance, and V Unbeatable chose Tattad Tattad from Goliyon ki Rasleela Ram Leela, pairing up with Travis Barker, drummer for the rock band Blink-182.

The group was previously known as Unbeatable, but a couple of years ago, after one of its founders, Vikas, passed away due to an injury during the rehearsals, they renamed themselves V Unbeatable (Vikas Unbeatable).

The group was founded by Vikas along with Omprakash Chauhan, currently the director. They previously also participated in the first season of America’s Got Talent: The Championship, securing the fourth position.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/u6js9z/article30851158.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/unbeatable,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/marana-mass-dancers-v-unbeatable-win-americas-got-talent-the-champions-season-2/article30851159.ece

39,2020/02/18,Over 60 lakh bales bought at MSP: Cotton Corporation,"‘Selling at market price may hit farmers’

The Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has procured more than 60 lakh bales of cotton so far this season at Minimum Support Price (MSP).

Chairman and managing director of CCI P. Alli Rani told The Hindu that 60% of the estimated cotton production had come into the market so far this season, which started in October 2019. Of this, the CCI had procured 28%. The Cotton Advisory Board’s provisional cotton production estimate for this season is 360 lakh bales.

The CCI has nine lakh bales stock of cotton from the previous seasons and 60 lakh bales from this season. Nearly 50% of cotton procured so far this season is from Telangana.

On the pricing in the domestic market, she said the maximum price that the CCI was quoting for the current season’s cotton was ₹46,900 a candy. On the industry’s demand that CCI should sell the commodity at the market price, Ms. Rani said farmers continued to bring cotton to the market and if the CCI reduced the prices now, the market price might decline further, leading to loss to farmers. She also said the CCI was confident of selling its stock this season as the quality was high.

The CCI might look at exports, though it was not keen on it now, she added.

The CCI has written to state governments to give indents for cotton seed requirements. It had also distributed ₹3 crore worth harvesting machinery free of cost to farmers, she said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/over-60-lakh-bales-bought-at-msp-cotton-corporation/article30854055.ece
40,2020/02/18,General insurance firms need to raise the bar to cut losses: IRDAI,"‘Are complex products that confuse customers needed?’

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) has said that general insurance companies need to be more efficient by controlling expenses in order to cut losses.

“Many general insurance companies have underwriting losses but they are carrying on their business because of investment proceeds. This is a short-sighted measure and we have to graduate ourselves to ensure that there are no underwriting losses,” S.C. Khuntia, Chairman, IRDAI, said on the sidelines of an event here. “This doesn’t necessarily mean that the insurers [should] increase the prices, because improvement in efficiency can also lead to reduction in underwriting losses. Similarly, expenses of the company can be controlled,” he said.

The general insurance segment grew at 14% last year as against its potential to grow at 17-18%, while the life insurance segment grew only at 10% as against the 12-13% potential, he said.

Mr. Khuntia said insurers were expected to review their products annually and weed out the ones that were not popular among customers. “Generally, in insurance companies, the top three to four products contribute 80% of the business. So, is there a need for large number of complex products that confuse the customers and drag the insurer’s performance also? So, the product review should ensure elimination of products that are not being accepted by the customers,” he said.

Mr. Khuntia said the the regulator would like to see a sustainable insurance industry which should be neither loss making not unduly profit making. He clarified that the regulator would not intervene in pricing.

“We don’t intervene in pricing. But if the pricing is not right and the product is put for approval to us then we certainly point it out to them. It’s an open market and we don’t want to regulate prices in a deregulated economy,” he said.

Asked whether IRDAI had received any proposal from LIC regarding its IPO, he replied in the negative.

“Any company which goes public there will be better corporate governance and better disclosure.”

He said it was a good idea for every insurance company to list and that IRDAI would nudge entities to go for the same but not make mandatory.

“It is, however, not making it mandatory to list because smaller companies are yet to achieve the scale for going public,” Mr. Khuntia said, adding that ideally a company should achieve sufficient scale to list within 10 years of its existence.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ummupq/article30853983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THBUIRDAI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/general-insurance-firms-need-to-raise-the-bar-to-cut-losses-irdai/article30853984.ece
41,2020/02/18,"JSW Paints sets sights on south, west India","Company mulls setting up new manufacturing facility costing ₹75 crore

JSW Paints Pvt. Ltd., a part of the $13-billion JSW Group, is planning to put up a new manufacturing plant to meet its growth target, said a top official.

“We have set ourselves a target to achieve 5% market share in south and west in decorative paints in two to three years,” said A.S. Sundaresan, CEO, JSW Paints.

“We started the paint division in April 2019 and it is growing. Right now, we have two plants and are planning to expand our business as it is growing at a healthy rate,” he said.

The JSW Group set up its first largest and fully-automated industrial coil coatings facility with an annual capacity of 25,000 kilolitre (KL) in Mumbai and decorative paints unit with 100,000 KL annual capacity at Vijayanagar in Karnataka at a cost of ₹600 crore.

“The industrial coil coating caters to B2B segment and decorative paints to B2C segment. Our plan is to double the sales volume of decorative paints in the next two to three years to capture a market share of 5% in south and west,” he said.

“As we started with a small base, our growth is healthy and we are giving competition to well-known firms. And, this calls for expanding our present facility in Vijayanagar and putting up a new unit elsewhere. It entails an investment of up to ₹75 crore for the new unit,” he added.

Currently, JSW Paints are available in the five southern States and Maharashtra. It would cover the entire western region during the current quarter. Next fiscal, the products would be available in the northern and eastern markets and pan-India in three years.

“The demand for colour-coated paints is growing and it would take at least one year for us to double the production capacity. Besides, catering to domestic market, we will also export 20% of our produce to European, west Asia, South East Asia and African markets,” he said.

Mr. Sundaresan said that about 75% of the production is consumed in-house and this would get altered to 60:40 ratio in the coming months as production volume picks up.

Over the next three years, the company hopes that the paint division would fetch a revenue of ₹2,000 crore to ₹2,500 crore, of which decorative paints would account for ₹1,500 crore.

Asked About the network expansion, he said by March the company would have enrolled 1,000 retailers and this would be doubled next year. “‘Our vision is to have 10% market share by 2025-26,” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jzaiap/article30853977.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THBUJSWPAINTS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jsw-paints-sets-sights-on-south-west-india/article30853978.ece

V.L. Dutt, the executive chairman of KCP Group, died at his residence on Tuesday.

He was 82. He is survived by his wife, daughter and a grand daughter.

The KCP Group, which boasts of a turnover of $250 million and has interests in cement, sugar and heavy industrial machinery, scaled new heights under his leadership.

43,2020/02/18,Foodgrain production set to touch a record high,"Abundance of late monsoon rains resulted in larger-than-expected harvests

Total foodgrain production is projected to scale an all-time high of almost 292 million tonnes in 2019-20, propelled by record production of both rice and wheat, according to the Agriculture Ministry’s second advance estimates released on Tuesday.

Production of several crops, including rice and major pulses, was lower than targeted in the kharif or the monsoon season. However, the abundance of late monsoon rains resulted in cumulative rainfall that was 10% higher than the long-period average for the season.

This helped farmers rake in rabi or winter harvests that were larger-than-expected in almost all crops.

Thus, the estimate for total foodgrain output of 291.95 million tonnes is more than six million tonnes higher than the 285.21 million tonnes produced in 2018-19.

Higher rice output

The Agriculture Ministry expects rice production to reach 117.47 million tonnes, slightly higher than the 116.48 million tonnes produced in the previous year. Wheat, which is only grown in the rabi season, will see a major surge in production at 106.2 million tonnes in the current year, from the 103.6 million tonnes in 2018-19.

Despite the government’s drive to encourage millets and nutri-cereals, production failed to match targets this year, with the estimate pegged at 45.24 million tonnes.

Pulses production was also estimated to come in lower-than targeted 23 million tonnes, although it was still higher than the previous year’s harvest. Most pulses are dry land crops, grown on land without irrigation and the delay in monsoons in many areas hit kharif harvests although rabi production improved.

It was a similar story with oil seeds. Production was estimated at almost 342 million tonnes, higher than last year but still lower than the target for this year. Sugarcane is the only major crop where this year’s estimated production of 3,538 million tonnes was significantly lower than last year’s output of 4,054 million tonnes. A glut in sugar production over the last few years had resulted in a crash in prices and an increase in payment arrears from sugar mills to cane farmers.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/e36oe4/article30854355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FOODGRAIN-1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/foodgrain-production-set-to-touch-a-record-high/article30853940.ece
44,2020/02/18,"Oil falls on coronavirus impact, OPEC delay","Asian shares fell and Wall Street was poised to retreat on Tuesday after Apple said it would miss quarterly revenue guidance owing to weakened demand in China.

Oil fell more than 2% on Tuesday, pressured by concerns over the impact on oil demand from the COVID-19 outbreak in China and a lack of further action by OPEC and its allies to support the market.

Forecasters have cut 2020 oil demand estimates because of the virus. Though new cases in mainland China have dipped, experts say it is too early to judge if the outbreak is being contained. Brent crude was down $1.34, or 2.3%, at $56.33 a barrel at about 1830 IST after rallying in the previous five sessions.

“OPEC+ has shown no sign yet of reacting to the virus-related slump in demand by making additional production cuts,” said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.

The virus is having a wider impact on companies and financial markets. Asian shares fell and Wall Street was poised to retreat on Tuesday after Apple said it would miss quarterly revenue guidance owing to weakened demand in China.

“This has spooked market players and triggered a sharp pullback in risk assets,” said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM, referring to Apple's statement.

The IEA last week said that first-quarter oil demand is likely to fall by 435,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the same period last year in the first quarterly decline since the financial crisis in 2009.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia, have been considering further production cuts to tighten supply and support prices.

The group, known as OPEC+, has a pact to cut oil output by 1.7 million bpd until the end of March.

The next OPEC+ meeting next month is set to consider an advisory panel's recommendation to cut supply by a further 600,000 bpd. Talks on holding an earlier meeting in February appear to have made no progress, OPEC sources said.

As well as OPEC+ voluntary curbs, support for prices has come from involuntary losses in Libya, where output has collapsed since Jan.18 because of a blockade of ports and oilfields.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ae0fym/article30853822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-OPEC-oil-Organization-of-the-Petroleum-Exporting-Countries-,https://www.thehindu.com/business/oil-falls-on-coronavirus-impact-opec-delay/article30853816.ece

Amid talks of the government encashing its bank guarantee over default in payment of dues, Vodafone Idea Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla met Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash on Tuesday as he looked for options to keep the company afloat.

After the meeting, Birla said he “cannot say anything at the moment.”

Vodafone Idea on Monday paid ₹2,500 crore to the Department of Telecom (DoT) and promised to pay another ₹1,000 crore before the end of the week.

But the amount paid for now is less than 5% of the dues that the DoT estimates the company owes to the government following a Supreme Court ruling that asked for including non-telecom revenues of telcos in computing statutory payments such as licence fee and spectrum charges.

The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stop DoT from taking any coercive steps for recovery of dues from Vodafone Idea.

In December, Birla had said Vodafone Idea may have to shut if there is no relief on the statutory dues. “If we are not getting anything, then I think it is the end of the story for Vodafone Idea,” he had said. “It does not make sense to put good money after bad...

China’s biannual auto show, one of the industry’s biggest international events, is being postponed in response to the continuing spread of a new virus.

The organizers of Auto China 2020 said in a statement dated Monday that the sprawling event originally scheduled for April 21-30 in Beijing would be moved to an undetermined date. The Auto China show has taken on increasingly heft as global manufacturers seek to grow their sales in China’s massive, but recently slowing, market for cars, trucks, vans and luxury vehicles.

47,2020/02/18,Trump’s visit may seal helicopter deal,"Defence pacts likely during U.S. President’s visit

The deal for 24 MH-60R Multi-Role Helicopters (MRH) for the Navy, which is likely to be announced during the visit of U.S. President Donald Trump, is lined up for the final approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on Wednesday, official sources said.

“The deal is before the CCS for final approval which is meeting on Wednesday. We are hopeful that it will be cleared,” a defence source told The Hindu. All procedural requirements for the deal have been completed, he added. The 24 Lockheed Martin-built helicopters, worth $2.4 billion, are being procured through the Foreign Military Sales route of the U.S. government.

Trade deal unlikely

Mr. Trump will visit India on February 24 and 25. With no headway in the talks for a trade deal, there are expectations that a few big-ticket defence deals will be announced.

There are several big-ticket deals in the pipeline. These include six Boeing P-8I long-range surveillance aircraft and 13 BAE Systems-built 127-mm MK-45 naval gun systems worth around $1 billion for the Navy, six AH-64E Apache attack helicopters for the Army, 30 armed drones for the three services and a tactical air defence system for Delhi. However, these are at various stages of procurement... “Apart from the deal for MH-60R helicopters, an announcement is possible on P-8I and Apache,” a second official source said.

The Navy is facing an acute shortage of MRH, with several warships operating with empty helicopter decks. These helicopters are being procured as replacement for 15 Sea King Anti-Submarine Warfare helicopters de-inducted in 1991 and one Sea King 42B MRH lost in accident. The MRHs in service, Sea King 42Bs, were inducted in the 1980s and are in need of replacement.

Given the urgency, the U.S. is likely to take some MH-60R helicopters from its newest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald Ford, which is undergoing upgrades. “We are hopeful of getting four or five MH-60s from USS Gerald Ford once the deal is signed,” a Navy official said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gdjkoz/article28971123.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-TRUMP-AP-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/trumps-visit-may-seal-helicopter-deal/article30854024.ece
48,2020/02/18,Maharashtra to look into ATS chief’s ‘underworld links’,"Gangster Vijay Palande’s letter to CVC accuses Deven Bharti of running criminal empire

The Maharashtra government is looking into the State Anti Terrorism Squad (ATS) chief Deven Bharti’s alleged links with the underworld based on a two-year-old letter from gangster Vijay Palande to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).

Mr. Palande, an accused in a 2012 double murder case, is lodged in Taloja jail

Last week, on February 12, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh wrote on a file, reviewed by The Hindu, calling for an explanation from Director General (DG) of Police Subodh Kumar Jaiswal, and asked him to hold a meeting to discuss the letter.

The letter, a copy of which is with The Hindu, was written on December 31, 2018 and forwarded to the State Home Department in October 2019 by the CVC and Union Home Ministry. It was then sent to the Home Minister for his views, who wrote, ‘To be discussed’.

“We are calling for a meeting to discuss the issue with the DG and Additional Chief Secretary (Home),” said a Home Department source.

Senior police officials said the letter needs to be taken with a pinch of salt, given that it is the handiwork of a ‘disgruntled accused’. “Much of the content of this letter cannot be verified,” said a senior officer.

Mr. Bharti, too, raised questions about the letter being taken seriously. “A serial killer, gangster, accused in six murder cases and other serious cases is arrested in 2012. He makes a motivated, malicious and wild complaint in 2018 and it is being peddled in 2020,” Mr. Bharti said. There was a need, he added, to look into who was behind “peddling this news and conniving, aiding and abetting a thoroughbred criminal in furthering his nefarious agenda,” he said. “If the media starts playing into the hands of accused criminals, this will set a wrong precedent and encourage accused persons to level unsubstantiated allegations against investigators.”

In the letter, Mr. Palande has alleged Mr. Bharti’s proximity to underworld gangsters Chhota Shakeel, and gang members such as Umar Chikoo, Salim Maharaj and Ahmed Langda. He also alluded to a ₹10,000-crore criminal empire being run by Mr. Bharti, which included a close network with gangster Ejaz Lakdawala.

The letter also said Mr. Bharti took ₹2 crore as bribe from Anuj Tikku, son of Arun Tikku, whose murder Mr. Palande and his associate Simran Sood have been accused of.

“Deven Bharti took ₹2 crore from from Anuj Tikku’s family to exonerate him of his father’s murder. He had given a contract to kill his own father to Dhananjay Shinde, a henchman of Santosh Shetty. Due to Deven Bharti’s blessings, Anuj Tikku was not charged at all,” said the letter.

The letter also accused Mr. Bharti of running a criminal empire along with gangsters, and refers to his proximity to gangster Santosh Shetty, Chhota Shakeel and Chhota Rajan.

Gangster Santosh Shetty, the letter said, continued to work with Mr. Bharti, but soon, Chhota Rajan discovered this and developed an animosity towards him. “Meanwhile, Bharti grabbed all the matka operations in the State.”

The letter also said gangster Sudhakar Shetty became Mr. Bharti’s ‘gang member’. “All illicit money was being parked at Sudhakar’s office on behalf of Mr. Bharti,” the letter said.

Additional Chief Secretary Sanjay Kumar refused to confirm the note or the letter. “I will have to check and get back to you on this,” he told The Hindu.

S.H. Kurlekar, Superintendent of Police, Taloja jail, denied information of the letter even though Mr. Palande has given his postal address as, ‘A 342, Room No. 49, High Security Anda Cell, Taloja Central Prison.’ “I have no information on (my) file of any such letter moving out of my prison,” Mr. Kurlekar said.

50,2020/02/18,Sanjay Kothari tipped to be CVC; Bimal Julka is CIC,"Panel, headed by PM, goes by majority opinion after Opposition leader objects

Sanjay Kothari, Secretary to the President of India, is tipped to be the next Chief Vigilance Commissioner. Former Information and Broadcasting Secretary Bimal Julka will be the Chief Information Commissioner.

Former CMD of Andhra Bank Suresh Patel has been chosen as a Vigilance Commissioner while former member of Punjab Civil Services Commission Amita Pandove will be an Information Commissioner.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the selection committee on Tuesday. The government is yet to make a formal announcement.

The meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was attended by Home Minister Amit Shah, Congress Leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury and Minister of State in the Prime Minister’s Office Jitender Singh. The decision, however, was arrived at by a majority opinion as the Opposition leader objected to the process and pointed to “certain legal infirmities”.

Mr. Chowdhury is reported to have objected to the fact that the government had neither shared the names of the short-listed candidates for the post of CIC before the meeting, as is the norm. The Opposition leader also objected to the fact that for the post of CVC, a member of the search committee was included as a short-listed candidate.

Mr. Modi is learnt to have directed the officials to ensure that norms were followed and the Opposition leader was provided with the short-listed names before such meetings.

‘Deeply flawed’

“It is regrettable that the entire process of appointment to the high offices of the CVC and the CIC was deeply flawed and violative of the constitutional guarantees, and was undertaken in a non-transparent manner,” Mr. Chowdhury said. “These fundamental flaws have vitiated the entire exercise. Sad that the government is using the flawed procedure to appoint persons to these high offices. Such arbitrary decisions will defeat the very objective of holding the government and the Executive accountable to the people of India,” he said.

Referring to reports on a wall being constructed to hide a slum in Ahmedabad ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to the city this month, the Congress said it is not a model that enterprising Gujaratis would be proud of.

“We live in times where: GDP is measured in tons, Citizen rights in volts, Nationalism in decibels, Poverty in the height and length of the wall. This is BJP’s ‘New India’!,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Twitter.

At a party briefing, spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said playing ‘hide and seek’ had become the favourite game of the BJP government.

54,2020/02/18,Cong. leaders speak in different voices on Debbie Abrahams,"While Singhvi backed the British MP’s deportation, Tharoor slammed the govt. for the decision

Congress leaders spoke in different voices over the deportation of British lawmaker Debbie Abrahams, with party MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi on Tuesday backing the government move and describing the British lawmaker as a ‘Pakistan proxy’.

On Monday, Indian authorities denied entry to Ms. Abrahams, a Labour Party MP who heads a British parliamentary group on Kashmir, on her arrival at the Delhi airport. Officials claimed that the British lawmaker was informed in advance about the cancellation of her e-visa.

“The deportation of Debbie Abrahams by India was indeed necessary, as she is not just an MP, but a Pak proxy known for her clasp with Pak government and ISI. Every attempt that tries to attack India’s sovereignty must be thwarted,” Mr. Singhvi tweeted.

His comments stood out in sharp contrast with those made by his party colleagues Shashi Tharoor and Gaurav Gogoi.

“British MP Who Criticised Govt on J&K Stopped At Airport: conduct really unworthy of a democracy &guaranteed to give us a far worse press than if she had been admitted. Govt claims situation is normal in Kashmir. Why is the govt then so scared of critics?” Mr. Tharoor tweeted on Monday.

Pointing out that he found it ironic that some of the people who applauded him for going to Britain as an Indian MP and telling them about their colonial misbehaviour were now attacking him for wanting India to grant a visa to the British MP, Mr. Tharoor wrote, “If we can dish it out, we should be able to take it.”

“I rather have the Government of India take a consistent position instead of selective red carpet treatment. Taking foreign ambassadors on shikhara rides while denying Member of Parliament to travel seems childish. We should have the maturity to welcome support and criticism,” Mr. Gogoi tweeted.

Cautious stand

At the official briefing, Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh, however, took a cautious line and maintained that the government should first officially state the reason why Ms. Abrahams was denied entry before the party commented on the decision.

Mr. Tharoor too downplayed his difference with Mr. Singhvi’s tweet. “My friend @DrAMSinghvi is welcome to disagree with me. Happy to inform @ThePrintIndiathat’s how democracy works: honestly-held views can differ on different issues. Glad @INCIndia is a democratic party,” he tweeted in response to a report in an online portal.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/r9djyh/article30854112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THTHAROOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cong-leaders-speak-in-different-voices-on-debbie-abrahams/article30854113.ece
55,2020/02/18,"Box office receipts in India cross ₹10,000 crore mark for the first time in 2019","The biggest film last year was not an Indian production, but Marvel's 'Avengers: Endgame' that grossed ₹433 crore across the country

Gross box office receipts crossed the ₹10,000 crore mark for the first time in 2019, making it a historic year for cinema in India, according to Mumbai-based media consulting firm Ormax Media’s Indian Box Office Report 2019.

Total gross earnings across all languages rose almost 12% last year to ₹10,948 crore, from ₹9,810 crore in 2018, according to the report. The reduction in GST slabs helped boost net earnings at an even faster pace of 19% to ₹9,490 crore.

Ironically, the biggest gainer was Hollywood, with its productions registering a 31% jump in gross collections (across all languages, in original as well as dubbed versions) to touch an all-time high of ₹1,595 crore. That helped it overtake Tamil and Telugu to the number two spot in terms of earnings after Hindi. Till last year, Hindi led the race followed by Tamil and Telugu, with Hollywood placed fourth.

The biggest film in India last year was not an Indian production but the Marvel superhero movie Avengers: Endgame that grossed ₹433 crore in all the language versions. It was followed by three more films that went beyond the coveted ₹300 crore figure — the Hrithik Roshan-Tiger Shroff bromance War (₹357 cr.), multilingual action thriller Saaho (₹349 cr.) and the controversial Kabir Singh (₹321 cr.).

Data box for box office story

Hollywood also increased its box office share last year. While Hindi led with 44% share of the gross domestic box office, Hollywood (in all language versions) stood second with 15% share, followed by Tamil and Telugu at 13% each.

According to Shailesh Kapoor, CEO and founder of Ormax Media, a big takeaway from the report is the increasing success of multilingual cinema. Besides Avengers: Endgame, The Lion King did well for Hollywood with ₹184 crore gross box office earnings across all language versions. “Saaho got 60% of its earnings from the Hindi than the Telugu or Tamil versions,” said Kapoor.

Telugu film Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy, dubbed and simultaneously released in Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam and Tamil, featured in the top 10 earners, having grossed ₹196 crore. “It shows that the success of Baahubali was not one off,” said Kapoor. “Hindi film industry will continue to get challenged by dubbed versions of the South and Hollywood films,” he added. No wonder all eyes are now trained on the forthcoming S.S. Rajamouli film RRR and Prashanth Neel’s KGF Chapter 2.

Other than Hollywood, the other industries that posted box office growth in 2019 were Kannada (36%), Malayalam (17%), Tamil (14%), Punjabi (13%) and Hindi (10%). On the other hand, both Marathi (minus 45%) and Bengali (minus 33%) cinema suffered sharp contractions in receipts in 2019.

Driving the growth in revenue was an 8.9% increase in total footfalls across languages in 2019. The figure crossed the 100 crore mark last year to reach 103 crore, up from 2018’s 94.5 crore. Footfalls was one metric where Hollywood retained its fourth spot. With 9% contribution to domestic footfalls, it lagged behind Hindi (33%), Tamil (19%) and Telugu (18%).",national,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/q91uz3/article28273015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/endgame,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/box-office-receipts-cross-10000-crore-mark-for-the-first-time-in-2019/article30854086.ece
56,2020/02/18,SC voices concern over the loss of green cover,"The court was hearing a plea challenging cutting of heritage trees for an over-bridge in West Bengal

Deforestation is so rapid that before anyone knows everything will be lost, Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde said on Tuesday, voicing concern over the loss of green cover.

A three-judge Bench, led by the the Chief Justice Bobde, was hearing a petition challenging the cutting of heritage trees in West Bengal to create space for an over-bridge in an accident-prone area of a highway.

Advocate Prashant Bhushan, for the petitioner, agreed that in another 50 years, the effects of climate change might take a turn for the worse.

‘Greed and profit’

Chief Justice Bobde did not hold back while condemning humanity’s tendency to abuse natural resources for greed and profit.

“I understand you don’t have the brains to build new ones [water conservation systems], but you are also destroying what is there,” said Justice Bobde.

The court said the green cover must be preserved.

“People are not willing to explore alternatives. There could be a way to create a path without cutting trees, though it might be a little more expensive,” Chief Justice Bobde said with the reference to the over-bridge project.

A tree’s value

The Bench even considered taking on board economists and environmentalists to estimate the value of a tree, factoring in the value of the quantum of oxygen it emits in its lifetime.

“When you cut a heritage tree, imagine the value of the oxygen the tree produced all these years. Compare it with how much you would have to pay for the equivalent amount of oxygen if you have to buy it from somewhere else,” Chief Justice Bobde had observed at an earlier hearing.

Mr. Bhushan had suggested a change in the alignment of the project or even an underbridge.

Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi, for West Bengal, had said the State had discussed the issue for 18 months before deciding on cutting as few trees as possible.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w2uo0/article30854010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-voices-concern-over-loss-of-green-cover/article30854011.ece
57,2020/02/18,China’s envoy thanks India for support during coronavirus crisis,"China will look after Indian nationals as its own, says envoy

China appreciates the support and solidarity that India has extended in its fight against the novel coronavirus, Beijing’s envoy said on Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference, Sun Weidong said China and India have been in close contact to deal with the threat and assured that Beijing would look after Indian nationals in China as its own.

“Virus is borderless and a common threat to everyone in the world. Facing this common challenge, we need to strengthen cooperation, enhance mutual understanding, show solidarity, and jointly overcome difficulties,” said Ambassador Sun emphasising that the threat from the coronavirus would be defeated by the joint efforts of China and the global community. He said kind gestures from common people in India had left a lasting impression on him.

The press interaction was the first since the outbreak late last year of the novel coronavirus epidemic, which has affected about 70,000 people inside China and posed a significant international health crisis. The diplomat maintained that the novel coronavirus disease was “preventable, controllable and curable” and that China had acted in a decisive manner to deal with the public health crisis.

On February 9, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had written to President Xi Jinping extending India’s assistance to fight the coronavirus outbreak. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar had also spoken to his counterpart Wang Yi and urged an objective evaluation of the crisis. “We appreciate and thank the solidarity and support rendered by India,” said the ambassador.

Elaborating on the multi-layered measures activated by Beijing to deal with the crisis, China’s envoy highlighted the roles played by President Xi and Premier Li Keqiang in setting up emergency measures across all the 31 provinces of China. He acknowledged that the health crisis had made a “certain impact” on the Chinese economy but described the setback as “local, temporary and limited”.

Ambassador Sun maintained that the Chinese government had coordinated with local universities in Hubei province to provide essential materials, and masks to Indian students in the region and helped them deal with the crisis. “We attach great importance to the health and safety of foreign nationals in China, and will take good care of the Indian citizens in China like our own,” he said. “I did learn about the situation of Indian students in Hubei province... they are taken good care of with good health, sufficient daily necessities, accommodation and food. So far there is no report of infection for the Indian citizens in China,” he added.

The envoy said both China and India were facing similar public health challenges and there was “huge potential” for collaboration to counter emerging threats. “We are ready to explore opportunities with India for cooperation in areas of public health and science,” the ambassador added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pax9rh/article30853996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THSUNWEIDONG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chinas-envoy-thanks-india-for-support-during-coronavirus-crisis/article30853997.ece
58,2020/02/18,"J&K delimitation move aimed at deferring polls, implementing RSS agenda: NC, PDP","Jammu and Kashmir’s regional parties, the National Conference (NC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday described the Centre’s move to set up a delimitation commission as “a ploy to defer Assembly elections” and “implementing the long-held RSS agenda here”.

“The freeze on delimitation in J&K till 2026 was pushed by the NC regime after amending J&K’s constitution,” NC leader and Member of Parliament Hasnain Masoodi told The Hindu. “The constitution does not exist after the Centre’s August 5 decision. I fear the hurry to push for delimitation is to delay Assembly polls in J&K. It will be used as an excuse not to hold polls,” Mr. Masoodi added. He said it comes at a time when all political processes has been stopped and the local political parties have been thrown out of the arena. On taking any legal course to stop delimitation, Mr. Masoodi said, “The decision would usually be taken by the Political Affairs Committee of the party. Unfortunately, NC president Dr. Farooq Abdullah, vice president Omar Abdullah and the general secretary are all behind bars,” the MP said.

Iin 2002, the government headed by Farooq Abdullah pushed for a freeze on delimitation tilll 2026 by amending the J&K Representation of the People Act, 1957, and Section 47(3) of the Constitution of J&K.

Even the PDP had, at the time, opposed any early delimitation. Senior PDP leader Firdous Tak said, “The delimitation move is another leaf from the red book of the RSS and the BJP to target and disempower a particular community. It is aimed at hitting at the Muslim character, which remains an eyesore for many. My fear is that constituencies will be carved up on the basis of ideology and religious belief.”

Senior Congress leader Saifuddin Soz said the best course available to the Union Home Ministry was to wait for a democratically elected Legislative Assembly, where the subject would be discussed followed by the decision. “Otherwise, the system can suffer considerable tension,” he warned.

The delimitation exercise has been set in motion as the J&K administration also rolled out the census process, which is likely to take place from June. It remains to be seen whether the 2011 census or the 2021 census report will be the basis of the delimitation, which aims to create seven more constituencies as envisaged by the J&K Reorganisation Act passed on August 5, 2019. The process is likely to take at least two years.

The BJP has been pushing for a delimitation exercise to increase Assembly segments in the Jammu region. At present, the Kashmir region has 42 seats and the Jammu region 37 seats on the basis of population ratio.

“The BJP’s demand is that the area, population and topography be kept in mind while carrying out the exercise,” said BJP State general secretary Ashok Koul.

Panchayat polls’ timing

Meanwhile, representatives of several political parties met J&K’s Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Shailendera Kumar in Jammu and questioned the timing of the polls, while demanding the release of all political detainees.

The meeting was attended by the NC, PDP, Congress, BJP and National Panthers Party (NPP).

Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Monga said, “The polls should either be conducted on non-party basis or the leadership, which is under detention, should be released to ensure the participation of these political parties and mandatory direction.”

He demanded the lifting of curbs in J&K for “any candidate to get peaceful and free atmosphere”.

The meeting was called days after the NC wrote to the Election Commission of India (ECI) and demanded release of political leadership to participate in the polls.

Sources said the CEO had assured the political parties that the issues would be raised “with the higher-ups to address them at the earliest”.

Iltija Javed, the daughter of the former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti, said on Tuesday that the Centre was not able to handle the consequences of the revocation of Article 370, and the erstwhile State was grappling with “an economic, psychological and emotional crisis”.

The Jammu and Kashmir police booked Ms. Mufti, a former ally of the BJP, under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) on February 7 after detaining her for six months in a subsidiary jail.

“This is not the country I grew up in. I am a proud Indian but we are now becoming a Hindu Pakistan. The discourse has fallen so low...I have full respect for the Prime Minister. Either he is being misled or wilfully misleading the country,” Ms. Javed said, addressing journalists at the Indian Women’s Press Corps.

She said she did not have any plan to take the political plunge yet.

“I will not say Kashmiris are not angry with my mother or other political parties, but they are angrier with the government. Today, I will do a salaam to [Union Home Minister] Amit Shah if he goes to Kashmir and roams around freely.

60,2020/02/18,Mediator to talk to Shaheen Bagh protesters and police,"Hegde says he will study SC order, hold consultations and chalk out a plan of action on Shaheen Bagh

Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, the Supreme Court-appointed interlocutor to hold talks with Shaheen Bagh protesters, said on Tuesday that he would study the court’s order and chalk out a course of action in consultation with all stakeholders.

In its order, a Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and K.M. Joseph said, “Mr. Sanjay R. Hegde, learned senior counsel, is present in court, and we would like him to play a constructive role as an interlocutor to make the persons at the site see reason. He, along with Mrs. Sadhana Ramachandran, learned counsel, or any other person of his choice, may do so.”

The order, published on the court’s official website on Tuesday, also recorded advocate Tasneem Ahmadi’s submission that she would endeavour to talk to former bureaucrat and intervener Wajahat Habibullah and even take up with the protesters the court’s apprehensions about a prolonged blockade.

The court on Monday upheld the protesters’ right to dissent on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, but with a rider that they should not hamper public movement. “The law has been enacted by Parliament, and is facing a constitutional challenge before this court, but that by itself will not take away the right to protest of the persons who feel aggrieved by the legislation. However, the question is where and how protest can carry on without public ways being blocked. Our concern is more than this matter alone, as there may be persons of different points of view who may tomorrow seek to emulate this protest. Such a scenario only leads to chaotic situation. This must cease on public ways everywhere,” the court said.

It has scheduled the next hearing for February 24.

61,2020/02/18,Mother’s body awaits cremation as offspring war over property in Berhampur,"Police, local authorities intervened for funeral rites to take place after five hours

The body of Suryamani Sahu (82) could be taken for cremation only after the intervention of police and administrative officials as her four daughters were warring over her property.

The oldest of four daughters, Mina Kumari Sahu, locked up her mother’s house, which delayed the funeral. She was being opposed by her three sisters, Sanjukta Kumari Sahu, Sandhya Kumari Sahu and Arunarani Sahu. The incident took place in the Sri Ram Nagar area under the Badabazaar Police Station limits of the city.

The deceased woman’s late husband Tara Charan Sahu, a former defence personnel who later served Odisha Police as a Sub-Inspector, died in 2008. Their only son had also passed away in 2001. The couple are survived by their four married daughters.

Property dispute

The deceased woman owned two buildings, five acres of land, and some money in a bank. Pramodini Sahu, sister of the deceased, alleged that Ms. Mina Kumari was living in one of the houses owned by Suryamani, taking her pension, and also trying to take control of her other properties.

Ms. Mina Kumari’s siblings allege that she had not spent anything on their late mother’s care or hospitalisation. Suryamani died at the MKCG Medical College Hospital on Monday afternoon.

When Suryamani’s body was brought back to her house for funeral rituals, Ms. Mina Kumari allegedly locked it up and did not let anyone inside for fear that her sisters would try to take over the property. Suryamani’s body had to be kept outside her second house for five hours, from 4 p.m.-9 p.m. A crowd gathered at the spot.

Impasse ends

Police officials, along with Berhampur tehsildar Sipak Kumar Patro, arrived at the place to counsel an end to the impasse. The sisters agreed to settle their dispute after their mother’s funeral rites were completed, following which the body was taken for cremation.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mothers-body-awaits-cremation-as-offspring-war-over-property-in-berhampur/article30853096.ece
62,2020/02/18,More Tatkal tickets for passengers now as railways roots out illegal softwares,"The booking process for a general user usually takes around 2.55 minutes, but those using illegal softwares could do it in just around 1.48 minutes, railway officials said

More Tatkal tickets will be available for passengers now as the railways has weeded out several illegal softwares and arrested 60 agents who would use them to block such tickets, a top official said on February 18.

Railway Protection Force (RPF) Director General Arun Kumar said the software cleansing exercise means Tatkal tickets, which would earlier vanish within minutes of opening of the booking, will now be available for passengers for hours.

Those arrested include a Kolkata-based person with suspected links to Bangladesh-based terror outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JUMB). In January, the RPF DG had said an e-ticketing racket with suspected links to terror-funding and money laundering was busted.

Officials explained on February 18 that illegal softwares such as ‘ANMS’, ‘MAC’ and ‘Jaguar’ would bypass the IRCTC’s login captcha, booking captcha and bank OTP to generate tickets, while a genuine user has to go through all these processes.

Illegally booked in 1.48 minutes

The booking process for a general user usually takes around 2.55 minutes, but those using these softwares could do it in just around 1.48 minutes, they said.

The railways does not allow agents to book Tatkal tickets and over the past two months, the RPF has nabbed around 60 illegal agents who were booking tickets through these softwares, making it virtually impossible for others to get Tatkal bookings.

“As of today, I can say that not one ticket is being booked through illegal softwares. We have plugged all the issues that we had with the IRCTC website and also nabbed most of those who were top operators of the softwares,” the RPF DG said at a press briefing.

With the arrests, Mr. Kumar said most of these illegal softwares, which used to generate business of ₹50 crore-100 crore annually, have been blocked.

Jump in availability

Booking for Tatkal tickets opens 24 hours before the day of travel.

The IRCTC’s ticket booking section reflects the impact of the railways action as it shows a jump in the availability of Tatkal tickets across the board.

For example, on October 26, 2019, Tatkal tickets were available for two minutes for the Magadh Express, while for February 10, they were available for over 10 hours after the bookings opened on February 9, 2020.

Similarly, on the Sampoorna Kranti Express, Tatkal tickets were available for a little over four minutes on November 16, 2019, while on February 8, 2020, they were available for 18 minutes.

On the Swatantrata Senani Express, on November 16, 2019, the Tatkal bookings lasted for just a little over two minutes, while on February 8, it lasted for more than an hour.

“This position has been taken from different zones and we have seen that the Tatkal tickets are available for longer. We are still monitoring other softwares which can be used to book tickets and will move on them as and when they try to book tickets illegally,” said Mr. Kumar.

Several arrested

The RPF DG said that seven people, including a Kolkata-based person who was in touch with Bangladesh-based terror outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, (JUMB) have been arrested in the latest crackdown, on February 8.

“Recently, we arrested seven people including Kolkata-based Jayanta Poddar who was in touch with JUMB operatives,” he said.

Among those arrested is one Rajesh Yadav, believed to be the fund manager for the illegal e-ticketing racket who was picked from Mumbai. Another person, Shamsher, who worked for Hamid Ashraf, a Dubai-based man suspected to be one of the masterminds of the racket, was arrested from Lucknow.

Mr. Ashraf, however, is still at large.

The DG also said that the RPF has arrested Satyawan Upadhyay, a developer by profession, who built the illegal ‘MAC’ software for ticket touts.

He further said that the RPF ran a drive against authorised IRCTC agents also on February 11 and 12, and 319 of them were arrested for dubious bookings.

As many as 317 user IDs were identified for blacklisting, he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/1mwq41/article30852768.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TATKALCOUNTER1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/railways-roots-out-illegal-softwares-more-tatkal-tickets-for-passengers-now/article30852760.ece
63,2020/02/18,"Menstruating women cooking food for husbands will be reborn as dogs, says godman","Swami Krushnaswarup Dasji is associated with the Swaminarayan Temple which runs a college whose staff had allegedly forced more than 60 girls to remove their undergarments to check if they were menstruating

A religious leader from Gujarat has said that menstruating women who cook food for their husbands will be reborn as dogs in their next life, while men consuming food prepared by women having their periods will be reborn as bullocks.

Swami Krushnaswarup Dasji, who made these remarks, is associated with the Swaminarayan Temple which runs a college in Bhuj whose principal and female staff had allegedly forced more than 60 girls to remove their undergarments to check if they were menstruating.

The principal, the hostel rector and the peon of Shree Sahajanand Girls Institute (SSGI) were arrested on Monday for the alleged incident which occurred on February 11.

“It is certain that men will be born as bullocks in their next life if they consume food cooked by menstruating women. I don’t care if you do not like my views, but this is written in our shastras [scriptures]. If a menstruating woman cooks food for her husband, she will definitely be born as a female dog in her next life,” the religious leader said while delivering a sermon in Gujarati, the video of which has gone viral.

Krushnaswarup Dasji belongs to the Nar-Narayan Devgadi of the Swami Narayan sect.

In the video, he can be heard warning men against consuming food prepared by menstruating women. He can also be heard admonishing women for being “careless” about their menstruation period, which he likened with “penance”. He is also heard asking men to learn how to cook.

“Women do not realise that the period of menstruation is like doing tapasya [penance]. This is written in our shastras. Even I do not like to tell you all these things, but I have to warn you. Men should learn cooking...It will help you,” he said.

The time and place of the video clip could not be ascertained. The videos of the sermons are available on a YouTube channel run by the temple.

As per the website of the Swaminarayan Temple, Krushnaswarup Dasji was initiated in the order in the year 1995. SSGI, a self-financed college having its own hostel for girls, is also run by a trust of the Swaminarayan Temple, Bhuj.

February 11 incident

According to girl students, the incident took place on February 11 when more than 60 students were taken to the washroom by a woman staffer and made to remove their undergarments to check if they were menstruating.

A probe by the Krantiguru Shyamji Krishna Verma Kutch University had earlier revealed that the girls were checked because the hostel had a rule that did not allow girls having their periods to eat their meals with other inmates.

Hostel authorities had decided to check the girls after they came to know that certain students had broken this rule.

Principal Rita Raninga, hostel rector Ramilaben Hirani, college peon Naina Gorasiya and Anita Chauhan were arrested by the police under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).",national,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/sm6w76/article30852590.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Untitledpng,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/menstruating-women-cooking-food-for-husbands-will-be-reborn-as-dogs-says/article30852624.ece

An exhibition on Harappan kitchens and the food cooked in them, complete with a tasting menu and dinner to give visitors a taste of the Indus Valley Civilisation, is set to start at the National Museum here on Wednesday.

The week-long exhibition, titled ‘Historical Gastronomica: the Harappan Dining Experience’, will showcase panels on the kitchens, cookware and food prevalent in the Indus Valley Civilisation, which dates back to over 5,000 years, and include a “food walk” within the premises of the museum, a National Museum official said on Tuesday.

Apart from that, tasting menus throughout the day, and dinner, which has to be pre-booked, will be organised, the official said. The event is being organised by a “Delhi-based group One Station Million Stories and the National Museum is hosting it”, the official said, adding that the food would be prepared by Delhi-based Sabyasachi Gorai, known as Chef Saby.

Daily variety

On the tasting menu will be one vegetarian and non-vegetarian dish each, a beverage, pickles and breads made from ingredients that have been found by archaeologists at the Indus Valley sites. This menu would change every day, but some of the dishes likely to be served are barley bread; fermented vine or spinach leaves stuffed with millets; chickpeas, moong (green gram), brown sesame seed and jaggery laddoos, according to an indicative menu drawn up by the organisers.

65,2020/02/18,‘Intercourse on even dates begets male child’ remark: Bhumata Brigade leader Trupti Desai demands police case against Marathi preacher,"Nivrutti Maharaj Indurikar drew the ire of rationalists and other activists when he allegedly remarked that intercourse by a couple on an even date would beget a male child, while on an odd date would result in the birth of a girl.

Gender rights activist and Bhumata Brigade leader Trupti Desai has demanded a police case be lodged against Marathi kirtankar (preacher) Nivrutti Maharaj Indurikar. He drew the ire of rationalists and other activists when he allegedly remarked that intercourse by a couple on an even date would beget a male child, while on an odd date would result in the birth of a girl during a sermon in Ahmednagar district.

Ms. Desai, who submitted a proposal to the Ahmednagar District Police authorities, urged that a case be lodged against him within four days.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Mr. Indurikar apologised for his remarks. “I regret if my remarks have hurt anyone’s feelings. That was never my intention. Through my sermons for the past 26 years, I have always laid great stress on rooting out blind faith and working towards social enlightenment,” he said in a hand-written note on his own letterhead. He further claimed that his remarks had been taken out of context.

Large following

Known for addressing social issues through his sermons by deploying witty though hard-edged satire, the preacher has a large following in the State among both men and women. A follower of the kirtankar from Ahmednagar, Smita Ashtekar, allegedly threatened Ms. Desai on social media if the latter dared to enter the district, while other supporters of Mr. Indurikar protested Ms. Desai’s entry into the district by waving black flags at her.

Also Read People unhappy with my work troubling me, says Nivrutti Maharaj

However, Ms. Desai remained unperturbed at these demonstrations, vowing not to rest until a police case was lodged against the preacher.

“He [Indurikar] has been known to make derogatory remarks against women in his sermons. I have already spoken regarding this with Home Minister Anil Deshmukh who has assured me that an inquiry would be conducted in this case… People should know that the Home Ministry is on the side of the women of this State and not on that of some preacher who makes offensive remarks against them,” said Ms. Desai, who submitted a proposal to Ahmednagar District Superintendent of Police Sagar Patil, urging that a First Information Report (FIR) be lodged against Mr. Indurikar.

Action demanded

Earlier, the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS), too, had demanded a police case against the preacher on grounds that his comments violated provisions of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act.

Ms. Desai made news with her highly publicised temple-entry “crusades” over the past few years to demolish gender barriers at shrines across Maharashtra, which finally led to temple trustees opening the inner sanctum of the historic Shani Shingnapur Temple in Ahmednagar district to women in April 2016.

She had also mounted a combative campaign to seek entry for women to the core area of the Haji Ali Dargah, and has written more than once to the trustees of the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala, demanding entry to women of all ages into the famous hill shrine.

‘No case’

Earlier, Minister of State for Women and Child Welfare Bacchu Kadu had said that the State government would not be filing a case against Mr. Indurikar as the latter was working towards enlightening people.

The preacher received support from Bharatiya Janata Party State president Chandrakant Patil, who, though stating that Mr. Indurikar should not have made such controversial comments, nevertheless remarked that the party backed him.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qj1ht2/article30852458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-NIVRUTTIMAHARAJINDURIKAR-SA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/intercourse-on-even-dates-begets-male-child-remark-bhumata-brigade-leader-trupti-desai-demands-police-case-against-marathi-preacher/article30852459.ece

Government or private universities will no longer be able to offer both PGDM and MBA courses simultaneously and will have to chose either of the two, the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) has said.

The technical and management education regulator of the Union Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry has said Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) courses can be run by standalone institutions, which are neither universities nor affiliated to any university, similar to the prestigious Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs).

“Over a period of time, deemed to be universities have added PGDM course under the banner of ‘Management Programme’ in contravention of norms. According to the AICTE Regulations, 2020, conducting PGDM and MBA courses in the same institution is not permissible,” a senior AICTE official said.

“Central, state and private universities and institutions deemed to be universities, which are running PGDM and MBA courses under the banner of management programme, are requested to convert all courses into MBA completely and comply with the AICTE norms,” he added.

The court was also hearing the money laundering case lodged by the Enforcement Directorate.

The Chidambarams were present in the court.

68,2020/02/18,Govt. trying to hide poverty behind wall after concealing data on economy: Congress,"The party took a jibe at the “Gujarat model” of development, accusing the BJP of trying to “hide poverty” by constructing a wall in Ahmedabad ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit

The Congress on Tuesday accused the government of hiding data, including that of the “lowest” consumption levels in 40 years, and asked it to make it public in order to find solutions to problems plaguing the economy.

The Opposition party took a jibe at the “Gujarat model” of development, accusing the BJP government in the State of trying to “hide poverty” by constructing a wall in Ahmedabad ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit there later this month.

“We live in times where: GDP is measured in tons, Citizen rights in volts, Nationalism in decibels, Poverty in height and length of the wall. This is BJP’s ‘New India’!” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala wrote on Twitter.

Congress spokesperson Gourav Vallabh said the BJP government’s favourite game has become playing “hide-and-seek” as it is concealing data pertaining to GDP numbers, inflation, unemployment and “now lowest ever consumption”.

“The BJP government’s favourite game is hide and seek. Hide farmer suicide statistics. Hide unemployment figures. Hide the truth of demonetisation. Hide real GDP figures. Hide poverty behind the wall. And now, hide the lowest consumption in 40 years,” he said, adding that the government has “launched a war” against all sections of society including women, students and farmers.

Mr. Vallabh said that 16 out of the 23 sectors in manufacturing are in dire straits, but the government continues to be in denial.

“We ask the government to not hide the data and that it should be made public so that it can be discussed as India is capable of battling all odds,” he said.

“Those talking about the Gujarat model are now building walls to hide the poverty there. If a disease is to be treated, you have to accept that it is there in the first place. But, the BJP does not accept its failures,” he said while taking a dig at the BJP government over reports of the construction of a wall in Ahmedabad to allegedly hide a slum in the city.

The Congress leader said the country has had the lowest growth in the last nine years and this will reduce savings as well, because inflation is 7.95%.

“The BJP’s favourite rating agency, Moody’s, has also projected India’s growth estimate for 2020 to be at 5.4%, against the government’s claim of showing 6 to 6.5% growth in the year,” he said.

Mr. Vallabh said poverty increases when consumption is low and claimed that the United Nations Development Programme data for 2005-2015 shows that during this period, the highest eradication of poverty (271 million people) has taken place in the country and the credit for this goes to the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cfg5oj/article30830763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SURJEWALA-NKV-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-trying-to-hide-poverty-behind-wall-after-concealing-data-on-economy-congress/article30852243.ece

The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) informed the National Green Tribunal on Tuesday that setting up of Water Front Management Authority, for cleaning of river Yamuna, is not possible as it requires legislative provision.

It told a bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel that the Monitoring Committee has rightly pointed that INTACH and DDA are not equipped to do enforcement work and they have no regulatory authority and therefore help from municipal corporations and the police is very essential.

“The suggestion of Yamuna Monitoring Committee (YMC) is for setting up of Water Front Management Authority under the aegis of DDA. It is submitted that DDA already is an Authority constituted through a separate Act. Therefore, constituting another Authority under the aegis of DDA may not be possible legally as the constitution of the Authority may again require legislative provision,” the DDA said in its report, filed through advocate Kush Sharma.

It said there are several stakeholders involved in management of river front namely Delhi Jal Board, municipal corporations, police and Irrigation and Flood Control Department, besides the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).

“Several experts are also involved from time to time like INTACH. These organisations have defined powers under various Acts and have their defined Rules. These organisations can access funds from their own budgets. While coordination between all these agencies is of utmost important, but any Society or other body may not be able to exercise the powers of these organisations nor may be able to access funds from the available budgets or these organisations/departments,” it said.

DDA further said that the function of police is effective control on encroachment and unauthorised construction in the area.

“Land in Delhi is with government of India and DDA is the agency authorised to manage land parcels in Delhi. Therefore, the land owned by DDA along the river front cannot be transferred to any other agency,” DDA said.

The NGT reserved its order on the issue after going through the report.

The tribunal had earlier sought response from the DDA on whether to set up a Work Front Management Authority on the cleaning of the Yamuna river after Yamuna Monitoring Committee’s (YMC) suggesed on setting up of the Work Front Management Authority under the authority.

In its report, the YMC suggested that in view of lapse of time and new challenges, a new mechanism may need to be developed under the aegis of DDA to be assisted in appropriate manner to deal with all the relevant issues relating to the river front.

The bench had appointed retired expert member B.S. Sajwan and former Delhi chief secretary Shailaja Chandra as members of the committee.

The NGT had earlier rapped the Delhi Jal Board over cleaning of the Yamuna and had said there has been no “meaningful progress” on the ground in the last three years.

70,2020/02/18,"Terror launch pads in PoK ‘full’, but our response hard and punishing: Lt. Gen. Dhillon","Lt. Gen. Kanwal Jeet Singh Dhillon said peace in the Kashmir Valley has been “cemented by security forces in coordination with various stakeholders including opinion-makers and mentors of the civil society”.

Terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir (PoK) “are full”, but the Pakistan Army’s attempts to infiltrate terrorists under the cover of ceasefire violations are being responded to in a “hard and punishing” manner, a senior Army commander said in Srinagar.

Lieutenant General Kanwal Jeet Singh Dhillon, who has been heading the strategic command of the Kashmir-based XV corps, is confident that Pakistan would not succeed in its attempts to push terrorists in the Valley and disturb the prevailing peace.

He said peace in the Kashmir Valley has been “cemented by security forces in coordination with various stakeholders including opinion-makers and mentors of the civil society”.

Lt. Gen. Dhillon, who will soon leave for a posting in the Army headquarters in Delhi, joined the strategic command in February last year.

His tenure began on a challenging note as within a week of him taking over, the nation witnessed a gruesome terror attack on its security forces in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed when a suicide bomber targeted their convoy in Pulwama on February 14.

Not yet settled properly in his new role, Lt. Gen. Dhillon of the Rajputana Rifles, began coordinating operations against the perpetrators of the ghastly attack as also monitoring developments along the Line of Control (LoC) where situation was getting tense by the day.

In a written reply to a question by PTI, Lt. Gen. Dhillon talked about the history of Pakistan’s proxy war and said the neighbouring country has been consistently aiding and abetting infiltration in India for more than 30 years now.

“All the terrorist camps and launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir are full. These terrorist cadres are desperate to infiltrate with the help of Pakistan Army, who indulge in firing at our posts.

“Our befitting response to ceasefire violations has been swift, hard and punishing,” Lt. Gen. Dhillon told PTI.

He said the Army’s main task is to keep terrorism at bay, both at the LoC and in the hinterland in “conjunction with Jammu and Kashmir police, paramilitary forces and intelligence agencies”.

The six Indians infected with SARS-CoV-2 on board the quarantined cruise ship off the Japanese coast were responding well to the treatment, the Indian embassy said on Tuesday, as 88 new cases of COVID-19 were reported on the vessel, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 542.

A total of 138 Indians, including 132 crew and 6 passengers, were among the 3,711 people on board the ship that arrived at the Japanese coast earlier this month.

The Japanese government on Tuesday said that final testing to detect positive cases of the COVID-19 is complete.

Eighty eight more people tested positive for the disease, taking the number of those infected on the ship to 542.

The ship was quarantined after a passenger who de-boarded last month in Hong Kong was found to be the carrier of the COVID-19 on the ship.

“Till 1800 (Japan Standard Time) today, no new #COVID-19 positive cases confirmed on #DiamondPrincess since yesterday,” the Indian embassy tweeted.

“All six Indian crew members already receiving treatment for COVID-19 are responding well to the treatment and their conditions are improving,” it said.

The embassy said it is coordinating with the Japanese government and ship management company for health and welfare of all Indian nationals on board.

“The embassy is in constant touch with on board Indian nationals who are successfully braving out the situation and understand public health safety in such situations,” it said.

The Embassy said it was making efforts for early de-boarding of all the Indians from the ship after the end of the quarantine period and was in discussions with the Japanese government and the ship management company for the disembarkation modalities.

The U.S. on Monday evacuated its 340 nationals from the ship, of which 14 had the virus.

According to a report, the U.K. government said it will evacuate its citizens on the ship.

72,2020/02/18,Analysis: What next for Arvind Kejriwal and AAP?,"The real challenge for AAP and its chief will come in other States as and when they decide to take the plunge.

As Arvind Kejriwal took oath as Delhi’s Chief Minister for the third time on Sunday, one question that lingered repeatedly was: what next for him?

Will he expand his politics beyond Delhi? Will the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) once again look at Punjab where it had once flourished but now seems to have disintegrated? Will he foray into other States to acquire the political heft that he needs to project himself as a ‘national leader’?

Such questions are asked whenever a political leader achieves a certain amount of success in his/her home turf. For example, when Narendra Modi won Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections for a fourth term in 2012, questions were asked if his next goal would be to lead the nation — which he eventually did.

Political observers had noted how Mr. Modi had spoken to his fellow Gujarati voters in Hindi, while expressing his gratitude for the love they showered on him and his desire now to contribute towards the nation’s growth.

So, has Mr. Kejriwal given any such hints in his speech after taking oath? Apart from expressing his love for Delhiites and his desire to work with Mr. Modi for a better Delhi, there were no overt suggestions.

But the clues lie elsewhere — in the radio messages, delivered in Mr Kejriwal’s own voice, where the AAP chief spoke of Bharat Mata’s every child getting employed, the sweat and toil of every farmer reaping profits, women feeling secure and so on. In the posters outside AAP headquarters, where it gave out a missed call number to get associated with ‘Rashtra Nirman’ (Nation Building), a word over which the BJP has almost claimed political patent.

If Lord Ram was an inseparable part of Bharatiya Janata Party’s politics, Lord Hanuman is now AAP’s mascot. From Mr. Kejriwal reciting Hanuman chalisa to the party distributing calendars with Lord Hanuman’s photo at the oath taking ceremony, AAP has developed its cultural symbols to go with its politics.

Analysts have termed this as being a more inclusive ‘cultural Hindu’ as opposed to hardline Hindutva politics of his rivals.

But this evolution of being a ‘cultural Hindu’ ensures that Mr. Kejriwal studiously kept out of university campuses — Jamia Milia Islamia (JMI) and the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) — that had seen protests and violence over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and fee hikes. He also stayed away from Shaheen Bagh protestors.

Mr. Kejriwal’s opposition to the CAA or support to the JNU came in the form of tweets. As he went about seeking votes on the basis of his government’s work in the area of education, public health or public transport, many commentators believed that the AAP chief wanted to avoid ‘getting caught’ in a polarising narrative or being labelled as part of the ‘tukde tukde gang’.

But the strategy seems well beyond the Delhi elections. The AAP chief is laying claim to, if not reclaim, the cultural and religious symbols that endeared his rivals to the majority Hindu community, a tactic that the Congress too adopted in State-specific elections such as Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.

It is in this backdrop that the BJP’s attempt to call him a terrorist didn’t succeed in Delhi and may not do so nationally.

The real challenge for AAP and its chief will come in other States as and when they decide to take the plunge. Delhi minister Gopal Rai indicated nation-wide recruitment for AAP that neither has a robust organisation nor identifiable leadership outside Delhi.

It’s influence in Punjab, the only State outside Delhi where it posed a challenge, too has been in the wane. Though there are rumours that though a sulking Navjot Singh Sidhu, who resigned as minister from Amarinder Singh government, could be roped in to revive the party in the State.

With the Congress party in a State of disarray, a few young leaders may see a future for themselves in AAP as an alternative platform.

So, the formidable challenge of building a robust pan-India organization will certainly weigh on Mr. Kejriwal’s mind while answering what next for him and his party.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/c9wls2/article30837975.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL17-KEJRIWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/analysis-what-next-for-arvind-kejriwal-and-aap/article30850828.ece

A senior Supreme Court lawyer has written to the Ram temple trust on behalf of a group of Muslims in Ayodhya, asking that five acres of land around the demolished Babri Masjid where a graveyard is situated be spared for the sake of ‘sanatan dharma’.

The letter, written by advocate M.R. Shamshad, is addressed to all 10 trustees of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra.

Mr. Shamshad said according to Muslims, there is a graveyard known as ‘Ganj Shahidan’ around the demolished Babri Masjid where 75 Muslims who lost their lives in the 1885 riots in Ayodhya were buried.

“There is a mention of this in Faizabad Gazetteer also,” he said. “The central government has not considered the issue not using the grave-yard of Muslims for constructing the grand temple of Lord Ram. It has violated ‘dharma’,” the letter stated.

“In view of religious scriptures of ‘sanatan dharma’, you need to consider whether the temple of Lord Ram can have foundation on the graves of Muslims? This is a decision that the management of the trust has to take,” it said.

“With all humility and respect to Lord Ram, I request you, not to use the land of about four to five acres in which the graves of Muslims are there around the demolished mosque,” the letter added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/spare-graveyard-land-around-babri-masjid-lawyer-to-ram-temple-trust/article30850820.ece

The visa of United Kingdom parliamentarian Debbie Abrahams was revoked as she was “indulging in activities that went against India’s national interest”, a government official said on Tuesday.

The Labour MP and leader of the U.K. Parliament’s All Party Parliamentary Group for Kashmir was deported to Dubai on Monday as she was found to not be in possession of a valid visa at the time of her travel to India and she was accordingly requested to return, the official said.

Ms. Abrahams has claimed she was “treated like a criminal” at the New Delhi airport before being sent back.

The revocation comes in wake of the MP attending the “Kashmir Solidarity Day” function organised by the Pakistan High Commission in London on February 5.

On Tuesday, she shared a copy of her e-business visa on Twitter. The visa, granted on October 7, 2019, was valid for a year to attend “business meetings”.

Revoked, intimated

However, the government official told The Hindu that Ms. Abrahams’ e-Business Visa was revoked on February 14, 2020, on account of her indulging in activities that went against India’s national interest, and this was intimated to her on the same day.

The official added that there is no provision of “visa on arrival” for U.K. nationals at the airport, dismissing Ms. Abrahams’ contention she should have been granted a “visa on arrival”.

The official said that, as per the rules, a previously issued e-Business visa meant for business meetings cannot be used for visiting “family and friends”, as stated by the British MP.

The Indian High Commission in London confirmed that Ms. Abrahams did not hold a valid visa.

“Mission has confirmed from the Indian immigration authorities that Ms. Debbie Abrahams did not hold a valid visa. Further, there is no provision for visa on arrival for UK nationals. She was accordingly requested to return,” the Indian High Commission said in a statement on Twitter.

A GoAir flight to Bengaluru had to abort take-off following a bird hit which caused a minor fire and damaged a fan blade, at the Sardar Vallabhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. The passengers and the crew were deplaned safely.

The bird, which was ingested by the right engine, caused a minor fire besides damaging a fan blade. The fire was immediately doused by the airport unit. The aircraft was later inspected by a GoAir engineering team. All the passengers were safe and no evacuation was necessitated, said a GoAir spokesperson.

78,2020/02/18,"Tapas Paul, Bengali actor and former Trinamool MP, passes away","Tapas Paul had been suffering from heart ailments for the past few years; his characters went well with Left’s narrative of nurturing the countryside

Tapas Paul, once a major star of the Bengali cinema, twice MP and MLA, passed away in Mumbai on Tuesday. He was 61.

Mr. Paul’s life was nearly as dramatic as some of the characters he played. A boy from middle class suburban Bengal became an overnight screen sensation for his role of a village simpleton ‘Kedar’ in the film ‘Dadar Kirti.’ (Elder brother’s actions).

In film after film, he played the same character, a typical suburban or village good man, finally defeating the urban bad man at a time when the CPI(M) was nurturing the countryside. Many film makers and actors of the 1980s rode the political wave making films on emergent rural Bengal. Mr. Paul was perhaps the most successful of the lot whose victory in films symbolised the victory of the village over the city, fitting the Left’s narrative.

By the time his career dipped, he associated himself with the rising star, albeit in politics, of Bengal Mamata Banerjee. Ms. Banerjee nominated him in a south Kolkata seat in the 2001 Assembly election and he won it, indicating that his simpleton image on screen can equally charm the voters in the elite south Kolkata constituency. He told this correspondent in 2001, in an interview, that he realised “Mamata Banerjee is the future of West Bengal”, perhaps much before the rest of Bengal.

Ms. Banerjee never disappointed Mr. Paul, who was not a particularly bright politician, and gave him the Lok Sabha ticket in 2009 and 2014. He won on both the occasions but made a mistake which triggered his end. He commented during his 2014 poll campaign in his constituency in Krishnanagar that he would make his “boys enter the houses” of the Opposition “to rape”. The video clip went viral and he was publicly admonished by all.

Soon after, his name featured in the multi-crore Rose Valley financial scheme scam and he was arrested by the CBI in the winter of 2016. For nearly one and half years he was in jail. Mr. Paul, who loved playing the good cop in films, was shattered emotionally and physically in the company of convicts. However, on Tuesday his friends and rivals unanimously said “he was a good man at heart”.

79,2020/02/18,"We will oppose SC verdict on reservations in public posts, says Congress","BJP-led Uttarakhand govt’s submissions betrayed its anti-Scheduled Caste and Tribe attitude, it says

Congress general secretary Mukul Wasnik on Monday said the party would stridently oppose within the ambit of the Constitution the recent Supreme Court judgment denying reservations in public posts was a fundamental right

Terming the judgment ‘unfortunate’, Mr. Wasnik said submissions made by the BJP-led Uttarakhand government betrayed its anti-Scheduled Caste and Tribe attitude.

“They claimed reservations for the communities was not a fundamental right. The BJP and the RSS are taking decisions against the Constitution. We will fight every kind of battle to oppose it within Parliament and outside it, which will be a long haul, so that benefits accrued to the communities since Independence are accorded in the future too,” he told reporters here.

Saying RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had repeatedly stated reservations in jobs and promotions needed a rethink, he said, “It’s unclear what new form they want to bring about. But their sinister intention is clear.”

He said Manmohan Vaidya, prachar pramukh of the RSS, had claimed that in the name of reservations, people had been kept divided. “He says ‘It is our responsibility to end the system’. Ours, meaning the RSS,” said Mr. Wasnik.

Furthermore, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a book had justified carrying human waste on heads by those belonging to the Valmiki community claiming they practised it willingly, he said. “As if they take pleasure in it. It’s unfortunate such a person holds the highest position.”

Mr. Wasnik said the BJP had even sabotaged the sub plans for the Scheduled Castes and the Tribes, introduced by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, which mandated a 15% and a 7.5% share of the Budget for them, based on their population. “The BJP’s economic policies have rendered many, including those from the communities, jobless.”

As regards the RSS’s purported plan to coerce tribals into declaring themselves Hindus in Madhya Pradesh during the forthcoming census, he said, “Nobody has given the right to anyone to appropriate such power in themselves to decide which community belongs to which religion. It is ultimately for the individual to decide what faith one has to follow.”

He said the BJP, considered tribals ‘vanvasis’ (forest dwellers) and not ‘adivasis’. “Adivasis are those who’ve lived at a place since time immemorial. But those who believe in Manuvad, will naturally think this way,” he said.

Asserting that the Congress was committed to tribals and Dalits getting equal opportunities in society, he said, “For centuries they have been victimised. They are not votebanks for the party.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/we-will-oppose-sc-verdict-on-reservations-in-public-posts-says-congress/article30845558.ece

81,2020/02/18,No headway in India-U.S. trade talks,"However, officials have confirmed that there has been a narrowing of differences on 25 of about 30 issues

With no significant movement on the India-U.S. trade negotiations yet, officials are considering taking even a modest trade deal off the table when U.S. President Donald Trump visits India on February 24-25, sources privy to the talks said. As The Hindu had reported on Friday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lightizer was due to visit New Delhi last week, but put off the visit when it appeared there was not enough progress in the talks, that appear to have run into trouble over market access for agricultural products including dairy, liberalising e-commerce, and investment norms for retail, as well as India’s push for a full reinstatement of its GSP (Generalised System of Preferences) status that the U.S. revoked last June.

Mr. Lightizer and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal have not spoken since last Thursday, it is learnt, and after another unsuccessful attempt to reschedule Mr. Lightizer’s visit over the weekend, officials are beginning to feel that time may be running out to wrap up negotiations in time for the presidential visit.

Met three times

However, officials on both sides have confirmed that there has been a narrowing of differences on as many as 25 of about 30 issues, as USTR officials have met with Commerce Ministry negotiators three times in the past month, and their talks could be picked up after the President’s visit. In addition, said the sources, if there is enough political backing for a trade deal of some sort, Mr. Trump, who said last week that he was keen on signing the “right deal” with India, could include Mr. Lightizer as a part of his delegation to try and make a broad announcement.

‘Lincoln House’ sale

Another issue that has eluded resolution despite talks for more than two years concerns the U.S. embassy’s sale of “Lincoln House”, its previous Consulate Building in Mumbai, that was sold for a record bid of ₹750 crore to a businessman in 2015. However, the property is on a long term lease from the Ministry of Defence, which has yet to clear the transfer of the property, thus holding up the payment for the Embassy. Officials had hoped to have this issue, which incurs U.S. Congressional oversight, cleared before Mr. Trump’s visit as well, but have made no headway yet.

Over nearly two years of trade negotiations, that began after the U.S. first announced it would review India’s GSP status, officials on both sides concede that all the issues have been discussed “threadbare.” Despite a similar push for a “mini-trade deal” to be announced when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the U.S. in September last year, they have been unable to cross the final hurdles for even a modest announcement thus far. Both India and the U.S. have accused the other of “changing goalposts” during the negotiation, as India has regarded U.S. tariffs on Steel and aluminium and the GSP decision as an act of bad faith while negotiations were ongoing. The U.S. has been similarly upset over new tariffs announced by India, including in the last Budget as well as changes in the IT and data localisation laws.

Doctors selected

“The entire exercise is aimed at ensuring that no case of COVID-19 remains undetected or untreated. We have already contacted hospital authorities from where medical personnel have been selected to ensure that they are relieved by the head of their Department/Organisation and that coordination is made possible with the State governments. Doctors have been selected from the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Kolkata, and Lady Hardinge Medical College Hospital and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, Delhi,” said a senior health official.

He added that this was an important move as the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

The facility housed a total of 406 people, including seven Maldivians.

First batch

The PVKN Government Degree College in Chittoor has embarked on a couple of unique and eco-friendly certificate and diploma courses in ‘mushroom cultivation’ and ‘medicinal plants’ from the academic year 2020.

Launched as pilot courses for the Intermediate students, they are expected to rope in housewives and women entrepreneurs in a big way soon.

The faculty of the Department of Botany, which is set to monitor the curriculum, practical sessions and field work for the students of the twin courses, said that it is a first-of-its-kind initiative in Rayalaseema region. Inaugurated after a two-day orientation programme on Monday and Tuesday, each of the courses would have an intake of 30 candidates.

Head of the Department (Botany) C. Meera Saheb said that the three-month certificate course in “mushroom cultivation” was designed in such a way as to benefit jobless youth aspiring to be entrepreneurs with low investments.

Anyone who has completed Intermediate education of any stream is eligible to join the course, and there is no age limit for the same. This course is spanned for six months for the candidates with Intermediate Bi.P.C. qualification.

“Our faculty, in association with the banks and MSMEs, will guide the youth as to how they could initiate their plants and avail bank loans,” Dr. Saheb said.

96,2020/02/18,A rare discovery of 18 feet tall Siva Linga atop a temple in Kadapa district,"A freelance archeologist Kadiyala Venkateswara Rao stumbles on the unique find

The discovery of an 18 feet tall Siva Linga at Bhiraveswara Swamy Temple atop the Mopuru hillock adjacent to Nallacherupalli village in Vemula mandal of YSR Kadapa district by a freelance archeologist has raised interest among experts and amateurs alike. The Siva Linga is believed to have been naturally formed (called Svayambhu) - than human installed - during the Neolithic Age dating about 3,000-2,800 BC.

Found on the banks of Mogameru rivulet, the Siva Linga has thrown further light on ancient civilizations. The discovery of stone implements like stone axes, megalithic burials and other important tools used by the Megalithic Civilization recently by the Archeology Department has created further interest.

Erectus statues

“The Siva Linga’s dicovery has thrown light on the ancient religious practices of Neolithic civilizations, during which, people used to worship idols of Gods and Goddesses in standing posture. Early megalithic burial sites are also found on the river bank, throwing light about the existence of an ancient civilization,” said freelance archeologist Kadiyala Venkateswara Rao.

Mr. Kadiyala, who has retired as deputy director in Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP), has discovered menhirs at Karempudi village in Guntur district , a discovery which revealed religious practices of the Megalithic Civilization.

A natural formation

What is unique about this discovery is the story about the origin of the Siva Linga. Locals believe that the idol was not man made, but a natural formation. They also believe that the Siva Linga has supernatural powers.

“The Bhiraveswara Swamy Temple is a popular abode of Lord Siva and such temples need to be preserved. The site is also archeologically significant as there are traces of Neolithic Civilization and I urge the Archeological Survey of India to do further excavations and declare the area as a protected area,” said Mr. Kadiyala.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/a-rare-discovery-of-18-ft-tall-siva-linga/article30851592.ece

Khazavali: “The victim accompanied by his wife Ms. Radha visited the grievance cell seeking action alleging that a villager (Pamula Kondayya) had encroached his piece of land and recently physically assaulted his wife.”

“This was the first visit by the victim to the district-level grievance cell,” said Mr. Khazavali.

The victim had reportedly consumed pesticide outside the grievance cell and went inside. After sometime, he collapsed in front of a group of officials who were receiving grievances from the public.

The officials, including Joint Collector K. Madhavilatha and Mr. Khazavali, alerted the police and admitted him to the general hospital.

“The health condition of the victim is stable and doctors advised him to stay in the hospital for two days for further treatment,” said Mr. Khazavali.

Superintendent of Police M. Ravindranath Babu said that no complaint has been registered as it was a civil case.

Krishna District Collector A.Md. Imtiaz on Monday directed the Municipal Commissioners and Tehsildars to complete preparation of layout of the sites identified for distribution among the poor for housing facility by February 25.

In a video conference, Mr. Imtiaz has directed the officials to identify new sites in the event of any legal hurdle for the proposed sites. “The new list of the eligible families for the housing facility should be released on February 19, considering every eligible family for the house site following a field-level verification on the genuineness of the application,” said Mr. Imtiaz.

The Collector has directed the officials to include new families that engage in handloom weaving for the financial aid under the YSR Chenetha Hastham in the district.

103,2020/02/18,"Surgeries will become easier with use of robotics, AI, says BIRRD director","Paediatric ward to be developed on corporate lines: M. Madanmohan Reddy

From merely using nimble fingers to perform complex surgeries, the TTD’s Balaji Institute of Surgery, Research and Rehabilitation for the Disabled (BIRRD) is all set to take a giant leap by taking the assistance of robotics and artificial intelligence for precision and patient comfort.

In his maiden interaction with the media here on Friday, M. Madanmohan Reddy, who recently took over as BIRRD director, said that artificial intelligence (robots) would soon be used to improve work efficiency and accuracy. The 300-bedded facility, which is arguably the largest orthopaedic super specialty hospital in Asia, has sixteen operation theatres where 31 doctors and 231 paramedical staff treat patients on a war-footing, with focus on surgery as well as rehabilitation.

Doctors would conduct outreach camps regularly to identify deserving patients. Similarly, a paediatric ward would be developed on corporate lines and a special ward for joint replacement surgeries on payment basis. As nine out of every ten cases can be treated without surgery, Dr. Reddy announced the establishment of a regenerative medicine department for the same, most likely in association with a Bengaluru-based medical group.

“This department will treat conditions like early osteoarthritis, tennis elbow, heel pain and shoulder pain. Our ultimate aim is to create confidence in patients that the best treatment is available here,” Dr. Reddy said. Similarly, in a reformative bid to introduce fiscal discipline, the hospital would soon begin charging for implants and disposables from patients who are able to afford to buy the items.

BIRRD is also likely to sign an MoU with Dr. Jean Louis Briard, a renowned joint replacement surgeon in France, to establish a centre of excellence in revision knee replacement surgeries. As the hospital attracts patients from even North India, resulting in a long waiting list, Dr. Reddy said steps would be taken to bring the admitted patients to the operation theatre within 48 hours.

104,2020/02/18,CONCOR to make global foray from Vizag,"Guntur exim terminal will become operational very soon, says CMD

The Container Corporation of India (CONCOR) will begin its first-ever international operations from Visakhapatnam to Chittagong in Bangladesh and make an exim container terminal operational at Guntur from February.

CONCOR Chief General Manager D. Satyanarayana told The Hindu on Thursday that the corporation with 28 port container terminals was confined to domestic service, but for the first time obtained all clearances from Bangladesh to expand its operations to that country through Chittagong Port and ships with containers would initially be sent from Visakhapatnam, Krishnapatnam and Chennai and slowly expand depending on the need and demand. The maiden voyage would be from Visakhapatnam some time in February, he added.

“We had started coastal shipping services limited to the western coast in January 2019 and it was a great beginning and with a potential to expand it to beyond Tuticorin up to Paradeep very soon,” Mr. Satyanarayana said.

Visakhapatnam already handles a good amount of containers (2 lakh TEUs), including two train rakes coming or going to Nepal through Birgunj daily, as Nepal was land-locked. About 50 rakes are sent from Visakhapatnam and 20 from Kolkata to Nepal per month, he observed. With Chittagong services added, the container handling would increase at Visakhapatnam with cotton bales, textile machinery, two-wheelers and other such goods forming part of the international consignment.

A domestic terminal at Guntur handles 10,000 tonnes with tobacco, chillies, other spices forming major part of the consignments handled there, the CGM said and added that another 10,000 tonnes would be handled in the export/import segment in the exim container terminal at the same place, which it had got permissions. “Exim terminal operations at Guntur will begin in February with a possibility of total handling capacity going up to 50,000 tonnes,” he observed.

105,2020/02/18,Jagan to launch scheme torevamp govt. hospitals on Feb. 18,"It will be implemented in 3 years at a cost of ₹11,737 crore

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is scheduled to launch the first phase of the ‘Nadu-Nedu’ (now and then) programme in the health sector by laying the foundation stone for a sub-centre at Kurnool on Tuesday.

The government, under the programme, plans to take up construction, repairs and renovation of hospitals at a cost of ₹11,737 crore in a span of three years. The Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) would be followed for the sub-centres, Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs), Area Hospitals (AHs), District Hospitals (DHs) and Medical Council of India (MCI) norms for teaching hospitals.

As part of the first phase, ₹1,129 crore has been allocated for the health and wellness centres (sub-centres). A pictorial contrast of the hospitals before and after the implementation of Nadu-Nedu would be displayed on their premises to highlight the difference. The auxiliary Nurse Midwifery (ANM) staff quarters will be provided with single bedroom, kitchen and toilet, a clinic with lab and examination room with toilet and fully furnished medical equipment and furniture.

Rate contract

The Essential Medicines List (EML) was revised following the recommendations of the Standing Experts Committee and EML and AML (Additional Medicine list).

The EML/AML was finalised to 607 medicines by November 2019. Of 607 drugs, rate contract is available for about 511 drugs . Also, 530 life-saving medicines are being provided in health care institutions in the State.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jagan-to-launch-scheme-torevamp-govt-hospitals-on-tuesday/article30846514.ece
106,2020/02/18,We are seeing an undeclared emergency: Siddaramaiah,"The Congress on Tuesday said the law and order situation in the State resembled an “undeclared emergency”. Its legislators walked out of the Legislative Assembly after Speaker Vishweshwara Hegde Kageri deferred a detailed discussion on the issue till Wednesday.

As soon as members assembled in the House, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah made a preliminary submission to convince the chair to take up the issue of “bad law and order situation” in the State in the wake of anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests. The adjournment motion was tabled in the backdrop of the killing of two men in police firing during anti-CAA protests in Mangaluru and the filing of sedition cases against a school student and her mother in Bidar.

The Congress leader said the police, acting on behalf of the government, had slapped sedition charges against protesters and those expressing dissent over CAA and the National Register of Citizens. “No court or Parliament has the power to take away citizens’ right to protest,” he said.

Claiming that the law and order situation in the State had broken down completely, he blamed the police for imposing Section 144 in Mangaluru and other parts of the State for curtailing freedom of expression and the right to protest.

An argument ensued when Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai questioned Mr. Siddaramaiah’s allegations that the government had stifled freedom of expression. Mr. Bommai accused the Congress of “destroying democracy” and stifling free speech when the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared Emergency in June 1975. The Congress government under Indira Gandhi even blacked out the press and curtained fundamental rights, he said.

Countering Mr. Bommai, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that party workers, students, women and scholars have been opposing CAA, but the ruling BJP was considering them anti-national. While Indira Gandhi declared Emergency, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has imposed an “undeclared emergency”, he said.

Meanwhile, Ministers C.T. Ravi and K.S. Eshwarappa started attacking the Congress leader. Mr. Eshwarappa asked, “Are you people [Congress] talking about the Constitution and stifling dissent? Who sent L.K. Advani, A.B. Vajpayee and Jayaprakash Narayan to jail? What anti-national activities did they do? You are the ones who destroyed the Constitution.”

Speaker’s stand

As the war of words escalated, Mr. Kageri said the House was wasting time by taking up issues under Rules 60 and 69, much to the dislike of the people of the State. This irked the Opposition leaders, who asked the Speaker to expunge the words “the House is wasting time”. The Speaker said he would examine it later.

Mr. Kageri, who saw no merit in the matter for discussion under adjournment motion, asked the Congress to discuss the issue in detail under Rule 69 on Wednesday. He then allowed ruling party member A.S. Nadahalli to speak on the motion of thanks to the Governor’s address.

When Mr. Siddaramaiah persisted with the demand for further discussion, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa shouted at the Congress leader, telling him he could not “dictate terms to the Speaker”. The Congress leaders subsequently walked out of the Assembly.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/w09rb1/article30854589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGSESSION1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/we-are-seeing-an-undeclared-emergency-siddaramaiah/article30854590.ece
107,2020/02/18,Uproar in Karnataka Assembly over ‘tukde-tukde gang’,"Some BJP Ministers on Tuesday said in the Legislative Assembly that the “tukde-tukde gang” of the Congress was supporting the ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act across the nation. This sparked off a verbal duel between ruling party and Opposition members.

While Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah was making a preliminary submission to convince the chair to take up the issue as an adjournment motion on the “deteriorating” law and order in the State in the wake of anti-CAA, NCR and NPR protests, Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi and Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai said that the “tukde-tukde gang” of the Congress has been actively participating in protests in the State as well as other parts of the country.

Mr. Bommai alleged that the Congress was the “owner of the tukde-tukde gang” and had no moral right to speak on the Constitution and CAA. “The Congress has been promoting the tukde-tukde gang and provoking innocent people to protest against CAA, an Act passed by Parliament. Advocates belonging to the Congress are coming in the way of arresting the tukde-tukde gang,” he said.

Congress leaders Priyank Kharge, Sowmya Reddy, U.T. Khader, K.J. George, Zameer Ahmed, Dinesh Gundu Rao and Ramalinga Reddy took strong exception to this. Mr. Kharge asked the government to define the concept a “tukde-tukde gang” as the Union Home Ministry has said that it has no information on the terminology.

Mr. Kharge challenged the Home Minister to arrest the so-called tukde-tukde gang if it existed in the State. Ms. Reddy too urged Mr. Bommai to inform the House about the members of said gang.

Eventually, Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri intervened and appealed to members of both the ruling and Opposition parties to stop their war of words and allow Mr. Siddaramaiah to complete his submission on the matter.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uproar-in-karnataka-assembly-over-tukde-tukde-gang/article30854578.ece
108,2020/02/18,Mangaluru anti-CAA protest: 21 arrested for violence get bail,"There is no direct evidence to connect petitioners with alleged offences, says HC

The High Court of Karnataka has granted bail to 21 persons, who were among those arrested in connection with a case registered for unlawful assembly, causing damage to public property and attempt to set fire to a police station during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Mangaluru on December 19.

Justice John Michael Cunha passed the order on February 17 while allowing the petitions filed by Ashik alias Mohammad Ashik and 20 others.

The court directed each of the accused-petitioners to furnish a bond for ₹1 lakh and two sureties each for like sum apart from imposing other conditions — to appear before the trial court as required, not threaten or allure the prosecution witnesses, not get involved in similar offences, and to not leave the territorial limits of the trial court without its prior permission.

Though the prosecution has claimed that the involvement of the petitioners was captured on CCTV cameras and photographs, no such material was produced before the court showing the presence of any one of the petitioners at the spot armed with deadly weapons, it observed.

The HC also observed that the photographs produced by State Public Prosecutor-I depict that no member of the crowd was armed except one who was holding a bottle. In none of these photographs, the police station or policemen can be seen in the vicinity. On the other hand, photographs produced by the petitioners disclose that the policemen themselves were pelting stones on the crowd.

It was also noted that the material collected by the investigating agency did not contain any specific evidence as to the presence of any one of the petitioners at the spot; on the other hand, allegations have been made against the Muslim crowd of 1,500-2,000, alleging that they were armed with weapons like stones, soda bottles and glass pieces.

“The records indicate that a deliberate attempt has been made to trump-up evidence and to deprive the liberties of petitioners by fabricating evidence. It is not disputed that none of the petitioners have any criminal antecedents...

“There is no direct evidence to connect the petitioners with the alleged offences. Investigation appears to be mala fide and partisan,” the court observed, while pointing out that the possibility of false and mistaken implication cannot be ruled out as there were counter complaints against the police.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/b0hr3u/article30854509.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGVIOLENCEFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mangaluru-anti-caa-protest-21-arrested-for-violence-get-bail/article30854510.ece

110,2020/02/18,HKCCI demands sufficient money supply through ATMs for growth,"Attributing the deceleration in overall business activities, particularly in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME), to the insufficient supply of money to the market, the Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries (HKCCI) urged the Union government and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to make necessary arrangements to ensure that there would be perennial money supply to the market through ATMs.

In a letter written to Union Finance Minister and RBI Governor on Tuesday, Amarnath C. Patil and Shashikanth B. Patil, president and secretary of HKCCI, provided a list of measures to be considered to increase the cash flow into the market through ATM network across the country.

“The business environment is undergoing very hard days and the businesses together with MSME units are on the verge of collapse affecting GDP growth. One of the reasons, we believe, for this state of the economy is the lack of free flow of money to the market... With the improper supply of money through ATMs, the people are losing faith in the banking system adding to the woes of the present-day business and industrial environment... With the lack of money supply, the MSME units are facing hardship leading to a decline in GDP growth,” they said.

They urged the government and the RBI not to charge any fee for withdrawing money from ATMs notwithstanding the limit for withdrawal. They also suggested making arrangements to ensure that money is available round the clock and all the seven days of the week including the Sundays and other holidays in all ATMs.

Their other demands included removal of the upper limit for withdrawals through ATMs and doing away with levying of handling charges in the banks as a temporary measure to stimulate the economy.

“Money to the tune of ₹8.9 lakh crore is in circulation but the sorry fact is that the banks are facing a shortage of funds. It means that there is circulation of money but not through the banks.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hkcci-demands-sufficient-money-supply-through-atms-for-growth/article30854474.ece
111,2020/02/18,Jayachamaraja Wadiyar’s birth centenary fete on Thursday,"Awards instituted in memory of the last Maharaja of Mysuru to be conferred on three musicians

The birth centenary celebrations of Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar, the last Maharaja of Mysuru, have entered the third segment with an event organised by HH Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar Foundation here on Thursday.

President Ramnath Kovind had launched the birth centenary celebrations in October last year.

The celebrations on Thursday include the Maharaja’s daughters – Kamakshi Devi and Indrakshi Devi – recollecting memories of their father. The programme starts at 3 p.m. at Senate Bhavan on the Manasagangotri campus, said Pramoda Devi Wadiyar of the erstwhile Mysuru royal family, at a press conference at the palace on Tuesday. Palace Secretary M. Lakshminarayan was present.

Ms. Wadiyar said the daughters’ reminiscences will be followed by the presentation of “Sri Jayachamarajendra Prashasthi” to eminent musicians R. Satyanarayana (posthumous), T.S. Satyavathi and Sukanya Prabhakar. Interestingly, Sukhanya Prabhakar had done her research on the works of Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar.

A musical tribute to the last Maharaja has been organised which has been conceptualised and directed by Sukanya Prabhakar. The ‘sangeetha roopaka’ has been titled ‘Ganarajendra Sri Jayachamarajendra’.

The last in the segment is a talk by former Union Minister and Rajya Sabha MP Jairam Ramesh, on ‘Jayachamaraja Wadiyar and the Indian Board of Wildlife’.

Book on Maharaja’s compositions

A book on the music compositions of Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar – “Sri Jayachamarajakrutha Srividya Sankeerthana Sudhalahari” – will be unveiled at the gathering. Ms. Wadiyar said the book was launched by the President during the inauguration of the birth centenary celebrations in October last year.

Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar was a versatile composer and the magnum opus contains 97 music compositions in Kannada and Sanskrit along with the music notes. It is a 500-plus book with a cover price of ₹900.

The royal family had 94 music compositions in its collections and three other compositions were with another musician. “We are looking for about 108 more compositions that the Maharaja had written. Once we get them, we would like to bring them in print form. The hand-written 94 music compositions had been deciphered and brought out in a book form for the use of musicians and researchers,” Ms. Wadiyar said.

She stated that the book is a tribute to the Maharaja, who was known for his musical acumen, and published by the royal family. “Plans are afoot to bring the digitised version of the book,” Ms. Wadiyar said, adding that 1,000 copies had been printed and they would be made available for sale at the venue on Thursday.

The books would be available later at the Sri Jayachamarajendra Art Gallery at Jaganmohan Palace.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/drbe37/article30854116.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18MYSBOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jayachamaraja-wadiyars-birth-centenary-fete-on-thursday/article30854117.ece
112,2020/02/18,"Ready to restore Devaraja Market, says Pramoda Devi","She says HH Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar Foundation will do the job

While the fate of the century-old Devaraja Market continues to hang in the balance for various reasons, Pramoda Devi Wadiyar of the erstwhile Mysuru royal family on Tuesday felt that the market should be restored since it was among the country’s earliest supermarkets, visualised by the Maharajas many decades ago. The market deserves to be retained and conserved for its interesting past, she added.

She told reporters at the palace here that the HH Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar Foundation, which was founded by her in memory of her late husband, was ready to take the responsibility of conserving the market.

“I’m personally very keen to renovate the market. We have a team of trained and experienced heritage conservationists who could restore the building to its past glory. If the government and authorities are willing, we are ready for the task,” Ms. Wadiyar said.

To a question on the opinions expressed by many elected representatives of the Mysuru City Corporation for its demolition, she said, “I think it (market) should be conserved.”

Ms. Wadiyar replied in the positive for the restoration of another landmark heritage structure – Lansdowne Building. The foundation is ready to take up restoration of heritage properties in private ownership as well, she added.

She cited the recent restoration of Sri Jayachamarajendra Art Gallery at the Jaganmohan Palace here to endorse the expertise of the foundation’s conservation team. She has also taken up the conservation of Karikal Thotti, one of the oldest portions of the century-old Amba Vilas Palace or the Mysuru palace.

113,2020/02/18,Farmers try to lay siege to CADA office in Mysuru,"A large number of farmers tried to lay siege to the office of Command Area Development Authority (CADA) in Mysuru on Tuesday seeking release of water from KRS and Kabini reservoirs to the canals.

The farmers, who took out a march from Gun House Circle under the banner of Karnataka Sugarcane Growers Association and Kabini Raitha Hitarakshana Samithi, reached CADA building, but were stopped by the police at the entrance.

The farmers were demanding immediate release of water to the canals for their standing crops and to fill the lakes to ensure drinking water for the cattle. The farmers were pressing for release of water to various canals including Left and Right bank canals of Kabini, Ramapura, Hullahalli, Varuna, Chikkadevaraja and Vishveshwaraya canals from Kabini and KRS reservoirs.

They claimed that there was enough water stored in the two reservoirs to meet the requirements of the farmers.

Altercation

But, when they were stopped by the police at the entrance, an altercation ensued between the farmers and police. President of the State Sugarcane Growers’ Federation Kurubur Shanthakumar, who led the protest, threatened to intensify the farmers’ agitation if the CADA officials did not release water to the canals. The farmers were angry that the officials had failed to respond to their demand for releasing water, which they had already communicated to the officials.

However, CADA Chief Engineering Shankare Gowda came down to meet the agitating farmers and reportedly assured them that water will be released.

“He said he had discussed the matter with senior officials of the Irrigation Department as well as Minister in charge of Mysuru district V. Somanna and a decision had been taken to release water to the canals from February 25”, Mr. Shanthakumar claimed. He further claimed that the farmers had withdrawn their agitation following the assurance given by CADA officials.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/farmers-try-to-lay-siege-to-cada-office-in-mysuru/article30854069.ece
114,2020/02/18,New claimant for kambala record?,"Claims and counterclaims on the fastest kambala jockey have been surfacing ever since Srinivas Gowda of Moodbidri hit the headlines for covering 142.5 metres in 13.62 seconds at a kambala event on February 1 and 2.

On Tuesday, reports surfaced that in another kambala race held at Venur in Dakshina Kannada district on February 15 and 16, Nishanth Shetty of Bajagoli in Udupi district covered 143 m in 13.61 seconds. This, reports claimed, had resulted in breaking Mr. Gowda’s record.

A senior kambala organiser, who did not wish to be named, said the 13.62-seconds record of Mr. Gowda was in the ‘Negilu Kiriya’ category. However, he had completed the same distance in ‘Negilu Hiriya’ category in 13.46 seconds at the same event, which unfortunately was not noticed. Only the 13.62 seconds was portrayed as a record, he said.

Kambala Academy founder and convener Gunapala Kadamba had told The Hindu on Monday that with Mr. Gowda’s feat, the issue of two jockeys covering 146 m in 13.6 seconds in 2013 had come under discussion. The kambala was held at Miyar in Karkala taluk where jockeys Suresh Shetty of Varkadigoli and Kolke Irvathur Ananda had completed the run simultaneously.

Stating that kambala races cannot be compared to Olympics sprints that are judged in minute seconds, Mr. Kadamba had said kambala was yet to evolve sophisticated technology to determine timing.

While the Kambala Samiti has adopted laser-beam technology at the finish point to exactly decide the finishing time, the same is yet to be adopted at the start point, he said. The academy and samiti are likely to test this technology at the February 22, 23 kambala being held at Paivalike in the neighbouring Kasargod district, Mr. Kadamba said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/j5zm8x/article30856928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HinduTemplateGNU74SNDL3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-claimant-for-kambala-record/article30854014.ece

The public prosecutor, however, opposed the bail plea and requested the court to hand over the accused to police custody. Accepting the request, the court handed over the accused to police custody till Wednesday 2 p.m.

“They have not committed any crime and strongly felt it was not right to abscond. That is why they decided to surrender. I hope they will get bail tomorrow,” Mr. Jagannath, defence advocate, told The Hindu.

Following a complaint lodged by one Shivakumar Arikeri, general secretary of BJP Yuva Morcha, the Gangavathi Rural police had filed an FIR against Mr. Bisaralli and Mr. Rajabaxi on January 24 under Section 505(2) of Indian Penal Code.

The police move had attracted widespread criticism. In defiance, thousands of people further shared the recitation on social media platforms. The poem was subsequently translated into 13 languages.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/poet-editor-taken-into-police-custody/article30853601.ece
117,2020/02/18,Work on Mysuru palace’s Karikallu Thotti in full swing,"The Wadiyar foundation has roped in experts for the first major restoration work

H.H. Srikandatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar Foundation, Mysuru, an entity of the erstwhile Mysuru royal family, has taken up the first major conservation of Amba Vilas Palace (Mysuru palace) with the restoration work of Karikallu Thotti, one of the portions of the original palace structure, in full swing.

Karikallu Thotti, in the rear end of the main palace building, was in bad shape with a leaking roof. The erstwhile Mysuru royal family has taken up restoration with a specially-drawn team of heritage conservationists and architects.

Pramoda Devi Wadiyar of the erstwhile royal family told a press conference at the palace on Tuesday that the government had given its nod for the restoration work after the family wrote for its support. “We have taken up the work using our funds. Funds from the government had been sought. Presently, gate collections are being used for palace maintenance. The restoration cost can be reimbursed from the collections,” she said.

The civil work of the wood-rich Karikallu Thotti, which also includes Gandada Thotti, has been completed. The remaining works include wiring, camera surveillance and fire-proofing, which are expected to be done by July this year. Karikallu Thotti’s adjacent structures will also be restored, Mr. Wadiyar said, adding that structures are reinforced using wood and therefore needs a foolproof fire proofing.

She showed videos of Karikallu Thotti before the restoration work and said the leak in the ceiling had forced the family to shift the prized artefact. “It was in a poor condition in the absence of proper maintenance,” she said.“If heritage conservationists had been involved in maintenance, the condition wouldn’t have been this bad. The process of calling tenders and engaging people not familiar to conservation does not yield expected results,” she said.

To a question, Ms. Wadiyar said the government should engage people who are trained in conservation of heritage buildings. She, added that H.H. Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar Foundation was prepared to look after the maintenance of entire palace if the responsibility was vested to us. “Our interest is that the palace should be properly conserved. Some portions of the palace are also in need of immediate restoration,” she replied.

Varsha, heritage conservationist roped in by the foundation, said the damaged wooden pillars and the wooden rafters had been replaced, besides strengthening the walls and roof as per the norms.

Ms. Wadiyar said it was an expensive project. Karikallu Thotti, after conservation, will house the family-owned rare artefacts and also an armoury.

Some repairs had been carried out earlier at the palace as part of maintenance work but the work to conserve the palace portions has been taken up for the first time, she maintained.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vm7omu/article30853585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGKARIKALTHOTTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/work-on-mysuru-palaces-karikallu-thotti-in-full-swing/article30853586.ece
118,2020/02/18,Farmers told to adopt new technologies,"Expressing serious concern over crop losses, Vice-Chancellor of University of Agriculture and Sciences K.N. Kattimani has appealed to farmers to adopt new technologies in agriculture and grow crops using less water.

He was addressing a gathering after inaugurating a programme, All India Co-ordinated Researched Products on FIM, PHET, UAE, EAAI and PET Technology and Machinery Demonstration Mela-2020, on UAS campus in Raichur on Tuesday.

Dr. Kattimani, who underlined the importance of survival of the agrarian sector, said that farmers should switch to other comprehensive farming methods that require less water and also other forms of farming such as fisheries, pig rearing and dairy farming to make agriculture more benefit and prevent possible losses owing to various reasons, including natural disaster and drought. “Farmers, especially in the Kalyan Karnataka region, should opt for horticulture crops adopting scientific methods of growing fruits and vegetables which can help fill losses they suffer in the other crops,” he added.

Dean of UAS M. Veeranagowda, who presided over the programme, said that UAS was keen on helping develop the farming sector through new researches and technologies and also guide farmers by holding seminars, conventions and exhibitions to create awareness among them. “Farmers can walk into the campus to get knowledge about new methods in growing crops,” he said.

K.V. Prakash, Chief of Agriculture Technology College, Veeranagowda Parasareddy, Trivikram Joshi, members of the administrative committee, also spoke.

Farmers were given information about agriculture equipment based on new technologies during the mela.

120,2020/02/18,Claim over ration card database puts two departments at odds,"Revenue Dept. fears the e-governance Dept. will take credit for its e-kshana database

The Revenue Department, over five years, created the e-kshana ration card database that maps nearly five crore population with their residence, caste and income. This in turn was seeded with Aaadhar details, helping the government in reaching out to genuine beneficiaries. The database was created by the Atal Janasnehi Kendra (AJSK) of the Revenue Department.

However, with the E-governance Department that is rolling out the family ID project seeking the integrated e-kshana ration card database, fears have now been expressed by the revenue officials that the AJSK’s work could be showcased by the E-governance Department as its own.

Munish Moudgil, who headed the project for four years while being the Commissioner of Survey Settlement and Land Records, has recorded his displeasure in a letter to Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar. Mr. Moudgil was transferred last week. “The E-governance Department seeking the entire integrated e-kshana ration card database created by me and showing it as its own work is unfair and amounts to usurpation of my four-year effort. This is gross injustice,” he claimed in the letter, accessed by The Hindu.

Mr. Moudgil also pointed out that legally only the tahsildar under the Revenue Department could declare/decide family details, and hence, family ID and individual ID issuance had to be done by the Revenue Department. He has also requested the Karnataka government to take note and recognise his work of four years.

In another letter addressed to Additional Chief Secretary Rajeev Chawla, who heads the E-governance Department, Mr. Moudgil said the family ID project will use the same idea of ration card and would stand on already implemented work of e-kshana.

‘Give credit’

“It is in fairness that the same is duly recognised and if at any time the family ID work of the E-governance Department receives recognition or award, they be named as co-creators,” Mr. Moudgil said in the letter. Besides him, he has sought the names of IAS officers S.S. Nakul and Meena Nagraj, KAS officials Gangadhar Swamy and Manjunath Swamy, NIC technical director Jayanthi and Manjunath, programme manager AJSK directorate to have worked on the project and be acknowledged as co-creators.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/4mzn4v/article30853474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGRATIONCARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/claim-over-ration-card-database-puts-two-departments-at-odds/article30853475.ece
121,2020/02/18,Succession row back in Moorusavir Mutt,"Sri Dingaleshwar Swami announces that he will enter the mutt on Feb. 23

After a hiatus that lasted close to five years, the issue of succession in Moorusavir Mutt has been raked up again with one of the claimants for the successor’s post Sri Dingaleshwar Swami making a comeback with more vigour and with a challenge to enter the mutt on February 23 this year.

There has been opposition to the appointment of Sri Dingaleshwar Swami as successor to the centuries old Moorusavir Mutt from a large section of the devotees and there are some who are in favour of him succeeding to the post.

Moorusavir Mutt is one among the prominent Lingayat mutts of the Virakta tradition.

In November 2014, after a court case in the issue and high drama on the mutt premises, the seer of the mutt, Sri Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami, had announced his decision to abdicate the peetha and had left for Hanagal Kumaraswami Mutt. The swami was head of the Hanagal Mutt before he was appointed peethadhipati of the Moorusavir Mutt.

It was only after much persuasion by devotees of Hubballi and various seers that the swami had returned to the mutt on the day of Basava Jayanti in April 2015. The swami had then said that he would not again commit the mistake of abdicating the peetha but would decide the issue of succession under the guidance of the heads of various mutts and the devotees.

Now, even as Sri Dingaleshwar Swami, who heads the Virakta Mutt at Balehosur in Gadag district, declared that he was still the appointed successor of Moorusavir Mutt and was ready for an open discussion on the issue on the mutt premises on February 23, Sri Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami, who is staying at Hanagal Mutt after recovering from a bout of illness, has issued a press release asking those speaking for and against the mutt’s succession issue to keep quiet.

Sri Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami had even said that his patience should not be construed as his weakness and the successor of the mutt would be appointed as per the tradition of the mutt and in accordance with the rules governing the mutt’s administration.

The former Minister and Member of the mutt’s core committee Basavaraj Horatti has tried to distance himself from the controversy saying that he would not go to the mutt on the scheduled date for a debate. “Nor would I like to intervene in the fight between the swamis,” he said.

However, the former MP and businessman Vijay Sankeshwar, who resigned from the core committee long ago, has extended support to Sri Dingaleshwar Swami succeeding to the post. In a press conference here on Monday, Mr. Sankeshwar even accused Sri Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami of selling the mutt’s property violating rules and said that under him [Sri Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami], the development of the mutt had been affected. He said that the accusations and cases against Sri Dingaleshwar Swami were created by vested interests to prevent his entry to Moorusavir Mutt.

Meanwhile, Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, who in 2015 played a key role in bringing back Sri Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami, has chosen to remain silent on the issue. However, discussions on the issue have begun among the devotees of the mutt and there is a clear division among them over appointing Sri Dingaleshwar Swami as the successor. Considering the possibility of the issue leading to disturbance like it had happened in 2014, the police have already provided security cover to the mutt premises.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7nsvn1/article30853398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19HBHUBBALLIMOORUSAVIRMUTT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/succession-row-back-in-moorusavir-mutt/article30853399.ece

128,2020/02/18,Vedike wants farm production promoted,"Appeal made to Chief Minister

A forum fighting for strengthening democracy – Prajaprabhutva Ulisi Andolana Vedike – has appealed to the Chief Minister to encourage agriculture production, by stopping non-agriculture activities in agricultural lands.

Nagesh Angirasa, an activist of the forum, in his appeal to Chief Minister B.S.Yediyurappa, has said the government should stop converting agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes.

He submitted his appeal at a consultative meeting convened by the Chief Minister as part of the pre-budget meetings in Bengaluru recently.

Mr. Angirasa was one among those invited to take part in the discussion.

Instead of procuring foodgrains for various schemes from different agencies outside, he said, the government should encourage farmers to grow and purchase them. “At present, paddy is losing demand. Farmers are shifting to other crops. If the government encourages farmers by purchasing from them at a good price, they would take up paddy cultivation”, he said.

Organic farming

He also appealed to the State government to take up a massive campaign to promote organic farming. “Agricultural scientists have made farmers grow crops using chemicals for years. This has affected the health of many people. In the interest of people’s health, the government should promote organic farming”, he said.

Mr. Angirasa opined that the government should strengthen farmers economically, by providing them scientific price for their products, in place of schemes to waive loans.

Interestingly, he suggested that the government reduce the expenses at Raj Bhavan, the Governor’s residence. “The Governor is necessary in a federal structure. But the expenses incurred to maintain the system should be minimal”, he said. He has also suggested abolition of the Legislative Council.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vedike-wants-farm-production-promoted/article30848457.ece

They said the BJP government was spreading falsehoods through the speech and appropriating the achievements of the earlier coalition government.

Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Siddaramaiah termed the Governor’s speech “directionless”. He alleged that the Governor had spelt out schemes that were largely introduced by the Congress-JD(S) government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy.

In a tweet, Mr. Siddaramaiah said that the government was conveying false information through the Governor’s speech. “Adequate relief measures are still not taken even after six months since floods took place. Many victims are still leading their lives without shelter,” he tweeted.

In another tweet, he said, “There are still plenty of reports about miserable living conditions of flood victims. But @BSYBJP is only worried about power & CM chair. It was expected that this unethical government, which was formed through Operation Kamala, will worry only about selfish motives.”

Meanwhile, Mr. Kumaraswamy described the speech as a “cut-and-paste job”. He said the “lacklustre speech” did not mention any new programme. Furthermore, he said the State government had failed to bring in financial aid from the Centre and the biggest achievement of this government was the masking of its failures.

131,2020/02/18,Bird numbers see drastic fall in Mysuru region,"The just-concluded single-day winter bird monitoring exercise across Mysuru, Mandya and Chamarajanagar districts indicates a drastic fall in bird count. This is being attributed to continuing habitat losses and excessive rains this year.

Heavy rains extending beyond the normal cycle of monsoon filled up waterbodies across the region and disrupted the distribution pattern of birds.

The bird monitoring exercise was completed on February 12. Sixteen teams, comprising 45 birders representing Mysore Nature group, took part in it, covering different routes simultaneously, according to A. Shivaprakash, who has been studying the birds of the region for three decades.

The Mysore Nature teams covered 114 locations across the three districts and identified 202 bird species, including 45 non-resident birds. But what came as a shock to the group was that their numbers were down to 25,107, as against 45,986 birds representing 209 species counted last year.

Mr. Shivaprakash told The Hindu that this was not a one-off figure, but part of a downward trend that has been perceptible for many years now.

He said the voluntary effort to study and monitor birds, which was started in 1987, has helped generate robust data on birds in and around Mysuru and presents a scientific baseline data not only on the status of various bird species, but also on their habitats.

Habitat loss

Habitat loss has been a continuous process for decades because of rapid urbanisation abetted by anthropogenic factors that have led to lake encroachment and erosion of forest and vegetation cover. This has contributed to the decline of the bird population in the Mysuru area.

But heavy rains have also wreaked havoc on migratory birds and their distribution this year. Contrary to popular perception, a full waterbody supports only a limited number and species of birds. “Shallow areas coupled with vegetation enable even waders to roost, but they do not prefer an overflowing lake as the foraging ground is lost,” Mr. Shivaprakash said.

Waders do not venture into deep waters, and if the lake is full then they will fly and scout for a more suitable habitat. Also, not all birds feed on fish; many species depend on insects that thrive when there is growth of hydrophytes, Mr. Shivaprakash explained.

A study of the 30-year data generated through annual monitoring highlights the gradual decline of bird numbers in the region. The bird count was in excess of 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh 15 years ago, but is now down to a few thousands, Mr. Shivaprakash said. There have been local extinctions, and seven of the nine species of birds that were recorded by Salim Ali in the 1940s in the Mysuru belt are no longer sighted in the region, he said.

Some sightings

Mysuru region plays host to exotic birds from distant lands during winter migration. Some of the migratory birds, such as the bar-headed geese, fly in from as far as Mongolia, soaring over the Himalayan mountains, and roost in the Kabini backwaters. Hadinaru lake, near Suttur, is another favoured spot of these birds. As many as 2,108 bar-headed geese were counted on the day of the bird counting exercise, and their winter sojourn is expected to end in the next few weeks.

Mr. Shivaprakash said a significant aspect of this year’s exercise was the first-ever recording of the white-rumped shama in the Mysuru area by S. Nisarga, S. Shylajesha and Sudhanshu Hegde, who were part of the bird-watching team.

The maximum number of bird species was recorded in the KRS backwaters (99), followed by Rayanakere (78) and Kalale (65). The maximum number of birds were sighted in Kabini (1,640), followed by Kikkeri (1,414) and Lingambudhi lake (741). The brahminy kite was sighted at 86 of the 114 locations surveyed. Cattle egret was sighted at 78 sites, while little egret which found at 77 sites, Mr. Shivaprakash said.

Other interesting sightings during the bird-counting exercise were the Malabar lark, Eurasian wryneck, thick-billed warbler, red spurfowl, common quail, baillon’s crake, yellow-throated bulbul, Indian scops owl, and yellow-throated sparrow.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mkd9ft/article30846198.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGMYSBIRDS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bird-numbers-see-drastic-fall-in-mysuru-region/article30846199.ece
132,2020/02/18,"Council bypoll: G.T. Deve Gowda defies party, votes for Laxman Savadi","Chamundeshwari MLA G.T. Deve Gowda on Monday created a flutter in the JD(S) when he violated the party’s direction and voted in favour of Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who won the byelection to the Legislative Council on Monday.

At their legislature party meetings, the JD(S) and Congress had asked all their legislators to stay away from voting in the Council bypolls. With Independent candidate B.R. Anil Kumar retiring from the contest on Saturday, Mr. Savadi’s victory was certain, but the election was held since the decision was taken after the last date for withdrawal of nominations.

On Monday, Mr. Gowda surprised his party colleagues as he walked into the polling booth escorted by Tourism Minister C.T. Ravi. He cast his vote and straight away headed to greet Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Mr. Savadi.

Admitting that he had voted, Mr. Gowda said he had no instructions from his party to abstain from voting. “As no JD(S) candidate is in the fray, I voted for Mr. Savadi. He is the State’s Deputy Chief Minister and it is our duty for vote for him. People will not accept it if we do not vote for him.”

Replying to queries on his maintaining a distance from JD(S) leaders, he said, “I am a JD(S) legislator representing Chamundeshwari. No one from the party spoke to me. I came directly to Vidhana Soudha for the election. As a legislator, I did not want to waste my vote,” he said.

Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said he did not know why the JD(S) leader had gone against the party. “We do not know whether he is in our party or has joined some other party. He is making several statements. Let us wait and watch,” he said.

Bypolls to the Council were necessitated by a seat falling vacant following the election of one Council member, Rizwan Arshad of the Congress, to the Legislative Assembly in the December Assembly byelections. This MLC bypoll was crucial for Mr. Savadi, who was not a member of the Assembly or the Council when he became Deputy Chief Minister.

Wait and watch: Kateel

BJP State president Nalin Kumar Kateel gave a cryptic response when asked about Mr. Gowda’s growing proximity to the saffron party.

“Wait and watch,” said Mr. Kateel when asked about the possibility of Mr. Gowda joining the BJP in light of him voting in favour of Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi during the byelections to the Legislative Council held on Monday. When reporters asked whether another round of ‘Operation Lotus’ was on the cards, Mr. Kateel said the doors of the BJP were open to everyone. “But I would not like to call it Operation Kamala.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/council-bypoll-gt-deve-gowda-defies-party-votes-for-laxman-savadi/article30846136.ece

134,2020/02/18,Aavin to supply 1.5 lakh litres of milk daily to Milma,"Milk to be given at ₹40 a litre

The Tamilnadu Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation (Aavin) has agreed to supply 1.5 lakh litres daily to the Kerala Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma). The supply is expected to start shortly, Milma chairman P. A. Balan said on Tuesday.

“In principle, we have agreed to their proposal. They have agreed to sell us milk for ₹40 a litre, which is a bit high for us. We are trying to get the price lowered,” Mr. Balan said.

Milma had placed a request for two lakh litres of milk to meet the shortage triggered by a dip in supply from the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF).

With Aavin agreeing to supply milk, the crisis will be averted for the time being, Mr. Balan said.

“After the reduction by the KMF, we are getting 95,000 litres from Karnataka. This, combined with the 1.5 lakh litres from Tamil Nadu, will suffice to fill the demand-supply gap in Kerala.” Milma procures 12 lakh litres of milk daily in Kerala. Milma officials had held discussions with Aavin in Chennai on Monday.

On a request by Animal Husbandry Minister K. Raju, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had taken up the matter with Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K.

Next is e-language lab, which will have language lab software that will provide opportunities for students to hear English, talk, read, and write depending on their learning capability.

The third component is e-broadcast. It will include programmes on KITE Victers channel that will help students learn how to use English in practical situations through interactive mode.

136,2020/02/18,Mystery shrouds death of six infants in a family,"Body of three-month-old exhumed for post-mortem

A sudden pall of mystery has fallen over the deaths of six children in a family over the last 10 years in Tirur. The family and the police alike are agape at the deaths of the infants that took place in mysterious circumstances. Doctors who examined the babies too had no definite reasons to ascribe for the deaths.

The authorities took note of the deaths when the sixth child of Rafeek Tharamal and Shabna died on Tuesday morning.

The three-month-old infant was brought dead to the government hospital at Tirur in the morning, and the body was soon interred at the Korangath Juma Masjid graveyard.

The police intervened following an alert by ASHA workers and the health inspector at the hospital. Rafeek’s elder brother Tharamal Ashraf, who is a municipal councillor at Tirur, filed a formal complaint with the police as part of clearing the air over the deaths.

Post-mortem report

The police exhumed the body and conducted a post-mortem at Government Medical College Hospital, Manjeri.

District Police Chief U. Abdul Kareem said the post-mortem had found nothing unnatural in the death. “So far, there is nothing unnatural. We have sent the internal organs for further examinations,” he said.

Mr. Rafeek’s first child died when it was six months old. The second child was two months old when it died. The third died when it was 25 days old. The fourth child lived up to the age of four.

The fifth and the sixth children were three months old when they died. Four of them were females and two males.

“Neither we nor the doctors who examined the children had any idea why our children could not live. It’s still a mystery. We want this mystery to be cleared. We took our children to several experts available. The doctors at Amrita Hospital said their cause of early deaths might be genetic,” said Mr. Rafeek’s sister Noorjahan.

Mr. Ashraf told The Hindu that the onus lay on the authorities, including the medical community, to clear the mystery that shrouded his brother’s family over the deaths of the children.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mystery-shrouds-death-of-six-infants-in-a-family/article30854401.ece

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday dismissed pleas by eight convicts in the Kevin murder case to suspend the sentence of double life imprisonment awarded to them by the Principal Sessions Court, Kottayam, and grant them bail. They had been convicted in the first honour killing case registered and tried in the State.

Based on evidence

While dismissing their pleas, the Bench comprising Justice A. Hariprasad and Justice N. Anil Kumar observed that it was of the view that the finding of the sessions court was based on positive proof and credible evidence.

143,2020/02/18,Murder of toddler: life imprisonment for woman,"Grandniece thrown to river by the accused

A woman who killed her four-year-old grandniece by throwing her into the Manali river at Puthukkad has been sentenced to life imprisonment. Thrissur Principal Sessions Judge Sofi Thomas on Tuesday also slapped a fine of ₹50,000 on Shailaja, 50, of Ollur. She would have to undergo an additional two years in jail, if she failed to pay the fine.

The incident happened on October 13, 2016. Meba, 4, daughter of Ranjith and Neeshma of Mattannur, reached her mothers’ s house at Pazhayil, near Puthukkad, for a funeral function.

Shailaja was Neeshma’s paternal aunt. Shailaja, who has a grudge with Neeshma’s family, threw the granddaughter of her brother to the Manalippuzha. She told the relatives, who were searching for the girl that some Bengalis kidnapped her.

Back in 2013, Shailaja had stolen Meba’s jewellery during her first birthday celebrations. Following this the child’s family had a fallout with Shailaja.

She was also booked by the police in a trafficking case in the same year.

Following these two incidents Neeshma’s family banned Shailaja from visiting their house. This prompted the woman to commit the gruesome murder.

The court, which found Shailaja guilty, sentenced her to life imprisonment. Public Prosecutor K.D. Babu appeared for the prosecution.

145,2020/02/18,Fire officials on their toes,"Season of wildfire seems to have arrived much earlier this year

As the extremely hot, dry season sets in, officials under the Kottayam forest division have been on their toes battling the blazes at different locations over the past one week.

According to officials, the region’s most destructive wildfires often occur during the March-May period with its vegetation desiccating into perfect tinder.

Dry spell

The season of wildfire, however, seems to have arrived much earlier this year with the green bushes at several locations turning bone dry, coupled with high temperature and strong winds.

The only thing missing is a spark, which could originate from anything — even from a burning cigarette.

“The climatic conditions have fuelled fires in at least seven locations including Vandanpathal, Murinjapuzha and Placherry under the Erumely range. These blazes may have caused a loss of bush vegetation in over 20 acres of land while no animal casualties have been reported,” said an official.

Meanwhile, eyewitnesses said that fire was racing through the hill tops at Kandankayam, near Mundakkayam, on Tuesday morning.

Taking serious note of the situation the department has deployed fire gangs at critical locations, which have been identified by assessing the previous history of wildfires.

Fire gangs

Each of these fire gangs, now camping inside the forests, comprise a couple of forest officials and adequate number of fire watchers.

These fire gangs plan their moves based on the directions from the Forest Division Office, which is being alerted on fire occurrences by the Forest Survey of India through satellite mapping.

“As of now, the blazes have been limited to locations under the Erumely range and they have been brought under control in a time-bound manner. Accordingly, we have hired the service of as many as 40 fire watchers for the region. At the same time, no such cases have been reported from the Nagarmpara, Ayyappankovil and Kumili forests,” said Y. Vijayan, Divisional Forest Officer, Kottayam.

Clearing fire line

Meanwhile, the authorities have expedited the works to clear the fire line along plantations and forests, besides launching awareness programmes along forest fringes.

The department also seeks to coordinate with the Fire and Rescue Services in bringing the conflagrations under control.

However, the absence of a fire responder machine and limited staff strength are posing serious challenges in materialising the plan.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fire-officials-on-their-toes/article30854289.ece

151,2020/02/18,Kollam DMO issues alert as mercury rises,"People advised to take precautionary measures

With the temperature steadily shooting up and mercury hovering around 36 degree Celsius in Punalur, the District Medical Office (DMO) has issued an alert advising the public to stay cautious.

“Those exposed to sun from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. should use loose cotton clothes and two-wheeler riders should wear sunglasses and helmet. Air circulation should be ensured in all workplaces and since staying outdoors will lead to dehydration it’s mandatory to increase the intake of water,” District Medical Officer V.V. Shirley said here on Tuesday.

Immediately move to places with proper shade if body temperature goes up and use cotton dipped in cold water to wipe body parts exposed to the sun.

Since sodium level can fall due to excessive sweating, regulate salt levels accordingly. “Dehydration and continued exposure to hot weather can lead to paralysis if not treated on time. So it’s important to get medical aid if symptoms including dizziness, fatigue, fainting and muscle cramps are seen.”

Since water shortage has been reported from many parts of the district, chances are high for water-borne diseases as well.

“Drink boiled water only to prevent diseases like jaundice, typhoid, diarrhoea and cholera. There is also a possibility for chickenpox outbreaks,” she said.

Drinking water

The DMO instructed primary and family level health officials to check the quality of drinking water distributed by private parties and tanker lorries.

Only those with food business operator licence will be allowed to distribute portable water. Tanks should be chlorinated and hoses and pumps used should be clean. Those who distribute water and ice should display details of the distributor and licence along with contact number.

Chlorine tablets

Chlorine tablets to purify water are currently available in all public health centres and community health centres. The department has also instructed to avoid soft drinks and other food items prepared at unhygienic places.

“Those who store water are advised use lids to cover the containers to prevent the outbreak of vector-borne infections such as dengue fever and chikungunya. Persons who are regularly exposed to contaminated water should take doxycycline as a precautionary measure,” she added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kollam-dmo-issues-alert-as-mercury-rises/article30854225.ece
152,2020/02/18,TDB denounces delay in payment of wages,"900 sanitation workers at Sabarimala yet to get wages

The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) and various organisations have taken exception to the undue delay on the part of the district administration in disbursing the wages of 900 Tamil sanitation workers who were deployed by the Sabarimala Sanitation Society (SSS) at Sabarimala, Pampa, Nilackal and Pandalam for 71 days during the last pilgrim season that came to a close on January 21.

Talking to The Hindu, TDB president N. Vasu said the board was all praise for the valuable service done by the sanitation workers.

No communication

The TDB used to release funds to the SSS, chaired by the Pathanamthitta Collector, every year on reimbursement basis. However, the board had not yet received any communication in this regard from the SSS so far.

Mr. Vasu said the board was pained to know that the poor workers were yet to receive their wages.

The workers hailing from Madurai, Theni, Kalladaikurichi, Salem, Cumbom, etc, were the backbone of the government’s cleaning initiative at Sabarimala and any delay in disbursing their wages had no justification, he said.

He had already directed board officials to consult District Collector P.B. Noohu and take necessary steps to release the funds required for disbursing the workers’ wages.

Administration flayed

The Akhila Bharatha Ayyappa Seva Sanghom (ABASS) and Sabarimala Ayyappa Seva Samajom (SASS) accused the district administration of adopting a stepmotherly attitude towards Sabarimala and the workers.

SASS president Akkeeramon Kalidasan Bhattathirippad and ABASS general secretary N. Velayudhan alleged that the daily wage of ₹400 fixed for the 24-hour cleaning work was too low when compared to the wage of a worker fixed by the government. Delaying even this ‘pittance’ amounted to criminal indifference.

The CBI on Tuesday arrested five policemen and a home guard in connection with the alleged custodial death of 49-year-old Rajkumar, a remand prisoner, on June 21 last year.

The agency had arrested K.A. Sabu, former sub-inspector of the Nedumkandam police station and prime accused in the case, on Monday.

The five policemen arrested on Tuesday include Rejimon, Roy P Varghese, Jithin K George, Sajeev Antony and Niyas. James K.M. is the home guard taken into custody. The accused will be presented before the Chief Judicial Magistrate court here shortly.

The court had granted six-day custody of Sabu, the prime accused, on Monday. The CBI had pointed out that further interrogation was required to ascertain whether senior officers had any role in the custodial torture.

Rajkumar, a private financier from Kolahalamedu, was taken into custody on charges of financial fraud on June 12 and was produced before the court only on June 16. He had allegedly accepted deposits from self-help groups on the promise of providing them loans. However, complaints were filed at the Nedumkandam police station that he had failed to keep the promise.

Rajkumar was allegedly subjected to severe torture at the Nedumkandam police station from June 12 to June 15, leading to his death on June 21.

156,2020/02/18,50 adventure tourism sites to be upgraded,"Muzhappilangad, Kaapil, and Wagamon are among the proposed sites

Fifty major adventure tourism centres in the State will be upgraded to meet global standards, Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran has said.

The Minister’s announcement came on Monday in the capital during the roll-out of a set of safety and security regulations to position the State as a secure and hassle-free destination for adventure-loving vacationers and nature buffs.

Noting that guidelines had been set for the conduct of 31 land, water, and air-based activities, the Minister said Muzhappilangad in Kannur, Kaapil in Varkala, and Wagamon in Idukki would be designated as adventure tourism centres. A proposal to set up adventure parks in all districts is also under the consideration of the government, as per the availability of land,” Mr. Surendran said.

Listing five ways of developing adventure tourism, he said the basic infrastructure in the existing spots needs to be developed first. This should be followed by identifying and developing new spots, promoting public-private ventures and creating a circuit connecting adventure tourism spots. Finally, it has be branded.

“Soft adventure parks have already been started in Veli, Kollam Asramam, Thenmala, Karalad in Wayand and Kottappuram. Preparations are in the final stages in Munnar to start paragliding activities.

158,2020/02/18,Call for holistic approach to achieve gender justice,"Seminar on ‘Nava Kerala and women’s movement’ conducted as part of Panchayat Day fete

Creating an atmosphere of rational thinking and keeping away from superstitions are the need of the hour to create a Nava Keralam for women, State Planning Board member Mridul Eapen has said.

Delivering the keynote address at a seminar on ‘Nava Kerala and the women’s movement’ here on Monday, Dr. Eapen said gender justice could be achieved only through the intermingling of the economic with political, social and cultural dimensions. The programme was organised as a part of the State level Panchayat Day celebrations.

“The policy of development should concern with resolving problems of poverty, deprivation, and unemployment,” Dr. Eapen said, adding that those problems were gender-specific and were not sufficiently recognised in society.

Dr. Eapen said gender justice meant ending all discrimination against women.

Speaking after inaugurating the seminar, T.N. Seema, executive vice-chairperson, Haritha Kerala Mission, said women’s participation in local bodies had significantly increased since 1995, and that now it stood at 58% as against a mere 4% a few decades ago.

Dr. Seema said women should come forward to build a Nava Keralam by striving for it on an even keel with men.

160,2020/02/18,Kannur pines for a cricket ground,"Fort Ground is no longer accessible to sports, despite its rich history

The Fort Ground, or the Kota Maidan to the people of Kannur, is not far from the historic Fort St. Angelo, built by the Portuguese in the 16th century. But it no longer exists in the nomenclature of the town’s streets and places. Fenced and guarded by Army men round-the-clock, the sprawling ground has now been reduced to a source of nostalgia for sports lovers here. But it was once open to local sports events.

Thalassery is incontrovertibly the cradle of cricket in Kerala. But neighbouring Kannur, the district headquarters, too has a cricket legacy. The Kota Maidan once witnessed several cricket matches between teams represented by the finest players of the time of Kerala and the Indian teams. It produced several State players who laid the foundation for today’s cricketing culture in the State. Cricket lovers here still recall the cricketing encounters and the Ranji Trophy matches played at the Kota Maidan.

Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, who went on to become India’s captain, played here the match against Kerala led by local lad J.K. Mahendra, the first player from the State to represent the Indian schools cricket team that toured England.

The region’s association with cricket is believed to have begun two centuries ago. The game was introduced at Thalassery by Englishmen of the East India Company. The presence of a number of Englishmen at Thalassery and military personnel in Kannur popularised the sporting event, especially cricket, over a period of time. It took many decades before the local people themselves formed the first club: Tellicherry Town Cricket Club.

Subsequently, cricket clubs also were established at Kannur and kick-started a competitive rivalry between the clubs in two neighbouring towns. The earliest mention of the game between Thalassery and Kannur was found in a newspaper report in 1890.

The Fort ground, no doubt, played a vital role in developing sporting culture in the area. The Cannanore Cricket Club, Brothers Club, Fort Cricket Club, and the Manor Club were the popular local clubs here. Thalassery also had many great players, of course. But there was no State team without at least a player from Kannur.

C.K. Lakshmanan, Sandy Aaron, P.V. Surendran, P.V. Diwakaran, A. Sathyendran, J.K. Mahendra, N.M. Amarnath, O.K. Ramdas, C.M. Ashok Sekhar, C.K. Ravi, C.K. Gopinath, P.V. Divakaran, and Ivan D’Cruz played for the State team. They were all from the clubs in Kannur town. According to old-timers, the Kota Maidan used to be open for practice every day. The clubs even brought well-known Indian and foreign coaches to train players. Local people who encouraged sports too kept the game going for long.

There could be many factors that led to the decline in cricketing culture in Kannur. The loss of the Kota Maidan to local players could well be one. The vast stretches of grounds that included the erstwhile Kota Maidan are part of the estate of the Army unit stationed here. Fenced and protected, they have long been out of bounds to local cricket and football players. With the shrinking of open grounds, many clubs have vanished, and some are fighting for survival.

Nostalgia apart, the Kota Maidan no longer serves to promote cricket or any other game today. The much longed-for rejuvenation of cricket in Kannur requires alternative facilities that can put the game back on a pedestal and revive the game’s glorious past here.

161,2020/02/18,Greens seek govt. intervention to stop felling of trees on estate,"Coffee plants too being rooted out flouting norms, they allege

Environmental organisations in the district have sought government intervention to foil attempts by a private coffee estate management to axe huge trees on the estate spread over nearly 500 acres on the Brahmagiri hills in Thirunelly grama panchayat in the district.

Addressing the media here on Monday, A. Shyjan, president, Brahmagiri Samrakshana Samiti, and N. Badusha, president, Wayanad Prakruthi Samrakshana Samiti, said the estate management had started marking trees to fell them.

The management is also constructing a helipad and digging a pond on the estate after felling coffee plants in the ecologically fragile area flouting all norms.

The estate was owned by a British family, and it was later handed over to others. However, the registration procedures are yet to be completed owing to legal constraints, they added.

Wildlife

Decades ago, the Forest Department had vested nearly 100 acres on the estate as per the Kerala Private Forests (Vesting and Assignment) Act, 1971.

It is also a major habitat of tiger, elephant, and beer. The felling of trees will not only affect wildlife but also several families in the area.

The estate management had temporarily halted attempts to root out coffee plants using excavators and fill nearly seven acres of marshy land near the forest area a few days ago on the intervention of the public and Revenue Department officials.

The ecologically sensitive hill with marshy lands is a major source of water for villagers on the hill slopes.

Since any attempt to fell trees in the area will adversely affect people, an immediate intervention from the State government is the need of the hour, the activists said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/greens-seek-govt-intervention-to-stop-felling-of-trees-on-estate/article30846077.ece

163,2020/02/18,Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker rejects privilege issue raised against Minister,"DMK legislator Thangam Thennarasu had sought to raise an issue of Assembly privilege in the House against Minister for Tamil Official Language Ma Foi K. Pandiarajan over a statement he made last month about dual citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils

The DMK on Tuesday sought to raise an issue of breach of privilege in the Legislative Assembly against Minister for Tamil Official Language Ma Foi K. Pandiarajan over a statement made by him in the House last month. But, after the Minister’s reply, Speaker P. Dhanapal concluded that there was no breach of privilege in the issue.

Soon after the Question Hour, the Speaker called upon DMK legislator Thangam Thennarasu (Thiruchuli), who had sought to raise an issue of Assembly privilege in the House against Mr. Pandiarajan.

Mr. Thennarasu said on January 8, the Minister had told the House that granting of dual citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils living in Tamil Nadu was possible, whereas the Union Home Minister had maintained in the Parliament that was it not possible. The DMK legislator charged that the Tamil Minister intentionally diverted the issue and misled the House by making a statement that was not true. Hence he urged the Speaker to take appropriate action against the Minister.

In his reply, Mr. Pandiarajan recalled the representation of then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa to the Centre seeking dual citizenship to Sri Lankan Tamils, contending only such an arrangement would help ensure that Sri Lankan Tamils had the possibility of claiming their property should they return to the Island.

Mr. Pandiarajan claimed that there were multiple interpretations of dual citizenship and that there was a possibility of Sri Lankan Tamils getting citizenship back home and also get Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) status in India. The Minister also pointed out that there was a difference between repatriates and refugees.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami too had urged the Union Home Minister to grant dual citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils, Mr. Pandiarajan recalled and went on to point out that former Chief Minister of Sri Lanka’s Northern Province Justice C.V. Wigneswaran and researcher Ilamparithi were supportive of the AIADMK government’s call for dual citizenship for Sri Lankan Tamils living in India.

After the Minister’s reply, the Speaker concluded that there was no breach of privilege in the issue. Objecting to the Speaker’s decision, DMK members led by their Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan staged a walk out. Later, they returned to the House and took part in the proceedings.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/va0qq8/article30851455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18FEBTH--ASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-assembly-speaker-rejects-privilege-issue-raised-against-minister/article30851456.ece

Minister P. Thangamani, who handles the portfolio for Prohibition, on Tuesday informed the Legislative Assembly that the government was committed to its policy of introducing liquor prohibition in a phased manner in Tamil Nadu.

The Minister made the statement in response to DMK legislator T. Mano Thangaraj (Padmanabhapuram), who raised the issue of prohibition. Mr. Thangamani said unlike the DMK, the AIADMK government believed in introducing phased prohibition.

To Mr. Thangaraj’s contention that the State government was increasingly dependent on revenue generated from liquor sales, Mr. Thangamani said under the AIADMK regime the business hours for TASMAC run liquor outlets have come down by two hours and 1,000 liquor shops were shut down on the orders of the Chief Minister.

Mr. Thangamani pointed out that even during the erstwhile DMK regime the revenue generated through liquor sales was high. Since the price of liquor had gone up since then, it was naturally reflecting high on the revenue generated, he contended.

165,2020/02/18,"This year, medical counselling in Tamil Nadu to have security features","Following last year’s NEET impersonation scam, officials this year are planning to take the thumb impressions of candidates and video the counselling sessions

After last year’s State medical admissions were rocked by cases of impersonation, the Directorate of Medical Education (DME) is all set to add security features to the medical counselling process this year.

Last year, investigations revealed that a few students secured admission to MBBS seats in government and private medical colleges by engaging impersonators for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET). The scam came to light in September, beginning with the case of a first-year MBBS student of Government Theni Medical College. The student had reportedly engaged an impersonator, who appeared for NEET in a centre outside Tamil Nadu, attended the medical counselling in the State and completed the admission process at the college. The CB-CID police that is investigating the case have so far arrested at least seven students and their parents.

This year, the DME is not taking any chances, an official said. “We are taking extra care this time. We want to check the genuineness of candidates and will be putting in place security measures at the counselling session that will be held by the Selection Committee. This will include facial identification, thumb impressions, latest photographs and Aadhaar card,” he said.

The counselling process will be videographed and the images of candidates will be captured and shared with medical colleges. CCTVs would be part of the security features to record the counselling process, officials said.

166,2020/02/18,Vaiko predicts ‘Manu Dharma’ meal scheme,"‘Scheme implemented by Kamaraj, MGR served as a model’

MDMK general secretary Vaiko on Monday criticised the Tamil Nadu government for roping in Akshaya Patra Foundation to implement the Kaalai Unnavu Thittam (Breakfast Scheme) in government schools alleging that the nutritious meal scheme would now become a ‘manu dharma meal scheme’.

In a statement, Mr Vaiko pointed out that the nutritious meal scheme implemented in Tamil Nadu from the days of former Chief Ministers Kamaraj and M.G. Ramachandran served as a model for the rest of the country. “ISKCON [which runs the Foundation] has been found to not use onion and garlic in their meals. In Tamil Nadu, eggs are provided as part of the nutritious meal scheme to students. But ISKCON will force them to eat vegetarian food. Developed countries even provide meat to students,” he said.

Mr. Vaiko alleged that the organisation would work against the interests of the food preferences of Tamilians.

The MDMK leader alleged alleged: “The government has given the scheme to a Hindutva group, the ISKCON foundation that runs the Hare Rama Hare Krishna organisation. The State government is not going to implement the scheme. They have given away 20,000 sq.ft of land on Greams Road and 35,000 sq.ft of land at Perambur Barracks to them. As on date, this land is worth Rs. 500 crore.”

He asked why no other organisation was given an opportunity to implement the scheme and why everything was being done in secrecy. He questioned how the Governor could provide Rs. 5 crore of government money to a private organisation and wondered if he had the powers to do that.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/5ye2c3/article30788005.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10FebDSJ02-WithG1I73K73M5jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nutritious-meal-scheme-will-become-manu-dharma-meal-scheme-vaiko/article30849557.ece
167,2020/02/18,"AIADMK, DMK spar over revenue deficit","The DMK on Monday warned the AIADMK government in the Assembly about the State’s rising revenue deficit. However, the government defended its record, arguing that the fiscal deficit and borrowing were “well within norms”.

Opening the debate on the Budget in the House, DMK legislator Palanivel Thiagarajan (Madurai Central) said the government’s spending on investments had reduced. He accused the government of maintaining “false prestige” by claiming that the fiscal deficit and borrowing were within norms.

Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who holds the Finance portfolio, said, “I have already given an explanation on this issue. You are raising this issue only because you are in another party.”

More borrowing

However, Mr. Thiagarajan disagreed and said the State government was borrowing more for revenue deficit than for investing in new projects. If the government borrowed for revenue deficit rather than investment, the growth rate would fall, he pointed out.

“You cannot take pride by saying ‘we have not failed’. You have to realise that we were earlier achieving distinction,” he said.

Mr. Panneerselvam said the borrowing had gone into investments during the erstwhile DMK regime too. Mr. Thiagarajan contended that though it was the AIADMK government which passed the Tamil Nadu Fiscal Responsibility Act, 2003, the party did not function in line with the Act.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-dmk-spar-over-revenue-deficit/article30846637.ece
168,2020/02/18,Property registration remains tepid,"Sharp fall in growth rate from 16.42% in 2018-19 to 2.5% this financial year

The revenue collected through stamps and registration of properties, which reflects the mood of the real-estate sector in the State, has witnessed tepid growth — around 2.5% — during the current financial year.

The fall in the rate of growth is perceptible when compared to what it was in the last two years. During 2017-18, the figure was 9.01%, and the following year, 16.42%.

In the first six months of the current year, the growth rate was on the negative side of about 2%. “Now, we are experiencing positive signals,” says an official in the Registration Department.

In terms of registration, around 21.38 lakh documents were registered during April 2019-January 2020 — 2.69% higher than the figure for the corresponding period last year. Likewise, the State has, so far, netted about ₹9,145 crore — 2.3% more than what it got last year.

As per revised estimates, the State government expects to get ₹13,123 crore in total for the current year. This means that in the months of February and March, the collection should be ₹3,977 crore, whereas it was around ₹2,134 crore in the last two months of the previous financial year.

The overall economic slowdown has been attributed to the sluggish growth rate. However, the situation may see a change for the better, according to officials and representatives of the sector.

Modest increase

To encourage voluntary compliance and enable both landlords and tenants to realise the full benefits of registration under the new Tenancy Act, the government has reduced the stamp duty for rental agreements for residential property for up to 5 years, from 1% to 0.25 %, and registration charges from 1% to 0.25 %, subject to a maximum of ₹5,000.

Though the quantum of the rise in revenue has not yet been estimated, there will be a modest increase at least, according to the officials in the Registration and Housing & Urban Development Departments.

S. Ramaprabhu, chairman, Southern Centre of the Builders’ Association of India, said the full impact of the simplification and fine-tuning of the Common Development and Building Rules, especially the increase in the average floor space index to 2, will be felt next year and will lead to a further increase in revenue.

Clearing hurdles

Besides, when the approval of applications for regularisation of unauthorised plots and layouts picks up further momentum, it will fetch more revenue.

As of now, around two lakh out of 8.35 lakh applications have been cleared, Mr. Ramaprabhu pointed out, adding that if the legal hurdles to the regularisation of unauthorised buildings were overcome, that will also yield more revenue to the government.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cbakex/article30846634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th18revenuecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/property-registration-remains-tepid/article30846635.ece

DMK Rajya Sabha member R.S. Bharathi has triggered a row by making disparaging remarks against the Scheduled Castes, Brahmins and television news channels.

At the event in question, Mr. Bharathi had said: “There is not a single Scheduled Caste judge in Madhya Pradesh. In Tamil Nadu, Kalaignar (former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi) first appointed S.

170,2020/02/18,"Incidents in Washermenpet were instigated, says CM","‘Muslim community should reject false propaganda and acts of miscreants’

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday alleged that “some forces deliberately instigated” the untoward incidents in Washermenpet in Chennai, where a group of Muslims had organised a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Friday last.

“Tamil Nadu has witnessed similar protests, demonstrations and rallies in the past, during which the police officers provided security and no untoward incidents were witnessed. This time, some forces had instigated the incidents,” he alleged in the Assembly while responding to DMK leader M.K. Stalin, who had raised the issue of police action against the protesters in Washermenpet.

Mr. Stalin, however, said the DMK was not satisfied with the CM’s reply, and led a walkout by his party’s MLAs. The Congress and other Opposition parties followed suit. The MLAs subsequently returned to the House to take part in the remainder of the proceedings.

Mr. Palaniswami said the Muslim community should reject “false propaganda” and “acts of miscreants” and cooperate with the government to maintain social harmony.

“The government of Amma (Jayalalithaa) will not allow anything that adversely affects minorities,” he said.

Pointing out that permission was sought on February 13 on behalf of 13 mosques to stage a protest against the CAA on February 23, the Chief Minister said that all of a sudden, 300 Muslims, including 200 women, assembled at the roundtana in Washermenpet and started raising slogans against the CAA, though they had earlier made it clear that they had no plans to stage a protest [on Friday, the 13th of February].

‘Defied advice’

“The police held talks with them and advised them not to protest as it would throw traffic out of gear. But they rejected the advice, raised slogans and resisted when the police tried to detain 40 persons. When the police put the detained persons in a bus, they smashed the windows of the vehicle,” he alleged.

The Chief Minister said the protest resumed at 6 p.m., following which a warning was issued as it was causing inconvenience to the public. “They were asked to disperse. But the protesters threw bottles, chappals and stones at the police. Rajamangalam Sub-Inspector Rajkumar and constables Udayakumari and Kala were injured. IPS officer Vijayakumari was hit by a stone,” he said.

Mr. Palaniswami said barricades were put up to prevent the protesters from causing damage to public property. But the protesters instigated the locals to push the barricades and the police. As many as 82 protesters were arrested as they broke the windows of the bus, the CM said.

He said the death of Fazurulla, an elderly man, due to natural causes, was distorted to give the impression that it was caused by police action, which led to further protests in Chennai and other areas.

Though an agreement was reached between the police and the leaders of various Muslim outfits, the protesters refused to disperse and continued to raise slogans, he added.

He said 150 persons had staged a protest on Monday, and the police had provided adequate protection to prevent any untoward incident.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/w8xhvi/article30846620.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18MUSLIMSPROTESTAGAINSTCABNRCNPRPOLICESHAHEENBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/incidents-in-washermenpet-were-instigated-says-cm/article30846621.ece
171,2020/02/18,Speaker rejects Stalin’s demand for resolution against CAA,"Dhanapal says as he has already rejected the proposal as per Rule 173 (e) and informed DMK leader

Speaker P. Dhanapal on Monday denied permission to the DMK to move a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the Assembly, as he had already rejected the proposal as per Rule 173 (e) of the Assembly Rules.

He was responding to Opposition leader M.K. Stalin, who wanted the House to take a cue from the States that had already adopted a resolution against the CAA.

When S. Austin (DMK) pointed out that the Rule 173 (e) would not be applicable since the issue was never taken up for discussion, the Speaker reiterated that he had the right to take a decision on the issue and that he had intimated the Opposition leader about his decision through a letter.

Hub of protests

Mr. Stalin said Tamil Nadu had become a hub of [anti-CAA] protests and the government must explain who was responsible for the police action against the women who took part in a protest “in a peaceful manner” in Chennai last Friday.

He said had the Chief Minister or his Cabinet colleagues held talks with the protesters, the problem could not have cropped up.

“I welcome the release of those who were arrested. But the government should withdraw cases against them.”

The DMK had sent to the President a memorandum with two crore signatures against the CAA, Mr. Stalin said.

The vital link road connecting the industrial town of Ranipet with Ponnai via Lalapet has been in a shambles for several months.

Motorists, particularly school bus operators, drive with constant fear that their vehicle may topple any time on the pothole-ridden road which connects BHEL-Ponnai Road and SIPCOT, Mukundarayapuram. The road provides connectivity to many smaller residential as well as commercial areas.

The failure of the authorities to undertake repairs of dilapidated road is taking a heavy toll on commuters, especially schoolchildren from Lalapet. The entry point of the road has been ruined due to continuous operation of heavy vehicles, including trucks transporting quarry dusts and sand, and industrial components.

Residents complained that with no elected representatives available at local body or block development office, the people were made to run after the Block Development Officers, who are neither helpful nor providing the satisfying replies to the persons approaching them with reasonable requests such as this one.

Passing the buck

V. Vagheesan, president of BHEL Ancillary Unit Association, submitted a petition at District Collector office which returned with a reply from State Highways department stating that the road not maintained by them. In his routine reply, the Block Development Officer of Walajah replied that efforts were on to hand over the maintenance of the road to State Highways Department.

Residents said that it remained a mystery why officials did not relay the road. A group of residents from Lalapet are planning to gherao the office of BDO in Walajah soon.

178,2020/02/18,Love Aaj Kal’s songs belong to a blockbuster,"Even as the film tanks at the box office, the soundtrack by Pritam is even better than that of Imtiaz Ali's 2009 original

Listening to the Love Aaj Kal soundtrack the first time without actually seeing the song titles, it was a pleasant surprise to hear the phrase, “Yeh Dooriyaan” pop up in the middle of one of the songs, accompanied by that mock-whistle hook. In a recreation-ravaged Bollywood scene, this was one repetition I didn’t mind. Firstly because, the phrase used, has an actual relationship with the director’s older film of the same name. And secondly owing to its tasteful execution, the composer has restricted the repeated phrase to the above-mentioned refrain. Of course, there’s the odd lyrical reference, like “aa raha paas main ya door main jaa raha” becoming a more affirmative “zyaada paas aana hai asal mein door jaana.”

Despite the tasteful execution, the song is still not a match for the original, despite positives like Mohit Chauhan sounding as good as he did ten years ago. There isn’t a lot happening in the main melody, a large chunk is made up of repeating bits, with the effect that the most memorable part of the song remains the part it borrows from the 2009 song. ‘Yeh Dooriyaan’ isn’t the only throwback song of the album – there is also ‘Haan Main Galat’, the ‘Twist’ redux built around that refrain it originally borrowed from the 1954 film Nagin. The latter is a more engaging number than ‘Yeh Dooriyaan’ – an aptly contemporised and equally groovy take on the piece.

There are repeats from the earlier soundtrack: KK who sang ‘Main Kya Hoon’ back then, gets an absolute belter here in ‘Aur Tanha’. The atmospheric sound with the pensive tune and rock-flavoured arrangement, along with the KK’s evergreen voice (why does he not get to sing more often?) evokes welcome memories of Pritam’s Life In a Metro. Also beautifully employed, are almost gospel choir-esque backing vocals that add to the song. Lyricist Irshad Kamil is in spectacular form with his writing, capturing love’s pain in vivid hues. The chorus comes into play in ‘Dhak Dhak’ as well – but in a more outlandish fashion, that along with the folk arrangement would make this song a great fit in Jagga Jasoos’s ‘Mombaka’. It definitely sits at odds with Love Aaj Kal’s dominant soundscape. ‘Parmeshwara’ (or parmesara as the singers pronounce it) is the final song in that category, led as it is by rapper Raftaar. The “anti-commitment” hip-hop piece sees some smart writing. But the number’s highlight is the title hook which is built on an aarti-style tune.

The rest of the soundtrack is Pritam showcasing his talent for immensely hummable melodic pieces or his love for alternate song versions. First up is ‘Shayad’ that sees Arijit Singh deliver in his dependable fashion, in both the original version and the more ambient ‘Reprise’. I like the first version better though, for its acoustic guitar-laden arrangement and the flute refrain, neither of which makes it to the other version. Singh is in finer form delivering ‘Rahogi Meri’ – but Pritam embellishes the tune with so much more in its second version titled ‘Haan Tum Ho’ (the esraj/sarangi in the first interlude is a fabulous touch), and the icing on the cake is Shilpa Rao joining Singh in the song’s second half with a lovely improvisational bit. The duo ends with a harmonised rendition of the opening verse. Darshan Raval and Antara Mitra lead ‘Mehrama’ for both its versions. The longer version consists of one added verse rendered by Raval. There is a repeating viola phrase (played by Shirish Malhotra) that deserves a mention, not for the playing brilliance, but for the way it contributes to the wistfulness and is likely to stay in your mind long after the song is done.

There is no question that the 2009 Love Aaj Kal soundtrack has aged wonderfully, and will always be counted among Pritam-Irshad Kamil’s best works. However, for sheer number of quality songs (and fewer Punjabi influences) in this album, I’d rate the new soundtrack higher. It remains to be seen how well , my verdict will stand the test of time. The song release pattern and the movie’s general performance are not likely to help its cause. It’s sad to see Imtiaz Ali gradually enter the league of the likes of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra and Shaad Ali whose movies get looked forward to purely for their music.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/rp79oe/article30852682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Love-Aaj-Kal-film-still-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/love-aaj-kals-songs-belong-to-a-blockbuster/article30852684.ece

Armaan Malik has not recovered yet from the Butta Bomma phenomenon. The song from the recently-released Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo became a sensational hit.

“Thaman and I knew that the song would do well, but to become a crossover national hit like this? Wow. Once the film released, it really catapulted the song’s popularity to another level,” he smiles, adding, “Now I have even people in North India singing the song to me. I think it’s all about the ‘happy feel’ the song gives and makes you want to keep listening to it.”

The 24-year-old is in Chennai to record for Harris Jayaraj, in what will be his return to Tamil cinema after a couple of years.

And the movie? No prizes for guessing, it is for Legend Saravana Stores owner Saravanan Arul’s debut movie. Armaan will be working with Harris Jayaraj and lyricist Pa Vijay for the yet-to-be-titled movie, which is directed by the director duo JD-Jerry. The movie stars Geethika Tiwary as the leading lady.

“I last worked with Anirudh for the Hindi version of Tharam Maara Single from Darbar and now I’m happy to be singing in Tamil again,” he says.

Having sung for over 13 years now, the singer’s repertoire spans across languages. Surely, it must have been hard on his part to understand the lyrics of his songs... “That’s true, but I have a special technique. First I write the lyrics in English and learn to pronounce them with my dots-and-hyphen system. Then I learn the composition from the music director,” says Armaan, on how he operates, “Finally, I understand the meaning behind each verse so I can get the different emotions right while signing. It’s a complicated process, but one that works”

Armaan says he is a linguistic enthusiast — a trait that only few singers admit. He adds that it has helped him sustain in the film industry: “Not many have done it earlier, and not many will do it in the future as well. That’s why the likes of Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghoshal are so respected. They have consistently proven themselves in so many languages.”

Observing that his voice has evolved over the years, Armaan says that he has managed to offer a “fresh feel” every time. “There’s a different pitch in my voice that doesn’t just come with age, but also with experience. All these go into the making of my voice. I think that’s why people are enjoying it,” he signs off.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/b1pjxx/article30851732.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Image1ArmaanMalikjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/armaan-malik-has-a-special-technique-to-learn-tamil-songs/article30851733.ece

She had to turn it down because the then 20-year-old had yet to graduate college, and Smruthi’s parents were dead against her pursuing a career in movies. Life, however, has a design of its own, and five years later, the film industry is where the journey took her. This time though, she says, with a broad smile, her parents had given up.

“They thought, ‘Okay, we cannot control this girl’. They were also confident that I could handle myself ,” she adds.

It may have been the same look of innocence that made filmmaker Magizh Thirumeni cast her as the demure Anandi, in last year’s hit film Thadam. A year on, she is wary of anyone using the word ‘innocent’ around her because of the stereotypical roles that it brings her way.

“I did not get a commercial film offer after Thadam. I am disappointed that people judge you based on the role. Even in the two other films I’m working on at the moment, I play an innocent girl,” she says.

Those two films are Theerpugal Virkapadum starring actor Sathyaraj in the lead, and the much anticipated film by RJ Balaji, Mookuthi Amman. Says Smruthi of her role in the latter, which has Nayanthara in the titular role, “It is one of the best teams I’ve worked with. This is definitely not an Amman film in the way you imagine. There is no good versus evil. It is a fun film, and I’m sure people are eager to watch Nayanthara play Amman.”

Moving up

Her desire to be a part of commercial movies does not mean she is okay being the “prop” in a film.

She wants to improve her craft, and though the roles she has taken up so far may not offer the screen time she desires, Smruthi chooses them because she gets to work with veterans like Sathyaraj and Urvashi (in Mookuthi Amman). It also helps that she has interacted with filmmakers of different calibre and style.

“Magizh sir would tell me everything about a character, breaking down things from top to bottom. Why the character is this way, and how she would react etc. With Balaji, it is all about reacting to what he or other characters in the film does. The first couple of days it was tough. Once I got the hang of the character, the reactions would come naturally,” she says.

Besides, working with the ‘Lady Superstar’ was a learning curve in itself.

“She (Nayanthara) is a perfectionist. She is never late to the sets and between changes, she works very quick. In front of the camera, she knows where her position ought to be. One cannot find a flaw in the way she works. For me, it is all about learning by looking at people [like her],” the actor adds.

Besides these two films, the actor also has Vanam with 8 Thottakkal fame Vetri in the lead.

The learning process extends beyond the screen as well. For someone finding her way around the Tamil film industry with no one to cast a guiding light, Smruthi admits that the proposition appears daunting.

“It is difficult. I make many mistakes and I don’t even realise until it blows up big. It is quite scary. You wouldn’t know how people judge you, and I, as a person, I’m quite open. I talk about things without constraints. In this industry, that is something you have to be careful about. I don’t know if I will ever learn to restrain myself, but it is a learning process,” she says.

When movies are not in her head, the actor’s mind is taken over by food.

“I love to go to restaurants and explore food. I am a big time foodie. I love Italian cuisine and pastries but now I’m on a no- sugar diet,” she says. On her Instagram, the actor posts pictures of her pet beagle, with whom she spends most of her time at home. “His name is Rowdy, and he acts just like one,” she adds.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/636xhs/article30851650.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPSmruthi-Venkat-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/nayanthara-is-a-perfectionist-smruthi-venkat-on-working-in-mookuthi-amman/article30851653.ece
181,2020/02/18,Preethi Asrani to debut in Telugu cinema with ‘Pressure Cooker’,"The Telugu comedy turns its lens on the pressure faced by students to live the American dream

Hyderabad has been home for the 19-year-old Sindhi girl from Gujarat, Preethi Asrani, for the last four years. She was eager to pursue a career in cinema even when she was in school and convinced her parents to send her to Hyderabad. Preethi is currently pursuing graduation at St Anns College for Women, Mehdipatnam. The first time she faced a camera was for a short film titled Fida when she was 16; then and later acted in the web series Social that also featured Rana Daggubati in a brief role. The comedy Pressure Cooker, releasing on February 21, will be her first major role in Telugu cinema.

In her sister’s footsteps

Preethi is grateful to her sister — actress Anju Asrani — who was instrumental in getting her a break in movies. She says, “My sister Anju is my inspiration. When I was five years old, I would visit Hyderabad and spend time on her sets. She has acted in 35 Telugu serials and a few films. When I was in VIII std, I decided to be an actress.” Preethi was actively involved in extra-curricular activities in schools. Her parents were concerned initially about her wanting to be in films, but she managed to convince them. Preethi portrayed the part of a blind girl in Fida and a cameo as the childhood role of the heroine in Malli Rava. “After Malli Rava I got many calls but I wanted to wait for a good script and production. It was then that I got the chance for Pressure Cooker,” she adds.

Director Sujoi had spotted Preethi in Malli Rava and felt that she would suit the character Anitha in Pressure Cooker. The directors Karampuri Brothers (Sujoi and Sushil) are debutants. The film’s trailer gives glimpses into the stress that students undergo to complete engineering and realise the American dream.

In the film, the hero Kishore (Sai Ronak) is expected by his father to head to the US.

Are parents portrayed as villains? Says Preethi, “Not really, parents too will know the intention with which the story is narrated.”

While the film team has been visiting colleges to promote the film, many students there shared similar stories of parents wanting them to go abroad, says Preethi. “In the film, I play a B.Tech student; my mother wants me to get married after the final year. However the main pressure is on hero to live up to his father’s dream.”

Talking about the film, Preethi discloses that Rahul Ramakrishna plays an important role, and Tanikella Bharani plays the neighbour whose sons are settled in America. The plot has been tried and tested, isn’t it? “We have had many USA-based stories, but this one focuses on students and their families,” she adds. Kishore faces not only pressure from his father but also from society, friends and girl friend, and to get the US Visa.

Preethi discloses that the film is a new age family entertainer and not targeted only at the youth. She explains, “If you are good at your work, there are enough opportunities here, but people (especially parents) fail to see that.”

Realistic tone

The dialogues have been kept realistic. The son is unable to tell his dad he doesn’t want to go to the U.S. A scene in the trailer shows the boy being made to learn the names of states in the US, not in India, as a child. Further, the father takes him to GRE classes, waits outside and drops him back; he does everything he can to help the son go abroad. The film is about unrealistic expectations of parents.

In the film, Anitha is an artist and an activist who feels that working in a multinational company is no big deal and it’s important to choose work that interests an individual. Preethi is looking forward to the film and reveals that she can speak good Telugu and has dubbed for her role.

182,2020/02/18,‘Catwoman’ Zoe Kravitz feels Robert Pattinson is perfect for the role of ‘The Batman’,"The actress plays Catwoman, which the likes of Anne Hathaway and Halle Berry have previously essayed, in Matt Reeves’ upcoming film

Zoe Kravitz, who is set to play Catwoman in Matt Reeves’ The Batman, says she is excited to work with Robert Pattinson as the actor perfectly suits the part of the DC superhero. Pattison was announced as the new Batman last year and his casting has been a topic of debate among fans. Kravitz said she is happy to have the British actor on board as her “partner in crime“.

“I’ve never worked with him before, but we’ve been together for the last few weeks. I had to camera test with him and now we’ve been training together and rehearsing together and he’s just a delightful person and such a wonderful, thoughtful actor. I think he’s perfect for the role and it’s going to be such an adventure. I’m excited to have him as my partner in crime and to be there to support each other, because it’s intense. It’s going to be a long shoot and there’s a lot of pressure, and I know he has my back and I have his,” Kravitz said in an interview with Variety.

Pattinson’s look as Batman was revealed last week, as Reeves shared the first camera test of the actor on Twitter.

The 33-year-old actor is taking on a part that was previously played by the likes of Michael Keaton, George Clooney, Christian Bale and Ben Affleck among others.

Joining him in the film are Paul Dano as The Riddler, Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon, Colin Farrell as Penguin and Peter Sarsgaard in a mystery role.

183,2020/02/18,"Rani Mukerji on ‘Hey Ram’: For his 'Aparna', Kamalji taught me to act without make-up","On the occasion of 20 years of ‘Hey Ram’, the actor recalls her shooting experience with Kamal Haasan, and the several invaluable lessons she learnt from him

Rani Mukerji has revealed what actor-politician Kamal Haasan said to her that made her more self-confident about her height and her brilliant skill-set as an actor.

Rani and Kamal’s critically acclaimed movie Hey Ram has completed 20 years of its release in the Hindi film industry. The Mardaani actress goes down memory lane and shared interesting life lessons that she learnt from the movie, directed by the southern superstar Kamal Haasan.

“Hey Ram has been one of my most major learning curves. Getting an opportunity to work with Kamal Haasan for me at that point in my career was something very special because I was always an admirer of his performance and his acting and here I was going to get directed by him. So, I think it was one of those opportunities that I didn’t want to let go and I remember going to Chennai for the shoot,” she said.

Rani says she loved every second of just being on the sets of Hey Ram.

“What I loved was the discipline of the entire shoot. There was a bell that used to ring for the take to start, there was a time given for make-up, there was a time given for hair which today is very normal in the way actor’s shoot,” she said.

Rani added: “Today, there is a shoot call, there is a call time, there is make-up time, there is hair time, there is costume time, but in Hey Ram that I actually saw a production house following every aspect of this and that was amazing. The first shot used to be taken at 6 am in the morning and pack up used to be at the time that the bell used to ring. They used to not go even one minute more than that time and even if there was a take left to be shot like even if we had rehearsed for the shot and the bell rang for pack up we would have to pick up that scene the next day, which for me was completely a new experience because of this work ethic and work discipline on a set.”

Kamal also gave Rani invaluable lessons in building self-confidence.

“I remember in those times, because I am quite short, I remember wearing these platform slippers and Kamalji looked at my slippers and said, ‘Wow, wow what are these!’ I said I was very comfortable walking in platform slippers, but, because my height is short. He said, ‘Are you crazy?, just wear flats. You are not to be measured by how tall you are but your achievements will measure who you are!’ I think that also stayed with me,” she said.

“From then on, I was confident about my height. To be an actor, you don’t necessarily need to be tall. Being an actor is about performing, is about acting and that is the biggest lesson I learnt from Kamalji.”

The 41-year-old actress was seen in no make up for the film, which was a huge learning for her.

“Getting to be directed by Kamalji, I think, I have learnt a lot from him. It was very, very, special. I remember the first day walking onto the set — Kamalji looked at me and said okay now you can go and wash your face and come back. I was like what is he saying, he was like, ‘Ya ya just go and wash your face and come back’ and I remember going back; as an artiste, you always have the insecurity of facing the camera without make-up.”

“I remember being slightly insecure about the fact that he was asking me to wash my face and I went back just removing some of it and I went back on set and he looked at me and said no, I need you to wash your face again. I said but I have washed, he said no you have not washed!”

“He said to go back and wash it as if you are leaving the set after pack-up, I said ok and I went back and actually removed all my make-up and I came to set completely stripped of it all. At that time, doing a film without make-up was unheard of. Kamal Ji came and he put the bindi on me and he told the makeup artist to just put little kajal in my eyes and then he said yes, ‘Now, my Aparna is ready.’”

Rani said that was the first time she “understood actresses or actors don’t need that much make-up”.

“You can actually do a film without make-up. It all depends on the lighting, the lenses the cameraman uses and I think I found a lot of confidence with the way Kamalji went through with his shoot,” she recalled.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/gu2afa/article30850384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hey-ram,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/rani-mukerji-on-hey-ram-for-his-aparna-kamalji-taught-me-to-act-without-make-up/article30850385.ece

186,2020/02/18,Dancer Sai Ronak makes his debut with Telugu film ‘Pressure Cooker’,"The actor talks about his dance studio in Hyderabad, and the freedom of movement

Pressure Cooker releasing this month has Begum Bazar boy Sai Ronak in the lead. His original name is Sai Kiran but since that is a common name, he changed it to Sai Ronak for the screen. He’s no rookie; in his engineering final year, he did Patashala, Kadali and Guppedantha Prema and took a break when none of the films worked.

“I’ve been into dance and martial arts since childhood and would train people from the time I was in Intermediate. I worked with many international artistes and established Hy Dance Studio in Madhapur with a troupe of 15 trained instructors. We are coming up with two more branches,” says Sai about his dance background.

He observes “When I started the studio, dance was not considered as a profession. I explored the dance scene in Mumbai and wanted to get that professionalism to Hyderabad as well.”

Actor Sai Ronak | Photo Credit: VIJAY RACCHA

Around 80% of trainees at Hy Dance are corporate peoplewho learn in different batches. Afternoons are devoted to personal training for celebrities. When he isn’t shooting, one finds him at the studio practising and upgrading with instructors.

Ask him the difference between dance instructors and choreographers and he explains that the latter have to focus on camera angles, have a grip on acting and story as well. Dance instructors focus on flexibility, body toning and dance exercises. Sai adds that Bollywood dancing is termed as free-style. ""We have instructors trained in hip hop and ballet at our institute. With time I will bring a new way of dancing in the industry.”

‘Secretly, we all love to dance’

Sai Ronak recalls working in Shaimak Dawar dance group as an instructor but quit within few months as he felt there was no freedom and one had to merely follow what was a fixed form. That was when he decided to start his own dance studio. He shares, “I want people to take up dance as a regular profession. A work out in a gym can drain you but dance and music will energise you. Secretly we all love to dance but most people are embarrassed because they have no knowledge. Those who can’t move their hands and legs have become consistent students for years now. We encourage people to dance and tell them it has a purpose. Zumba is for body toning and weight loss, contemporary dance is for core-strengthening and body-balancing. It gives flexibility. With hip hop, you get control over your body, there is grace and strengthening workout. Bollywood dancing is about grace and expressions. We ask people what they are looking for and what time they want to be trained and customise a package.”

Signing off he says, “None of the films I had worked in had a dance because all of them had concept oriented plots. I will not interfere if I were to dance in a film, will leave it to the choreographer. My next film after Pressure Cooker is a story by Suresh, who’s an associate of director Jayant Kripalani.""",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/b84r40/article30849504.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy18-pressure-cooker-still-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sai-ronak-on-his-telugu-film-debut-pressure-cooker/article30849507.ece
187,2020/02/18,"First Saudi film fest to give a push to cultural exchange, fledgling industry","Red Sea International Film Festival will be held in Jeddah Old Town from March 12 to 21; women’s rights, immigration are among the entry themes

The historic Red Sea International Film Festival, the first ever in Saudi Arabia, is set to take place at the UNESCO World Heritage site of Jeddah Old Town from March 12 to 21. Three-time Academy award-winning American filmmaker Oliver Stone, of Platoon, Wall Street, Born on the Fourth of July, JFK, Nixon, and Natural Born Killers fame, will head the competition jury. The other highlights include a special screening of Spike Lee’s Malcolm X, the first non-documentary film to be given permission to shoot in Mecca. It will be followed by a Masterclass with the famous filmmaker.

After premiering at Pingyao, winning multiple awards at MAMI in October 2019 and travelling to Berlinale this week, one of the most celebrated Indian indies, Prateek Vats’ black comedy on a monkey repeller, Eeb Allay Ooo, will be competing with 15 other feature films at the Saudi festival. There will be cash awards totalling $2,50,000. Apart from India, the participating countries include Angola, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Columbia, Egypt, France, Germany, Kosovo, Lebanon, Mongolia, Nigeria, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Spain and the United States.

The festival announced the programme details, competition lineup and industry initiatives of its first edition on Monday. Festival director Mahmoud Sabbagh and artistic director Hussain Currimbhoy from Saudi Arabia announced 107 films and shorts at a press conference on Monday. Mr. Sabbagh is well known for Barakah Meets Barakah, the country’s first film to premiere at Berlinale, while Mr. Currimbhoy has been a programmer at the Sundance Film Festival.

Cinema halls had been banned in Saudi Arabia since the early 1980s, and the first one came up after almost 35 years in April 2018 in Riyadh. The festival announced the opening of a new cinema complex with a 1,200-seat Coral theatre and four additional screens, one with 240 seats and the remaining three with 120 seats each.

‘Changing the Script’ is the festival’s theme. It aims to be a platform for “expression and discovery through film”, to “support and help in the growth of Saudi Arabia’s emerging film industry, inspire new audiences across the country, and contribute to a richer experience for Saudi Arabia’s changing society by encouraging a more open cultural exchange.”

Fittingly, the festival opens with a film on Saudi filmmaking: Faris Godus’ Shams al-Maaref (The Book of Sun). On the transformative impact of the internet, it is set in 2010, at the peak of the Saudi YouTube movement. A group of high school seniors and their teacher set out to produce a no-budget horror movie, “a wild adventure that will put their futures at risk”. The festival catalogue describes the film as “an insider’s look at the origins of cinema in Saudi Arabia and the energy that informs today’s scene.”

According to a festival press announcement, the advancement of women’s rights, the scourge of domestic violence, immigration and marginalised individuals are some of the focus areas in the competition entries. “We have a strong desire to push diversity, particularly in women’s position in public spaces, and for a more open society. The films present a strong look at what makes society function and the relationship between the individual, patriarchy and hegemony,” said Mr. Sabbagh.

No wonder then, one of the most looked-forward-to title in the New Saudi/New Cinema section is the ‘Untitled Omnibus Feature’, developed in partnership with Jeddah-based production house Cinepoetics Pictures. The portmanteau film has five Saudi women filmmakers helming the shorts: Hind Alfahhad, Jowaher Alamri, Noor Alameer, Sara Mesfer, and Fatima Al-Banawi. Award-winning Palestinian filmmaker Suha Arraf is the screenwriting supervisor for each of these.

Incidentally, in 2012, Haifaa Al Mansour became the first Saudi female filmmaker to direct one of the first Saudi Arabian feature films ever. Called ‘Wadjda’ after its protagonist, it was the first film ever to be filmed entirely in Saudi Arabia with an all-Saudi cast. A German/Saudi co-production, the film was produced with official permission and with support from the Saudi partner Rotana Studio. It was premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Keif as-Hal, released in 2006, is often billed as Saudi Arabia’s first film; however, it was shot in the United Arab Emirates, and the female lead was played by a Jordanian.

“We worked hard to ensure that the films being presented showcase Saudi Arabia’s emerging film industry, and encourage a more open cultural exchange. This isn’t just about exporting our stories; we are bringing different perspectives, new conversations into Saudi Arabia too,” said Mr. Sabbagh.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/i3g62z/article30846905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18bmRed-Sea-International-Film-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/first-saudi-film-fest-to-give-a-push-to-cultural-exchange-fledgling-industry/article30846906.ece

The State government has ordered an inquiry into allegations against beleaguered ex-registrar of Satavahana University U. Umesh Kumar relating to illegal continuation in the post, misuse of internal funds of the university and illegally staying in university guest house while getting house rent allowance (HRA).

The complaints against Mr. Umesh Kumar had been brought forth by the Association of Satavahana University Teachers (ASUT) and president of Lok Satta Udyama Samstha-Karimnagar unit.

Registrar replaced

The State government has sent back Mr Umesh Kumar to his parent organisation in Osmania University for the inquiry to take place smoothly.

T. Bharath has been appointed as the new Registrar of SU.

On Tuesday, an inquiry panel comprising former registrars of Kakatiya University and Ambedkar University, Jagannatha Swamy and Venkaiah, respectively, visited Satavahana University and examined all the financial records. They also recorded the statement of Lok Satta district president N. Srinivas, who said the complaint was made to avoid misuse of public exchequer and ensure transparency in administration.

He alleged that Mr. Umesh Kumar, who was on deputation from Osmania University, continued in the post without any valid leave and had contributed to several financial irregularities by misusing the internal funds. Mr Umesh Kumar had also illegally recruited security staff and other staff for his personal work, Mr. Srinivas claimed.

Referring to the complaint, the Lok Satta office-bearer also told the inquiry panel that Mr Umesh Kumar converted the university guest house into his personal residence for one-and-a-half years and also claimed HRA from the government at the same time.

There are also allegations of misuse of official vehicles and irregularities in fuel costs, he said and demanded that the inquiry committee conduct a special audit of the financial matters pertaining to his tenure in the university.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/a2pt5s/article30853847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18-SATAVAHANAUNIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/probe-into-alleged-irregularities-by-former-su-registrar-begins/article30853824.ece
190,2020/02/18,Vemulawada being spruced up for Mahasivarathri fete,"Three-day jatara to start tomorrow; focus on pilgrim comfort, sanitation

The Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy Devasthanam here, also known as ‘Dakshin Kashi’, is being decked up for the three-day Mahasivarathri Jatara from February 20 to 22.

Temple authorities are sprucing up the premises with new paintings, lights, floral decorations and setting up canopies to protect the devotees against the harsh sun. Temporary shelters are also being constructed for the pilgrims who would participate in the jagaran (staying awake the entire night) at the shrine.

The dharmagundam or holy tank has been replenished with fresh water and showers have been set up. The authorities are focussing on round-the-clock sanitation on the temple premises as well as in the entire town by deploying additional sanitation staff. Arrangements are also being made for drinking water at various locations.

For the first time, silk vastrams for the presiding deities, Lord Shiva and his consort Goddess Parvathi, would be presented by four Ministers — K.T. Rama Rao, Eatala Rajender, A. Indrakaran Reddy and Gangula Kamalakar along with local legislator Ch. Ramesh Babu on Mahasivarathri day (February 21). Invitations have already been handed out to the Ministers for their participation in the traditional rituals. In keeping with tradition, TTD authorities would also present silk vastrams to the deities on the occasion.

The temple town is also getting a facelift with the erection of welcome arches and lights. Adjoining temples of Sri Bheemeshwara, Baddi Pochamma and Laxminarasimha at Nampally hillocks are also being decked up. The special attraction for Mahasivarathri would be Sivaarchana, a devotional musical and cultural programme with 24-hour performance by various artistes for the entertainment of pilgrims participating in the jagaran.

The devasthanam authorities have roped in 30 persons for preparing 5 lakh laddus and 20 quintals of pulihora to be sold as prasadam. The authorities are expecting nearly 4 lakh devotees during the three-day festival. The regular 100-gram laddu is priced at ₹20 a piece, 500-gram laddu at ₹100 a piece while 250 grams pulihora will cost ₹15 per packet.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/liwf5x/article30853802.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18-VEMULA-KTR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/vemulawada-being-spruced-up-for-mahasivarathri-fete/article30853804.ece

192,2020/02/18,Student’s body surfaces in irrigation canal,"He was swept away while taking bath

The body of B Bhanuprakash, a B.Sc second year student of SR&BGNR Government Degree College, who was swept away in an irrigation canal here on Sunday, was found floating in the canal at Gopalapuram near here on Tuesday.

Bhanuprakash, an inmate of the post-matric hostel here, was washed away by strong undercurrents in the NSP canal when he ventured into the channel to take bath on Sunday afternoon, sources said. His friend, who accompanied him to the canal, too got trapped in the undercurrent, but managed to swim to safety, sources added.

Various student unions staged a rally here on Monday in protest against the alleged laxity of the officials concerned in tracing the missing student. The search operations were subsequently intensified following the intervention of the district authorities.

The body of Bhanuprakash was found floating in the canal by some local residents near Gopalapuram on Tuesday morning. The body was later fished out from the canal.

As the news spread, the relatives of the deceased as well as activists of the SFI and the PDSU squatted in front of the Collectorate demanding stern action against the errant staff of the hostel for their alleged lapses in supervision of the well-being of the hostel inmates and ‘delayed response’ to trace out the missing student.

The demonstrators demanded that the government order a detailed probe into the incident and sanction ₹ 20 lakh ex gratia to the bereaved family of the tribal student, who hailed from Adavimallela village in Penuballi mandal. Police dispersed the protesters by whisking them away from Dharna Chowk and shifted the body to the mortuary at the District Headquarters Hospital in the vicinity.

Later, a delegation of the district leaders of the SFI, the PDSU and the AISF met Additional Collector Madhusudhan at the Collectorate and presented a memorandum to him seeking government’s support to the impoverished family of the deceased.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/gpak2e/article30853690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19STUDNETS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/students-body-surfaces-in-irrigation-canal/article30853692.ece
193,2020/02/18,Employees’ bodies flayed for toeing government line,"Three years would be over before PRC recommendation is implemented: TPCC

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) has criticised the attitude of employees’ association leaders for maintaining silence on the inordinate delay in the implementation of First Pay Revision Commission in the State.

Official spokesperson of TPCC G. Harshavardhan Reddy, who is also the founder of Telangana Panchayat Raj Teachers Union, said in a statement on Tuesday that the PRC should have come into force from July 1, 2018 but the the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) government had been extending the deadline for submission of its report repeatedly harming the interests of 4 lakh employees and teachers and 3 lakh pensioners in the State.

He alleged that the leaders of associations such as TGOs, TNGOs, teachers unions had been biding time in praising the State government besides calendar and diary releases. He also criticised the MLCs elected from teachers and graduates constituencies including K. Janardhan Reddy, K. Raghotham Reddy, P. Rajeshwar Reddy and N. Ramachander Rao for keeping silent on the rights of employees, teachers and the unemployed youth.

The Congress leader sought to know why Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao was delaying the implementation of PRC by often claiming that Telangana was at the top of performance indicators in the country. He stated that the government had extended the term of PRC from the existing extension of February 24 to December 31.

Even in case the PRC submits its report in January next PRC implementation could begin from March and by that time three years of the five-year PRC period would be completed, he observed.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/employees-bodies-flayed-for-toeing-government-line/article30853661.ece
194,2020/02/18,BC bodies seek caste-wise enumeration in Census 2021,"Column not included in proforma recently released, says Krishnaiah

Representatives of 14 backward classes association led by National BC Welfare Association president R. Krishnaiah have requested the Centre to take up 2021 Census with caste-wise enumeration of people.

A delegation of the BC associations met Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy here on Tuesday and requested him to include the column on caste in the Census proforma as it was not there in the 31-column proforma released by the Home Ministry recently. The proforma on the nationwide Census to be taken up from March 1 next year had the columns on SC, ST, Hindu, Muslim and Christian communities but there was no column for BCs, they pointed out.

Explaining the significance of BC census Mr. Krishnaiah said although there were several schemes implemented by the Central and State governments for the development of BC communities in education, employment, political and economic sectors lack of proper data on the BC population was denying the due benefits to them. He cited examples of governments facing problems in allocation of welfare benefits to BC communities in the absence of their population data.

He reminded Mr. Kishan Reddy that as the Opposition party, BJP had demanded preparation of BC caste-wise population data in 2010 when the Congress was in power at the Centre. On August 1, 2018, a decision was taken to take up BC caste-wise enumeration in Census by the then Home Minister Rajnath Singh at a high-level meeting but sought to know why there was change in its stand on the issue after it had returned to power last year.

Leaders of other BC associations, including N. Venkatesh, A Ramkoti, T. Nandagopal, V. Ramakrishna, B. Krishna, D. Suresh, Ananthaiah, C. Rajender, R. Chandrashekhar Goud and others, comprised the delegation. They later stated that the Union Minister had assured them that he would arrange a meeting of the BC association with the Union Home Minister Amit Shah soon on the issue.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/4gajf6/article30853642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy19BC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bc-bodies-seek-caste-wise-enumeration-in-census-2021/article30853643.ece
195,2020/02/18,Elected representatives told to work for development of their urban bodies,"Do good, honest work, emerge as State leaders, CM tells them

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said it is the responsibility of elected representatives of urban local bodies to transform towns and cities in the State as the models for the country

The Chief Minister who addressed the newly elected mayors, chairpersons, councilors,ward members and corporators in the State level Municipal Conference held at the Pragathi Bhavan here on Tuesday spoke at length on their duties and responsibilities.

Lacing his speech with illustrations, the Chief Minister told the gathering on how public representatives should conduct themselves in public life.

If in the bygone colonial era politics had meant sacrifice and even laying down ones life, in independent India, one should be committed to national building activity. Those who understood this, would earn name and fame. “Power should not get into ones head and one should not aspire for unwarranted status,” he said reminding that only 140 out of 5 crore people have become mayors and chairpersons. “This is a stepping stone and it would depend only on you how much do you scale up,” he said.

Non-political

Cautioning them that power and position are akin to walking on a thin razor’s edge, he said one should not lose balance while discharging duties. People fought a relentless battle in the belief that they would be benefited if they got their own State.

Citing his own outlook, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said for him politics were only for fighting elections and he did not indulge in politics after that. The implementation of government programmes and schemes like Mission Kakatiya and Mission Bhagiratha in all villages without any discrimination and without any scope for politics was an example. The ruling party worked for all people. If a leader did his work with commitment and dedication, he would win faith and confidence of people and their total support. The newly elected people’s representatives of municipalities and corporations could emerge as leaders in the State in the coming days.

Giving advice to the heads of urban bodies, he said they should not make false promises and proper planning should precede any work or task for its execution. “Have less photo-ops and focus more on executing works,” he said.

No corruption

The term municipality became synonymous with drainage, dirt and garbage. Baldia became a second name for corruption and the common refrain among people was: “Baldia, Khaya, Peeya and Chaldiya” (Municipal staff came, ate, drank and left). He said to remove the bad reputation, transparent policies should be adapted and a non-corrupt system be in place.

A town’s progress should be based on proper planning and it should not be haphazard. “It is in your hands to change the face of towns and cities in the State to become the best in the country,” he remarked.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mk9xq8/article30853873.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy19pattanapragathi-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/elected-representatives-told-to-work-for-development-of-their-urban-bodies/article30853562.ece
196,2020/02/18,Bhongir MP wants trains to halt in his constituency,"Urges Union Railway Minister to sanction an RoB at Narketpally

Congress MP from Bhongir Komatireddy Venkat Reddy has requested Union Minister of Railways Piyush Goyal for halt of several trains at Ramannapet, Bhongir, Aler and Jangaon railway stations in his constituency. He also sought sanction of a road over bridge between Chityal and Srirampur railway station at Narketpally.

Mr. Reddy met the visiting Union Minister here on Tuesday and submitted two representations comprising his requests. Stating that public transport would improve in his constituency only with halt of several express trains passing through it, he requested halt of Satavahana, Konark, Padmavathi and Machilipatnam express trains at Bhongir. This would not only be helpful to the devotees planning to visit Yadadri temple but also be beneficial to the employees, students and traders.

He also sought extension of Falaknuma-Bhongir MEMU till Jangaon.

Further, the MP requested the Railway Minister to improve amenities in railway station and sanction an RoB between Chityal and Srirampur stations at Narketpally. He explained that a large number of people commuting between Munugode and Narketpally were facing inconvenience due to lack of RoB, which he said would also prevent accidents.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bhongir-mp-wants-trains-to-halt-in-his-constituency/article30853323.ece

The pensioners JAC and retired employees association requested the Chief Minister to consider grant of interim relief of at least 27 % on par with the government of neighbouring Andhra Pradesh with effect from July 1, 2018, the date from which the new pay scales were due. They recalled how the Chief Minister considered implementation of the PRC on various occasions and also the concessions granted to various sections in spite of the deep financial crisis the State was undergoing.

198,2020/02/18,State being pushed into a debt trap: CPI,"Debt burden has increased to a staggering ₹ 3.24 lakh crore, says Chada Venkat Reddy

Notwithstanding the oft-repeated claims of persons at the helm in the State on ‘Bangaru Telangana’, the State’s debt burden has increased to a staggering ₹ 3.24 lakh crore, alleged CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy.

“Pending bills to the contractors involved in execution of various projects and development works in the State reached a staggering ₹ 40,000 crore,” he said, alleging that the State was on the verge of falling into a debt trap.

Addressing the party’s district conference here on Tuesday, Mr Reddy lambasted the ruling TRS accusing it of solely focussing on winning every election by “hook or crook” without addressing the pressing issues facing farmers, labourers and other toiling masses. He alleged that the BJP-led Central government was playing havoc with lives of people by implementing “discriminatory and divisive” laws.

He called upon the party cadres to gear up for sustained mass movements to fight against the “anti-poor and pro-corporate” policies of both the State and Central governments. Other speakers underscored the need for unified mass struggles to safeguard the interests of working class from the onslaught of “big corporate entities”, backed by capitalist forces.

CPI senior leader Puvvada Nageswara Rao, State assistant secretary K Sambasiva Rao and others spoke.

199,2020/02/18,Railways hiked funds for TS ‘10 times’: Piyush Goyal,"Stone laid for new terminal at Cherlapalli

Indian Railways and Union government have enhanced funds for Telangana by “10 times” in the last five years for taking up or completing many railway works including new lines, trains, passenger amenities and others, said Union Railways & Industries Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday.

“The funds allocated in 2014-15 was ₹258 crore finalised by then UPA government whereas it is ₹2,602 crore in 2020-21 just for TS projects,” he asserted at the launch-cum-dedication ceremony of many works in TS and AP too at Secunderabad station among which was the foundation stone for the ₹250-crore new terminal station at Cherlapalli for the twin cities.

Mr. Goyal appeared piqued at TS Animal Husbandry Minister T. Srinivas Yadav urging the Indian Railways to “shed North India bias” and “also look at south India” for railway projects during his speech at the function earlier.

“What Mr. Yadav is talking was in the Congress-led United People’s Alliance (UPA) government era, I wish to present a few facts to him about how the Modi government has been allocating funds to the Telugu States without any discrimination,” he said and reeled out figures to buttress his assertion.

In the second year itself, the Centre had hiked budget allocation to ₹755 crore and was substantially increasing it “ setting up a new record.” About a dozen projects worth ₹10,000 crore have been cleared and these include doubling, tripling and electrification works.

About 158 km of new lines was completed during the last five years as againat 74 km in the previous five years (2009-14), 48 km of double lines was taken up as against ‘0’ earlier, 303 km of electrification was done when compared to 170 km previously. Also, during the NDA regime 22 new trains were introduced and 42 trains were extended, he pointed out.

Long pending Peddapalli-Kothapalli line of 178 km cleared in 93-94 was taken up with 95 km work done in recent past. Silimarly, lot of importance is being given to connecting AP projects in SCR like the ₹2,480-crore Guntur-Bibinagar and the Dhone-Mahabubnagar-Akola line.

Much to Mr.Yadav's discomfort, Mr. Goyal said the Centre would not be found wanting in releasing funds for any railway project but the onus was on States like TS to expedite land acquisitions, right of way and allot funds in joint venture projects.

In this context, he urged the Minister to ensure that the TS government fulfil its contractual obligation and provide ₹450 crore for completion of MMTS phase III as the railways had already spent about ₹500 crore and also ensure the work between Sanatnagar-Moula Ali section is cleared to “complete the project”.

Union Minister of State for Home, G. Kishan Reddy, appealed for early completion of MMTS Phase II and extension of railway line up to Yadadri., improve amenities in the existing stations of Hyderabad, Secunderabad and Kacheguda and halt trains at Cherlapalli. TS BJP president K. Laxman and SCR GM Gajanan Mallya also spoke.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/railways-hiked-funds-for-ts-10-times-piyush-goyal/article30853258.ece
200,2020/02/18,Gajwel development model impresses VIP visitors,"Ministers, civic body chiefs and officials get a guided tour in CM’s constituency

It was a general feeling of awe and surprise among the visitors at the facilities at the vegetable and non-vegetable integrated market, urban park, forest rejuvenation centre and Vaikuntha Dhamam in this constituency headquarters town being represented by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. All the visitors expressed amazement at the way they were planned and executed.

A team of Ministers, MLAs, municipal chairpersons, collectors, additional collectors and scores of other officials reached here on Tuesday to see and get a first hand experience of the development in the CM’s constituency.

The team which came in more than 12 buses and other vehicles was led by Finance Minister T. Harish Rao. The other ministers included E. Rajender, Puvvada Ajay Kumar, A. Indrakaran Reddy, Satyavathi Rathod, Gangula Kamalakar, Jagadeeswar Reddy and Prashanth Reddy, among others. They were welcomed by Mr. Harish Rao with cotton saris and dhotis.

At the integrated market the ministers and officials interacted with farmers and vegetable vendors.

Good facilities

“We are happy that we have been provided with a permanent shelter and will be protected from rain and sun. We are selling vegetables for the past two months from here. However, people of the town are yet to get accustomed to buying vegetables from this market. Some days we are unable to sell even ₹ 400 worth of vegetables,” a vegetable vendor, S. Lakshmamma, told an MLA who interacted with her. She hoped that situation will change for better as people start patronising the market.

Another vendor pointed out that some days they were barely earning enough to pay the interest on the amount borrowed to buy vegetables.

However, the vendors admitted that two months is too short a time to judge and said they would have to wait for a few more months to see the results.

Inaugurated by CM

The integrated market was constructed at a cost of ₹ 22.85 crore and inaugurated by Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao on December 11th, 2019.

The Hindu cremation grounds Vaikuntha Dhamam was built at a cost of ₹ 2 crore with all facilities for conducting the funeral rites.

“We also can replicate the model of Gajwel provided funds are released by the government,” commented an MLA on condition of anonymity.

Minister for Tribal Welfare Satyavathi Rathod told Mr. Harish Rao: “While being Marketing Minister you took up the development work. Now being Finance Minister sanction the funds and we will all follow the Gajwel path.”",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/chw855/article30853084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19SIDDIPET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/gajwel-development-model-impresses-vip-visitors/article30853085.ece
201,2020/02/18,Government extends tenure of PRC to December 31,"Additional terms of reference given by government reported to be reason

The State government extended the term of the Pay Revision Commission headed by retired bureaucrat C.R. Biswal till December 31.

Chief Secretary SomeshKumar issued orders to this effect onMonday claiming that the term of the commission, the first to be constituted after the formation of Telanganahad been extended with the concurrence of the Finance department. The order quoted a letter addressed by the PRC Chairman that was taken intoconsideration while extending the term of the pay panel.

Study completed

Though the Commission is reported to have completed its study relating to the pay related aspects for different classes of employees, it could not submit its recommendations as the government had given additional terms of reference from time to time. The Commission was given more than two extensions since its constitution on May 24, 2018 and the term of the PRC is coming to close on February 24.

The Commission held elaborate discussions with all stakeholders, including the employees unions, government officials, especially those of the Finance department, for finalizing its report on the pay revision. It is reportedly in favour of recommending more than one option relating to the quantum of fitment benefit that should be given to employees.

Pay scales elsewhere

The Commission had also examined threadbare the pay scales that were being implemented in different States, especially the southern States as well as those like Maharashtra where the details were available online. However, the government in the meantime gave additional terms of reference more than once to the PRC entrusting it with new responsibilities.

These included study of existing business rules and staffing pattern at the district and mandal levels as the government wanted recommendations on this aspect for more clarity and expeditiousness in the decision making process. The commission members obtained staff related information from the grass root level and also utilized the data of staffing pattern posted on the Finance department’s portal for their study on business rules and related issues.

Retirement age

Even as the commission was about to complete its exercise, the government earlier this month entrusted it with the new responsibility of examining the proposal to enhance the age of superannuation and the finer aspects relating to financial implications involved in it. “We are being given new terms of reference every time the study is on the verge of completion,” a senior official told The Hindu adding the February first week’s additional ToR were third in the series.

Therefore, the commission had sought more time for conducting a detailed examination of the issues before finalizing its report. “A request has been sent to the government for extending the tenure till December this year,” the official said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/prc-seeking-extension-of-tenure-to-submit-its-report/article30852277.ece

Slamming the move to adopt an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act resolution in the Telangana Assembly, Union Minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday said the issue should not be politicised on “petty political grounds” and asked the State government to drop it.

The attack comes a day after the State Cabinet headed by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao decided to pass a resolution in the Assembly against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), while urging the Centre to repeal last year’s changes in the law.

Also Read Cabinet resolution against CAA is ridiculous: Laxman

“...in a federal structure, the States have to implement the national laws and I would urge the the government of Telangana not to politicise this issue on petty political or appeasement grounds,” the Railway Minister told the media here.

He said the State government should withdraw its decision to table the resolution.

The Union Minister said he felt happy when Telangana Minister K.T. Rama Rao, son of Chandrasekhar Rao, recently spoke at an event in Delhi about the Centre and the State working together.

“But, here, a baseless proposal was passed in the Cabinet on February 16. I would like the State government to withdraw it,” he said.

The Cabinet meet felt that the CAA would lead to discrimination on the basis of religion in the granting of citizenship and jeopardise the idea of secularism envisaged in the Constitution.

According to Gummadidala Sub- Inspector S.

206,2020/02/18,A prachara ratham for Bhadradri temple in the works,"The motorised chariot is being assembled in Hyderabad at a cost of ₹35 lakh

The historic Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple in Bhadrachalam will soon get a new ‘prachara ratham’ (motorised chariot) to propagate its glorious history and architectural grandeur.

The new prachara ratham is being presently assembled at a workshop in Hyderabad at an estimated cost of ₹35 lakh, sources said.

Bus being converted

A bus is being converted into a motorised chariot to resemble the renowned Bhadradri temple. In the front, it will have an intricately carved sculpture of illustrious saint composer Bhakta Ramadasu (Kancharla Gopanna), the then local Tahsildar, who built the temple dedicated to Lord Rama in the 17th century.

The front portion will depict an intricate art work of ‘gopuram’ while the rear side will resemble a kalyana mandapam-like structure, temple sources said.

It will have a separate enclosure to carry the processional idols of Lord Rama, the presiding deity of the historic Bhadradri temple, and his consort Sita. It will be deployed to Agency areas and elsewhere in the district to propagate the history of the famous shrine and its traditions including major annual religious events associated with Sitarama Navami, Mukkoti (Vaikunta) Ekadasi and Pokala Dammakka Utsavam.

Induction next month

Temple authorities are planning to induct the new prachara ratham in the service of the temple deity during the ensuing Srirama Navami Tiru Kalyana Brahmotsavam celebrations slated to begin on March 25. It is scheduled to be held in the temple town on the occasion of Srirama Navami festival on April 2.

Old ratham defunct

The move to make the new prachara ratham was necessitated as the old one has remained ‘defunct’ ever since it met with a road accident in an interior tribal area of Bhadrachalam Agency, resulting in the death of its driver in July 2014.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/9kjaxg/article30846583.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy17Kothagudem-Prachara-Ratham,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/a-prachara-ratham-for-bhadradri-temple-in-the-works/article30846572.ece
207,2020/02/18,There is more passion when there is a rivalry: Daley Thompson,"They may be good friends now, but at their peak in the eighties, decathletes Daley Thompson and Jurgen Hingsen appeared to be at each other’s throats at the majors. Their rivalry — like Sebastian Coe’s middle distance battles with Steve Ovett and Carl Lewis’ sprint face-offs with Ben Johnson — lit up athletics, made fans sit up and follow it closely.

With Usain Bolt off the stage, athletics desperately needs such rivalry but that’s missing these days.

“In my opinion, people who are technically excellent and very good and are world record holders, I think they are the best. But I think there is more passion to be found when there is a rivalry. Where there is somebody else equally good, then I think it is best for the sport, any sport. I think people really like to take sides,” said two-time Olympic champion Thompson in a chat with The Hindu on the sidelines of the 20th Laureus World Sports Awards celebration here.

Wearing a mask

So, what’s holding back such memorable rivalry now?

“I think a lot of it stands on luck and timing, I don’t think we can force these things. But I do think that when you have them, you have to make the most of it. Because it is just one of those coincidences, sometimes you might have three or four, then nothing for 20 years,” said the 61-year-old former world record holder and one of athletics’ most colourful characters ever.

“I think nowadays people don’t find it easy to be themselves because everybody wants to have ‘friends’ on social media and everybody, kind of, doesn’t want to upset anybody.”

Shoes controversy not over

If the spate of world records in recent times are any indication, the new AlphaFly and VaporFly shoes appear to have given athletes a huge advantage and some are even calling it ‘technological doping’. And there is a feeling that World Athletics’ new restrictions are not enough.

“There is nothing wrong with development but I think if the most important thing about winning a gold medal is what shoes you wear, then we are doing the wrong things,” explained the Brit, the 1980 and 1984 Olympic gold medallist.

“I think the governing body needs to act and try to be fair to as many people as they can. And I think the situation at the moment is not finished. It kind of goes against the spirit of it. Of all sports, the most basic sport in the world is running. And so, they need to sort it properly.”

Thompson also felt that the doping issue needs to be handled more strictly.

“I do think you can make it much more difficult for cheats. And at the moment, it is not difficult enough.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/eodkx6/article30854252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19THOMPSON,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/there-is-more-passion-when-there-is-a-rivalry-daley-thompson/article30854253.ece
208,2020/02/18,"A reminder of the magic sport brings to our lives, says Tendulkar","Tendulkar dedicates Laureus award to all champion athletes who have inspired youngsters

The other day Onkar Singh, a journalist with Deutsche Welle in Bonn, spoke about how football changed people’s lives in Germany.

“Whenever there is a major football competition, the Germans are all happy. And when Germany won the FIFA World Cup, people were so happy that they were even hugging strangers in the street,” said Onkar, who was at the 20th Laureus World Sports Awards function here.

When Sachin Tendulkar won the Laureus Sporting Moment of the last 20 years at the Verti Music Hall here on Monday, he spoke about a similar feeling, how it unites his countrymen back home.

“This is a reminder of how powerful sport is and what magic it does to all our lives. We experience the power of sport and even now, as I watch this film (about India’s 2011 ICC World Cup triumph and how his teammates carried him around the stadium), it is really amazing. It is an incredible feeling, something beyond words,” said Tendulkar.

Everybody who had come for the Laureus ceremony, especially the Germans, clearly understood the feeling. The Laureus Sporting Moment 2000-2020 was decided through an online voting system open to the public and with India’s huge population and Tendulkar’s massive popularity back home, it was clear that the Master Blaster would be the big favourite.

“I’d like to thank the Laureus Academy members and also for the people who voted and felt that the moment (aptly titled, ‘Carried on the shoulders of a nation’) that we saw on the screen, was worth voting for,” said Tendulkar. “There is a tricolour in my hand in the image, this was obviously the proudest moment of my life. I had waited for this trophy for 22 but I never gave up, I never lost hope. I was merely lifting that trophy on behalf of my countrymen and India. I couldn’t have asked for anything more.”

Tendulkar saluted Laureus for its impressive work to change people’s lives.

“With everyone celebrating Laureus’ 20th anniversary, it’s incredible what the Academy has been able to achieve in the last 20 years, how much it has impacted so many lives through various mediums for gender equality, education etc.”

He also spoke about the moment he met Nelson Mandela.

“I had the honour of meeting the great man Nelson Mandela when I was only 19. His hardship did not affect his leadership. Out of the many big messages that he left behind, the most important I felt was that sport has the power to unify everyone,” said Tendulkar.

“Today, sitting in this room with so many greats, some of them did not have the best of everything but they gave the best of everything they had and have gone on to become champion athletes. I want to thank all of them for inspiring youngsters to pick up a sport of their choice and chase their dreams.

“I feel this trophy belongs to all of us for having inspired youngsters and it’s not just about me.”

The Laureus Award winners:

World Sportsman of the Year: Lewis Hamilton and Lionel Messi; World Sportswoman of the Year: Simone Biles.

World Team of the Year: South Africa Men’s Rugby Team; World Breakthrough of the Year: Egan Bernal.

The victory could not have been more historic, as it was India’s first World Cup win on home soil and its second ever.

Sensational tie

Six-time Formula One World champion Hamilton and six-time FIFA World Player of the Year Messi were so close in terms of their achievements in 2019 that even the ultimate sporting jury, the Laureus World Sports Academy, could not split them, with the voting being tied for the very first time in the 20-year history of the Laureus Awards.

The duo pipped golfing great Tiger Woods, Kenyan marathoner Eliud Kipchoge, tennis legend Rafael Nadal and MotoGP champion Marc Marquez to the award.

The 2019 Rugby World Cup winner South Africa won its second Laureus World Team of the Year Award, beating Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool and the US women’s football team, among others.

The memory of Siya Kolisi, South Africa’s historic first black Test rugby captain, lifting the Webb Ellis Trophy in Yokohama, was an iconic moment in sport. The team’s victory united communities back in South Africa, and was proof of sport’s ability to change the world. The winners were revealed as sportsperson gathered together to be part of the most important annual awards ceremony, this year celebrating the 20th anniversary of Laureus.

The event was hosted by actor Hugh Grant and the legends of sport, past and present, were treated to entertainment from British singer-songwriter Liam Payne, former member of One Direction. A tribute was paid to American basketball legend Kobe Bryant, who recently died in a helicopter crash.

Biles wins it

American gymnast Simone Biles confirmed her place in the history of Laureus, winning her third coveted Laureus Sportswoman of the Year Award as she continued to push the boundaries of the sport.

She beat American footballer Megan Rapinoe, Japanese tennis sensation Naomi Osaka, American track and field athlete Allyson Felix and skier Mikaela Shiffrin.

210,2020/02/18,This tiny shop in Kolkata has iconic paintings rest casually along its walls,"Up close and personal with legendary artists at this frame shop in the Salt Lake City branch of Chemould

How often do you get to look at — even touch and feel — a Jamini Roy or a Nandalal Bose or an S.H. Raza, as if you were browsing in a supermarket?

At the Salt Lake City branch of Chemould, the famed framemakers in Kolkata, you can. Works of several legends rest casually on the walls of this tiny shop, as if they're recently-framed pictures waiting to be collected by customers. You realise their value only when you ask for the price and subsequently look at the signature.

“It is no fun admiring creations of great artists from a distance. You should be able to get intimate with them. Only then you can appreciate art,” says Arnab Chakraverty, 42, whose family is in the business of importing frames. They bought over Chemould — started in Park Street in 1941 by celebrated art patron Keku Gandhi — in 2008.

In 2011 they revived the art gallery that Chemould had once been known for, and on Valentine’s Day in 2014 Chakraverty opened a branch in FE Block of Salt Lake City. “My wife Deblina is an artist herself; she had won the President’s Medal when she was barely 13. After I got married I began to appreciate art. Today I have works of almost all the big artists you can think of: M.F. Husain, Jamini Roy, Nandalal Bose, Bikash Bhattacharya, F.N. Souza (in picture in his left hand), Ganesh Pyne, V.S. Gaitonde, Abdur Rahman Chughtai, Gopal Ghose and many more,” says Chakraverty.

Works of Husain, which command the highest price, about ₹40 lakhs each, are not displayed in the shop, but those of most others are, including one by Nicholas Roerich (in picture in his right hand). Chakraverty’s collection includes mica paintings (the oldest dates back to 1830), and also Kalighat and Dutch Bengal art.

“Earlier I hardly had people coming into the shop, but now there is some awareness. I am even getting a few customers,” says Chakraverty. Each work of art comes with the certificate of provenance and authenticity, which specifies where it was sourced from. “No one would spend ₹30 or 40 lakh — that’s the cost of a small apartment — on a painting whose authenticity they are not sure of,” he says.

He recalls an incident from 2018, when he sold two works of artist Ram Kumar to a customer from Jamshedpur. “Someone later told the customer that the paintings may not be genuine. I told him that he was free to return them, but he liked them so much that he didn’t want to part with them and took them to Ram Kumar himself, who was 94 at the time, for verification. Ram Kumar had told him the works were indeed his. Then, exactly three days later, the artist died.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/eshf49/article30849967.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG3682-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/this-tiny-shop-in-kolkata-has-iconic-paintings-rest-casually-along-its-walls/article30849968.ece
211,2020/02/18,Donald Trump visit to Ahmedabad | Kerala social worker Aswathy Jwala launches hunger strike against wall ‘to hide slums’,"600-metre wall apparently to hide slums from U.S. President Donald Trump’s sight.

Kerala’s leading social worker Aswathy Jwala, who founded the Jwala Foundation that provides food and shelter to the displaced and the elderly, has launched her hunger strike at the Sharaniyavas slum where the Ahmedabad civic body has built a 600-metre wall apparently to hide slums from U.S. President Donald Trump’s sight during his Ahmedabad visit on February 24.

“I read in the newspapers that the Gujarat government has built a wall to hide the slum. I was shocked about this and decided to come and meet the slumdwellers and support them with my hunger strike,” she told The Hindu on Tuesday.

“I met and talked to these people and learnt that they are scared by the police so I am here to support them. What the government is doing is nothing short of atrocity against slumdwellers,” she added while going on the hunger strike in a tiny corner of the newly built wall.

She demanded that all these people living in the slums for decades must be rehabilitated with proper housing by the government.

“The Gujarat government and its agencies are spending approximately ₹80 crore to beautify the city ahead of the U.S. President’s visit. In the name of beautification, they have constructed this wall to hide slums,” she added, slamming the authorities for coming up with the idea.

Asked what brought her all the way from Thiruvananthpuram to Ahmedabad, she said ‘humanity’ and added that “instead of hiding slums, the authorities and governments should work to make the country better. “Why not work to eradicate poverty so that there are no slums instead of hiding slums,” she asked.

The wall has been built by the civic body to ensure that President Trump does not have any glimpse of around 800 slum houses dotting the main road from the airport to the Indira Bridge from where his convoy will likely pass by.

213,2020/02/18,Road rage: SP leader’s son shot dead,"Collision between motorcycles led to stone pelting, firing

A Samajwadi Party leader’s son was shot dead during a violent clash that broke out here after a “road rage” incident involving them and a local BJP politician’s son, police said on Tuesday.

They said 20-year-old Sachin, son of a district-level SP leader Puranmal Prajapati, was killed on Monday night in Palasahibabad locality in Sasni Gate area as the argument following the collision between two motorcycles led to stone pelting and firing.

At least six people, including the deceased’s younger brother and a policeman, were injured in the clash, the police said.

They said the incident happened when Prajapati and his another son — Narendra — were going to attend a function related to backward classes.

They were on a motorcycle which collided with the two-wheeler of Amit, son of Ishwar Chand Upadhyay, a BJP leader who was previously an office-bearer in the party’s district unit, the police said.

The incident led to a heated argument between them which escalated into stone-pelting and gunshot firing as the two sides were joined by their supporters, the police said, adding the mob set Amit’s motorcycle ablaze.

Sachin also arrived at the scene and was hit by a bullet, they said, adding he died at a hospital later.

Three arrested

Three people have been arrested but the main suspects have managed to escape, they said.

SP (Crime) Arvind Kumar said it was a case of “road rage”.

214,2020/02/18,Punjab govt. sanctions 650 cr. for rejuvenation of Sutlej tributary,"Highly polluted Buddah Nullah passes through Ludhiana

The Punjab Cabinet on Tuesday approved ₹650 crore in the first phase for rejuvenation of the highly polluting Buddah Nullah — a seasonal tributary of Sutlej in Ludhiana.

“Under this ambitious plan, an additional sewage treatment plant having a capacity of 275 MLD, including associated infrastructure, would be developed which would go a long way in solving the problems of Buddah Nullah and subsequent pollution of the river Satluj,” said an official statement.

The Cabinet meeting, which was held here, also decided to levy 1% additional stamp duty on registration of sale-purchase of urban properties to finance water supply and environment improvement programmes in the urban areas of the State.

Notably, the pollution in the Buddah Nullah is a major threat to public health and environment and the main sources of pollution in the nullah are direct flow of pollutants by industries and dairies. Also, treated effluents from existing STPs, based on UASB technology, does not meet the required quality and overflow from sewer lines add to the problem.

215,2020/02/18,"U.P. budget anti-farmer and corporate-friendly, says BKU","‘It seems government’s focus is on building expressways’

The Bhartiya Kisan Union has described the Uttar Pradesh budget as “old wine in a new bottle” for farmers. “It is anti-farmer and corporate-friendly,” said Dharmendra Malik, senior BKU leader and spokesperson.

“Around 70% of the State’s population earns its livelihood through agriculture so we expected the State government to spend 30% of the budget on the upliftment of farmers and rural areas. But, it seems, the government’s focus is on building expressways,” he said.

The past experience of expressways, he said, didn’t prove beneficial to farmers. “Governments acquire the land, pay the compensation and move on. They neither invest in the skill development of the farmer nor do they develop agriculture-based industries on both sides of expressways. With no agricultural land left, the farmer has nowhere to go once he spends the compensation money. The State government doesn’t guarantee a job as part of the resettlement either.”

Sugarcane price

Mr Malik further criticised the government for not increasing the State advised price of sugarcane.

“We are demanding ₹400 per quintal because the input costs have increased but it continues at ₹315 for the common variety of sugarcane,” he said.

He also questioned the expansion of sugar mills that were announced in the budget. “It is limited to a few mills. A number of mills are still crying for attention, like the Satha Sugar Mill in Aligarh and Morna Mill in Muzaffarnagar.”

‘No outlay increase’

Mr Malik said no substantial increase in the outlay for fisheries, animal husbandry and horticulture meant the farmer could not diversify to add to his income.

Rajendra Yadav, state president of Bhartiya Kisan Sangathan said the budget failed to meet the expectations of the farmers.

“The government hasn’t come up with any concrete solution to the problem of stray cattle. The government scheme of paying ₹30 a day to tend the stray cattle is not viable. It should be increased to ₹100,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/up-budget-anti-farmer-and-corporate-friendly-says-bku/article30854348.ece

With the budget session of the Haryana Assembly slated to start on February 20, the principal Opposition party, the Congress, is all set to corner the ruling BJP-JJP government over the State’s “poor economic health, unemployment, corruption, farmers’ distress and deteriorating law and order situation”.

The ruling BJP-JJP alliance government, led by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, on the other hand, is all set to take on the Opposition with its achievements during the past 100 days in power, claiming that the government has provided people a clean, transparent and corruption-free administration.

Among others, increasing the old age allowance and other social security pension from ₹2,000 per month to ₹2,250 per month and deciding to ensure 75% reservation to unskilled labourers from Haryana in industries, are key accomplishments that the State government is claiming to have achieved.

The budget session will start with the Governor’s address on February 20.

‘Mountain of debt’

Former Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Haryana Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda told The Hindu that the party would forcefully raise issues pertaining to the worsening economic situation in the State, where the debt has increased from ₹61,000 crore to ₹1.81 lakh crore under the BJP regime.

“The mountain of debt is continuously rising, the government should present a White Paper on the debt situation,” he said.

Mr. Hooda said rising unemployment, corruption, deteriorating law and order situation and farmers’ plight were other important issues that the party intends to raise in the House.

“The unemployment rate under the Congress regime was at 2.8%, which has gone up by 10 times to 28% under the present government. Where is the unemployment allowance they (BJP-JJP) promised to pay?,” quipped Mr. Hooda, adding that Haryana, which was was once leading the nation in per capita income and per capita investment has now seen 18% decline in rural consumption under the BJP regime.

“Rampant corruption, farmers distress and deteriorating situation of law and order will also be raised. We will bring calling attention motions on different issue,” Mr. Hooda said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1onkeu/article30854328.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE18-HOODA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cong-set-to-corner-haryana-govt/article30854329.ece
218,2020/02/18,"Not angry with Scindia, says CM Kamal Nath","Cong. leader had threatened stir over poll promises issue

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Tuesday said how he could be angry with Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia if he couldn’t be angry with Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the BJP vice-president and former Chief Minister of the State.

The statement in the form of an analogy came after Mr. Scindia last Thursday threatened to hit the streets if promises made before the 2018 Vidhan Sabha elections were not kept by the Congress government, to which Mr. Nath, following a Madhya Pradesh coordination committee meeting in New Delhi where Mr. Scindia was also present, retorted: “Toh utar jaaye” (Then hit the streets).

On Sunday, Mr. Scindia in Gwalior reiterated the threat stating fighting for issues was his duty as a public servant. However, he inserted a caveat saying the State government needed time as it was just a year into its tenure.

Mr. Scindia in the past has assailed the government for its survey of crops ravaged by rain and demanded adequate compensation for the affected. Meanwhile, Forest Minister Umang Singhar, from his camp, accused former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh of trying to destabilise the government, while two Congress MLAs levelled a corruption charge against Health Minister Tulsiram Silawat.

In December, Mr. Scindia told party workers in Bhind that loans of farmers hadn’t been waived entirely as promised in the manifesto, prompting Mr. Singh to launch into damage control by stating that all leaders were together in serving the State’s people who had given them the mandate.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation has issued eviction notice to more than 40 slum houses located 1.5 km from the newly-built Motera Cricket Stadium in Ahmedabad where the Namaste Trump event will be held on February 24.

“You have encroached upon a plot of land belonging to the AMC. Evict the plot in another seven days with your household chattels, otherwise, departmental action will be taken to evict the land. If you have to make any representation, you can do so on February 19 at 3 p.m.,” reads the notice issued by the estate wing of the civic body.

The residents questioned the timing of the notice and alleged that they were being removed as part of the “beautification exercise” ahead of the U.S. President’s visit to the area.

Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra strongly denied any such move and said: “No slum is being evicted ahead of the Namaste Trump event in the city. There are no plans of any forceful eviction in near future. There are no plans to evict any slum dwellers near the event venue or the route which the dignitaries will take. The AMC has an Estate department which is responsible for preventing any settlements on public land.”

According to him, whenever any fresh encroachments are noticed, the civic body issues notice to the occupants to furnish proof of ownership and conducts a hearing. These notices are for hearing and ask the occupants to furnish documents of ownership.

If the residents are unable to provide any documents, they will be evicted from the said land in due course — perhaps over next 1-2 years.

220,2020/02/18,"NPR can go ahead, says Uddhav Thackeray","He, however, says the NRC will not be allowed.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Tuesday that he would not block the National Population Register (NPR) in Maharashtra.

He said he would “personally check the columns” in NPR forms. “The Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) are different and the NPR is different. No one has to worry if the CAA is implemented. The NRC is not there, and will not be implemented in the State,” he wrote on Twitter.

He said he would not allow the NRC to be implemented in the State. “If the NRC is implemented, it will affect not only Hindus or Muslims but also Adivasis. The NPR is a census, and I don’t think anyone will be affected as it happens every 10 years,” he said.

Mr. Thackeray said the Centre had handed over the probe into the Elgaar Parishad case to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), but the State government would never permit the investigation into the Bhima-Koregaon clashes to be handed over to the Centre.

Bhima Koregaon probe

On the second day of his Konkan tour, he said the Elgaar Parishad case and the Bhima Koregaon clashes (of January 1, 2018) were two separate issues. “The Elgaar Parishad case and the Bhima Koregaon clashes are two separate matters. The Ambedkarite fraternity is concerned with the Bhima Koregaon riots... I have not handed over the investigation into the clashes to the Centre and nor would I do so in the future,” he said.

Mr. Thackeray said the atrocities on Dalits during the riots were “unfortunate” and he would never allow any further injustice to the community. “I reiterate that the violence at Bhima Koregaon in 2018 is distinct from the Elgaar Parishad case investigation. The Centre has taken over the latter from the State government and not the former. Let there be no misunderstanding.”

His remarks came a day after the Sharad Pawar-led Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) called for a special investigation team to probe the Elgaar Parishad case.

Mr. Pawar recently expressed displeasure with Mr. Thackeray’s decision to transfer the Elgaar case to the NIA. The Elgaar Parishad probe has caused fault-lines within the tripartite MVA (Maha Vikas Aghadi) government, with the NCP and the Congress gunning for the constitution of a SIT while Mr. Thackeray and the Sena not too keen on probing the issue further.

The Republican Yuva Morcha, a Pune-based Ambedkarite outfit, said that if the Chief Minister was truly concerned about Dalits, he must immediately constitute an SIT to probe afresh the Bhima-Koregaon riots.

Mr. Thackeray clarified on the Shiv Sena’s stance on the Ratnagiri Refinery Petrochemical Limited project. Answering a question on an advertisement for the project placed in the Konkan edition of the party’s mouthpiece Saamna, he said, “I take all decisions regarding the Shiv Sena, and the stance that is to be adopted by the party on any issue is decided by me. No entity that gives any advertisement in the Saamna ever decides the Sena’s stance.”

Ambedkarite outfit seeks SIT probe

Reacting to Mr. Thackeray’s statements, the Republican Yuva Morcha (RYM), a Pune-based Ambedkarite outfit, said that if the Chief Minister was truly concerned about no further injustice to the Dalit community, then it must immediately constitute a separate SIT to probe afresh the Bhima-Koregaon riots as well.

Also read | Dubious decision: On NIA takeover of Bhima Koregaon case

“Chief Minister Thackeray’s consent to transfer of the Elgaar Parishad case over to the NIA, and thereby to the Centre, has hurt secular outfits as well as disappointed the Sena’s alliance partners, the NCP and the Congress. If he indeed is concerned about providing speedy justice for the Ambedkarite community regarding the Bhima-Koregaon clashes, then he must form a SIT to probe the riots anew and fast-track the case given that the Koregaon Bhima judicial commission [set up to probe the riots] has proved itself utterly ineffective,” said RYM president Rahul Dambale.

Mr. Dambale said that he had already written to Mr. Thackeray regarding this earlier this year and urged the Chief Minister to direct the Pune Rural police to file a charge sheet in the Bhima Koregaon case and set up a trial court to probe the role of radical Hindutva leaders Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide, alleged to be the chief orchestrators of the clashes.

Refinery project

Speaking on other issues, Mr. Thackeray further clarified the Sena’s stance on the Ratnagiri Refinery Petrochemical Limited project, known as the ‘Nanar refinery’ project.

The Chief Minister was responding to questions regarding a recent advertisement for the project in the Konkan edition of Sena’s mouthpiece Saamna. The advertisement has raised eyebrows and triggered talk of the scuppered project being revived despite Mr. Thackeray and his party’s vehement opposition to it in the past.

“I take all decisions regarding the Shiv Sena and the stance that is to be adopted by the party on any issue is decided by me. No entity that gives any advertisement in the Saamna ever decides the Sena’s stance,” Mr. Thackeray said, adding that the Nanar issue was closed as far as he was concerned and that it was not even worth commenting on.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ihd5p1/article30838058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMUDDHAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/npr-can-go-ahead-says-uddhav-thackeray/article30850250.ece

Election strategist-turned-politician Prashant Kishor on Tuesday questioned the Nitish Kumar government’s development model, even as he sneered at the Bihar Chief Minister for making ""ideological compromises"" to stay in alliance with the BJP.

Mr. Kishor, who has been vocal about his opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), said Mr. Kumar should spell out whether he was with the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi or those who supported Nathuram Godse.

“Nitish ji has always said that he cannot leave the ideals of Gandhi, JP and Lohiya... At the same time, how can he be with the people who support the ideology of Godse. Both cannot go together. If you want to stay with the BJP, I don’t have any problem with it but you cannot be on both sides,” Mr. Kishor said.

“There has been a lot of discussion between me and Nitish ji on this. He has his thought process and I have mine. There have been differences between me and him that the ideologies of Godse and Gandhi cannot stand together. As the leader of the party you have to say which side you are on,” he said.

In a direct assault on Mr. Kumar’s model of governance, Mr. Kishor said Bihar was the poorest State in 2005 and continued to be so. “There has been development in Bihar in the last 15 years, but the pace has not been as it should have,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/b38wbd/article30850141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kishor,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/prashant-kishor-questions-nitish-kumars-development-model-in-bihar/article30849939.ece
222,2020/02/18,SC reserves order on Devendra Fadnavis’ review petition,"Ex-Maharashtra Chief Minister was earlier directed to face trial for suppressing information.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday reserved its judgment on a review petition filed by former Maharashtra Chief Minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis against its October 2019 verdict directing him to face trial for suppressing information about two pending forgery and criminal defamation cases in his 2014 election documents.

A Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra, however, did not heed to a plea by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who argued for Mr. Fadnavis, for stay of the trial court proceedings.

Also read: SC to hear in open court Fadnavis’ review plea in poll case

Mr. Rohatgi argued that there was no concealment of information and charges had not yet been framed at the time of filing poll documents. Mr. Fadnavis said the October 2019 saw far-reaching consequences in his political graph.

The apex court verdict of October 1 last year was delivered by a Bench of then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose. The judgment had directed a Nagpur court to continue with the trial against Mr. Fadnavis under Section125-A of the Representation of the People (RP) Act, 1951.

The decision had come in an appeal filed by Satish Ukey, a lawyer, against a Bombay High Court decision. The High Court had set aside a Sessions Court go-ahead to try Mr. Fadnavis for violation of the RP Act.

The judgment by Chief Justice Gogoi had held that a “contesting candidate is mandated to furnish information concerning the cases in which a Competent Court has taken cognisance along with the cases in which charges have been framed”.

The apex court interpreted Section 33-A of the 1951 Act to hold that ‘information’ to be disclosed by a candidate includes cases of which a court has already taken cognisance.

On Tuesday, Mr. Rohatgi argued that Section 33A was wrongly involved in his case.

Marathi kirtankar (preacher) Nivrutti Maharaj Indurikar has said some people unhappy with his work for society and the Warkari community were trying to trouble him by demanding cases against him.

The Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmulan Samiti (MANS), which works to eradicate superstitious beliefs, last week sought a police case against Mr. Indurikar for remarks on timing of intercourse and the sex of child, which it said violated the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act.

During a sermon in a hamlet in Ahmednagar, the preacher reportedly said that a couple having intercourse on an even date would beget a son, and on an odd date a daughter. “If intercourse is done at an inauspicious time, the child that is born would bring a bad name to the family. If the timing (of intercourse) is missed, the quality of output (child) will be sub-standard,” he is heard saying in a video that went viral.

During a sermon on Sunday in Ahsti tehsil in Beed, the preacher said, “I have been working for society and among the Warkari community for the past 30-35 years. Some people are unhappy with this and want to put me in trouble.”

He received support from BJP MLC Suresh Dhas, who claimed the kirtankar had said what was written in the treatise Guru Charitra. “We will support Nivrutti Maharaj if any action is taken against him. What is the connection between what he said and the PCPNDT Act?,” Mr. Dhas asked.

A disabled woman was booked in Aurangabad along with 10 relatives after she allegedly refused to take possession of the body of her husband, who died in a road accident, said an official on Monday. The family allegedly created a ruckus in the police station.

Arjun Rathod (30) died after his motorcycle was hit by a four-wheeler on Paithan-Aurangabad Road on February 11. His wife, Devaki, refused to take the body for cremation after legal formalities later that day, said the police official.

The Goa Forward Party (GFP) on Monday asked the Pramod Sawant government to withdraw the tax on feni announced in the State budget for 2020-21, and warned of an agitation if the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party did not do so.

First such tax

It is the first time that a tax, announced in the budget tabled in the Assembly on February 6, will be levied on the popular Goan beverage made from fermented and distilled juice of cashew apples, or from coconuts.

The tax is expected to increases price per bottle by almost 50%, and distillers and bottlers had earlier said the hike would impact sales of the alcoholic drink.

Talking to reporters in Margao, GFP chief Vijai Sardesai said the State government should withdraw the feni tax by the end of the Carnival, scheduled from February 22 to 25, or face an agitation.

“Feni contributes only 1% of excise revenue collected by the State annually. Feni is made by Goans for Goans. The State government has not made any effort to popularise it after giving it the heritage drink status. This tax will also affect private players who want to make the drink popular,” Mr. Sardesai said.

Coconut feni worst hit

He said the coconut feni industry would be the worst hit, as it would amount to double taxation because farmers already pay tax when they bid for cashew plantations for harvesting at auctions.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/goa-tax-on-feni-gfp-demands-withdrawal-threatens-agitation/article30848567.ece

Land revenue paying receipt, permanent account number (PAN) card and bank documents do not prove the citizenship of a person, the Gauhati High Court has observed.

A Division Bench of Justices Manojit Bhuyan and Parthivjyoti Saikia made this observation on February 12 while dismissing a writ petition filed by one Jabeda Begum against the order passed by a Foreigners’ Tribunal (FT) at Tamulpur in western Assam’s Baksa district.

Declared foreigner

The FT had declared her a foreigner who had entered Assam after 1971, the cut-off year for detection and deportation of illegal immigrants according to the Assam Accord of August 1985.

Ms. Begum had told the FT that the names of her grandparents and parents had appeared in the voters’ list of 1966 while that of her father was in the 1970 list of electors. The High Court agreed with the findings of the tribunal that she could not produce any document that could establish her link with her parents.

2016 case

The court also referred to a 2016 case of one Md. Babul Islam to reject Ms. Begum’s reliance on certain papers. “This court ... has already held that PAN card and bank documents are not proof of citizenship,” the judgement read.

Observing that land revenue paying receipts and certificates issued by a village headman “can never be the proof of citizenship of a person,” the court said the FT was correct in its decision on Ms. Begum and dismissed her petition “devoid of merit.”

The court of Justices Bhuyan and Saikia had in an earlier case observed that “merely producing an elector photo identity card in the absence of supporting evidence would not be a proof of citizenship.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/6sut75/article29543927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AadharandPANCARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/land-revenue-receipts-pan-no-proof-of-citizenship/article30846700.ece

Making a statement on the motion of thanks to the Governor’s address in the Assembly, Mr. Patnaik said all departments of the State government will be brought under the ‘Mo Sarkar’ initiative by March 5.

Mr. Patnaik announced that April 1 was set as deadline for shifting all wage payments through banks for all line departments. All government transactions across Departments will be done through the Integrated Financial Management System by April 1.

Conservationists have called upon the district administration to shelve plans to begin construction works on a wetland in Kotagiri and help preserve it.

The wetland, known as Rifle Range, has been threatened by the spread of invasive flora as well as encroachments in the form of illegal constructions. Local residents and activists have been fighting to clean up the wetland and to prevent further encroachment of the site.

However, recent plans to build housing for government staff as well as government buildings on the wetland could be catastrophic for the environment and have implications for the water security of residents in Kotagiri town, warned K.J. Raju, secretary of the Longwood Shola Watchdog Committee.

In a petition to the District Collector, Mr. Raju called for the protection of the wetland, from where water is drawn and supplied to parts of Kotagiri town. “What remains of the previously massive wetland is only a small portion, measuring about eight acres. At least this portion needs to be left intact to ensure the availability of water for local residents, and also provide a habitat for wildlife,” said Mr. Raju.

“If the constructions come up, not only the groundwater levels will decrease substantially, but also the three functioning wells from where water is drawn by the local bodies will become polluted,” said Mr. Raju.

The Longwood Shola Watchdog Committee has also called upon the administration to remove the exotic eucalyptus trees that were planted on the wetland a few decades ago, as they consume more water.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/conservationists-call-for-protection-of-rifle-range/article30854583.ece

234,2020/02/18,Number of birds visiting Nanjarayan Tank on the decline,"There is a decline in the number of migratory birds visiting the Nanjarayan Tank near Uthukuli in Tiruppur district compared to previous years, a recent bird census carried out by the Forest Department has revealed.

As per the orders of Tiruppur District Forest Officer P.K. Dileep, the census was carried out in January by a team of officials led by Tiruppur Forest Range Officer S. Mahes.

Ms. Mahes told The Hindu the decline in number of pelicans, storks, ibises, darters and geese is more pronounced. Only 17 spot-billed pelicans were recorded during the census. “Until last year, between 200 and 300 spot-billed pelicans arrived in Nanjarayan Tank during October and stayed till February,” Ms. Mahes said. However, most of these birds left in November 2019, leaving only 17 in January. Only seven bar-headed geese, a migratory bird from eastern and southern parts of Asia, were recorded in the census. Other migratory birds recorded in less numbers were three glossy ibises and two darters.

The Forest Department identified and recorded 40 different species of birds during the census, but the number might change depending on the seasons. The exercise spanned three weeks in January, with the number of birds noted once a week and the final number was obtained after averaging the readings, Ms. Mahes said.

K. Ravindran, a bird watcher and president of Nature Society of Tiruppur, said that apart from the above-mentioned birds, duck species such as northern shovelers, garganey, northern pintails and common teal also saw a decline in this season. He claimed that the “change in ecosystem” of Nanjarayan Tank due to desilting, illegal fishing and growth of hyacinth might have contributed to the decline. “Reviving the habitat is a Herculean task,” Mr. Ravindran said.

However, Ms. Mahes said that the Forest Department has not yet confirmed the cause of the decline.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/birds-visiting-nanjarayan-tank-on-the-decline-census/article30854564.ece

236,2020/02/18,"Lesser fish-eagle, tufted duck spotted in Coimbatore tank","‘Sighting of lesser fish-eagle could be an indicator of improvement in habitat’

In what appears to be an indicator of the quality of habitat, members of the Perur Lake Forum recently spotted two rare visitors in Kolarampathy tank, one of the less polluted water bodies in Coimbatore.

Lesser fish-eagle (Icthyophaga humilis), a resident of forest-fringed water bodies, and tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), a winter vagrant, were spotted in the tank during a monthly synchronised survey conducted by the forum.

This is the first photographic record of the sighting of tufted duck in Coimbatore city, though the bird was sighted before in Ukkadam tank in 2017, claims Prakash G., a member of the forum.

The sighting of lesser fish-eagle in the tank gains significance as the raptor, known for its ability to lift fish from the water with its curvy talons, resides in riparian forest areas and mainly feeds on freshwater fish.

Mr. Prakash and other members of the forum namely Vijaykumar Ramamoorthy, Srinivas Rav and Sureshbabu K., spotted the two birds first on February 8.

According to Mr. Prakash, they spotted an odd one among the flocks of lesser whistling duck and garganey at a distance in the tank. “Since the duck exhibited sequences of diving as feeding strategy, it was evident that it was different from dabbling ducks seen in our area. Mr. Ramamoorthy and Mr. Rav took series of photographs to confirm its identity later,” he says.

As the group resumed observation towards the northern side of the tank, they spotted a raptor perched on a tree and a Brahminy kite disturbing it by flying close in a menacing manner. Though the raptor appeared to look like a lesser fish-eagle, they were doubtful about the sighting as the raptor prefers riparian forests habitat. They took multiple photographs of the raptor, which led to its identification. Two other members of the forum namely Gajamohanraj D. and Sharang Satish also came to the tank after finishing their observation in Krishnampathi tank and took more photographs of the duck that has unique floppy crest.

“Following discussions with G. Parameswaran, president of the forum, Mr. Gajamohanraj made multiple visits to Kolarampathy on different days and took multiple photographs to establish the identity of the duck beyond doubt,” adds Mr. Prakash. He says that Rajah Jayapal, Senior Principal Scientist at Coimbatore-based Sálim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (Sacon), reviewed the photos of two birds and confirmed identities.

According to P. Balasubramanian, senior principal scientist at Sacon, sighting of lesser fish-eagle at the tank could be an indicator of improvement in the habitat, as the raptor is a resident of riparian forests like the ones at Pillur and Athikadavu.

Mr. Balasubramanian had co-authored a paper on the bird diversity of riparian forest along Bhavani river in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, which mentions sighting of 20 lesser fish-eagles nesting in the riparian habitat of Bhavani river between August 2012 and July 2014.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/rhmw47/article30854557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB19LESSERFISHEAGLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/lesser-fish-eagle-tufted-duck-spotted-in-coimbatore-tank/article30854559.ece
237,2020/02/18,Villagers oppose HPCL’s pipeline project,"Villagers of Sivadi here staged a demonstration against the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited’s proposed pipeline project on Tuesday. The protesters, led by the Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, objected to the proposed pipeline project that envisions a pipeline from Vijaywada to Dharmapuri, where a storage terminal will be set up here.

According to the HPCL website, it is set up to cater to the petroleum needs of the Salem-Coimbatore belt.

The 697 km Vijaywada Dharmapuri pipeline (VDPL) project is slated to acquire over 123 acres of land from Sivadi village in Dharmapuri. The project has seen objections from the villagers over the last many months since the time landowners received notices of the proposal on their land holdings.

According to Tamil Nadu Vivasyaigal Sangam, the villagers had objected to the project in May 2020, and the same were conveyed to the district administration. However, despite objections to taking away of the primarily marginal landholdings of the villagers, the administration has not intervened on behalf of the Sivadi residents, the Sangam has alleged.

Speaking at the protest, former Harur MLA Dilli Babu said that over 70 of the lands proposed for acquisition for the company belonged to Dalits and were marginal landholdings. Later, the protesters submitted a petition to the district administration.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/villagers-oppose-hpcls-pipeline-project/article30854170.ece

239,2020/02/18,Road widening project disrupts BSNL telecom service in Bargur hills,"BSNL officials warn that damage to OFC will lead to permanent shutdown of service in the hill area

Road widening works in the Anthiyur – Thamaraikarai stretch leads to frequent disruption of BSNL mobile services in Bargur hills as officials warn that further damage to optic fibre cable (OFC) would lead to permanent shutdown of service in the hill area.

Heavy vehicles use the ghat road that leads to Bargur and Kollegal in Karnataka and work began to widen intermediate lane to double lane of Bhavani – Anthiyur – Bargur - Kollegal road by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). Earthmovers, rock breaking machines and drillers were used to remove the boulders and trees and also for digging on ghat road. BSNL has laid OFC on ghat road to Thamaraikarai and Bargur to provide network connectivity in the hill area that serves people in over ten villages. However, people were facing frequent network disruption in the past four months as the cables were snapped during the road digging works.

In the absence of mobile connectivity, communication between people in the hill area was affected causing inconvenience to the people. “Except for BSNL, no other telecom service provider has installed tower in the hill”, said Appaiyaa, a farmer in Thamaraikarai who wanted service to be provided uninterrupted.

Speaking on anonymity, a senior BSNL official, said that OFC cables were cut-off during road digging works and repair works were carried in 50 joints in eight km. stretch. We carry out repair works even during night hours as we are the only service provider in the hills, he added.

BSNL had spent more than ₹ 5 lakh for carrying out repair works and further damage to the line would disrupt the service permanently. “If the cables are snapped again, repair works cannot be done and service would be stopped”, he said. The official said that they have made frequent requests to the officials asking them to be more cautious during digging activity as given the current financial situation of the organisation, OFC cannot be replaced.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/road-widening-project-disrupts-bsnl-telecom-service-in-bargur-hills/article30854085.ece

The Fifth Additional District Court in Coimbatore on Monday sentenced a 38-year-old man to undergo 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in connection with the electrocution of two siblings at Majid Colony near Ukkadam in June 2017.

Judge T.H. Mohammed Farooq awarded the punishment to G. Mohamed Mustafa in connection with the electrocution of S. Salman (18) and his sister S. Banu (16).

Mustafa had drawn power illegally from the house of a neighbour named Amsa after Tangedco disconnected power connection to his house due to faulty and burnt wire. He used a wire without proper insulation to draw power and passed the wire across the road using an iron pole for support. Apart from electrifying the house, he also used the illegal connection to power a bulb in a shed adjacent to the house where people played carom.

On June 7, 2017, Mustafa’s neighbours Salman and Banu went outside the house to clear water logging due to rain. Salman was electrocuted when he touched the iron pole that supported the wire. Banu too suffered electric shock while attempting to save her brother. Additional public prosecutor B.

246,2020/02/18,Police to deal with halting of night buses on busy roads,"Plan to call a meeting of private bus operators

Halting of long-distance private buses on city roads to pick up passengers for overnight travel has been affecting smooth flow of traffic in the late evening hours.

To tackle the problem, the Coimbatore city traffic police have decided to call a meeting of the bus operators to discuss measures to reduce such halts on busy roads, especially from 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) R. Mutharasu told The Hindu the issue has come to the attention of the police and a meeting of bus owners will be planned soon.

Halting of private buses is common on Avinashi Road between Lakshmi Mills junction and airport junction. Such buses are halted at places other than bus stops as per the convenience of the passengers who choose the place of boarding.

The situation turns worse when buses are halted for a long time occupying the motorable space, to give time for reserved passengers to arrive and to load luggages.

“What we understand is that these buses are halted at places requested by passengers. Online reservation platforms allow passengers to choose the place of pick up. The police will ask the bus owners to reduce the number of stoppages on busy roads,” said Mr. Mutharasu.

He said that the police would also instruct the opeartors to avoid the use of high power LED headlights and power horns in omni buses.

During special drives conducted in the last two weeks, the police have fined around 400 persons for the use power horns and about the same number of persons for using high power LED headlights and additional lights for decoration purposes.

According to bus operators, around 200 omni buses conduct overnight services to other cities from Coimbatore.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/1t38wf/article30846025.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB18NIGHTBUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/police-to-deal-with-halting-of-night-buses-on-busy-roads/article30846026.ece

248,2020/02/18,New butterfly species recorded in Salem,"The three-day bird and butterfly survey conducted in Salem forest range concluded on Sunday and four new butterfly species and a bird species have been recorded by surveyors.

In the survey that was jointly conducted by Salem Nature Society members and Forest personnel, teams spotted white-rumped spinetail (Zoonavena sylvatica). According to experts, the bird is widely distributed in India, Nepal and Bangladesh.

The experts said that it was the first photographic record of the bird in Salem district and it was recorded by four students, Suryaprakasam, Mohammed Shahidh, Noorbriyan and Abdul Rehman Mahi, at the foothills of Yercaud.

The bird had been rarely recorded in the Eastern Ghats. The bird can be generally spotted over water bodies in and around forest areas.

The teams recorded Common tinsel (Catapaecilma major), a butterfly from the Blue family, for the first time in the Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu. The species was recorded by A.Pavendhan, S.Soundararaj, T.Nagaraj and R.Krishnamoorthy in Yercaud Hills.

The survey recorded sightings of butterfly species like Chocolate albatross, Pale four-lineblue and Transparent six-lineblue for the first time in the district. The survey also recorded the presence of Oriental grass jewel, the smallest butterfly, and Southern birdwing, the largest butterfly, in the ranges here.

Mr. Pavendhan, president, Tamil Nadu Butterfly Society said that the presence of the largest and smallest butterflies could be seen as an indication of presence of diversified habitat here. He said that there was good scope for butterfly studies in the region.

This is the second time the Salem forest division and Salem Nature Society is conducting a survey of this kind in Salem forest ranges. According to officials, 17 teams with 85 volunteers and 50 forest personnel conducted the survey in Yercaud, Shervarayan North, Shervarayan South, Danishpet, Mettur, Kalvarayan, Valappadi, Attur and Thammampatti ranges.

During the survey, the teams recorded 214 bird species and 136 butterfly species in the Eastern Ghats here. In the survey conducted in 2018, 276 bird species and 76 butterfly species were recorded.

According to the survey report, the drop in record of migratory birds in the region might be due to prolonged monsoon this year.

District Forest Officer A.Periasamy said that based on the proposals in the report, steps would be taken to conserve and preserve the habitats and host plants here.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/cpuvwk/article30846010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA18CHOCOLATEALBATROSSRECORDED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/new-butterfly-species-recorded-in-salem/article30846014.ece

250,2020/02/18,Corpn. to replace nine shredders at MCCs following complaint,"Officials, however, suspect complaint is motivated

Just as it is making progress in constructing and running micro compost centres (MCCs) at 35 places in the city to decentralise waste processing, the Coimbatore Corporation, it appears, is facing hurdles, some of it from within.

The MCCs are at present the Corporation’s solution to its waste management problem.

The Corporation says the MCCs and the system it will put in place will strengthen waste segregation. And, thereby, reduce the quantity of waste it transports to Vellalore.

Of the 35 MCCs that the Corporation has taken up in the first phase, it has completed work in 12. It has also begun waste processing operation after installing machines to convey and shred organic waste, which it then dumps in concrete tanks to produce compost.

In a few of the 12 centres, the machines installed are not as efficient as they should be, complains a team of Corporation officials. The machines are unable to shred the organic waste to the desired specification and do not have enough horse power for the desired operation. It, as a group operating the machines, is unable to run the machines and has asked for replacements, the officials add.

A senior officer, confirming the receipt of complaints, says the Corporation has decided to replace eight or nine machines with ones with higher horse power. The Corporation will use the replaced machines at its on-site compost plants in parks.

The complaint about the shredders’ efficiency and plan to change those have angered another group of officers. It sees in the complaint a design to sabotage the Corporation’s plans to build the MCCs.

An officer, who is a part of the group, says there is definitely an attempt to derail the operation of MCCs because a few people in the team stand to lose if the Corporation operates the MCCs. Those few will no longer have control over vehicles, be able to fudge fuel consumption records or illegally service bulk waste generators.

And, that is why the team is using ill-experienced workers to run the MCCs and dumping cooker weight, iron pieces and stones into the shredders that are supposed to shred only organic waste.

The officer says that there is photographic evidence to prove that materials that are not supposed to be dumped into shredders are being dumped and wants to know how cooker weight, stones and coconut shells find their way into shredders if the team collects waste only after segregation.

The officer further says that the issue has been taken to the notice of the Corporation Commissioner, who has now decided that in the South Zone, the Corporation’s sanitation wing officials will operate the MCCs and in West Zone, the Corporation outsourced agencies. After a few months of study, either the sanitation wing will run the MCCs or outsource.

Senior officials who did not want to be named say they are aware of the complaint against the shredder and the allegation that the complaint is motivated. It is to put to rest that the civic body has taken such a stand.

And, the civic body is clear that it wants to streamline the waste collection and process in keeping with the commitment given to the National Green Tribunal.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/7nsx40/article30846003.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB18CORPORATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corpn-to-replace-nine-shredders-at-mccs-following-complaint/article30846004.ece
251,2020/02/18,Ranji Trophy | We had to make two teams one: J&K coach,"‘Made people with two different mindsets believe in each other’

Very early into his tenure as the Jammu & Kashmir coach, Milap Mewada realised one thing: this was not a united team. So when Mewada and Irfan Pathan drew up a plan for the future last year, they quickly decided that one thing had to happen. “We needed to remove the ‘and’ in Jammu and Kashmir and make it J-K,” says Mewada.

“There were always two parts in this team — players from Jammu and players from Kashmir. We were able to unite them. We know that no sportsman likes to lose. [But] there were two teams, two different colours, two different mindsets. We made them believe in each other.”

That Mewada, a former Ranji Trophy cricketer and coach from Baroda, and Irfan, currently the J& K mentor, were able to achieve their objective is evident in the results this campaign. J & K finished on top of Group C, advancing to the quarterfinals of the Ranji Trophy for only the third time in its history and the first time since the 2013-14 season.

On the field, Mewada and Irfan operated with a seriousness and professionalism the J & K players had not perhaps known previously. Off it, they organised continual team-building sessions. “We made it mandatory for players to eat dinner in groups of four — we picked players from different parts of the State, those who did not know each other well,” says Mewada.

“They had to learn some secrets about one another, something fun they had done. For example, someone admitted to puncturing someone’s tyre, someone had pursued [a girl] and been slapped, someone had shattered someone’s window. They had fun, they felt togetherness and brotherhood.”

Then there came the drawings. Groups of four players had to produce a hand-drawn picture that summed up the team best: one came up with a bunch of logs bound together; another drew a river feeding a turbine, except the river had a few minor streams that branched off, weakening it; a third saw the squad as a tiger hiding inside a goat. “All this made it clear what the players were thinking. Everyone wanted unity,” says Mewada.

At the start of the season, he and Irfan handed every player a questionnaire. One of those questions was how long J & K had been playing in the Ranji. Players made various guesses.

The next one was how many titles the side had won. “Nobody got that wrong,” smiles Mewada. “So I told them, ‘You have been playing for 50 years and you have not won anything. So don’t play just another season this time. Make it a mission instead.’”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/uuq7zr/article30854277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19Milap-Mewada,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-we-had-to-make-two-teams-one-jk-coach/article30854278.ece
252,2020/02/18,Indian women edge out West Indies in ICC Women’s T20 World Cup warm-up game,"Poonam claims three wickets to derail the chase

Spinner Poonam Yadav claimed three wickets as India geared up for the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup with a thrilling two-run win over the West Indies in a low-scoring warm-up match here on Tuesday. Electing to bat, India posted 107 for eight in the stipulated 20 overs before restricting West Indies to 105 for seven.

Deepti strikes

Chasing 108, West Indies was comfortably placed at 57 for one in 13 overs when Deepti Sharma struck, cleaning up opener Lee-Ann Kirby (42) to trigger a collapse. Soon skipper Stafanie Taylor (16), Chedean Nation (0) and Deandra Dottin (1) were back in the hut as West Indies slipped to 67 for five in the 17th over.

Hayley Matthews (25) and Chinelle Henry (17) blasted three fours and a six in the 19th over to leave the team with 11 to get off six balls.

Henry blasted Poonam for a four but the Indian dismissed Hayley off the fourth ball. West Indies needed three runs off the last ball but Chinelle was caught by Veda Krishnamurthy.

Earlier, the top-three failed to fire as India was reduced to 17 for three. Opener Smriti Mandhana (4) lasted just six balls, while Jemimah Rodrigues fell without opening her account. Shafali Verma blasted a couple of fours before being caught by Britney Cooper off Shamilia Connell (2/20).

Deepti Sharma made a 32-ball 21 before falling to Anisa Mohammed, while Pooja Vastrakar (13) was removed by Aaliyah Alleyne.

The scores: India 107/8 in 20 overs (Anisa Mohammed 2/16) bt West Indies 105/7 in 20 overs (Lee-Ann Kirby 42, Poonam Yadav 3/20).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/p0mmvq/article30853616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19POONAM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-women-edge-out-west-indies-in-icc-womens-t20-world-cup-warm-up-game/article30853617.ece
253,2020/02/18,"We have the team to beat New Zealand, says Arun","India’s bowling coach aware of dynamics of windy Wellington and Basin Reserve

The big white sheets covered the pitch and the square, soaking up the water. It rained here on Tuesday forcing the Indians to cancel their practice session.

Indeed, the picturesque Basin Reserve ground, the soul of New Zealand cricket, wore a forlorn look with just two more days to go before the first Test gets underway here on Friday.

Although the surface for the game was not in view, locals said there was a fair amount of grass under the covers. The conditions should favour the seamers here.

Showers forecast

While showers have been forecast till the first two days of the Test, the weather should be fine for the last three.

The pitch could also be seamer friendly in the first two to three days and then flatten out.

The Indians discovered this the hard way on their last Test tour here when Brendon McCullum’s history-making triple hundred, backed up by centuries from B-J. Watling and Jimmy Neesham enabled New Zealand script a great escape.

With the Indians calling off their training session, the team’s bowling coach Bharat Arun was able to eke out time for shopping at the busy Lambton Quay in Wellington’s CBD.

Arun was confident about India’s chances against New Zealand.

He told The Hindu, “New Zealand is a combative side but we have the team to beat it in its backyard.”

Not too concerned

Arun was not overly concerned about India’s ODI setback.

He said, “We were without six of our World Cup players. Sometimes, it is not all about winning.”

Arun added, “It’s about trying out cricketers in different positions and we might lose some matches in the bargain.”

He observed, “Look we found an ideal No. 4 for the shorter versions in Shreyas Iyer.

“And K.L. Rahul offers us a lot as a versatile batsman at No. 5 who can also ’keep competently.”

Switching his attention back to Tests, Arun was aware of the dynamics of the windy Wellington and the Basin Reserve.

Bowling against the wind

Here, bowling against the strong winds is a huge ask from a seamer. Arun said, “Not one, but each of our pacemen could take turns bowling against the wind. We could also ask the spinner to bowl against the wind and rotate the pacemen from the other end.”

India will play only one spinner, and, at this stage, it appears R. Ashwin may be that man since he gets the ball to dip or drift while bowling against the wind. He offers more in the air than Ravindra Jadeja who is better on tracks where the ball grips.

It’s also likely that Rishabh Pant will get the nod ahead of Wriddhiman Saha. While Saha is a more accomplished stumper, Pant can keep smartly standing back on these pitches and also attack the Kiwi seamers to swing games.

The talented Prithvi Shaw should open with Mayank Agarwal, who has a fine temperament.

The sublime Shubhman Gill may have to wait longer for his chance.

Ishant brings experience

Ishant Sharma, set to join the team on Tuesday night, adds much to the Indian pace pack with his experience and skill.

“Yes, Ishant will join us. In the conditions here, the pacemen can bowl a bit up, than they did in Australia,” said Arun.

Ishant could combine with Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami with the in-form Umesh Yadav missing a place by a short-head. The competition among the Indian pacemen is intense and that’s not good news for the Kiwis.

Trent Boult will be back in action for New Zealand, combining with Tim Southee. And in picking the lanky Kyle Jamieson, someone who bowls with pace and can extract lift around off-stump, the Kiwi think-tank is zeroing in on an old Indian failing.

The battle lines have been drawn even if the weather is murky here.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/9h0l6m/article30853536.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19-ARUN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/we-have-the-team-to-beat-new-zealand-says-arun/article30853537.ece
254,2020/02/18,"Can’t wait to get Virat Kohli out, announces fit-again Trent Boult","Boult was out of action for the past six weeks due to a fracture on his right hand sustained during the Boxing Day Test against Australia.

There are no half measures for fit-again New Zealand pace spearhead Trent Boult who is ready to challenge India captain Virat Kohli on his return to international cricket during the two-Test series starting here on Friday.

Boult was out of action for the past six weeks due to a fracture on his right hand sustained during the Boxing Day Test against Australia and missed out on the limited-overs leg of the India series.

Also read: India to play day-night Test in Australia

Back for the traditional format, the left-arm fast bowler made his priorities clear ahead of the first Test.

“That’s personally why I play the game, to get guys like that (Kohli) out and test myself against them, so I can’t wait to get stuck in. But he’s an exceptional player. Everyone knows how great he is,” Boult said, sending out a warning after landing in the capital city for the opening Test.

The Basin Reserve track will have a lot for the seamers and in conditions conducive to seam bowling, a wily customer like Boult might prove to be a handful.

“I’m preparing for a solid wicket. It generally is very good here and goes the full distance (five days). I do enjoy playing here, the history that’s involved, and it’s going to be an exciting week building up. I can’t wait to get out there,” said the 30-year-old who has taken 256 wickets from 65 Tests.

It was frustrating for him to watch his side get walloped 0-5 in the T20 series but exhilarating to when it got its mojo back in the subsequent one-dayers. The Black Caps won 3-0 in the 50-over format.

“I think it is what it is. I have just got to put the last six or so weeks behind me and just back myself to get out there and do my thing,” said Boult, who warmed up by playing a club game at the picturesque Taupo ground.

“I was pushing in off the long run. I think a couple of the clubbies from Taupo really enjoyed that. It was a good afternoon,” added the pacer, who sent down eight overs in a friendly game for his club Cadets.

Professionally, Boult had to lie low due to injury, but it was also a good break as he and wife Lana welcomed their second child.

“Having some time away from the game and having my second son a couple of weeks ago came at quite a good time,” said Boult.

Fighting fit, all he wants now is to get hold of a red kookaburra and get a few to tail into Kohli and company.

“I am hungry to be here and can’t wait to get back in the white and get the red ball moving around,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/murvk7/article30513492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOULTK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cant-wait-to-get-virat-kohli-out-announces-fit-again-trent-boult/article30849768.ece
255,2020/02/18,BCCI withholds subsidy to DDCA,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to withhold the annual subsidy to Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA). The move was expected following complaints by some important members of the unit.

“We have stopped the subsidy,” BCCI president Sourav Ganguly revealed to The Hindu. Ganguly was here to attend the Apex Council meeting where it was also decided to appoint an ad-hoc committee to administer DDCA.

DDCA had been in the news for all wrong reasons for long. It was put under an administrator twice — Justice (Retd) Mukul Mudgal and Justice (Retd) Vikramajit Sen — before Rajat Sharma took charge following the elections.

After Rajat resigned, the DDCA remains embroiled in increasing controversy related to administration.

The support staff of the Delhi teams (senior and junior) have not been paid for more than four seasons now. “Some coaches were paid by Mudgal and Sen administration because they could produce the contracts. But many former players have served as coaches and selectors without being handed a contract,” said a former player who has sent many representations to claim his dues.

According to a senior DDCA official, the dues have been withheld for lack of clarity as far as terms of payment are concerned. “How do we know who is to be paid what amount? There are no contracts.” He insisted, “the only way out is for the Board to take a decision.”

Various members of the DDCA have, meanwhile, sought intervention from the Board, pointing out incidents of financial irregularities and misconduct during the Annual General Meeting in December.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/3evvoc/article29768501.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BCCI-001,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bcci-withholds-subsidy-to-ddca/article30848421.ece
256,2020/02/18,Ranji Trophy | Odisha — keeping the momentum going,"Coach Parida wants his boys to target semi first, then final

Odisha has qualified for the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals after a gap of three years following a draw against Jharkhand. It was a remarkable outing for the Subhranshu Senapati-led side which finished second in Group C (38 points) behind Jammu & Kashmir.

This achievement wouldn't have been possible without the guidance of former domestic batting stalwart and current coach Rashmi Ranjan Parida.

Moment of pride

""We aimed to progress to the Elite Group A & B and to achieve that we had to be among the top two. That was the aim that the boys had and finally we are there,"" Parida told Sportstar from Bhubaneshwar.

""It's a moment of pride and we are happy with our achievement. Having said that, we aim to reach the semis and then the final. It is not an impossible task,"" he said.

Odisha began its season with three straight wins against Chhattisgarh, Services and Uttarakhand.

The team next salvaged a draw against Tripura and then pulled off a stunning one-wicket away win against Haryana.

""Winning the first three games gave us the momentum. It was a massive boost and beating Haryana in Rohtak was very satisfying. We knew we had the arsenal to win games,"" Parida stated.

However, in its next fixture, Odisha suffered a four-wicket loss at home to J&K before bouncing back to beat Assam and Maharashtra.

""It's a long season and I knew we would suffer a loss here and there.

“But we never allowed the momentum to slip away and came back strongly. It's been an incredible journey and credit goes to the entire team. There were individual flashes of individual brilliance, but overall it was a team effort,"" he said.

The 2016 knockout

During the 2016 quarterfinal, Odisha lost to Gujarat, with rival opener Samit Gohel scoring an unbeaten 359 and breaking the world record for the highest score by an opener carrying his bat in first-class cricket. Gujarat qualified for the semifinal based on first-innings lead.

Asked how his side is preparing for the high-pressure match, Rashmi said, ""Look it's all about mental strength and the boys are ready for it. Except for Basant, Biplab and Govind the rest haven't played a knockout.

“So it's a chance for them to express themselves and create something special. Bengal will come hard but we are ready for it.

Kings XI Punjab is set to acquire the St. Lucia franchise of the Caribbean Premier League, becoming the second IPL team to own a CPL outfit after Kolkata Knight Riders.

“We are about to sign an agreement to be part of CPL. We are getting the St Lucia franchise. The structure and name of the company will only be communicated after we get BCCI’s approval,” KXIP co-owner Ness Wadia told PTI on Monday.

“Mohit Burman (co-owner) is in the Caribbean at the moment to sign the agreement. We want to especially thank the Prime Minister of St Lucia Allan Chastanet and Tourism Minister Dominic Fedde for making this possible. We have been pursuing this for almost nine months,” added Wadia.

St Lucia Zouks is one of the six teams competing in the CPL. The team is led by former West Indies captain Darren Sammy.

Another Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders had acquired Trinbago Knight Riders in 2015. It is the most successful CPL franchise till date, having won three titles.

St Lucia’s best performance till date came in 2016 when it finished fourth.

The Caribbean Premier League, which began in 2013, is among the established T20 leagues in the world.

Pete Russell, Chief Operating Officer of the Hero CPL, said: “We are hugely excited to welcome this ownership team to the CPL family and we are looking forward to seeing where they take the Zouks during the upcoming season and beyond.

“They bring with them a wealth of experience which is fantastic news for both the CPL and St Lucia as a whole.”

St Lucia Prime Minister Chastanet also welcomed the development.

“I welcome the new owners of the Saint Lucia Zouks and hope that their new energy and drive will inspire the team to excel,” said Mr. Chastanet.

“Saint Lucians continue to root for the Zouks and we are encouraged by the confidence that Mr. Mohit Burman and his team have placed in the players and St Lucia,” he added.

The 2020 CPL will be held from August 19 to September 26.

The employment of a 32-year-old woman working at Sahitya Akademi, who had complained of sexual harassment against the organisation’s Secretary K. Sreenivasarao, has been terminated.

On February 14, the victim, a 32-year-old official at the Akademi, was sent her termination letter, which said that she was on probation for two years starting February 15, 2018, and her performance was not found satisfactory, due to which her services could not be confirmed.

On November 7 last year, an FIR was registeredunder Section 354A (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code, in which the victim alleged that Mr. Sreenivasarao had been making sexual advances towards her since she joined the Akademi in February 2018, and when she confronted him recently, he held her hand and told her she should have understood his “hints”.

An internal enquiry was also being conducted by the Internal Complaints Committee. However, the victim feared its outcome and hence approached the Local Complaint Committee under the District Magistrate. “The ICC has members who are close to the Secretary and I did not trust they would be impartial,” she said. The LCC directed that the victim should be given three months paid leave.

The victim then approached the Delhi High Court which directed that the monthly payments to the victim shall not be stopped for three months, which will operate till March 16. However, her employment was terminated on February 14.

Two charge sheets have been filed by the Delhi Police in connection with violence that erupted inside and outside Jamia Millia Islamia on December 15. They were filed on February 13 at the Saket court, the police said.

A senior police officer said the document mentions the name of Jawaharlal Nehru University PhD student Sharjeel Imam for persuading an accused to commit violence. “He is not named as an accused in the charge sheet. He has been arrested in connection with the Jamia case on Sunday. However, one of the accused, during interrogation, said he heard Imam’s speech and got instigated to commit violence,” the officer stated.

On that day, one Sharjil Imam, student of JNU Sharjil Imam also gave provocative speeches against CAA…”.

The document states that the protesters, including arrested accused, were stopped by a police party after which they jammed the Mata Mandir Road in New Friends Colony, damaged and torched vehicles and pelted stones at police.

While volunteers said that they had not received any intimation regarding when the interlocutors would speak with them, they said that they expected them to come to the site to hold discussions with them.

Meraj Khan, a volunteer, said that the protesters had drawn up a memorandum of demands which include either a complete rollback of the CAA or amendments to it in such a way that mention of particular religions are removed, that the NPR in the current form not be carried out, that the NRC not be carried out at all, that persecuted Rohingya refugees also be included in the CAA, that cases against protesters across the country be taken back or they be released if jailed and that any property recovered from protesters be returned.

Mohammed Shabaz, another volunteer, also argued that the focus on traffic issues be caused by the protest was misplaced and that other roads could also be opened up in order to bring relief to the traffic situation. He also reiterated that the protests would go on till the demands were met.

The JNU Students’ Union on Monday called for a protest demanding the release of university student Sharjeel Imam, arrested on sedition charge last month, and Kafeel Khan, booked under the National Security Act for his speech during an anti-CAA protest at Aligarh Muslim University on December 12.

The protest was scheduled to be a march from Mandi House to Jantar Mantar but the students called off their march and headed directly to Jantar Mantar.

Speaking at the protest, JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh alleged that the government in power was targeting people for unjustified reasons and that “hate speech” was being celebrated in the country.

“Nowadays, hate speeches are being celebrated in the country. However, if people, specifically people from the Muslim community, raise their voice against the government, they are targeted and a sedition case is slapped against them,” Ms. Ghosh said.

The protesters drew examples of various speeches delivered by the members of the ruling party in the run-up to the Delhi elections and asked as why no action was taken against them.

The students also called for a repeal of the amended Citizenship Act, a stop to the NPR and other draconian laws.

The Delhi High Court on Monday sought the response of the Centre, the city government and the police on a plea by a Jamia Millia Islamia student seeking compensation for injuries suffered allegedly in police action against anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters on December 15.

At the outset, the court was of the view that the student ought to have filed a civil suit if he was seeking compensation as his claims would have to be proved through evidence.

“These are matters of evidence. Why are you not filing a suit for damages? On the basis of annexures in a writ claims cannot be proved,” said a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar.

“It has become a fashion in Delhi to file a writ for everything,” the Bench also said.

271,2020/02/18,Enough evidence to establish excessive force: Jamia student,"Recounts night of horror in which he lost vision in one eye

“What more does the police need in terms of evidence? Everything is crystal clear,” said Mohammed Minhajauddin on Monday who lost vision in one eye during the police crackdown at Jamia Millia Islamia on December 15.

Mr. Minhajauddin, an LLM student, was among many other students seen in a CCTV video of the research scholars library where police personnel are seen indiscriminately beating up people. He said, “A few of my friends and I were there since 2 p.m... We went downstairs in between and returned. We even have the CCTV footage of this which we have submitted to the court.”

One point of entry

Narrating the sequence of events, Mr. Minhajauddin said that by evening, the police had entered and spread across the campus and everyone was in a state of panic. “There were a lot of sounds coming and many students had switched off their laptops and were just worried about finding a way out,” he said. With many seeking refuge in the research scholar’s section, the door, which is the only point of entry, was latched from inside.

“But they [police] banged the door several times, broke the latch and entered,” he said, following which allegedly without any warning, the police personnel in the video are seen beating up people with lathis. He said that the police gave no instruction to leave the place and were simply thrashing everyone present there, allegedly also hurling communal slurs.

Speaking to CNN News18, Mohammad Mustafa, an M.A. student at the university who was reportedly at the library as well said that police personnel who entered and carried out the crackdown without warning had asked him, “Do you want Azadi [freedom]?” Mr. Mustafa who is said to have suffered fractures in both hands during the incident, told the TV channel that he felt vindicated.

Mr. Minhajauddin said that his fingers were fractured when he was hit by a lathi. When he tried to escape from the room, he was hit in the eye in which he lost his vision.

While the police were hitting people with lathis inside the research scholar’s section, more personnel were allegedly waiting outside the room. They allegedly hit people as they came out. “I started to feel unconscious and somehow made my way to the bathroom,” he said. Mobile footage from the day, showed Mr. Minhajauddin bleeding from his face, lying unconscious in the bathroom of the university along with another student.

“Jamia [Millia Islamia] could have released this footage themselves and made everything clear but they were also worried about the law and order situation,” he said, adding that there was enough evidence to establish police brutality and that action must be taken.

Mr. Minhajauddin is undergoing regular treatment at AIIMS to make sure his other eye does not get infected, he said. Various foundations had also reached out to him and were helping him raise funds for his treatment.

He said that he had been advised to go abroad to seek treatment as well but was yet to take a decision in the matter. He has also approached multiple authorities to have a case registered in the matter and has approached the High Court to seek compensation, he said.

A notice was issued to the authorities on February 11 in this regard, he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/enough-evidence-to-establish-excessive-force-jamia-student/article30846800.ece

The case was later transferred to the Crime Branch, which has been probing the matter.

Forensic examination

274,2020/02/18,Over 50% inmates in Tihar jail from backward classes in 2018,"Muslims accounted for 84% of minority prisoners: data

Over 50% inmates in Tihar prison belong to Schedule Caste, Schedule Tribe and from Other Backward Classes (OBC), as per Prison Statistics 2018.

The data was recently shared by the Ministry of Home Affairs in response to a question in Rajya Sabha.

The data show that in 2018, there were 3,724 SC, 540 ST, and 4,063 OBC prisoners in Tihar jail out of a total of 15,468 inmates — accounting for 53.65% of the jail population. In 2017, there were 3,725 SC, 215 ST, and 4,156 OBC prisoners — accounting for 53.4% of the jail population. In 2016, the percentage was 51.2; in 2015, it stood at 46.9%.

The data was shared by the MHA in response to a question on whether the government maintains data based on the caste and religion of inmates, and what is the percentage change in the figures.

The data also showed that in 2018, there were 4,275 inmates from the minority community, out of which 84% were Muslims; the rest included 289 Sikhs, 348 Christians and 42 others. In 2017, Muslims accounted for 83.9% of the total inmates from the minority community, and in 2016, it was 84.1%.

There has been marginal change in the percentage of inmates from the minority community since 2014, the data showed.

“Demography and the fact that people from lower strata of society are more prone to committing crime, could be the reasons for the high percentage,” a prison official said, adding that the high Muslim population in the jail could be because “after Hindus, Muslims are highest in number in India”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/b5fqz6/article30846756.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/prison-datacol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/over-50-inmates-in-tihar-jail-from-backward-classes-in-2018/article30846757.ece
275,2020/02/18,"We were on a mission, says rescue team that went to Wuhan","In my mind we were soldiers working for our country, says team leader

“This was a mission not a trip,” said Pulin Gupta, professor of Internal Medicine at RML Hospital, who headed the first medical team that evacuated 324 Indians from Wuhan, China — epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak that has now spread to over 25 countries.

“It was all worth it when we saw the reaction of the Indians we were rescuing. There was cheer and even applause as the flight took to the air... there were many moist eyes,” he added.

The real work of the medical team (three doctors and two nursing staff) started just before the 324 Indians came on-board. “We had stocked up on medicines, personal safety equipment, emergency medicines and had sessions with staff on what the protocol would be. The Air India staff was also informed about the virus and how best to protect themselves. When our citizens boarded the plane, we had to evaluate their medical condition, ensure their safe trip back home and be sure to minimise the spread of any infection. That was a challenge,’’ said Dr. Gupta.

He added that besides logistics, the anxiety of going into an area which was dealing with a relatively little know virus was not easy.

“Though we knew that fatality was relatively low compared to similar strains, we were still anxious. However, when my mother told me that the country needs me now, all last-minute anxieties vanished and I was able to convey that confidence to my team also. In my mind we were soldiers working for our country. That in a nut-shell was our frame of mind,” said Dr. Gupta.

After returning to India, the team was kept in isolation for 14-days.

“But this is all part of our duty to help our brothers and sisters in distress. This was no time to think about risks. We were aware that prevention is the best cure. We also prepared the blueprint for the second Indian team which went into Wuhan for the next batch of Indians,’’ said Dr. Gupta.

On Monday, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan presented the team from RML Hospital and Safdurjung Hospital, an appreciation letter from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for their “grit, determination and compassion”, and successfully evacuating a total of 645 India citizens and seven Maldivan citizens from Wuhan.

The appreciation letter from the PM read: “In such a scenario, the evacuation of Indian citizens in distress has not only given relief to those rescued but has also reassured the Indian diaspora settled across the globe that in time of crisis, the entire nation stands firmly united. Your indefatigable effort inspires every citizen to serve the nation with dedication and commitment”.

277,2020/02/18,"Farmers storm Noida Authority complex, seek compensation","They demand increased payout in compensation for acquired land and residential plots

Hundreds of farmers from 81 local villages stormed the Noida Authority complex on Monday demanding 64% increase in compensation for acquired land, residential plots of the size equal to 10% of acquired land, and settlement of issues regarding houses which fall in the abadi land (rural land used for residential purposes).

These have been long-standing demands, but there has been a spurt in the protest since last week when 11 farmers were arrested. Keeping this mind, the district administration has imposed Section 144 in Gautam Buddh Nagar for a month. Farmers of Greater Noida have also joined the protest. On Monday, AAP MP Sanjay Singh and MLA Raghav Chadha addressed the farmers and supported their demands.

Ravi Kumar, a farmer leader, said they welcomed the support of AAP. “The officials know our demands for a long time but they are not taking any action,” he alleged, adding that farmers should not be made to pay the price of development.

Rajendra Yadav, State president of Bharatiya Kisan Sangathan, said the Authority was working as a commercial enterprise and was not looking after the interests of farmers. “The problem arose because the officials did not survey the land properly. Every piece of land, including schools and colleges, in these 81 villages is in the name of the Noida Authority now. We gave up farmland for development, not our residences and educational institutions. When we ask for residential plots, which is our right, they say we are squatting on the Authority’s land,” he said.

Mr. Yadav said the Allahabad HC had directed the State government to hike the compensation by 64% in 2011. “Some farmers were even given the amount.

Mr. Singh also criticised Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over a host of issues, especially the law and order situation in the State.

Stating that Delhi has sent out a message that “politics of hate” will not work against “politics of work”, the AAP MP claimed that only a party which gives good education, healthcare, cheap power and water and helps the cause of the common person would win the elections.

Mr. Lakra said, “I was with the Congress from 2013 to 2015. Before that I was not with any political party. I joined AAP in 2017 and the party decided to give me a ticket. I consider myself very lucky that the party chose me.” He said he switched to AAP because of its ideology, image and its work. “I was impressed by their good work and their type of politics,” he said.

Work for vikas

The MLA said he would work for the development of rural areas. “I will work for the vikas of the villages and also work on the Sports University, which has already been approved by the government,” Mr. Lakra said. “We will also make schools in the area better and provide better medical facilities. This will be my focus area,” he added.

The AAP MLA who lives with his wife, three children and their families, said he used to be involved in social work even before he joined the Congress. When asked about getting a party ticket less than three years of joining AAP, Mr. Lakra said, “I was doing work on the ground and the party was impressed with it.”

Mr. Lakra, 61, was born in Mundka. He said his father did farming and was also a businessman. The MLA did a diesel mechanic course from ITI Pusa in 1978-1979. “My three sons are into property dealing,” he said, adding that they also have few farm fields in Delhi.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2p76um/article30846630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE17AAP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/i-consider-myself-lucky-to-get-party-ticket-richest-aap-mla/article30846632.ece
281,2020/02/18,‘Fulfilling poll promises will be top priority of AAP govt.’,"Cabinet Ministers talk of working towards Delhi’s development

The new Cabinet took charge at the Delhi Secretariat on Monday with Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s government stating that its biggest priority would be fulfilling the promises made in the Guarantee Card and the Aam Aadmi Party’s manifesto.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia presided over back-to-back meetings with officials concerned of both departments soon after resuming office.

Sisodia on Budget

“The Budget, which will be tabled in the Delhi Assembly in March, is among our priorities,” he said.

At a meeting with senior officers of the Finance Department, Mr. Sisodia had stressed on the need to eradicate departmental corruption by income tax officers.

“It is important to take steps to wipe out departmental corruption...setting up effective revenue targets should be our next course of action,” he said.

He also held a meeting with officials of the Education Department where he gave several instructions, including speeding up work on two new universities — the Delhi Skills and Entrepreneurship University and the Sports University — and repairing the outer wall of all schools under the government’s jurisdiction.

After resuming charge, Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said: “The Guarantee Card will be my priority... the government will work on further strengthening Delhi’s transport system.”

Clean water 24x7: Jain

Delhi Jal Board (DJB) head Satyendar Jain said: “Fulfilling the targets of AAP’s manifesto will be my priority along with the Guarantee Card. I will also work hard to bring Mohalla Clinics within a radius of 1km for every citizen across Delhi. I will also work to provide clean water 24x7.”

Development Minister Gopal Rai said: “The new government will reach every level of society and work will be done keeping in mind the needs of the most disadvantaged sections. The people of Delhi have new expectations and are looking forward to delivery of the Delhi’s development model today. People are discussing this model across the country and we will ensure its expansion.”

Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said: “We will work for the development of people from every class. The people have supported AAP wholeheartedly and this is our time to return this faith.”

Food and Supply Minister Imran Hussain said: “The government wants to make Delhi a world-class city. Keeping this in mind, the manifesto and the Guarantee Card, the emphasis will be on fast implementation.”

“We have to continue to work on improving the infrastructure of our schools. We need to speed the installation of CCTV cameras and ensure more new classrooms. Effective utilisation of the School Management Committee funds is also important,” Mr. Sisodia added.

An official, close to the government, said there will be fewer big announcements compared to the 2015 government as they will be implementing promises and many of the schemes are already in the pipeline.

“We will work on giving free rides for students in buses. We will look into the feasibility of issuing passes to the students for the same and also work on making cables underground across the city,” the official said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/fulfilling-poll-promises-will-be-top-priority-of-aap-govt/article30846629.ece

283,2020/02/18,Pulicat’s overlooked monuments are a testament to its archaeological beauty,"As Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha culminated in the port town last weekend, organisers led a heritage trail along its centuries-old structures

The Dutch cemetery has a startling macabre beauty.

Its tombs rise unexpectedly, as we drive down a dusty street in Pulicat, bustling with bicycles and goats. Skeletons painstakingly carved into stone, stand guard at the gates, welcoming visitors. A short distance away, lies the Portuguese cemetery, its graves gradually being colonised by the local, tenacious thorny scrub.

Pulicat, better known locally as Pazhaverkadu, has hosted waves of invaders, traders and visitors for centuries, absorbing their religions and traditions to create a rich and remarkable social fabric, built on acceptance rather than resistance.

Appropriately enough, the Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha, a month-long celebration of the cultural threads that make Chennai unique, culminated at Pulicat last weekend. The day-long event included a Nature trail, of course. The region is well-known for its rich bio-diversity and flamboyant flamingoes. However, in a bid to highlight other facets of this ancient port town, the event also included a heritage trail, which began at the cemetery.

The Arabs, who arrived more than a thousand years ago, were followed by the Portuguese, drawn to India’s spices and cotton in 1502.

In 2007, the Art and Architecture Research, Development and Education (AARDE ) Foundation, a not-for-profit architecture and design service organisation found an old Portuguese cemetery when scanning the area on Google Maps.

Reliable information on the area and its rich history is elusive. Fortunately Xavier Benedict, the founder of AARDE and his team, have been pro-actively tracking down old documents, maps and other records to reconstruct as much of the past as possible: an important task, given how Pulicat and its monuments can easily be overlooked since it is largely off the tourist trail.

For instance, Our Lady Of Glory, a wooden church dating back to 1555 (making it one of India’s oldest churches) was demolished in 2008. It has been replaced by a large, modern church, and the only remnant from the past is a graceful wooden statue of Mary, which as local legend goes, fell off a Portuguese ship and was found by a fisherman centuries ago.

Time has stood still at Saint Anthony’s shrine, however, set in the heart of the village. This little brick chapel, built in the 18th Century, has a tiled roof and simple altar adorned with little other than candles and dappled sunshine streaming though the windows. It is empty and hushed, except for snatches of murmured conversations from fishermen mending their nets outside, punctuated by birds chirruping as they dive through the space.

At the entrance of Samayeswarar temple, which dates back to the 10th Century Chola dynasty, the wall is supported by wooden pillars and a tree, its roots coiled around the bricks. The roof, exposed to sun and rain, bears delicate, intricate carvings in wood. This temple also has a stepwell, made of bricks and lime mortar.

The heritage trail winds through Chinna Pallivasal mosque, formally known as Al Masjid ul Muzarraf constructed in 1708 AD. Locals chat about how the Arabs settled in Pulicat, and how a section of the locals still have Arab features. The mosque is known for its century-old sun dial installed in 1915.

After the tour ends, I track down Xavier, curious about the history of a ramshackle building we explored, set in the local hospital complex.

It turns out to be a Dutch tax collection office dating back to 1640. Discussing how Pulicat is full of archaeological gems like this, Xavier explains why the area is so fascinating: “this is the oldest maritime heritage on the Coromandel coast,” he says, adding that they excavated Fort Geldria, the site of India’s first European fort, with the ASI (Archaeological Survey of India ) in 2013. “The foundation is still there. Though it’s covered with thorny bushes.”

He adds that the port was best known for exporting cotton, and says the Arabs came first, followed by the Portugese and Dutch. Pulicat also drew French, Armenians and Spanish traders thanks to its unique geography.

“You can’t separate culture and Nature. Because of the natural values, people were able to converge here for trade. You need shallow water for ships to anchor,” he says.

There is one more factor: wind. “Nature is Pulicat’s advantage,” says Xavier, adding “Vasco Da Gama started using wind for movement, and the Portuguese realised in Pulicat, the North-East monsoon moves ships away from the coast, perfect for export. Then, during the South-West monsoon, winds bring ships to us.”",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/txcstt/article30852069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19MPPULICATDUTCHCEMETERY,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/discovering-the-archaeological-gems-of-pulicat/article30852071.ece
284,2020/02/18,To the beats of janggu,"The contrasting musical cultures of India and Korea were on display at this multi-genre performance

On a Monday evening at Bharata Kalakshetra Auditorium, the beats from the traditional Koream drum, janggu, set the mood for what was to follow. A concert series titled Same Same But Different, conceived and produced by the Korean music group, Noreum Machi since 2013, to introduce its international collaborations with artistes across the world, was underway.

In this edition, which premièred in Chennai, they worked in tandem with renowned contemporary dancer and choreographer Astad Deboo, and Trayam, an ensemble of three Indian musicians, featuring percussionist BC Manjunath, singer and flautist Varijashree Venugopal and percussionist and composer, Praveen D Rao.

The concert began with the percussionist-trio of Noreum Machi, playing the traditional drum, janggu (shaped like an hourglass), which is emblematic of Korean music. Led by Ju Hong Kim, artistic director of Noerum Machi, the percussionists impressed the audiences with their dynamic beats.

Trayam, then presented a musical performance — a battle of rhythm and melody, dominated by konnakol by Manjunath and Carnatic vocals by Varijashree.

Speaking of the collaboration, Praveen said, “We understood what is different, and what is similar between Indian and Korean music. The two traditions are like two banks of a river, that never meet, but this musical experiment has made even that possible. Blending the rhythm of the tabla with the ritualistic musical instrument piri (a double-reed musical instrument, a type of cylindrical oboe) was the greatest challenge,” Praveen said.

Seventy two-year-old Astad Deboo made a poetic entry, when Trayam was performing. His introspective, minimalistic choreography for the rendition of ‘Om Purnamadah Purnamidam’ rendered a trance-like quality. The concert was divided into eight segments. The most anticipated moment was when the entire team of Korean and Indian musicians joined Deboo on stage. A seamless marriage of kayagum and flute, culminated the evening on a high note.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/to-the-beats-of-janggu/article30850756.ece
285,2020/02/18,"Excellence award in hand, Novartis CEO turns nostalgic","‘My grandfather was given an internship at Ciba Geigy, which later became Novartis’

Novartis CEO Vasant (Vas) Narasimhan, who received the prestigious Genome Valley Excellence at BioAsia 2020 on Tuesday, went down the memory lane recalling how his grandfather was offered an internship in Ciba Geigy, the firm that would later become Novartis.

Expressing gratitude to his grandparents and parents for the sacrifices they made to see their children do well in life, the Indian-origin head of the global pharma major said his grandfather graduated from the Delhi University in Pharmacology.

“One of the most remarkable stories of his journey is shortly after graduating, he went to Pune to work in the pharmaceutical firms that were developing there. He was given an internship to actually go to Basel to Ciba Geigy which, of course, would later become Novartis, the company I am here as the CEO,” he said to loud applause from the packed hall in HICC here.

Mr. Narasimhan said the award was an incredible honour and it also was a time to reflect that he was standing on the “shoulders of giants, including being on this stage [because of his] grandparents”, who hailed from Tirupati, and his parents. He also played a few pictures of his family, including one of his grandparents.

Sharing a few perspectives on ‘Reimagining Medicine’ and some of the big trends shaping the pharma industry, he said cell and gene therapies are set to become the future of medicine. He also underscored the significance of improving access to medicines and use technology to improve life expectancy. Speaking on management techniques, he said the need was to have an ‘Unboss culture’. Noting that he would prefer Bhagavat Gita for lessons in leadership and man management, he said people drove performance.

The Novartis-Hyderabad centre is the second largest for the company and employed 6,000 of the India headcount of 8,000. The facility here played a pivotal role in bringing the latest innovations with the support of technology that could solve many problems of the world.

Stating this, he announced the launch of Biome India, a digital innovation hub in Hyderabad and the first such in Asia. Through Biome India, Novartis will engage with startups and innovators passionate about healthcare. The other Novartis Biomes are in San Francisco, Paris and London.

A release said the digital innovation hub here is aimed at boosting the connection and interaction between Novartis and partners from across the digital ecosystem, from nimble startups and academia to the biggest players in the industry. It will act as a bridge to the external ecosystem, enabling Novartis teams to better discover, develop and drive collaborations that transform innovative initiatives into impactful and scalable solutions for patients.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/89xjyl/article30854529.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18-BIO-ASIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/excellence-award-in-hand-novartis-ceo-turns-nostalgic/article30854530.ece
286,2020/02/18,Humanity takes over survival instincts,"Labourers who had a close shave rush to help those trapped in the car that came crashing down

A group of labourers working at vegetable market under Baharat Nagar Road Over Bridge (RoB) were jolted by the sudden noise of a car and cement railing crashing to ground from over 20-foot height on Monday midnight. Before they could make sense of what had fallen a few feet away from them, their survival instincts kicked in and some of them ran for their life.

Yet, reeling under the shock, they gathered courage and went to rescue those who were caught in the vehicle. While driver Sunil (22) and four others suffered injuries, Sohail (27) died on the spot.

A large area under the RoB in Bharat Nagar is occupied by the vegetable market. Wholesalers and labourers are usually involved in brisk business from dawn. Throughout the night, lorries and auto trolleys laden with vegetables arrive.

It was a lucky escape for some labourers who were either unloading crates of vegetables from autos or taking a break on either side of the spot where the car crashed.

Lifting sacks filled with green chillies, Krishna, who was one among the labourers and a witness to the incident, said that his heart skipped upon hearing the loud crash. Folding his hands and looking up to the sky, he said they all were lucky. Another labourer Bandari Kumar said that they were sipping tea when the accident happened. Both were on night duty.

“An auto trolley filled with tomatoes was waiting for an excavator to move so that it could be parked there. The car crashed on the bucket teeth of the excavator. It was a lucky escape for at least six of us since it takes at least two labourers to unload the tomato crates from the auto and four more to carry them to the market. Had the accident happened 10 minutes later, many people would have died ,” said Krishna. Driver of the auto Seenu said that he was sitting in the vehicle when the car came crashing down.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hr1jju/article30854487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19FLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/humanity-takes-over-survival-instincts/article30854488.ece
287,2020/02/18,Goyal moots meet on pharma industry issues,"Eyes mid-March for the meeting; suggests participation of leading medical schools, universities and govt. bodies too

Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal has proposed a meeting of pharma industry to discuss issues that it faced and find solutions to them.

“Sometime in the second week of March, I will get the pharma industry together to spend a day with me. Let’s dissect various issues plaguing the industry,” he told the BioAsia 2020 CEO Conclave here on Tuesday.

Heads and top level executives of Novartis, Sun Pharma, Piramal Group, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and MSD spoke on the challenges and opportunities for the industry as well as the work being undertaken to improve access to medicine. Moderating the conclave on ‘Playing Catch up or preparing to lead’, Telangana Industries and IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao highlighted several issues that the industry battled, from IP infringement to price control.

“I heard different suggestions of what we could learn from world examples, [how in] specific products like sterile injectables there is a window of opportunity for India to take pole position. The [need for] faster approvals and getting together manufacturing [units], research [institutions] and universities [in] a confluence of stakeholders,” Mr.Goyal said.

He said leading medical schools, universities and government bodies such as CSIR may also be called for the meeting. “I think if all of us sit down and put our heads together, we can find solutions to all these issues, be they clinical trials, environmental concerns, issues around economies of scale, developing better clusters,” he asserted. There is also scope to develop empowered bodies that can look at faster dissemination of problems of the industry and work with State governments and the Centre.

He suggested the meeting towards the conclusion of the conclave, in which the need for continuing tax breaks on research and development expenditure was highlighted by Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories chairman and head of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance Satish Reddy.

“I understand the importance of tax breaks, Satishji,” he said, pointing that the incentive was given at a particular point of time when the country was trying to attract a particular business segment. “For a variety of reasons, one must also accept that there will be always be a sunset [clause] for every impetus given. I think we all have to look at engaging in more innovative ways…” Mr.Goyal said.

On price control, he said it was “here to stay and needed in an emerging economy and [for] taking healthcare to the vast masses. Price control has worked hugely for India”. The Union Minister also added that the Centre’s plan to transform India into a $5 trillion economy would be incomplete without providing quality of life.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/4073x2/article30854181.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18-KTR-PIYUSH-BIO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/goyal-moots-meet-on-pharma-industry-issues/article30854171.ece
288,2020/02/18,Road cutting to be allowed only up to May 15,"GHMC Commissioner tells engineering wing to take up works well before onset of monsoon

No road cutting permissions after May 15, regulation of street vending zones, installation CCTV cameras and delegation of powers to zonal commissioners for the road maintenance works are some of the decisions taken during the meeting chaired by Additional DGP Jitender and GHMC Commissioner Lokesh Kumar on ‘Safe City Project’ on Tuesday.

Mr. Jitender said that about 10,000 cameras have been installed and these have to be synchronised to the Command & Control Room, from where the traffic can be monitored. The facility can be utilised by other agencies like the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWSSB), power distribution companies.

Mr. Lokesh Kumar advised his engineering wing to take up road cutting, restoration and re-carpeting of road works well before the onset of monsoon. All the Zonal Commissioners have been empowered to permit road cuttings, hence they have to coordinate with different stakeholders so that the works are grounded in an organised manner and completed in the stipulated time.

Timelines of the road cuttings and repairs are to be displayed to alert the commuting public with private maintenance agencies directed to go for ‘micro-trenching’ as far as possible instead of ‘open trenching’ and in any case the restoration works should be done in 48 hours, he said. A common ticket for parking fees including those in the upcoming multi-level complexes, vacant land spaces and streetside was discussed as also smart cards for street vendors to enable them to do businesses from a designated place. Alternative sites for those who are likely to be displaced are to be scouted.

The additional DGP observed that the mobility of traffic has increased of late and this was due to cooperation of all departments.

Project Officer, Integrated Tribal Development Agency, Utnoor, Bhavesh Mishra on Tuesday assured the Banjara community of looking into their demand for Forest Rights Act (FRA pattas for forest lands). He also assured the community that Local Scheduled Tribe (LST) certificates would be issued to tribal people as per the given law.

Mr. Mishra was responding to demands made by the community with regard to issue of FRA pattas and LST certificates as many members have been deprived of it. He also suggested the community document its culture and heritage for the benefit of people at large who can acess it on the internet.

At the 281st birth anniversary celebrations of Santh Seva Lal Maharaj organised by the community in town, the Banjaras made a forceful demand for increase in percentage of reservations to Scheduled Tribes to 10 % based on the composition of population. The elders in the community were of the opinion that getting enhanced reservation would even end the Adivasi-Lambada conflict.

Speakers also underscored the need for the community to function as one unified entity. Some of the speakers demanded land for construction of Banjara bhavan at Utnoor as well as release of funds for construction of the bhavan in Adilabad as promised in the previous year.

291,2020/02/18,"TRS govt. influenced by MIM chief, says Piyush Goyal","Union Minister charges KCR with minority appeasement and petty politics against CAA

The Telangana government is indulging in petty politics and minority appeasement, probably under the influence of Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi, in passing a Cabinet resolution against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), charged senior BJP leader and Union Railways, Industries Minister Piyush Goyal.

“It is sad and unfortunate that the K. Chandrasekhar Rao government has taken the stand against an Act passed by Parliament. It is nothing but insulting the Parliament, freedom fighters, Dr. Ambedkar and going against the Indian Constitution. I urge the government to take back the resolution,” he said on Tuesday.

At a press conference, flanked by his Cabinet colleague G. Kishan Reddy, TS party president K. Laxman and others, Mr. Goyal asserted that CAA is the “law of the land” and will have to be implemented as “in a federal structure the States cannot refuse to implement a Central law”.

The BJP leader said he was happy to note IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao talking of Centre-State cooperation in Delhi at a recent event but realised the scene was different here as TRS has joined other parties like Congress and Majlis in resorting to “scare mongering the minorities against the CAA and dividing people”.

“CAA has nothing to do with Indian nationals. There will be no harassment or injustice. The Act is only meant for religious minorities facing religious persecution in neighbouring Islamic nations. Where else will Sikhs, Jains, Christians and Hindus facing discrimination from these nations go? It is the duty of all Indians to provide them shelter,” he said.

The Modi government had never indulged in religious politics whereas it was the TRS government which gave “false assurances” on 12% quota for Muslims struck down by the High Court and now pending in the Supreme Court, maintained Mr. Goyal. Hence, it has no ethical right to comment on so called religious discrimination of the BJP government. “We never discriminated on religious grounds in any of our welfare schemes be it gas/power connections, housing, bank accounts, etc., as we believe all religions have equal rights,” he said.

With reference to recent Delhi polls, the Union Minister said even Arvind Kejriwal did not lend support to Shaheen Bagh protests and people vote on basis of various local issues too.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/w4ll5i/article30853232.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19PYUSHGYOEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/trs-govt-influenced-by-mim-chief-says-piyush-goyal/article30853233.ece
292,2020/02/18,1 killed as car falls off Bharatnagar RoB,"One person was killed and five sustained injuries when their car fell off a Road Over Bridge (RoB) in Bharatnagar late on Monday night. Car driver Sunil (22), allegedly crashed it into the RoB cement railing and the vehicle plunged from over 20 ft height on to a road adjacent to a vegetable market.

Sohail (27), who was sitting beside the driver died on the spot. The driver was not found to be drunk, said Sanathnagar sub-inspector M Mohan Reddy. The police suspect rash and negligent driving led to the accident that occurred at around 2.15 a.m. Sunil was not arrested as he was undergoing treatment for head injury. All the injured are recuperating at Gandhi Hospital.

The victim Sohail, a resident of Pandit Nehru Nagar, Borabanda manages a hotel in Sanathnagar limits. He along with his cousin also by the same name Sohail, friends Irfan, Ashwaq, Ghouse, and driver Sunil went out for tea late in the night. They were returning home from Bharatnagar.

There is a vegetable market at the spot where the car plunged into, which would usually be crowded during day-time. Close to the accident spot, an excavator, autos and lorries were parked by the side of the road. Workers were either unloading the stock or taking a break when the car crashed a few metres from them.

293,2020/02/18,"1 killed, 5 injured as car falls off flyover in Cyberabad","Similar accident occurred at Biodiversity Park flyover in November 2019

One person died and five were injured when a car fell off a flyover on Monday midnight. The vehicle dropped from over 20 feet on to a road near a vegetable market area in Sanathnagar.

Sanathnagar Police Sub-Inspector S. Mohan Reddy said that Sohail (22), who was seated beside the driver, died on the spot. Driver Sunil (22) and four others sustained injuries. Sunil did not appear to be drunk, he said.

In a similar accident in November 2019, a speeding car fell off the Biodiversity Park flyover, resulting in the death of a woman and injuries to at least three persons.

A large portion under the flyover in Sanathnagar functions as a vegetable market, with sellers and labourers being involved in brisk business from dawn. Throughout the night, lorries and autorickshaws arrive laden with vegetables. It was a lucky escape for some labourers who were either unloading crates of vegetables or taking a break on either side of the spot where the car crashed.

Still reeling from the shock, a worker, Krishna, said that his heart skipped a beat on hearing the sound of the crash. Though they initially ran for their lives, they later went to the rescue of the five people in the car.

“A lorry filled with tomatoes was supposed to be parked at the spot where the car crashed. But for some reason it waited at a distance for 10 minutes. We were sipping tea a little away from the spot when the accident occurred,” said Bandari Kumar, who was among those who went to help the injured.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/142131/article30849095.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Hyd-accident,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/1-killed-5-injured-as-car-falls-off-flyover-in-cyberabad/article30849153.ece

WEHUB signed an MoU with University of Basel, Switzerland, on Monday at the inauguration of BioAsia 2020. It is aimed at gaining deeper understanding of the functioning of the respective ecosystems and the industry landscape.

The purpose of structuring the programme was aimed at ensuring that startups could scale up and sustain through global market access as also to support those engaged with access to programmes, mentoring, industry specific trainings/workshops, technical and business expertise. It also envisaged technology transfer and cross learning to enable entrepreneurs working in similar fields to cross-collaborate across industry borders.

295,2020/02/18,Outdated mortuary at OGH raises a stink,"OGH mortuary in dire need of a new building, modern facilities

Almost two years since former Health Minister C. Laxma Reddy announced about modernising mortuaries across the State, there seems zero progress on that front.

Take the example of the mortuary at Osmania General Hospital, which is in dire need of a new building as well as modern facilities. “The current building has leaks leading to dampness in walls. It needs regular repairs. Fluid waste from the mortuary is released into regular drainage. So, a separate facility is required to treat the waste and release it,” sources said, pointing to the threat to people’s health due to the existing conditions there. Autopsy on highly decomposed bodies, those with various diseases, are also performed at the mortuary.

Every year, over 5,000 post-mortem examinations are conducted at the mortuary with bodies brought in from various districts. After reports of rats chewing on preserved bodies surfaced in Decemeber 2017, new freezers were provided. However, it led to space crunch.

Sources said that doctors from other departments in the hospital shy away from stepping anywhere near the mortuary because of the pathetic conditions. The stench there is so strong that it is almost impossible for one to walk past the building without holding up their nose. “Work conditions badly need to improve,” a source said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/outdated-mortuary-at-ogh-raises-a-stink/article30846563.ece
296,2020/02/18,"Run more local trains, travellers’ body urges Railways Minister","The Suburban Train and Bus Travellers Association has appealed to Railways Minister Piyush Goyal to advise SCR authorities for the introduction of MMTS trains during peak hours on the Bolarum-Secunderabad section and extend a few existing Express trains up to Malkajgiri station.

General secretary of the association, Noor said that electrification of Medchal-Secunderabad has been completed fulfilling a long-standing demand, yet no trains were being run. Just about nine services are being run and these are irregular and not at all conducive to passengers including office-goers, students and businessmen.

Several passengers are forced to go to Kacheguda or even Lingampalli to catch the special trains since they originate from there. Introduction of new trains from Nizamabad/Malakjgiri to Kurnool and construction of road under-bridges and subways along the Malkajgiri-Medhcal section are among the association’s demands.

It also called for development of Safilguda station so that Secunderabad station can be de-congested by allowing trains towards Kazipet. The Malkajgiri station has also become popular, and a second platform along with lifts are badly needed here, it said.

A representation to this effect would be presented to Mr. Goyal during the railway function being held at the Secunderabad station on Tuesday, said the general secretary.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/run-more-local-trains-travellers-body-urges-railways-minister/article30846521.ece
297,2020/02/18,"India’s first CoE for gaming, VFX and computer vision opens in Hyderabad","10,000-sq.ft. facility targets incubation of 25 to 30 startups annually for the next five years

India’s first Centre of Excellence (CoE) for gaming, VFX, computer vision and AI was opened here on Monday.

Set up by Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) and backed by Telangana government, IMAGE is the first Incubation centre for companies focused on IP in gaming, VFX, computer vision and AI.

STPI-IMAGE also signed MoU with five partners — Telangana VFX, Animation and Gaming Association (TVAGA), Hyderabad Angels, HYSEA, IIIT-Hyderabad and TiE — with an objective to nurture and promote startups and budding entrepreneurs by offering mentoring, technology support, infrastructure like plug and play incubation, Mocap, CVAI labs and funding.

₹20-crore investment

The 10,000-sq.ft. CoE inside the existing STPI facility targets incubation of 25 to 30 startups annually for the next five years. A total investment of ₹20 crore would be made over a period of five years for the CoE in addition to existing infrastructure in the STPI facility.

Industries and IT Principal Secretary Jayesh Ranjan, who was the chief guest for the soft launch, said it was matter of great satisfaction that STPI was focusing on a gaming and VFX CoE. If it was not for STPI some 25 years ago, the IT industry would not have developed in Hyderabad, he said. Now STPI was pushing Indian IT industry into product development and setting up CoEs across the country for different verticals.

Mr. Ranjan said Hyderabad was the appropriate choice for the CoE on gaming and it could become the go-to destination for every one in this area. “We have a strong eco-system and the city hosts world-leading gaming companies and events of global scale. India’s biggest IMAGE towers will soon open in Hyderabad,” he said.

Hyderabad top choice

STPI director general Omkar Rai said Hyderabad was a natural choice to set up the IMAGE CoE due to its inherent industry strengths. The CoI would bring a paradigm shift in revving up research and innovation in gaming,VFX, computer vision and AI in collaboration with tech partners, industry, investors, industry associations and government, and will bolster indigenous product development and growth of tech entrepreneurship in the country, he explained.

Mr. Rai said this was the seventh CoE that was set up among the domain specific CoEs set up so far across the country to facilitate startups of the day to get necessary support. Originally, the plan was to set up eight CoEs, but now 21 CoEs would be set up and the number could go up to 28 with ₹600 crore expenditure coming from all the stakeholders including the State and Centre. Overall, 1,000 veteran industry leaders of 28 CoEs would mentor close to 2,000 startups.

Govt. as enabler

Chief mentor of the CoE, Shashi Reddy said Hyderabad like Bay Area, would help in grooming innovative ideas and most importantly, the government was playing the role of enabler leaving the main job of development to industry leaders.

HYSEA COO Srinivas Rao said the association would provide seed funding, strategy guidance and market access besides helping the startups on matters related to product definition.

298,2020/02/18,The long wait for 24/7 post-mortems,"Officials say round-the-clock PMEs possible only if additional faculty is appointed; post-graduates evince interest in joining govt. services

As if the death of a loved one isn’t traumatic enough, grieving family members often end up spending a painfully long time at mortuaries to claim the body and begin funeral rites. The waiting period goes much beyond tolerable limits if the body is taken to the mortuary post ‘working hours’.

In cases the body is taken for post-mortem after 4 p.m., the closing time, the bereaved family members have to wait as long as 17 hours.

The wait becomes even more agonising for those from far-away districts who arrive in Hyderabad without any idea of the accommodation facilities or access to basic facilities such as food and transport.

Post-mortem examinations (PME) in State-run hospitals are carried out only between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.

Almost two-and-a-half years ago, a request had been placed before the Telangana government to allow the conduct of PME even during the night, but it has not been acted upon so far.

Acute shortage

Health officials maintained that PMEs can be performed round the clock only if additional faculty is appointed and that not many are keen on joining the forensic medicine department. Post graduates in that specialisation, however, said that they are willing to join government services, especially teaching hospitals.

Forensic Medicine doctors claimed that they regularly get requests from various sections of government officials, including the police, as well as influential members of society, to conduct PME at night so that the waiting time for grieving family members is cut down. “We can help avoid causing further pain to people if this practice is introduced. Additional staff and mortuary technicians also have to be appointed while infrastructure too has to be improved,” a forensic science doctor said.

In response to a Right to Information application filed by Lok Satta Udyama Samstha-Karimnagar president N. Srinivas, the head of Osmania General Hospital’s forensic medicine department, M Taqiuddin Khan stated in 2016: “As of now there is no special directive from government to conduct post-mortems during nights for RTA (Road Traffic Accident) death”.

It was added that they are obliged to perform medico-legal work at any time provided the investigating authorities carry due authorisation documents with them.

Mr Srinivas requested Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao in May 2017 to direct officials concerned to conduct PME round the clock. “But I did not get any response to the letter. Post mortems are performed round the clock in States like Gujarat, Goa and Karnataka. A lot of people will be relieved if it is practised in our State too,” he said.

A Health official, however, explained, “Acute shortage in the department is the main constraint. Very few people joined during recruitment.”

Head of forensic medicine department at Gandhi Hospital, T. Krupal Singh said that just like in neighbouring States, an allowance should be given if one performs PMEs at night.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/nx6usz/article30846455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17-GANDHIHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/the-long-wait-for-247-post-mortems/article30846441.ece
299,2020/02/18,Teenager accused of shop-lifting dies,"The Intermediate student collapsed outside a departmental store in Hyderabad

An intermediate student died a few minutes after he walked out of DMart hypermarket at Vanasthalipuram without paying the money for chocolates he allegedly picked up on Sunday, police said.

The victim, from Jogi Tanda in Suryapet district, was pursuing his second year intermediate from Sri Chaitanya Junior College (Residential), Hayathnagar branch.

Outing

On Sunday morning, he along with three other students came on an outing, police said.

Around 9 p.m.. they went to DMart to buy footwear. “As they didn’t like the models on display, they decided to leave the store, before which the youngster picked a few chocolates and put them in his pocket,” Vanasthalipuram inspector A. Venkataiah said.

“A sales executive who noticed this alerted the security, who in turn asked the teenagers to return for checking. While going back to the store, the youngster suddenly collapsed and was rushed to a nearby private hospital where he was declared dead,” he said.

However, the victim’s parents on Monday alleged that their son was beaten to death by DMart staff for allegedly stealing chocolates and also accused the college management for letting the victim go on outing without their consent.

Parents stage protest

They staged demonstrations outside the store and the college.

“The video footage of surveillance cameras clearly shows that the boy collapsed before reaching the security -- and so far, we are not suspecting any foul play,” the inspector said.

The youngsters parents told police that they were not aware of the outing. However, the college management maintained that they called the victim's local guardian, his cousin, who agreed for ‘self-outing’.

Police suspect that the teenager had a panic attack and died.

“However, the exact cause of death can be known only after the post-mortem report,” Mr. Venkataiah said.

300,2020/02/18,Former OU student found dead in hostel room,"K. Narsaiah completed PhD in Geography last year

A 45-year-old man was found dead in a hostel in Osmania University on Monday afternoon.

According to police, the victim, Kompally Narsaiah, who finished his PhD in Geography last year, committed suicide by consuming poison on Sunday afternoon.

However, the incident came to light at around 2 p.m. on Monday when his friends noticed a newspaper lying outside the door and after he was not responding to the repeated knocks.

“As there was no response from inside, the students opened the window and found him lying unconscious. The students opened the bolt using a bamboo stick from the window,” Osmania University Inspector Rajashekar Reddy said.

He said that by the time the students went inside, Narasiah’s body started decomposing and blood was oozing out from the nose. Forensic experts at the Gandhi Hospital, who conducted autopsy, opined that the victim consumed an unknown poison and died, Mr Reddy said.

Narasiah hails from Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district, police said. The investigators said that they didn’t find any note left behind by the victim and are yet to ascertain the reason behind the extreme step. “We will once again search all the books in his room to see if he had left any suicide note,” Mr. Reddy said.

Meanwhile, mild tension prevailed as a large number of students held a protest demonstration in front of the hostel and prevented the police from shifting the body to the morgue.

Eleven students were taken to custody and were let off by evening.

301,2020/02/18,"STPI to promote incubation centres in tier II, II cities","Vijayawada is one of the 11 centres picked up in the initial phase

Omkar Rai, Director General, Software Technology Parks of India, said that 28 Centres of Excellence will be set up in a year for mentoring domain-specific start-ups.

Speaking to media persons on the sidelines of the launch of IMAGE Centre of Excellence for Gaming, VFX, Computer Vision and AI here on Monday, he also said that Next generation of Incubation Centres (NGIC) were being launched by the Union Ministry of Electronics and IT exclusively in tier two and three cities soon.

The STPI will be the implementing agency for the NGICs. The idea is to make sure that smaller towns and cities with lot of potential talent too can be brought on the same page where the Tier 1 start-ups are standing now, he says.

The STPI picked up 11 locations for the initial phase including Vijayawada in Andhra Pradesh, Mohauli, Patna, Bhopal, etc. “We want to support and focus on smaller towns. We will provide mentor support, initial seed funding support, Plug and Play infrastructure, labs with up to ₹100 crore operational expenditure. The process has started and the Vijayawada centre and other centres will function in three months,” he said.

The STPI will support the NGICs for three years and for 28 CoE, it will be for five years. The CoEs and NGICs in the vicinity will converge and talk to each other to create better synergy.

Exports

He disclosed that the STPI exports for 2018-19 stood at ₹4.24 lakh crore. Recently, NASSCOM announced that overall export has grown from $ 136 billion to $147 billion and overall revenue from the IT and Electronics has grown from $ 177 billion to $ 191 billion. But most importantly, the full focus of the government is towards making India a software product nation.

“Right now the software product market in India is close to $ 8 billion to $ 9 billion and world over the software product market stands at more than $ 500 billion. Under the new national software product policy approved by the Union Cabinet, NGICs were being launched. “Our target is to ensure India also reaches $ 70 billion to $ 80 billion software product market by 2025, export plus domestic. We want tier 2 and 3 cities also should contribute to this target. We are doing very well in terms of software exports and IT services. We are the largest outsourcing destination.

302,2020/02/18,"Wanandaf, Bengaluru’s hip hop collective, breaks barriers with rap","Wanandaf has performed electrifying cyphers at public spaces, including Town Hall and MG Road, on varied topics including politics, mental health and feminism

In June, 2019, rappers Nex, Akx, producer Cj, and videographer Karim Poocha shot a small cypher video in Lalbagh. They uploaded it on social media and announced their next performance at Rangoli, MG Road. Defying all expectations, hundreds of rappers and producers turned up. And that is how Wanandaf, a hip hop collective, became a sensation in Bengaluru’s art scene.

Agaahi Raahi, Innerrhymes, Akx and Karim Poocha (the core group of Wanandaf) talk about their journey so far and how all their performances have been powerful and of high standard. If you have attended their performances at Town Hall, where Siyasat was performed by Nex, who raps in Dakhani, or at Cubbon Park (which the collective call their home) or Innerrhymes’ cypher about mental health, there is no need for words to describe their performances. However, if you haven’t, then ‘powerful’, ‘relevant’, ‘stirring’, and ‘electrifying’ are some words that come to mind.

Agaahi Raahi says the cypher at Rangoli in MG Road was charged with excitement over rap. “It had even started to rain, but no one cared, we continued to perform.” Innerrhymes adds: “People kept joining in. A group of people were free-styling at one end with rappers on the other.” By the end of it, 100 people were added to their Whatsapp group. “We even had rappers from other states joining in,” adds Akx, who then claims: “After our cypher, rappers from Lucknow and Ahmedabad started their own collective.”

Wanandaf breaks all barriers, including religion, caste, class, and language. The artistes come from varied backgrounds and rap in different languages, including Hindi, English, Telugu, Dakhani and Urdu.

Tracing his journey, Akx, a conscious rapper in Hindi, says: “When I came to Bangalore in 2017, I did spoken word performances. I rap about what it means to have been raised as a middle-class boy and about what is going through my mind. One day I found a Bangalorean rapper Young Dirtt on VH1. I finally met Smokey, who is one of my inspirations, and that is how I became a rapper.”

He adds: “It was hard to find a videographer, though, who was interested in shooting us and who also knows about hip hop.” He eventually found out about Karim Pooch and Nex. “The three of us got talking. I thought that is all we need to start a scene in Bangalore. I then introduced Nex and Karim Poocha to Smokey. All of us met and it was then we decided to name our collective Wanandaf.”

Karim adds: “Every Bangalorean will relate to Wanandaf, it is a take on auto driver demanding one-and-a-half meter fare.”

Innerrhymes vouches for Wanandaf’s strict adherence to standards. “When we put out a certain kind of quality, people’s expectations of us would be high.” When asked if they are careful with their lyrics, they unanimously say they do not censor themselves or care for censorship. “Rap is protest art,” Akx says and adds: “Nex got a lot of threats because of his performance ‘Siyasat’ at the Bindi and Burqa protest. But that did not stop us from performing and Nex also got a lot of praise, there were people from Mysuru who called to ask him to perform.”

Agaahi Raahi is proud to call himself a feminist. “I tell men there is nothing to fear about this term. I am inspired by my sister. I ask for her perspective on issues and put that in my music,” Agaahi Raahi raps in Hindi about political and social issues. “I was interested in rapping since my school days, but I was not connected with it from 2010. Then I moved to Bangalore in 2017 and later I met Wanandaf.” His track ‘Krodh’, which was released in November, 2019, and is about child marriage, won him quite bit of traction and praise.

An introvert, Innerrhymes says he performs conscious rap. “I rap about mental health, anxiety, depression, and suicidal tendencies.”His track ‘Inner Reveal-ations’ is coming out on March 6. “It has four tracks: ‘Lulla-bye’, ‘Unsent Letters’, ‘Lately’, and ‘Panic Attack’.”

Wanandaf is excited about their uber cool track ‘56: A Song for the City’. “Agaahi Rahi says, “It was released on February 11, ‘56’ is a song for the city by the gang of four who started it all: Nex InnerRhymes, Akx and me. You could say it is Bangalore’s anthem. I recorded one verse and sent it out. Akx said I am riding this beat. I gave a shout out to my friend Alchemii. Innerrhymes heard it, and he decided to join.”

Wanandaf also credits a group called Bangalorean. “There were always rappers in Bangalore, but they didn’t get the exposure they needed,” says Agaahi Raahi. Wanandaf, therefore, aims to bring all the rappers under one umbrella. Karim Pooch says: “Wanandaf now has close to 180 members. We even have French and Arabic rappers.”

As of now, Agaahi Raahi is looking forward to his mixtape Irtiqa-Evolution, which comprises three songs: ‘Mufti’, ‘Jaang’ and ‘Qayaamat’ while Akx’s next song is Doom, which is against caste.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/j839ja/article30860551.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGMWANANDAF,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/breaking-barriers-with-rap/article30852211.ece

The issue had snowballed into a controversy after Mr. Warrier posted an RTI document on February 6 that stated that the organisers of the music event had not remitted the proceeds from the event towards the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund.

‘Karuna’ was held on November 1. A letter sent by the KMF to the secretary of the Regional Sports Centre to provide the Rajiv Gandhi Indoor Stadium at Kadavantra here as the venue for the event had showed that it was being organised as part of raising funds for the relief fund. The stadium was given free of cost for the event as it was meant for raising funds for the flood victims. The KMF had handed over a cheque for ₹6.22 lakh on February 14 after the issue hit the headlines.

Members of the KMF on Tuesday wrote a letter to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking an official investigation into the allegations of financial irregularities in the conduct of the fest. The KMF could not raise the money to cover the expenses through ticket sales and without a sponsor for the event.

306,2020/02/18,‘Green corridor’ to boost seamless commute,"2.5-km stretch between North and South railway stations to be linked to metro stations, KSRTC bus stand

The 2.5-km-long ‘green corridor’ proposed between Ernakulam Town (North) and Junction (South) railway stations is expected to augment seamless integration between different commuting modes, with its promoter agencies set to brainstorm this week on directly linking it with the KSRTC bus stand and the three metro stations en route.

With a preliminary survey for hewing out the corridor completed and a detailed project report expected shortly, officials of the stakeholder agencies arrived here on Monday to take the project forward and to link it with other commuting modes en route. While decongesting arterial roads such as M.G. Road and Chittoor Road, the corridor will also benefit people visiting Ambedkar Stadium located near the KSRTC bus stand, and Lissie Hospital, among others.

Pedestrian-friendly

The 2.5-km corridor beside the tracks that link the two railway stations has been envisaged as a pedestrian-friendly walkway, where only electric buggies and bicycles will be permitted. The existing road distance between the two railway stations is 4.8 km through M.G. Road and 4.4 km through Chittoor Road.

A French consulting firm had been roped in to prepare the feasibility report, while preliminary studies are being funded by French development agency AFD, under Mobilise Your City (MYC) programme.

Land acquisition will be minimal since land owned by the Railway and the Kochi Corporation is available, except for a small stretch in Kaloor. Revenue (or puramboke) land too is available. The Railway is very keen to develop the corridor, which is at present ill-lit and crime-prone. Three murders took place recently in deserted areas near the railway tracks, a haven for criminal elements, said Dennis Jose, city project coordinator for the green corridor.

The Centre for Heritage, Environment and Development (C-HED) under the Kochi Corporation is expected to help process documents and other details, while the AFD will streamline funding of the European Union. New Delhi-based Urban Mass Transit Company (UMTC) under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs will execute the project. City-based think tank Centre for Public Policy and Research (CPPR) too is associated with the initiative.

The visiting delegation is expected to meet the Mayor and two councillors later this week. The Corporation mooted the idea of hewing out such a corridor 15 years ago. It is expected to provide funds for land acquisition.

Value addition

Apart from Kochi, Ahmedabad and Nagpur were selected under the MYC programme, aimed at helping improve infrastructure in developing countries. Residents’ associations and others were keen to realise the project since it would add value to underutilised space in their backyards, said C-HED director Rajan Chedambarath. “The proposed corridor will augment connectivity between the two main railway stations in the city and decongest arterial roads,” said T.J.

307,2020/02/18,Islanders to march to Collector’s camp office,"Protest against prohibitory orders

People on Puthuvype island under the aegis of the Puthuvype LPG Terminal Virudha Janakeeya Samara Samithi will march to the camp office of the District Collector here on March 2 to demand the withdrawal of Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code that is in force around the upcoming LPG import jetty and storage facility.

Prohibitory orders were imposed in the area around midnight of December 15 to prevent disruption of construction work on the LPG jetty and storage complex being built by the Indian Oil Corporation.

A Samithi spokesperson said the district administration had decided to prolong the prohibitory orders in the area for another six months and the decision had not been conveyed to the people. The people in the area were holding a peaceful protest against the LPG facility and the imposition of Section 144 CrPC was not warranted, he claimed.

Residents in the area have protested against the LPG facilities claiming that they posed a threat to their life and property while the IOC has said that the project had received all statutory clearances and it had inducted the latest safety measures.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/9nui6c/article30846731.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17KIIOCPUTHUVYPE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/islanders-to-march-to-collectors-camp-office/article30846732.ece
308,2020/02/18,GCDA seeks 120 days to repair 3.5-km road,"HC raps agency, says erring officials should be held accountable

It would take the Greater Cochin Development Authority (GCDA) 120 days to complete repairing the Kaloor-Kadavanthra Road!

The time required by the GCDA as stated before the Kerala High Court, which is considering a petition on the bad state of city roads, caught the judge by surprise on Monday.

“You require 120 days for the repair of the roads? By that time, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation would construct a bridge,” said Justice Devan Ramachandran, who was considering the case.

Interestingly, the 3.5-km Kaloor-Kadavanthra Road is the only thoroughfare owned by the GCDA in Kochi.

Complaints

People are reporting on the bad condition of city roads, and sending pictures.

The responsibility for the poor upkeep of the roads shall be fixed and the officials held accountable. The State government too would fix the responsibility on erring officials, the judge warned.

The condition of the roads at Vyttila and Kundannoor junctions is very bad.

There were also complaints about the poor condition of Chittoor Road, the judge orally observed.

Lawyers pointed out that the Kerala Water Authority had started digging up Rajaji Road, which was recently re-laid, for laying pipelines.

The court asked the lawyers who were appointed as amici curiae to file a report on the developments.

The court will consider the case again on February 25.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/gcda-seeks-120-days-to-repair-35-km-road/article30846721.ece

310,2020/02/18,Maradu debris removal likely to take more time: SLMC,"Panel urges National Green Tribunal to issue strict directions

The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management has informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that, going by the present pace of work, the removal of debris from the apartment demolition sites at Maradu would not be completed within the 45-day schedule fixed by the Supreme Court.

“It is apt to note that the progress of segregation and removal of waste is not at the expected speed. During the start-up meeting of the Joint Committee [constituted as per the orders of the tribunal], it was informed by the Sub Collector, Kochi, that the time for removal of debris fixed by the Supreme Court is 45 days. If things are moving at the present pace, the process would not be completed within the time specified,” said a report filed by the SLMC before the NGT.

The committee has urged the tribunal to issue strict time-bound directions, the violation of which would entail penal consequences to all concerned, to complete the process of removal of demolition waste from all the four sites in Maradu municipality as per the statutory norms and regulations.

It said that the service providers had sought a longer period for complete removal of the debris. However, neither the SLMC nor the government can extend the time as it is absolutely within the competence of the Supreme Court, according to the report.

The committee pointed out that the Maradu municipality authorities had not been able to collect the updated specific details related to the debris removal. The details given as on February 10 are vague and without specifics.

Windbreakers around the sites as mandated by the statute have not been provided. Sprinkle systems too have not been provided.

Protective measures

Dust mitigation measures have not been displayed at the site for public viewing. No protective measures such as geo-textiles had been provided in the trenches near the lake side of Alfa Serene and Golden Kayaloram to prevent the flow of contaminated water into the backwaters, it said.

The report said physical verification revealed that 40% of steel was segregated and 35% of steel removed from the sites. However, authentic details of storage or recycling units were yet to be submitted.

Waste processing

The logbook details of the sites to which the debris is being transported are not legible. Even though Prompt Enterprises (private agency entrusted with the task of debris removal) claims that a construction-and-demolition-waste processing facility is being set up at Kumbalam, no such facility has been installed there and no waste deposited at the site, according to the report.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/454krz/article30846706.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17KIMARADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/maradu-debris-removal-likely-to-take-more-time-slmc/article30846707.ece

313,2020/02/18,"Drinking water in Bengal basin contains high amounts of toxins, says study","For the first time in India, a whole region has recorded the presence of pesticides and PAH in its natural sources of water and surface sediments

Groundwater as well as river water in the western Bengal basin has high concentrations of pesticides and toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), a study authored by a group of scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur has revealed.

The researchers tested hundreds of samples, both of groundwater and river water, which is used for drinking water supply from the Farraka Barrage to the Sunderbans, and found these chemicals in significantly higher amounts than permissible limits.

Significant findings

The Western Bengal basin has evidence of high concentration of arsenic in groundwater, and according to the researchers, the study assumes significance because, for the first time in the country, a whole region has recorded the presence of pesticides and PAH in its natural sources of water and surface sediments.

“The results of this study suggest the existence of wide presence of POPs (persistent organic pollution pollutants), as pesticide residues and PAHs, detected both in groundwater and river water of areas, variable by land use, which are historically known to be at risk from groundwater arsenic pollution,” reads the paper.

Titled ‘Wide exposure of persistent organic pollution pollutants (PoPs) in natural waters and sediments of the densely populated Western Bengal Basin, India’, the findings of the paper authored by Srimanti Duttagupta and Abhijit Mukherjee of IIT-Kharagpur among others, provides a new dimension to the deteriorating water quality of the region. The paper was published in a leading international peer reviewed environmental journal Science for Total Environment earlier this week.

‘46 times higher’

Samples from more than 230 locations for groundwater, 32 locations for river water and 20 locations for surface sediments across 350 km were recorded for three consecutive years and studied for the presence of pesticides and PAH, Professor Mukherjee said. He pointed out that in some samples, the pesticide content in drinking water was as high as 46 times of the permissible limits.

Srimanti Duttagupta, the lead author of the paper, said that groundwater and river water were tested only from locations at which water is sourced for drinking purposes.

Another important aspect of the study is that it shows spatio-temporal distribution of these chemicals detected predominantly in natural waters. The study also points out that the pesticides and PAHs detected in agricultural and rural areas are distinct from urban settings.

Urban, rural

“While concentration of pesticides is higher in rural areas, particularly in agricultural areas in districts like Murshidabad and Nadia, as we go down, high concentration of PAH is found to rise in urban and semi-urban areas, particularly in North 24 Parganas and south Nadia,” Professor Mukherjee said.

The researchers said PAHs as a group are aromatic hydrocarbons, the most common being napathlene, which are not only released by industrial discharge but also from fuel emissions.

Densely populated

The study has been carried in one of the most populated regions of South Asia, and the presence of hazardous chemicals in groundwater raises concerns over anthropogenic pollution due to local vehicle combustion, biomass burning and industrial combustion, apart from agricultural activities.

Professor Mukherjee said that while arsenic contamination is blamed for most of the deaths due to water contamination, the study provides another aspect for looking into how much pesticides and PAHs in drinking water contribute to the disease burden.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/97m08f/article30845486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Fig1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/drinking-water-in-bengal-basin-contains-high-amounts-of-toxins-says-study/article30845490.ece

316,2020/02/18,‘Revenue loss due to GST may go on after 5 years’,"It is due to structural changes, says latest Odisha Economic Survey

Odisha may continue to sustain loss on account of Goods and Services Tax (GST) even after five years although there was constitutional provision of compensating loss for five years only, says Odisha Economic Survey which was tabled in the State Assembly on Monday.

The introduction of GST in July 2017 had subsumed 17 taxes levied by the Centre and the State under the GST.

“With initial troubleshoot issues related with the implementation of the new tax regime, Odisha has been facing revenue loss,” says the latest Survey.

“As per the constitutional provisions, the State will get compensation towards loss of revenue for five years. However, the State may continue to sustain loss on account of GST even after five years because of the structural changes like the rate structure, abolition of central sale tax and entry tax,” it observes.

As per the Economic Survey, applying 14% growth rate to the base year’s collection, revenue for 2018-19 works out at ₹1,6370.08 crore whereas revenue collection under GST is ₹1,2140.45 crore.

317,2020/02/18,"Land revenue receipt, PAN not proof of citizenship: Gauhati HC","Land revenue-paying receipt, permanent account number (PAN) card and bank documents do not prove the citizenship of a person, the Gauhati High Court has observed.

A Division Bench of Justices Manojit Bhuyan and Parthivjyoti Saikia made this observation on February 12 while dismissing a writ petition filed by one Jabeda Begum against the order passed by a Foreigners’ Tribunal at Tamulpur in western Assam’s Baksa district.

The FT had declared her a foreigner who had entered Assam after 1971, the cut-off year for detection and deportation of illegal immigrants according to the Assam Accord of August 1985.

Ms. Begum had told the FT that the names of her grandparents and parents had appeared in the voters’ list of 1966 while that of her father was in the 1970 list. The High Court agreed with the findings of the tribunal that she could not produce any document that could establish her link with her parents.

The court also referred to a 2016 case of one Md. Babul Islam to reject Ms. Begum’s reliance on certain papers. “This court... has already held that PAN card and bank documents are not proof of citizenship,” the judgment read.

Observing that land revenue-paying receipts and certificates issued by a village headman “can never be proof of citizenship of a person”, the court said the FT was correct in its decision on Ms. Begum while dismissing her petition “devoid of merit”.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/land-revenue-receipt-pan-not-proof-of-citizenship-gauhati-hc/article30846699.ece
318,2020/02/18,Getting practical about fashion with boot camps,"How to source the yarn? Is the dye truly azo free? Creative Bee’s fashion boot camps aim to teach budding designers the basics of textile industry requirements

This March, Hyderabad-based Creative Bee will conduct three ‘Finishing Boot Camps - in fashion and textiles’ to help fashion and design school graduates fine-tune their skills.

Bina Rao, the founder of Creative Bee, speaks from experience when she points out that in the last 25 years that the organisation has been recruiting designers and technical staff, she’s noticed a wide gap between what’s taught in fashion schools and the industry skill sets that fresh graduates need.

This gap, she observes, is prevalent even among students who emerge from reputed design schools, and hands-on training is required to make them industry ready. “There’s so much to be covered in academic curriculum in fashion institutes that there’s not enough time to impart practical knowledge. Once you step into the industry either as an entrepreneur or begin working with a company that has international clients, these graduates are a loss for the first few years without knowing the basics — how to source different types of yarns for small, medium and large scale companies, or how to analyse dyes sold in the market,” says Bina.

Bina Rao

Having used both natural dyes and chemical azo-free dyes, Bina explains that there’s rampant adulteration in the dyes supplied in the market. Most dyes are sold without labels and it’s tough for beginners to test and identify the adulterated dyes from the good ones. Wrong selection of dyes can mar a collection.

Creative Bee’s boot camps or crash courses will be conducted in collaboration with fashion, textile and design industry experts. The first one is a four-day programme focusing on the technicalities of mainstream production and will go into the details of working with dyes, yarn and looms; pre and post-processing techniques such as sourcing and supply, and inventory management.

The second one is a three-day boot camp to help first-time entrepreneurs learn how to set up of an enterprise, taxation, finance, recruitment, marketing, exports, and intellectual property protection. Bina emphasises how crucial it is for designers with a creative bent of mind to also know finance and taxes, “It’s very important to learn these aspects, or you end up paying a penalty at some point.”

The third is a four-day boot camp for those interested in tapping into the emerging area of slow fashion. At a time when eco-friendly, sustainable or slow fashion have become the buzzwords, emerging designers have a lot to gain by mastering the know-hows. “There’s a lot of attention on slow fashion internationally. Graduates need to know everything that goes into making a collection sustainable — where to source alternative fibres and dyes, and what truly is sustainable fashion,” sums ups Bina.

319,2020/02/18,Meet Kaushik Velendra who has come a long way from Kollywood to the runways of London,"From being a spot boy to dressing up the stars and showcasing at the London Fashion Week, this former Chennai boy has had quite an arduous journey to the fashion world

Kaushik Velendra was rejected 16 times before he secured admission into Central St Martins, London. From that batch of 36, he was the only one who was placed in the Masters in Menswear Fashion programme.

Today, five years on, the 29-year-old has dressed supermodels like Alton Mason, and more recently, Ranveer Singh for a recently-concluded award show. If you noticed the actor’s sharp black suit with embellished power shoulders and sleek arms doing its rounds on social media, you should know it is Kaushik’s handiwork.

“That garment is a story of three countries,” says Kaushik, “The beading was done by Jean-Francois Lesage in Paris and Chennai, and the jacket was made by former Alexander McQueen craftspersons, now part of my team in London.”

This power look silhouette is what Kaushik showcased at his Autumn Winter show at London Fashion Week this January. The all-black collection comprised sculptural, body-shaping jackets and pants designed with the aim to enhance posture and flatter the male body. It can make the wearer feel like a super hero, believes the designer.

That showing at London Fashion Week then became Kaushik’s big ticket to other bigger events across the globe. “I got invited for the Grammy Awards, BAFTA and Paris Fashion Week this year,” he says. He dressed Mason for the Grammys and Jack Brett Anderson for the BAFTA party.

While he may be hobnobbing with much of the western pantheon, his aim is to place India on the global fashion map. He says that when one counts the top fashion brands they think of Prada, Armani, Celine, Gucci... but there aren’t any Indian labels on that list.

And with his brand Maison Velendra, that is something he wants to change. Later this month, Kaushik will be on his way to Paris to attend the LVMH awards, for which he is short-listed. Instituted in 2013, it is a prestigious award honouring young fashion designers from around the globe, and one designer and three graduates from fashion schools can win the prize.

Now based out of London, with his fashion label opening offices in Milan, Paris, Los Angeles and New York, Kaushik recalls his formative years in India. He was born in Bengaluru and moved to Chennai in 2008. He worked as a light boy on the sets of Bollywood. He also cleaned garments; part of jobs he did to make money.

“I worked on one half of the Mani Ratnam film Guru. I joined the team to fix and iron clothes. I needed the cash. Then I slowly evolved to assistant costume designer.” says Kaushik. “I was introduced to Kamal Haasan and took care of his clothing. I worked on retail, styling and designing and by 2014 I was done dressing everyone I wanted to,” he says. At that point, as a 22-year-old, he knew he needed to do something else and more to widen his horizon. In 2014, he managed to go to the Cannes Film Festival and showcase a line of menswear. “It’s where I met a lot of people including Uma Thurman and the producers of Pulp Fiction. That is where I was advised to further my skills at Central St Martins.”

And so he did. “That is how it all started. And all it took were 17 attempts and a never-give-up attitude.”",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/ka5cqv/article30851524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19MPKaushik3,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/from-kollywood-to-the-runways-of-london/article30851525.ece
320,2020/02/18,Sri Thumbai Tex offers a range of undyed and unbleached organic cotton underwear,"Clothes that come in contact with our skin should be organic and non chemical, say Yasodha and Muthukumar who manufacture clothes from unbleached and undyed organic cotton

On every second Sunday of the month, Yasodha M gets on a Government bus from her home in Avinashi to Gandhipuram carrying with her two bundles of organic cotton underwear to be sold at the Uzhavar Sandai at the Corporation Higher Secondary School in Vadakovai. She has been making these with her husband Muthukumar Swami for the past one year. “My son is allergic to chemical dyes. We started stitching clothes from unbleached and undyed organic cotton for him. Soon, we started getting orders from people,” she says, as she arranges piles of vests, briefs, slips, panties, bras and shorts on the veranda of the school.

Muthukumar is a textile graduate who has worked in the textile industry for 20 years before setting up his own knitting unit in Tirupur. “I was the manager in the firm I worked at and learnt about different processes from production to sales there. After a point, I felt that I should start something on my own. I started my unit under the name Sri Thumbai Tex seven years ago and we initially produced t shirts,” he says. It has only been one year since they made the shift to organic clothes.

Yasoda’s brother, Senthil Kumar is an organic farmer and he was instrumental in turning them into the organic way of life. “He has worked with agricultural scientist G Nammalvar for 10 years and what he told us was an eye opener. We changed our lifestyle and started to eat organic. We grew our own vegetables and fruits and began frequenting organic markets to buy our essentials,” says Yasodha.

Their next step was to bring it into their business. “We started with inner wear as it is the first layer of clothing that is in close contact with the skin,” she explains. Muthukumar buys organic cotton yarn from Tirupur to knit the fabric. It is then washed before tailoring to prevent shrinkage. “We tailor them in our home in Avinashi. The fabric is ironed before we bundle it for the markets,” Yasodha adds. Muthukumar claims that this is a sustainable model. “One kg of bleached and chemically dyed cotton requires 65 litres of water for its treatment. The water will be polluted and will end up in our soil and water bodies. On the other hand, if we skip this process all that is required is three litres of water and the waste water can go to the soil and it is not overloaded with chemicals,” he says.

Their first sale was at Tiruchi. “We took three bundles unsure how our products would be received. We only had men’s undewear, panties and vests. We were surprised that people liked them and we were sold out by the end of the day,” he adds. Over time, they added more products and now they have shorts, bras, baby dresses and slips. Vijaya R, a customer at the market, says, “My sister has a baby and I bought a pair of dresses for her last month here. Finding unbleached cotton is not easy and so I am here for more,” she says.

The duo has also participated in organic markets in Chennai and Hyderabad. “Awareness on sustainable clothes is still very low. There are people who ask us why our clothes look dull, and we explain to them that it is due to the natural colour of cotton. In such markets, we also get to know our customers directly and also understand what they need. We are now working on night wear,” says Yasodha.

323,2020/02/18,Unused ponds to get new lease of life,"Mission Thelineer to be launched in Kozhikode today

Around 80 ponds in the district that have remained unused for various reasons are getting a rebirth under Mission Thelineer, a project of the Kozhikode District Panchayat being implemented through the Haritha Keralam Mission and Suchitwa Mission. The project that is to be launched on Tuesday by Excise Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan is, however, already under way.

Under the project, civic bodies, including municipalities and the corporation, are expected to identify ponds that can be renovated, so that they come into use during summer. So far, 77 local bodies have identified as many as 80 ponds under disuse that are to be renovated under Mission Thelineer.

Incidentally, the ponds are in different conditions. Some have been rendered useless owing to waste being deposited in them, while some others are full of accumulated silt. A few ponds are not approachable thanks to their location or to shrubbery. Under the project, all such hurdles will be removed so that the water in them could be used for drinking or bathing purpose.

“Most local bodies have scheduled the clean-up for this month. Some will be completed by the first week of March,” said P. Prakashan, district coordinator, Haritha Keralam Mission.

Cleaning is carried out by local clubs and residents’ associations, who are also in charge of upkeep of ponds port-renovation. So far, ponds at Nadapuram, Peringottukavu, Chathamangalam, and Vadakara have been renovated under the project.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/6vvdyb/article30846158.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thelineer,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/unused-ponds-to-get-new-lease-of-life/article30846159.ece
324,2020/02/18,Malabar Tourism Circuit on the cards,"Project envisages linking of village and beach tourism destinations in Koyilandy and Vadakara

A multi-crore tourism development project with financial support from the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) is on the anvil. The project envisages linking of prominent village and beach tourism destinations in Koyilandy and Vadakara Assembly constituencies.

Kitco, a leading technical consultancy organisation, will be preparing a detailed project report (DPR) for the initiative named Malabar Tourism Circuit.

The project is expected to address several pending beautification needs of the region covering Thikkodi beach, Kolavipalam beach, Lokanarkavu Temple, Akalappuzha, Kottakkal, Sargaalaya Crafts Village, and Vadakara sand banks. A few more locations without basic amenities and road connectivity too are likely to be included in the project in consultation with the district tourism authorities.

“We have identified around 11 acres in the Koyilandy Assembly constituency alone for various tourism projects under the Malabar Tourism Circuit initiative. It also includes both private and revenue lands,” said K. Dasan, MLA, Koyilandy. He added that the Vadakara sand banks would have a number of aesthetically designed huts for beach-goers on completion of the project.

For the quick preparation of DPR, the earlier plan to add the Dharmadom beach as well to the Malabar Tourism Circuit has been temporarily put on hold. According to Mr. Dasan, the development of the Dharmadom beach will be undertaken as part of a separate project of the Tourism Department.

The DPR is likely to be submitted to KIIFB within a month. A preliminary report on major development proposals and cost of implementation is now under the consideration of the district tourism authorities. Since the proposal also includes further development of the Sargaalaya Crafts Village with a new light and sound show project, the opinion of the existing management too will be taken into account ahead of the submission of DPR.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/cmausc/article30846104.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18KI-Malabar-rediscoveredcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/malabar-tourism-circuit-on-the-cards/article30846105.ece

The mother of the 17-year-old girl from Ottapidaram in Thoothukudi district said that her daughter, a special child with disabilities, was sexually assaulted by S. Ponraj, 55, when the family members were away. Now her daughter was four months pregnant, she said.

She said that the pregnancy must be terminated in the interest of her daughter. Claiming that the perpetrator belonged to an influential family, the woman sought police protection and an appropriate compensation to the family.

She said that she has filed a police complaint against the accused under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012.

A 60-year-old woman died in a road accident near Sayalkudi here in the district and 29 others, including 14 women, all from Maharashtra, suffered multiple injuries late on Tuesday night.

Police said that the tourist van, which was carrying 30 passengers, had been to Kanniyakumari on Monday. After going around places, they left by Tuesday noon to Rameswaram.

As the vehicle was approaching Kadugusandai Chatram near Sayalkudi, a goods vehicle (auto), suspected to have come on the wrong side, collided with the tourist van, in which the vehicle toppled along the East Coast Road.

In the melee, the 60-year-old woman identified as Saradabai died on the spot. The driver identified as Rajyut and five others suffered fracture. Many others suffered multiple injuries and were taken to Ramanathapuram Government Hospital.

332,2020/02/18,Woman kills her alcoholic son in Cumbum,"Theni

In a shocking incident, an unidentified body of a man was found stashed in a gunny bag with the hands and legs cut and the torso missing.

Following a complaint, the Cumbum police registered a case of murder. Superintendent of Police, Sai Charan Tejaswi inspected the scene of crime and formed a team.

Preliminary inquiries revealed that the gunny bag was hurled into the river side from Surulipatti Salai by a two-wheeler rider. The pillion was said to be holding the bag. As the water flow was very thin, the passers by, including a few boys, who were engaged in fishing, informed the police.

Soon, the police seized the gunny bag and found the parts of body. The police deployed a sniffer dog at the site that it ran towards the main road, where the vehicle had stopped. Based on the inputs gathered and the CCTV footage, the police zeroed in on a few suspects and secured a man and woman in about less than 10 hours from the commencement of the probe.

The confessions led to identification of the body as Vigneshwaran, 30, son of a couple - Raja and Selvi, 49. The shocking aspect was that Vigneshwaran was allegedly murdered by his own mother Selvi assisted by her younger son Vijay Bharath, 26.

Narrating the horrific story, Selvi is said to have informed the police officers that after she lost her husband Raja 18 months ago, she lived with her two sons who had successfully completed engineering. Unfortunately, her elder son Vigneshwaran was addicted to liquor and was always in a state of drunkenness.

In such a scenario, she got her younger son married to a girl last month. After leaving her in a relative’s house here, Vijay Bharath went for a job in Coimbatore.

She further said Vigneshwaran started pestering her to get him also married and threatened to misbehave if she failed to get a girl for him. Shocked, the mother narrated the conversation with her younger son.

“I decided to finish him off...” she said and gave Vigneshwaran sleeping pills and as he went to bed, she killed him with a knife.

In a bid to ensure that no one noticed, the widow, with the help of her younger son, threw the body on the riverside and abandoned the legs in a well in Gandhi Nagar West and other parts in Veerappa Naickenkulam near Cumbum. As they were planning to vacate the place, the following day, the police came knocking the doors.

After collecting the parts of the body as per the confessional statement, the police handed them over to the Government Hospital. Further investigation is on.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/woman-kills-her-alcoholic-son-in-cumbum/article30853514.ece

Police have nabbed a notorious burglar in connection with a series of burglaries in the district, including the burglary of two jewellery showrooms in Marthandam and recovered ₹ 1.25-crore worth gold ornaments from him.

In a statement, Superintendent of Police N. Shreenath said six special police teams were formed recently after two jewellery showrooms in Marthandam were burgled, in which 270 sovereigns of gold ornaments were stolen. When the special teams were following vital clues they got during the probe, it was found that habitual offender Edwin Jose of Pullaanivilai under Nithravilai police station limits was involved in the burglaries.

The police also found that he had sold the booty with the help of one Ramesh Kumar of Marthandam, who was into the business of selling old ornaments.

The special team, led by Inspector Parvathi, Inspector of Police (In-Charge), Marthandam police station, nabbed Edwin Jose and recovered ₹ 1.25-crore worth 330 sovereigns and two bikes from him. During interrogation, Edwin Jose reportedly confessed to the police that he was involved in 15 major burglaries in the district.

The recovered gold ornaments would be returned to the rightful owners soon after producing the valuables in the court, said Dr. Shreenath, who lauded the special teams’ efforts in solving the series of burglaries.

334,2020/02/18,HC stays conduct of fresh election to panchayat ward,"Petitioner challenges Collector’s order nullifying his election

MADURAI

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday restrained the State Election Commission from conducting election to a ward and the subsequent election to the post of vice-president of Sithalavai panchayat in Krishnarayapuram panchayat union in Karur district.

A Division Bench of Justices T. Raja and B. Pugalendhi passed the order on the petition filed by A. Krishnamoorthy of Karur district, who challenged the Collector’s order to declare the election null and void.

Mr. Krishnamoorthy said that Sithalavai panchayat comprised nine wards, out of which wards two, three, five and eight were reserved for women. The other wards came under the general category, he said.

He said that he had contested from ward six and won the election. Subsequently, he was elected vice-president of Sithalavai panchayat union, he said. However, on February 2, the Collector declared the election to the ward and the vice-president post null and void.

The Collector passed the order on the ground that the ward was reserved for women. The petitioner said that this amounted to dereliction of duty on the part of the authorities and sought a restraint on the SEC from conducting a fresh election. He also sought a compensation of ₹10 lakh for the mental agony he suffered.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-stays-conduct-of-fresh-election-to-panchayat-ward-madurai-karur/article30853378.ece

Armed with the High Court order staying their transfer from Primary Schools in Sivakasi Union to far off places in Virudhunagar district, a section of teachers on Tuesday petitioned Virudhunagar Collector, R. Kannan, seeking transfer to their old schools.

The teachers were led by Tamil Nadu Primary School Teachers’ Federation, district secretary, Kannan. In their petition, the federation said that the Department of School Education had transferred a section of “surplus” teachers on the basis of re-deployment from one union to another.

However, the officials had not followed the established rules that had been in practice for several years while implementing transfer order, the teachers alleged.

Based on their petition claiming that transfer order was not in conformation with the established rules, the High Court Bench in Madurai on February 6 stayed the re-deployment order.

“Though the copy of the High Court order was immediately mailed to the officials of School Education Department, the officials have so far not acted upon it and were not allowing us to join duty in our old schools,” one of the teachers said.

The teachers said that teachers from other districts with similar order from the High Court were allowed to re-join their old schools.

Associate Professor N.

That fund should be used for purchasing inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and plant protection chemicals to reduce input cost,” he said.

He added that a bank account would be created for the fund, from which the members could get loans in the future. “The State government provides a rebate of ₹5 lakh for active groups,” he said.

337,2020/02/18,Cong cadre protest against LPG price hike,"‘It has forced the poor to op for firewood’

MADURAI

Cadre of the Congress party and Mahila Congress staged a protest here on Tuesday against the rising price of domestic LPG cylinder, blaming it on “the complete failure of the Union government in curbing the rise in prices of essential commodities”.

The protesters were carrying an empty LPG cylinder and firewood to show how the upward price revision had forced the poor to opt for firewood, instead of gas, for cooking. They also raised slogans against the Centre.

Madurai district president of the party V. Karthikeyan said that the price of LPG cylinder had doubled from what it was when the Congress was in power at the Centre. “Under the Congress regime, an LPG cylinder was sold for around ₹400. But, today the price has shot up to over ₹800 under the BJP government. The LPG subsidy provided by the government is just an eyewash to deceive the people,” he charged.

“On the one hand, there is an unprecedented crisis of unemployment and inflation in the country, and on the other, the increase in the price of LPG cylinder has totally affected the people. This government works only to favour big corporates and they are not working for the interests of the poor,” he said.

Mahila Congress Madurai city president R. Shanavash said that the poor were the worst-affected due to the increase in the price of LPG cylinder. “This has forced many poor women to opt for firewood for cooking,” she said.

The protesters also alleged that the reservations at various government institutions for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes were not being followed under the BJP rules.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/7ruxim/article30857333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA19MDUCONGLPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/cong-cadre-protest-against-lpg-price-hike-madurai/article30853092.ece

He hoped that it would facilitate the fishermen and urged the Minister to provide funds for procuring vessels for deep sea fishing in the region. He also appealed to the Union government to help release of the fishermen arrested by Sri Lanka and retrieve their boats.

In his address, former Minister and MLA M. Manikandan said that the permanent solution for the fishermen in this region would be the retrieval of Katchatheevu. Hailing late leader Jayalalithaa for taking up the cause of the fishermen, he said that the Central government, which has a cordial relation with Sri Lanka, should retrieve the Katchatheevu, which alone would encourage fishing activity to grow in a big way.

He also wanted the Centre to establish an airport here under the UDAN scheme as Rameswaram alone attracted close to two crore yatris every year.

Green energy

Officials attending the function said that the lighthouse would be operated with solar energy, with its policy of harnessing clean energy by the Centre.

Considering the historical importance of the location of Dhanushkodi and the tourists visiting Rameswaram temple, a visitors’ viewing balcony would be provided at 42 metre height with lift provision in order to attract tourists.

The lighthouse complex would be of reinforcement cement concrete (RCC) structure with an octagonal shape of 50 metre height (including stilt). The lighthouse tower is attached with an annexure building for the provision of powerhouse, auxiliary equipment room, duty operators room and inspection room etc.

It will also have visitors’ restroom, rainwater harvesting system, security room, gardening and children play area, land scaping etc. The lighthouse would be fitted with light equipment of range of 18 nautical miles to facilitate the navigation and with a provision of radar for the purpose of coastal surveillance and security of local fishermen, they added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/k5165u/article30852881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA19RAMESWARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/minister-lays-stone-for-modern-lighthouse-at-dhanushkodi/article30852882.ece

343,2020/02/18,There’s a need to regulate share autos,"Safety of the passengers a concern

Overcrowded share autorickshaws carrying office-goers, schoolchildren and the general public is a common sight in Madurai. Though they violate rules and regulations, share autos have become the most sought-after mode of travel to reach every nook and cranny of the city.

People do not have to go to a dedicated bus stop or bus stand for boarding a share auto. Just a wave of hand is enough to bring a share auto to one’s service. Commuters like Thavamani, a worker at a canteen in the city, says that it is convenient for her to use a share auto. She stays in an interior area of Othakadai. Earlier, she had to walk up to the main road to catch a bus to reach her place of work.

Since the share autos are plying even to the interior areas now and are charging comparatively less, she says, she prefers the share auto to the bus.

However, these autos have started causing nuisance for the public. Only a few share autos in the city have permits. Also safety of the passengers commuting in these vehicles is a concern. Share autos sometimes pose a threat to two-wheeler riders and motorists. Whenever the share auto drivers see people standing by the road, they immediately bring the vehicles to a screeching halt, even if it is in the middle of the road, complain other vehicle users.

RTI activist Hakkim Kasim says there has been a significant increase in the number of share autorickshaws, which has also led to a reduction in bus routes. There is absolutely no regulation of share autos and their routes have not been defined, he adds.

The bus stops have turned into share auto stops as they enter the bus parking bays and block way for the buses. According to a reply to his RTI application, he says, though hundreds of share autos are plying on the streets only seven have got permits.

This means a huge revenue loss for the State government. As the helmet regulation – it is not strictly implemented though – has brought about some change in the public, plying of share autos should be regulated, he says.

It is not that people want share autos off the roads, but there has to be regulation. Introduction of State-run mini buses like in Chennai can be a welcome option, says S. Sampath, State joint general secretary, Retired Transport Employees Federation, and coordinator of Pensioners’ Confederation.

The High Court Bench has passed several orders time and again and has ordered appropriate action against those violating the rules, which included carrying a prescribed number of passengers.

P.S. Suresh, a motorist, says the police and the Regional Transport Officers should work in tandem to crack down on the share autos plying on the roads without permits. The eyes of the auto drivers are not on the road. They only look for passengers standing by the roadside and this causes traffic hindrance, he says.

Joseph Nixon, Assistant Commissioner (Traffic), Town range, says that traffic police are on a constant vigil against rule violators. Stringent action is being taken against those involved in rash driving, drunk driving, stopping vehicles in bus stops, autos from other districts plying on city roads and permit violations. Awareness programmes are also conducted for the drivers, he adds.

Madurai District Integrated Ape Auto-drivers Welfare Association president R.P. Chandrabose says that only the share auto drivers are being targeted. Private vans, buses and even lorries are illegally increasing their capacity and plying on the roads, he says. Recently a share auto driver committed suicide due to ill-treatment by police personnel. This is just one instance. If there are separate bays for autos or regulation in place, we would definitely follow them, he adds.

Kutty and Mahendran, both share auto drivers, agree that they do accommodate more passengers than the permissible limit, which is illegal. But, they say that it is the question of their livelihood and they have to feed their families. “Even passengers prefer the share autos. We don’t know any other occupation apart from this for our livelihood,” they say.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/2rcu6f/article30857370.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA19MDUSHAREAUTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/theres-a-need-to-regulate-share-autos-madurai-matters/article30852536.ece

346,2020/02/18,"Water supply snapped to tax evaders’ buildings, houses","THOOTHUKUDI

The Corporation, which is organising a drive against encroachments on Wednesdays to remove illegal structures under its jurisdiction, has acted against tax evaders on Tuesdays by disconnecting drinking water connections to buildings.

As the residents of Thoothukudi Corporation have not paid taxes payable to the urban civic body to the tune of ₹ 32 crore, including drinking water tax of ₹ 15 crore and property tax of ₹ 15 crore, the cash-starved Corporation has planned to unleash punitive measures against the tax evaders on every Tuesdays.

“Some of the residents, who have not paid the taxes payable to the Corporation for a few years, are ignoring the notices being sent by the urban local body to remind them of their responsibility. Hence, we’re identifying the buildings for which no property and drinking water taxes have been paid for the past one year and to cut drinking water connections to these buildings,” V.P. Jayaseelan, Corporation Commissioner said.

To execute this ‘Operation Tuesday’, the Commissioner has formed a team in every zone under the leadership of the Assistant Commissioners concerned. On the first Tuesday, Assistant Commissioner of Thoothukudi East T. Dhanasingh led a team.

“Once the drinking water connection is snapped, owners of these buildings clear the tax arrears immediately. On Tuesday (February 18), the East Zone realised the tax collection of ₹ 17 lakh within a few hours. Only after due examination of the payment of taxes, the houses and the commercial establishments will be given reconnection,” said Mr. Dhanasingh hinting that ‘Operation Tuesday’ would intensify in the days to come.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/z1iwlq/article30851864.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA19TUT-WATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/water-supply-snapped-to-tax-evaders-buildings-houses/article30851865.ece
347,2020/02/18,Prime land in Tallakulam serves little purpose,"The space opposite Prasanna Venkatachalapathy Temple is poorly-maintained and serves as one huge car workshop

Along the busy Alagarkoil Road, right in front of Prasanna Venkatachalapathy Temple in Tallakulam, one can see several mechanics working on cars, vans and bikes parked in a vast area.

This prime area measuring 1.16 lakh square feet is under dispute for the past 15 years. With both the temple administration and the Corporation laying claim to the property and going to the court over the issue, no development has taken place here. K. Parthiban, a resident, says things have gone worse in the past few years.

“This space is poorly lit and serves as a dump for unwanted vehicle parts. People living in the vicinity have to breathe the spray paint filled air,” he says and adds that this is only the surface of the problem. Since the open space is uneven, rainwater stagnates and the whole place becomes slushy. The pools of water become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, he says.

Convenor of Tallakulam Makkal Nala Committee A. Venkataramanujam says the problem of ownership of the vacant space started in 2004.

A Corporation resolution passed in 1999 sought the permission of the then Collector to use the revenue land marked ‘street’ in the town survey register to be maintained by it.

Ever since, the temple administration and the Corporation have individually procured court orders laying claim to the land but the case which has is for 15 years now has not helped the residents but only benefited the temple, says Mr. Venkataramanujam.

While the temple administration has leased out the land to contractors who let the space for parking, residents are also charged when they park their vehicles, he says.

If the case is resolved quickly, the huge space which was once filled with trees can either be developed as a park or an open air auditorium, and thus generate revenue. Moreover, it will also be a sight to behold during the Chithirai festival because there are 30 mandagapadis (platform for Lord Kallazhagar) around the temple alone, he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/yp6j0j/article30848633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18MACITY-TALLAKULAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/prime-land-in-tallakulam-serves-little-purpose/article30848634.ece

So it took some time for the throng of petitioners, including the aged and the differently abled, to brave the traffic on the road opposite the only entrance remaining open before entering the complex.

349,2020/02/18,Call for release of seven convicted in Rajiv case,"Members of Eazha Tamizhar Viduthalai Kootamaippu staged a protest in front of the Collectorate, here on Monday, seeking the release of seven persons convicted in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.

The Centre had earlier told the Madras High Court that the Governor was at liberty to decide the premature release application of the convicts, filed under Article 161 of the Constitution. Article 161 confers power on the governor to grant pardons, suspend, remit or commute sentences of any person convicted of any offence against any law.

On September 9, 2018, the Tamil Nadu cabinet adopted a resolution recommending to the governor to release all seven convicts - Nalini, Sriharan, Perarivalan, Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and Ravichandran - from the prison prematurely.

The resolution was forwarded to Governor Banwarilal Purohit.

The protesters said the Centre's refusal of Nalini's plea last week to release her on the ground that she had been kept in illegal detention since September 9, 2018 when the State Cabinet made a recommendation to the Governor for releasing all seven convicts in the case was unjustified.

‘It is unjust’

350,2020/02/18,"Failures are important to be successful in life, says VC","College degree alone would not guarantee success: K. Parthasarathy

“A person has to face at least three major failures in life, to be successful in this journey filled with challenges. Even if you fail to achieve a goal, don’t worry, as life is full of opportunities,” said Vice-Chancellor of Tamil Nadu Open University K. Parthasarathy here on Monday.

He was addressing Madurai Corporation school students during the valedictory session of an art expo, organised by M.S. Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation and the Corporation. The expo was organised as part of ‘Happy Schooling programme,’ a joint initiative of the Trust, the Corporation and HCL Foundation, with focus on mental well-being of students.

Mr. Parthasarathy said that obtaining a college degree alone would not guarantee success in life. “To be successful in life, you need to have knowledge and skills,” he said.

A total of 124 students from 20 Corporation schools participated in the expo which was based on the theme ‘Art from waste’ and students produced creative craft products from waste materials.

Corporation Commissioner S. Viskan said that success and failure had a thin line of difference. “Do not let failures crush your passion. Being a Corporation school student should not impair your desire to achieve in life. If you believe in yourself, you can achieve any goal in life,” he said.

C. Ramasubramanian, Founder of M.S. Chellamuthu Trust and Research Foundation, said that he was mesmerised by the creative products made by the students.

Sixth Additional District and Sessions Judge Sayeedunnisa on Monday sentenced serial killer Cyanide Mohan Kumar to life imprisonment on finding him guilty of murdering 23-year-old Arathi, a resident of Kasaragod district in Kerala, in 2006.

The punishment comes in the 19th of the 20 cases of murder registered against Mohan Kumar. Earlier, he had been sentenced to life in three of the 20 murder cases.

Unlike in the other cases, Mohan Kumar, in this case, introduced himself to Arathi with his real name and told her that he worked as a teacher.

According to the chargesheet, Mohan Kumar met Arathi while she was coming to work at an unit of Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Ltd. (CAMPCO). Mohan Kumar had accompanied Arathi to the latter’s house.

On January 3, 2006, Arathi left her house after telling her family members that she was going to a picnic. Arathi came to Puttur bus stand from where Mohan Kumar took her to Mysuru where they stayed in a lodge near the bus stand. The next morning, Mohan Kumar asked Arathi to remove her ornaments in the room. The two came to the KSRTC bus stand where Mohan Kumar asked her to consume a pill stating that it was a contraceptive pill. However, it was cyanide.

Arathi consumed the pill in the washroom. As she collapsed, people in the washroom rushed her to a nearby hospital where she was declared dead. Mohan Kumar then went to the lodge and left the place along with Arathi’s ornaments. Following his arrest by Bantwal Police on October 21, 2009, Mohan Kumar admitted to murdering 20 women.

Ms. Sayeedunnisa sentenced Mohan Kumar to life and imposed a fine of ₹ 25,000 on him for an offence under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. This sentence shall commence after he serves the sentence of imprisonment in the other cases where he has been convicted, the judge noted.

A total of ₹ 55,000 fine has been imposed. All sentences in this case will run concurrently.

356,2020/02/18,Sugar exports expected to pick up,"About 9 million tonnes deficit in global market; prices go up

Indian sugar exports are expected to gain momentum in the coming months as global sugar prices have increased.

According to a press statement from the Indian Sugar Mills’ Association (ISMA), there is a deficit of nearly nine million tonnes in the global market during the 2019-2020 sugar season and Thailand’s exports are likely to be 3-4 million tonnes lesser due to lower production there.

Global sugar prices for raw and white sugar are currently 20% to 25% more than what prevailed three months ago, when India started its exports. Accordingly, Indian sugar exports may get accelerated in the coming months, the ISMA said. Nearly 16 lakh tonnes of sugar have been exported so far this season of the 32 lakh tonnes for which contracts have been signed.

Some of the sugar mills do not plan to export sugar against their allocated export quotas and some have surrendered a part of their MAEQ (Maximum Admissible Export Quantity) to the government.

It is understood that the government is actively considering reallocation of quotas of mills that have not contracted the stipulated quantity for exports, the association said. By the end of the current season, which started last October and will end in September this year, the total sugar exports from the country is expected to be more than 50 lakh tonnes.

On the production front, as on February 15, the mills had produced 169.85 lakh tonnes of sugar as against 219.66 lakh tonnes during the corresponding period last season.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/k7bslh/article30854032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THBUSUGARR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/sugar-exports-expected-to-pick-up/article30854033.ece

Following the Supreme Court’s February 14 order, that asked the managing directors and directors of the companies to show cause as to why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them for failing to pay even a ‘single penny’ to the government despite an October 2019 apex court judgment, Vodafone Idea on Monday deposited ₹2,500 crore with the Department of Telecom, while committing to pay another ₹1,000 crore by the end of this week.

However, as per DoT’s assessment, the liabilities of the company for licence fee and spectrum usage charge stand at about ₹53,000 crore.

On Monday, the Supreme Court did not entertain “an urgent oral application” made by Vodafone Idea for directions to be issued to the DoT to not take any coercive steps for recovery of AGR dues.

Vodafone Idea has been the worst hit by the Supreme Court’s October 24 decision in favour of the government on definition of AGR. In December, Mr. Birla had said that Vodafone Idea may have to shut if there was no relief on statutory dues.

The company, which reported a net loss of ₹6,439 crore for the October-December 2019 quarter, had also warned last week that its ability to continue as a going concern would depend on favourable outcome of its modification plea filed before the Supreme Court.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/kstq4g/article30850794.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12BIRLA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/birla-meets-telecom-secretary/article30854017.ece

359,2020/02/18,Prices of key pharma ingredients may rise if virus impact prolongs,"No supply from China for past 25 days.

The prices of key pharmaceutical ingredients could rise if the COVID-19 situation in China does not improve soon, a top company official said on Tuesday.

China accounted for 67.56% of total imports of bulk drugs and drug intermediates at $2,405.42 million to India in 2018-19.

“The prices of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) could increase if the situation in China does not improve soon,” Zydus Group Chairman Pankaj Patel said.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday met representatives of various sectors, including pharmaceuticals, textiles, chemicals, electronics and IT hardware, solar, auto, surgical equipments, and paints, to review the situation following the outbreak of the deadly virus in China.

She said the government will soon announce measures to deal with the impact of the virus outbreak on the domestic industry.

Describing pharma, chemical and solar equipment sectors as worst affected, the Minister said disruptions are visible in these due to delay in shipments.

‘No price-rise concerns’

“There are no concerns about price rise so far due to coronavirus [COVID-19],” she added. She also said there were no reports of shortage of medicines or medical equipment; instead, the pharmaceutical industry was asking for lifting of the ban on exports of certain items.

The Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP) has already constituted a high-level panel to assess the impact of the outbreak of the deadly virus in China on the supply of APIs in India.

According to official sources, Indian drugmakers have informed the high-level committee that they presently have stocks for the next two to three months.

There has been no supply from the neighbouring country for the last 20-25 days, mainly due to Chinese New Year holidays, sources said. The prices of medicines are monitored by the government, and apart from the essential medicines whose prices are fixed by the government, companies are allowed to hike prices of the remaining drugs by only up to 10% in a year.

Antibiotics, vitamins

India has a high dependence on fermentation-based APIs / intermediates namely antibiotics and vitamins. Companies have been maintaining 2-3 months inventory of these APIs and intermediates, Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) Secretary General Sudarshan Jain had earlier said.

360,2020/02/18,Irdai says ‘yet to get’ proposal from LIC on IPO,"“Any company which goes public, there will be better corporate governance and better disclosure,” IRDAI chairman S C Khuntia said.

Insurance regulator is yet to get any proposal from LIC on an initial public offering, but feels a listing is better from a governance perspective, chairman S C Khuntia said on Tuesday.

He also said that there is nothing for the life insurance industry to worry for the time being with regard to government’s move on certain income tax exemptions as the alternative to invest still exists.

Khuntia also asked insurance companies to “weed out” loss-making products and concentrate only on the better paying ones.

On the IPO of Life Insurance Corporation of India announced in the budget, he said, “LIC proposal has not yet come.”

“Any company which goes public, there will be better corporate governance and better disclosure,” he told reporters on the sidelines of an event of actuaries here.

On being asked if LIC’s business will need any restructuring before IPO, Khuntia said that work on the same is being carried out by the government.

He said it is a good idea for every insurance company to list and the Insurance Regulation and Development Authority of India (Irdai) will nudge entities to go for the same.

It is, however, not making it mandatory to list because smaller companies are yet to achieve the scale for going public, Khuntia said, adding that ideally a company should achieve sufficient scale to list within ten years of its existence.

He said the practice of annual product review needs to be carried out in full seriousness by the players and pitched for a weeding out of the loss making ones.

“I would like to encourage companies to weed out products which are not selling and simply adding to the number, then they will be able to manage those products well,” he said, adding that the plea was made at a meeting with chief executives recently.

When pointed out about practices where industry players are compromising on financials in the health insurance segment while signing on to group schemes, Khuntia said the Irdai wants players to be sustainable, where they don’t create losses nor do they earn excess profits.

He, however, said that Irdai will not intervene on the pricing front but will limit itself to pointing out concerns to the players and issue notices if necessary.

Khuntia went public with his disappointment at the low growth levels of the life and general insurance segments despite the under penetration in India.

General insurance grew at 14% last year as against its potential to grow at 17-18%, while the life insurance segment grew only at 10% as against the 12-13% potential, he said.

Terming actuaries as conscience keepers of the insurance industry, Khuntia asked the Institute of Actuaries of India to take more efforts to increase the number, adding that inherent skill sets in mathematics and software make Indians very amenable to the stream.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/irdai-says-yet-to-get-proposal-from-lic-on-ipo/article30850375.ece

363,2020/02/18,Protecting children’s right to protest,"A child has as much right to be present at a protest site as any adult

There are many legal and social difficulties involved in the Supreme Court’s move to take suo motu cognisance of children taking part in demonstrations in Shaheen Bagh in Delhi. This has a direct impact on children’s right to protest as well as on their mothers’ right to protest, specifically since the enforcement of the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act could render both mother and child stateless.

Two unrelated issues

It is indeed a tragedy that an infant died in the cold during the protests earlier this month. But criminalising the mother and putting the onus of the child’s death on her negligence rather than questioning and examining the economic and political reasons for poverty is a travesty of justice. Why is it that Indian mothers, especially from migrant labouring families, have to carry their children where ever they go? By saying that women should not be allowed to take their children to protests, we are effectively rendering impossible their own mobility and pushing them back into their homes. How can women then voice their dissent against a law which is going to affect them directly? And if they do voice their dissent by going to a protest, where are they supposed to leave their children? What infrastructure does the state provide by way of crèches or day care centres? What kind of housing does the state provide for migrant workers? In Bengaluru, a migrant colony was recently demolished after videos claiming that illegal Bangladeshi immigrants were sheltered in the settlement went viral. A wall is being built in Ahmedabad to apparently hide slums from the U.S. President during his visit this month. In such a context, isn’t the idea of a safe home also mediated by class?

Also read: ‘Stop children from getting ‘involved’ in Shaheen Bagh protest,’ says 12-year-old bravery award winner to SC

There is an erroneous notion that the infant died on account of the protest rather than due to other systemic issues. And the Supreme Court is assuming causality without even examining the matter. In the suo motu action, the Court has conflated two unrelated issues. The first is a child’s right to participate in or witness a protest. The second is the death of the infant. There is no obvious relationship between the first and second issue. The death of the child due to natural causes should have no bearing on children’s right to be present at a protest or a mother’s right to take her children to a protest.

A child’s right to protest

Implicit in the freedom of speech and the freedom to assemble peaceably and without arms under Article 19 of the Constitution is the right to protest. This right is guaranteed to all citizens of India regardless of age. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which India has ratified, expressly recognises in Article 13 that freedom of expression of the child includes the “freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child’s choice.”

Both the Indian Constitution and the CRC state that no restriction may be placed on these freedoms except those that are necessary and imposed by statute for the “purposes of safeguarding the sovereignty, integrity and security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence”. Even these restrictions must pass the test of reasonableness as understood by the constitutional courts. As such, neither the Constitution nor the CRC contemplate a blanket restriction being imposed on children’s right to protest by a court directive.

Even with respect to individual cases, there must first be a serious examination of the specific circumstances of the case since overarching directions regarding a child’s participation are also a restriction on the mother’s mobility and on parenting rights generally.

Further, the CRC, in Article 5, recognises the “evolving capacities” of children. This means that as children acquire enhanced competencies, there is a diminishing need for them to be protected. They have a greater capacity to take responsibility for decisions affecting their lives. The law recognises that children do not magically acquire agency when they turn 18 years, but are capable of exercising their rights and that the law must facilitate the same.

Article 12 of the CRC provides that member states should assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely. For this purpose, the child should be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly or through a representative. Therefore, there can be no restriction on a child’s right to protest without hearing the child.

A place for learning

While many schools encourage children to read newspapers and watch news channels, attending a protest is also a way for children to receive information and ideas. At a protest they get to witness expressions of discontent against acts or omissions of the government that have prejudicial and even violent impacts on people’s lives. A protest is also a space where children get to experience and assert citizenship. It’s a space for them to comprehend what ‘We The People of India’ encompasses; it is where they get to see people from all walks of life. It could also be a space for children to celebrate their unity as Indians.

As far as the CAA-NRC are concerned, women, especially poor women, will find it hardest to prove ancestry due to lack of documentation. Further the CAA and NRC directly affect children as well: if one parent is held to be an illegal migrant, it means the child will also be considered an illegal migrant. A child has as much right to be present as a stakeholder at such a protest as any adult.

While news reports say that the infant who died was exposed to the chilly Delhi air, they don’t mention the circumstances of the parents who are daily wage migrant workers living in an adjoining jhuggi in a plastic tent home.

Also, why is it perfectly acceptable for children to participate in an anti-pollution protest in peak winter, but not in the protests at Shaheen Bagh? Why don’t those protests constitute parental negligence worthy of court intervention? The petitioner in this case is herself a child. What is the basis on which it is decided that one is a valid exercise of the child’s agency and the other is not? When we debate the participation of children in protests, these are questions we must ask ourselves.

364,2020/02/18,Germany’s AfD conundrum,"The grand coalition’s supposed neutrality may not be a credible strategy in a fragmented polity

Cracks are widening in the German establishment’s defences against the far-right. The resignation of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s heir, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, on February 10 as leader of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) is the most profound convulsion to rock the party since the 2015 migrant crisis.

Crossing the line

Days earlier, the Christian Democrats’ local unit drew wide condemnation for seeking the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD)’s votes in electing Thuringia state’s premier. The move, intended to block the return of the left-wing Die Linke after the inconclusive October regional election, was unprecedented in post-war German history. Soon after the polls, sections of the CDU pushed for the opposite outcome. The aim this time was to back Die Linke to return to office. That move too was rebuffed by the leadership. Earlier, in December, the governing coalition in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt came under strain when a CDU official’s links with neo-Nazis became apparent, forcing him to finally quit.

Allowing the AfD to play kingmaker in Thuringia caused outrage across the political spectrum. The CDU could not countenance an affront to its founding principle of propagating a social market economy to counter nationalism, even though the beneficiary was the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), its long-time ally. Chancellor Merkel described the election of FDP leader Thomas Kemmerich in Thuringia with AfD votes as “a bad day for democracy”. She said the outcome “has to be reversed” and criticised her party’s role as “unforgivable”. Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, whose ratings have plummeted after her narrow victory as party chief in 2018, took the cue and bowed out.

The AfD is no less a taboo for the FDP. Mr. Kemmerich has since called for fresh elections. FDP national leader Christian Lindner, who initially justified the machinations, eventually promised a vote of confidence in his own leadership. The Social Democratic Party (SPD), the junior partner in Ms. Merkel’s grand coalition, and the Greens, another potential CDU ally, would view even a slight swerve towards the far-right the ultimate red line.

The episodes in Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt have only exposed deepening divisions within the centre-right party. At the heart of the issue is the long-standing stance of maintaining equidistance from the extreme left and hard right. But such supposed neutrality may not commend itself as a credible strategy in Germany’s current fragmented polity, especially not after the steady erosion of the CDU and SPD base. Their vote share in the 2017 federal elections plunged to the lowest since 1949. Meanwhile, the stridently anti-Islam and anti-immigrant AfD emerged the largest opposition in the German parliament with 89 seats. The party is well represented in all the regions. The Bundestag’s March 2017 move to redefine the honorary title of “father of the house” to mean the longest-serving member rather than its oldest, only to block an AfD member, seems like another era.

A silver lining

One silver lining for the CDU-SPD is the finding that in western Germany, the AfD tends to win half the votes it takes in the eastern states. Eastern Germany still suffers from high unemployment, inequality, and poor public services. Greater investment to boost growth would be the antidote to the AfD’s anti-immigrant onslaught, not a rightward slant by centrists. If Germany’s ideological firewall needs a recast, the relevant direction seems obvious.

Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer’s resignation has reopened the question of vesting the party leadership and the country’s chancellorship in the same person. Should the logic behind this argument be pursued, a snap election and a premature end to Ms. Merkel’s unbroken tenure from 2005 cannot be ruled out. The current uncertainty comes at an awkward moment, as Germany assumes in July the six-monthly rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union. It is hoped that Germany will tide over this crisis.

365,2020/02/18,May the Force be strengthened,"The functioning of the CRPF needs to be revisited

In the wake of Independence, a contentious administrative issue was over the retention of CRP (Crown Representative Police). As the Constitution designated ‘law and order’ as a State subject, the relevance of having a Central police force was questioned by everyone, except Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who argued vehemently and boldly in favour of it.

From having just two battalions as the CRP, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) has now expanded to being a three-and-a-half lakh-strong force consisting of specialist wings like the Rapid Action Force, the COBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action), and the Special Duty Group. It is the largest paramilitary force in the world and no other security force of the country has seen expansion at such a rapid rate.

Providing integrated security to a diverse country of continental size is not an easy task. Resolving certain conflicts requires immediate solutions for which regular armed forces cannot be deployed. Hence, we require paramilitary forces, and the CRPF is the most sought-after one because of its flexibility and versatility. The force has earned its place as the ‘peacekeeper of the nation’.

April 9 is observed as ‘Valour Day’ by the CRPF because it was on this day in 1965 that an ordinary battalion of the CRPF repulsed an attack by a Pakistani brigade. Similarly, October 21 is observed as ‘Commemoration Day’ by all police forces, as a mark of respect to the CRPF soldiers who, in their fight against the Chinese Army in 1959, at Hot Springs, Leh, made the supreme sacrifice.

However, this glowing track record pales into insignificance when we consider the mass casualties the Force has had to suffer. In April 2010, at least 75 of its soldiers were killed by Maoists, numbering about 300, in Dantewada early morning when they were returning after a night-long patrol. And last year, the Pulwama attack happened.

Pressure on soldiers

What made Pulwama different from the earlier episodes of mass casualties was the unparalleled response from the political leadership, civil society and all other stakeholders to the attack. A year after the attack, it is time for the nation to take a relook at the main agency dealing with conflicts in different territorial zones. The frequent movements lock, stock and barrel are taking its toll. There are increasing cases of suicides and fratricides. The anguish caused because of prolonged periods of duty away from one’s family members adds to the pressure experienced the soldiers having their fingers constantly on the trigger guard, where a delay in response by even seconds can cost them their lives. Though the Home Minister recently stated that CRPF jawans would get to spend 100 days with their families every year, considering the present levels of commitment, 100 days of leave is an impossible dream for a soldier.

An easier way out here would be to revisit the government’s decision on tasking specific Central Paramilitary Forces exclusively with certain operations. It should be compulsory for recruits to all Central Police Forces to be deployed to anti-insurgency roles during their first 15 years of service, when they are newly trained and fighting fit. They can be shifted, in the next 10 years, to border duties. The last phase of their career should be in static duties. That way, the present system of a soldier ending up performing a high-risk job till the last day of his service, just because he happened to be allotted to CRPF after a common selection process, can be avoided and he can look forward to easier duties during the later phase of his career.

Rehabilitation of retired personnel

Also, as the Force is deployed to the last man, the welfare and morale of the soldiers needs to be taken care of. A large number of personnel are taking voluntary retirement, but there is no rehabilitation policy. The creation of a Welfare and Rehabilitation Board has not made any impact. Provision of canteen facilities, without tax exemption, hardly gives the soldiers any relief. Another demand that needs to be considered is that of a One Rank, One Pension scheme.

And finally, it is high time the Force develops home-grown leadership. Elements like a healthy work culture, ethos and regimentation are very crucial for any armed force and they are best guarded by officers born on the cadre. The long overdue Non-Functional Financial Upgradation (NFU) materialised only after judicial intervention. However, the top leadership — made up of IPS officers on deputation — is reluctant to implement it. The first anniversary of the Pulwama attacks should enable all stakeholders to device ways and means to plug the loopholes and address the system failures in a Force that still remains the most formidable in internal security matters.

366,2020/02/18,The long and the short of Trump versus the rest,"With the weight of the Republican Party now behind him, the U.S. President is going all out to bag the November poll

The American Congress predictably acquitted U.S. President Donald Trump from charges of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. This has left the Democrats, their supportive bureaucrats and the media detesting him while the Republicans and their followers embrace him, or back him sufficiently, to want him to continue in office.

The liberal media never accepted Mr. Trump as legitimate, depicting him as racist, chauvinist and a liar; they are unable objectively to assess the President’s policies. Democrat-supporting liberals in the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency and the bureaucracy showed their discontent in a quasi-rebellion against the President, and when the Russia collusion probe led nowhere, they turned to the impeachment route. Citing the sixth U.S. President, John Quincy Adams (1825-1829), “America… goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all,” the liberal guardians of the presumed benevolent empire consider Mr. Trump a reckless isolationist — although he injected billions of dollars into the military — for questioning the financial burdens of alliances with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Japan and South Korea.

A shift in Republican stance

Republican establishment figures and ultra-conservatives, originally resentful of Mr. Trump, now coalesce behind him because he favours economic protectionism, chauvinism and foreign policy isolationism, has reduced corporate and wealth taxes, imposed limits on immigration and refugees, appointed conservatives to Supreme and Federal courts, de-regulated the economy and supported evangelical agendas including support for Israel’s settlements and recognition of Jerusalem as its capital. If President Barack Obama’s tenure saw the elimination of Osama bin Laden and stimulated the economy, Mr. Trump has killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Iran’s General Qasem Soleimani, slashed unemployment and grown the economy while opposing government programmes such as Obamacare and the Green New Deal. His approval among Republicans is around 90% despite his hostile takeover of the Party while branding himself as a warrior against élites, fake news and a corrupt establishment.

Driven by the urge for publicity, Mr. Trump uses provocation, confrontation and bombast to dominate the news agenda and exploit the vulnerabilities of his adversaries. His boasts of successes, which bend facts to breaking point, infuriate his opponents and distort their judgement. Populism is distasteful to the educated, but has certain merits in encouraging neglected constituencies to participate in the democratic process, though it is illiberal in nature and assaults institutions tasked with oversight over majority rule. Mr. Trump’s opponents attack his boorishness but neglect the reasons why many voters supported him, namely because working and middle-class Americans, losing faith in state institutions and political parties, are responsive to right-wing extremists.

A resonating slogan

After the Gulf War fiasco and the financial crisis, Mr. Trump understood that the U.S.-led liberal order, free trade and globalisation no longer had popular traction; that is why his slogan “Make America Great Again” resonates. Americans know Mr. Trump held no public office, was a shady real-estate operator, draft dodger, evader of taxes, denigrator of Muslims, Latin Americans and women, but they elected him nevertheless, and he has continued along the same path, focusing on power irrespective of principle. With the weight of the Republican Party now behind him, he has, in effect, been campaigning from the day of his inauguration, while building a sophisticated data-gathering and voter mobilisation operation with an eye to winning the November 2020 election. Basic to this approach is bilateral leverage or quid pro quo. Mr. Trump saw nothing wrong in asking the Ukrainian President to advance his political interests, or in acting against a Congress instruction. He claims the Democrats in Congress are obstructing him, and that only those who elected him could hold him accountable. It will be the American people who will finally express judgement on the Trump presidency, next November.

Then and now

In the previous presidential election of 2016, Republicans and independents who voted for Mr. Trump were driven mainly by dislike of Hillary Clinton and the élites who backed her. This time the Democrats and many independents will be motivated by hatred for Mr. Trump and his record. Independents, who will determine the outcome, will vote with consideration to their conscience and bank balances. Those who benefit from Mr. Trump’s economic policies will vote for him, short of an economic recession or financial crisis, which although widely predicted, have yet to materialise. Those worried about democracy, liberal values and civic rights will vote against him for fear of authoritarianism, racism and inequality.

How could one of the most divisive Presidents in American history, impeached for high crimes and misdemeanours, reeling from one self-inflicted crisis to another, win high office again? The election debate will focus largely on Mr. Trump, which is what he wants. Republicans will emphasise his accomplishments and Democrats his transgressions, though the election ought to be about the economy, American traditional values and democracy. To win, the Democrats must appeal to the working and middle class, the automaker and steel worker. Mr. Trump will claim that millions of unworthy immigrants entered the U.S while jobs went to China and Mexico and the establishment stood idly by. His 2016 strategy was to win key States such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and that will be his objective again. Mr. Trump could, therefore, suffer a heavy defeat in the popular vote while winning the handful of States that decide the electoral college. Accordingly, while the impeachment process against Mr. Trump failed, its effect on voters in a few crucial States will prove critical.

Much will also depend on the Democrats’ choice of nominee. Mr. Joe Biden would be portrayed by Mr. Trump as a corrupt re-run of the Obama regime. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren will be painted as radical leftists who endanger American prosperity. No sitting President incumbent has lost since George H.W. Bush’s defeat to Bill Clinton in 1992 during tax increases and a recession. The 2020 presidential election will represent a decision between liberal and illiberal democracy. Whatever the outcome, the Trump presidency has laid down new yardsticks to preoccupy his successors and political leaders in all other countries for many decades to come.

367,2020/02/18,Women-at-arms: on SC order on permanent commission to women officers,"In allowing women permanent commission, the court has demolished gender stereotypes

The Supreme Court has delivered a sharp rebuke to the government by asking it to adhere to its own stated policy, articulated on February 25, 2019, on granting permanent commission to women in the Short Service Commission (SSC). Though women are absorbed into the SSC, they are now denied permanent commission in most branches of the Indian Army. More importantly, in furthering the principle of equality and non-discrimination enshrined in the Constitution, the Court has at the same time come down heavily on the stereotypes of women and their physiological features that were consistently put across in the government’s submissions to deny equal opportunity to women who fulfil the same criteria their male counterparts do. As long as society holds strong beliefs about gender roles there will not be change of mindsets, the top court observed. Indeed, the Court has torn into a number of contradictions inherent in the government’s arguments that gravely weaken its case and expose inherent prejudices. For instance, it was submitted that deployment of women officers was not advisable in conflict zones where there was “minimal facility for habitat and hygiene”. Yet, the government admitted to the Court that 30% of the total number of women officers are in fact deputed to conflict areas. In directing the government to grant permanent commission to those women who opt for it, in 10 branches of the SSC, and by ordering the government to level the playing field, the Court has forced acknowledgement of the sterling role women have played and continue to play, shoulder to shoulder, with their male counterparts, for the security of the nation. It has also made recommendations to correct the anomalies including in the matter of pensions due to women.

It is a telling state of affairs that though Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on August 15, 2018 that permanent commission would be granted to serving women officers of the armed forces, it needed the Supreme Court to prod the government into doing it. The efforts of the litigants, who have waged an uphill battle since 2003, fighting their way up from the Delhi High Court, which ruled in their favour 10 years ago — and the government wilfully ignoring it — all the way up to the Supreme Court, deserve applause. That this discrimination should happen even while the Indian Army experiences a shortfall of officers by about 10,000 in the ranks is all the more galling. It is not as if there is surfeit of women officers: a mere 1,653 out of 40,825. Given the inherent flaws in the structure, implementation and change are not likely to happen soon, even given the Court’s deadline of three months.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/women-at-arms/article30844783.ece
368,2020/02/18,A royal mess: on the turmoil in telecom industry,"Only pragmatism and prudence can lift the telecom industry from its current troubles

It cannot possibly get messier than this. The telecom industry is in turmoil unable to pay up its dues as per the Supreme Court verdict on adjusted gross revenues delivered in October last; the Court is aghast that its order is not being complied with; and then there is the government torn between revenue considerations, the need to uphold sanctity of contracts, and ensuring that one of the players does not go under in the process of honouring the verdict. Faced with the wrath of the Court, Bharti Airtel paid ₹10,000 crore on Monday with the promise of paying the rest before mid-March when the court will hear the case next. Vodafone Idea, the one hit the most by the judgment, on Monday sought more time to pay up but the Court was in no mood to humour the company and refused to hear the plea. The company eventually paid ₹2,500 crore by the evening. The two companies, as indeed the others in the industry, have only themselves to blame for the predicament that they find themselves in now. They could have paid up their annual dues over the years — which were not material in relation to their respective turnovers — under protest even as they litigated the case in the top court. That would have obviated the need to pay interest and penalties now which are higher than the actual dues. At the very least, they ought to have provided for the liability in their balance sheets as a contingency, which they failed to do.

While they have to pay the price for this now, what can be done to ensure that the blow is not fatal? If Vodafone shuts shop, not only will the industry be reduced to a duopoly, with all the attendant consequences for customers but it will also lead to loss of about 15,000 direct jobs and several thousand more indirect ones. Worse, the cascading effect will be felt across the economy as lenders face the consequences of the company going bankrupt — non performing assets will rise. Telecom equipment suppliers may also go down as their dues will not be paid. And what happens to the 212 million Vodafone subscribers? It is doubtful whether the other two players can absorb them all. The industry is critical to the government’s plans for a digital economy not to mention its revenues, including from the upcoming 5G spectrum auctions. The government has to, therefore, examine what it can do to save the situation without disrespecting the Court’s verdict. Legislation to offer a staggered payment schedule that ensures that the net present value of future payments is equal to the dues is one option experts are suggesting. There could be other options that can be considered in conjunction with the industry, including reducing the adjusted gross revenue-based licence fees and spectrum usage charges. Whatever route it chooses to soften the blow, the government will have to get the Court on its side at the next hearing on March 17. The need of the hour is pragmatism laced with prudence on all sides to clean up this royal mess.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-royal-mess/article30844777.ece
369,2020/02/18,Tender of LED street lights project to be cancelled,"Civic body is running out of patience as company is yet to begin the work

In 2018, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) announced its ambitious plan to replace the city’s 4.8 lakh street lights with energy-efficient ones, but with the project yet to take off, the civic body’s patience is wearing thin.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar told The Hindu that they would recommend to the State government to cancel the global tender that had been awarded to a company.

The project, estimated to cost ₹560 crore, was to be completed by 2021. The International Financial Corporation, a sister concern of the World Bank, is the transactional advisor for the project.

According to civic officials, by now, the company should have started the process of replacing the existing installations with LED lights. However, the company is reportedly yet to complete financial closure.

“We had earlier warned the company that action would be taken if there were further delays. Since we have not received any proactive response from them, we will be recommending to the State government to cancel the tender,” said Mr. Anil Kumar.

The project was conceived to reduce the BBMP’s expenditure on electricity. The civic body currently spends an average of ₹12 crore a month to power street lights. Once the existing lighting fixtures are replaced with LED, the bills may come down by at least ₹4 crore.

“It was to be a win-win for the BBMP, as we will not be spending on capital investment, and we will be paying less towards electricity charges. The company will recover the capital investment from the energy savings, and pay the rest to the BBMP,” an official said.

Meanwhile, Residents’ Welfare Associations across neighbourhoods have been fighting for better lighting, especially in smaller lanes and by-lanes.

“On busy streets, we depend on commercial establishments to light the pavements, which have either been dug up or filled with construction debris. But many of the narrow residential lanes in my area have inadequate lighting. We have to depend on lights of nearby buildings, which is not enough,” said a resident of Fraser Town.

Several councillors have also alleged that they are unable to make improvements on account of the LED project. During a council meeting in January, councillors sought to know the status of the project. They claimed that the BBMP was not allowing them to install LED lights and that electrical contractors are refusing to repair the defunct ones because of which several stretches across the city are plunged in darkness.

Mr. Anil Kumar replied proposals from councillors to convert existing lights to LED street lights, to be taken up under the 14th Finance Commission, were being approved.

Meanwhile, a chartered engineering firm has been entrusted with the job of conducting a baseline assessment of the existing street lights, and identifying areas that require more lighting.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/1h4lm4/article30854436.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGSTREETLIGHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/tender-of-led-street-lights-project-to-be-cancelled/article30854438.ece
370,2020/02/18,Pre-term babies get the kangaroo care treatment,"It involves the infants being carried, usually by the mother, with skin-to-skin contact

A pre-term female baby born with a low birth weight of 780 gram in November at the State-run Vani Vilas Hospital has now gained adequate weight and overall development thanks to Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) provided at the hospital.

KMC is a method of care for pre-term infants, which involves the infants being carried, usually by the mother, with skin-to-skin contact. The more skin-to-skin contact, the better, said doctors.

After several episodes of respiratory distress, apnea and feeding issues, the baby’s weight increased to 1,850 gram in 103 days. The baby was discharged on Tuesday.

Sahana Devdas, Chief of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the hospital, told The Hindu that the mother, 21-year-old Rabiya Sultana from Vijaynagar, gave birth to triplets at 26 weeks on November 9. While the first baby weighing 780 gram survived, the other two male babies weighing 720 and 700 grams died within 10 minutes of birth.

“If everything was normal, the mother should have delivered the baby on February 16. Now, the mother has been advised to continue KMC even at home till the baby’s weight increases to at least 2.5 kg,” she said.

Medical Superintendent Geeta Shivamurthy said the patient was brought to Vani Vilas in a critical condition.

“Of the nearly 1,600 babies born in the hospital every month, nearly 40% are pre-term babies. We have been successfully providing kangaroo care to such babies,” she said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/l7offa/article30854426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGVICTORIAHOSPITALPREMISES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pre-term-babies-get-the-kangaroo-care-treatment/article30854427.ece

On Tuesday, Mayor M. Goutham Kumar distributed the documents to 60 beneficiaries identified under the ‘Pourakarmika Gruhabhagya Yojane’.

The BBMP has already taken a decision to provide housing to 400 beneficiaries and they will get BDA flats in Alur. A release from BBMP states that out of the 400 beneficiaries, 272 have been identified.

For the financial year 2014-15, ₹25 crore was allocated. In 2015-16, ₹50 crore was allocated for the scheme.

The cost of each flat is ₹9 lakh out of which the Directorate of Municipal Administration will provide ₹6 lakh and the BBMP the remaining ₹3 lakh.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bda-flats-for-pourakarmikas/article30854258.ece
372,2020/02/18,CM seeks reduction of Bannerghatta’s eco-sensitive zone,"Cites stalling of development projects around park

The government has reiterated its stand to limit the Eco Sensitive Zone (ESZ) of Bannerghatta National Park to 168.84 sq km, drawing the ire of environmentalists in the city. The ESZ provides a regulated buffer zone around protected areas.

In a letter dated February 1 to Union Minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has stated that there is no change in the State government's stance in response to the request from the Union government to re-examine the possibility of retaining the original ESZ proposal with an area of 268.96 sq. km.

The Ministry for Environment, Forests and Climate Change had published the draft notification of ESZ of 168.84 sq.km., which was recommended for finalisation during the 33rd ESZ Expert Committee meeting held in February 2019. As reported previously in The Hindu, this represents a 37% reduction from the first draft notification issued in 2016 which had marked an ESZ of 268.9 sq.km.

However, in August 2019, the ministry had asked the State government to re-examine the possibility of retaining the original ESZ.

Justifying the government's stance, Mr. Yediyurappa, in the letter, stated that many development projects around the Bannerghatta National Park had stopped. The new ESZ will range from 100 metres (towards Bengaluru) to 1 kilometre (in Ramanagaram district) from the periphery of the protected area.

Environmentalist Vijay Nishanth said the move spells disaster for the city and exposes the BJP's hypocritical stance. “Three BJP MPs – Rajeev Chandrasekhar, P.C. Mohan and Tejasvi Surya – have written to the ministry against reduction of the ESZ. However, the CM has sought a reduction on the ground that development projects have come to a standstill,” he said and added that many citizens' groups struggled to put an end to illegal quarrying inside the ESZ. Signature campaigns to retain the original ESZ of 268.9 sq.km. were also taken up.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/cm-seeks-reduction-of-bannerghattas-eco-sensitive-zone/article30854182.ece
373,2020/02/18,Police chief asks citizens to test response time on Suraksha app,"Police promise to respond in eight minutes; App sees over 2.8 lakh downloads

Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao has invited citizens to test the response time of the local police on the Suraksha app for women, which has garnered over 2.8 lakh downloads.

“We encourage you to download [the app] and have the power to summon your Hoysala patrol car. Please call your patrol car, we will be with you within 8 minutes. No call will be a prank call,” he said on Twitter.

The commissioner’s tweet has not gone down well with the patrolling police, who say they are stretched thin. They are worried that the tweet will go viral and they will be inundated with calls from people who are simply ‘testing’ them and not really in need of help.

“It will be a nuisance if citizens start calling us randomly. This service offered by police is only meant for emergencies,” said a local police officer.

However, Mr. Rao said that the police are ready with the motto that no call is a prank call , in order to make the service popular and user friendly.

There are around 272 Hoysala patrolling vehicles deployed at strategic locations across the city to attend to calls within the stipulated time.

“There is a demand for an additional 100 patrol vehicles, which, if sanctioned, would further reduce the response time,” said a senior police officer.

Most of the alerts received via the Suraksha app are related to domestic fights, harassment of women, and passengers of taxis accusing the drivers of harassment, a senior police officer in charge of the Suraksha operations said.

“We get around 15 genuine alerts on the app and another 30 from people who want to check the response time. So far, the number of the latter has not increased. As we have been given specific instructions, every call received through this app is taken seriously, “ the officer added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fuh8iw/article30853949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BGPOLICEHOYSALA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-chief-asks-citizens-to-test-response-time-on-suraksha-app/article30853950.ece

375,2020/02/18,BBMP delimitation: HC pulls up government,"Indicates that it may impose hefty cost for forcing SEC to approach court

The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday cautioned that it may impose exemplary cost on the State government for forcing the State Election Commission (SEC), set up as per the Constitutional mandate, to approach the court for a direction to the government to complete the process of delimitation of wards of the Bruhat Bangalore Mahahagara Palike (BBMP) and fix caste-wise reservation for timely conduct of elections.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar said that the SEC was forced to approach the court by filling a petition due to failure of the State government to perform its statutory duties under provisions of the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976.

The bench was hearing a PIL petition filed by the SEC.

The bench also directed the government to inform the court by March 4 whether delimitation was done as per the 2011 census and when the ongoing process of delimitation commenced. This was after the government counsel said that the delimitation process would be completed in 30 days and reservation would be fixed by June to enable the SEC to complete the election process before September 10, the date on which the term of the BBMP council ends.

However, the bench said that prima facie, there was no impediment for the government to conduct the exercise of delimitation much earlier while observing that “prima faice it is a fit case to impose exemplary cost on the State government to force the SEC to approach the court.” At least cost of ₹10 lakh will have to be imposed on State, the bench observed orally.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-delimitation-hc-pulls-up-government/article30853309.ece
376,2020/02/18,Rabies death: BBMP slaps notice on private hospital,"Cites failure to follow protocol and inform civic officials of case

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has issued a notice to the private hospital where a 31-year-old woman from Cox Town died of rabies for allegedly failing to follow protocol and inform them of the case.

All private hospitals in the city are required to inform the civic body when a patient with any communicable disease gets admitted, said BBMP health officials. “In this particular case, the private hospital not only failed to inform the BBMP at the time of admission, it did not intimate the civic body even after the victim's death,” an official alleged. “We have taken the medical reports of the victim, including laboratory reports.”

The BBMP’s Animal Husbandry Department has taken up vaccination of stray dogs in Cox Town. In all, 48 stray dogs had been administered the anti-rabies vaccination (ARV).

Officials claimed that this was the first rabies death reported this year. In 2019, two deaths were reported but they occurred in areas outside BBMP limits. Three deaths were reported in 2018 – in Gavipuram Guttahalli, Jayanagar 3rd Block, and Nagawara.

“Following the recent rabies death, we have intensified the awareness campaigns in Cox Town and surrounding areas about preventing dog bites and precautions to be taken,” the official said and added that all referral hospitals of the BBMP have adequate stock of rabies immunoglobulin and anti-rabies serum.

Former joint director (animal husbandry) Parvez Ahmed Piran said dog bites are usually attributed to factors ranging from territorial, maternal or sexual aggression to aggression due to rabies. “Three factors – sexual aggression, maternal aggression and aggression due to rabies – can be taken care of by intensifying Animal Birth Control (ABC) and ARV programmes. Awareness campaigns must also focus on steps to be taken after a dog bite,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/rabies-death-bbmp-slaps-notice-on-private-hospital/article30853164.ece

378,2020/02/18,HC to initiate contempt proceedings against tree authority members,"This follows failure of the authority to start tree census as mandated by the court

The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the Bengaluru Urban District Tree Authority to submit the names of all its members for initiating contempt proceedings against them for not commencing tree census in the city despite a specific direction given by the court on August 20, 2019 setting a deadline of two weeks to start the process.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction during the hearing of a PIL petition that complained of non-implementation of various provisions of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act, 1976.

As R. Gokul, Chairperson of Bengaluru Urban District Tree Authority, who was present in the court, was not able to answer the court’s query as to whether the census would commence by tomorrow, the Bench said there was no option but to initiate contempt of court proceedings against the members of the tree authority as there was “blatant violation” of the specific direction issued six months ago.

Observing that tree census in the city, as mandated by law 44 years ago, was not commenced despite the specific direction of the court, the Bench said though the Commissioner of the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike has said in his affidavit that the proposed tree census cannot be confined to only of the trees on the sides of the roads, the affidavit still refers to census of only such trees and does not include trees on public and private properties.

Interestingly, a counsel for Institute of Wood Science and Technology orally indicated to the court about withdrawing from the task of conducting the census and to refund the amount received from the BBMP while entering into an agreement for conducting tree census.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/hc-to-initiate-contempt-proceedings-against-tree-authority-members/article30852645.ece

380,2020/02/18,Online only booking for BIFFes irks cine enthusiasts,"The process for booking tickets and passes for the upcoming Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFes) has been made into an online procedure via a single platform – BookMyShow.com, irking many cine enthusiasts.

“Making bookings online is not an issue, but making it mandatory to book online with no option of physically buying passes is wrong. The option to physically buy passes must also be provided. Several senior citizens are not comfortable booking online,” said Avinash K., a cine enthusiast and a techie.

Effort to go paperless

However, Sunil Puranik, chairperson, Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy, said most film festivals had this system and people would get used to it, though he acknowledged there would be some teething trouble. He said the decision was made to make the festival paperless.

Sharing credentials

What has also irked many is that the platform has made giving out credentials – Aadhaar or Driving License or Passport Number – mandatory for booking passes. Many have argued they are not comfortable giving out their credentials to a private firm and it was wrong to make this a prerequisite for booking a pass.

“It is unethical of the government body to allow a private firm to access our credentials. We are forced to give out our credentials if we want to book a delegate pass. This is a violation of data privacy protocol,” said K. Phaniraj, an academician and film enthusiast. He also pointed out a recent Supreme Court order struck down Section 57 of the Aadhaar Act that allowed corporate entities or even individuals to demand Aadhaar credentials for goods and services.

Mr. Phaniraj has started a mass e-mail campaign to BIFFes organisers. “We oppose succumbing to a business booking platform for gaining total control for registration. It is patently unethical for a private business platform to access our private data by asking to upload our credentials”, the email reads.

Mr. Puranik said he will look into the concerns of giving out credentials on a private platform. However, another senior organiser of the festival said at most festivals across the world, furnishing credentials was a must for a delegate pass and it was not like just booking tickets for a movie.

BIFFes selection list

BIFFes recently announced the list of films selected for all the four competition sections – Kannada, Kannada Popular Entertainment, India and Asian. But the selection, or rather the omissions, in the Kannada section has drawn criticism.

The exclusion of three films – Arishadvarga directed by Arvind Kamath, Gantumoote directed by Roopa Rao that have been selected for multiple film festivals, and Mohandas, a film on Mahatma Gandhi’s childhood directed by multiple award winning director P. Sheshadri – have now become bone of contention.

“I am surprised that my film was not selected. It is the first film on Gandhi’s childhood and is an ambitious project made in three languages shot at locations related to the Mahatma. It is also based on a Sahitya Akademi winning Kannada book by Bolwar Mahammad Kunhi. I was looking forward to première the film at the home festival,” Mr. Sheshadri said.

What has also drawn the ire of filmmakers and enthusiasts is that certain films have been repeated in multiple sections. For instance, Bell Bottom and Kavaludaari are being screened in Kannada and Kannada Popular Entertainment sections, while the recent release Mundina Nildana is being screened in the Kannada and Asian Film competition section.

N. Vidyashankar, artistic director, BIFFes, said the selection of films was the call of an independent screening committee for each category. “The committee has representatives from film directors, producers, technicians and critics. The seven-member committee also includes three from outside the State.

381,2020/02/18,Grape exports hit by COVID-19,"Grapes and watermelon mela from Wednesday at HOPCOMS outlets

COVID-19, which has affected tourism and other trades, has also reportedly impacted grape exports from the State.

HOPCOMS (Horticultural Producers’ Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society Ltd.), which announced the ‘Grape and Watermelon Mela 2020’ in its outlets here from Wednesday, said most countries had become cautious about imports. “Countries in the Gulf, such as the U.A.E, which used to import grapes, have not imported the usual quantity as they are cautious of importing food due to the COVID-19 scare. As a result, the export of grapes has dropped,” said HOPCOMS president A.S. Chandre Gowda. In addition, the yields have been lower this year due to the prolonged monsoon. “Around 13,000 hectares of plantation is in Vijayapura district alone and around 4,500 hectares in Belagavi district was worse hit as intermittent rains even after the monsoon and cloudy weather resulted in 35% to 40% low yield this time,” he added. Chickballapur district, however, will not be affected much as farmers grow grapes in the second stage (February and March). It is expected to get a decent yield this year, he said.

The mela will go on till the end of March. Around 15 varieties of grapes, including Sharad seedless, Thompson seedless, Taj Ganesh Sonaka, and four to five varieties of watermelon – Namdhari and Kiran – will be sold at 10% discount at HOPCOMS outlets.

B.N. Prasad, MD, HOPCOMS, said it planned sell over 500 tonnes of grapes and 1,500 tonnes of watermelon. At the last mela, over 350 tonnes of grapes and 1,000 tonnes of watermelon were sold. “Fruits will be purchased directly from farmers of Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Koppal, Gadag, Belagavi, Kolar, Chickballapur and Bengaluru Rural districts,” he said. The amount would be directly deposited into their accounts within four days. “We will give them a little over the market price,” he added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/cw39os/article30846385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGGRAPESMELAFILEPHOTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/grape-exports-hit-by-covid-19/article30846386.ece
382,2020/02/18,Power supply to CBD hit as transformers catch fire,"Electricity supply to many areas in Central Business District, including Vidhana Soudha and Vikasa Soudha, was affected

A major fire broke out at the Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Ltd. (KPTCL) 66 kV power station at Anand Rao Circle on Monday afternoon, sending officials of the transmission company and Fire and Emergency Services into a tizzy.

Power supply to many areas in the Central Business District, including the power centre Vidhana Soudha and Vikasa Soudha, was affected.

With the legislation session in progress, the officials were on high alert. Power supply to Vidhana Soudha was immediately provided from C Station, near Cantonment.

Manjula Naik, MD, KPTCL, told The Hindu that prima facie, it appeared that the 20 MVA transformer had a fault and caught fire when the breaker system failed to trip. When the 24-year-old transformer caught fire, it spread to the adjacent transformer. It took over half an hour for the Fire and Emergency Services personnel to control the blaze.

“This is the first time that such an incident has occurred. Following the fire, power supply to Vidhana Soudha, Vikasa Soudha, Cauvery Bhavan, Madhav Nagar and few other areas was affected,” she said, and added that the loss due to the fire was pegged at ₹5 crore.

The blaze had also damaged wires of another transformer at the site. “The third transformer is being repaired. Meanwhile, the fourth transformer will be pressed into service. By the end of Monday, around 70% of the power requirement will be taken care of,” she said.

The two transformers that caught fire will have to be removed for repairs. If they can’t be repaired, they will have to be junked. To ensure uninterrupted power supply to Vidhana Soudha and other government establishments in the CBD, in view of the legislature sessions, KPTCL will replace the faulty transformer with a new one by February 26.

The two transformers were transmitting around 60 MW. While the two remaining ones will be able to transmit nearly 45 MW, for the remaining, Bangalore Electricty Supply Company (Bescom) will have to change over the load from other stations, such as Victoria Hospital station or Telecom station.

Admitting that power supply could be an issue for a few more days, Ms. Naik said that Bescom would probably have to enforce two to three hours of load-shedding in CBD. “Once the new transformer is installed and commissioned, the power supply situation will be normalised by February 27,” Ms. Naik added. Bescom officials said the situation was ‘under control’.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/amx30u/article30846365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGBESCOMTRANSFORMER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/power-supply-to-cbd-hit-as-transformers-catch-fire/article30846366.ece
383,2020/02/18,Nirmala Sitharaman lauds Bengaluru’s Budget inputs,"Bengaluru actively participated in the preparation of Union Budget 2020-21 proposals by offering thoughts and valuable inputs, said Union Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman.

According to her, after the submission of the Budget it was important for her to go around the country to meet people and industry and trade representatives who provided inputs for the Budget. Addressing a large audience of businessmen and tax professionals here on Monday, she said, “Some require explanation or more clarity. Budget is the growth blueprint of the country for the next five years.”

Mohandas Pai said the country was fast becoming a digital economy and clarity around tax was still a big issue. “Please remove surcharge on capital gains. There is 28% tax on unlisted stock that is not liquid and, therefore, it comes with high risk. This has to be equated with listed stock and tax has to be reduced to 15%. No other country has such a tax structure. If this continues, businesses won’t be able to get capital, especially when the country will require capital to the tune of $100 billion by 2025,” he said.

Responding to an industry request for extension of compliance deadline for e-invoice for GST, the Finance Minister said the decision was taken some eight or nine months ago by the GST Council and there was enough time for the transition. From April 1, e-invoice will be made mandatory in the country for companies that are in the ₹100-crore revenue range and firms that comply will also be able to generate tax returns online automatically.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/nirmala-sitharaman-lauds-bengalurus-budget-inputs/article30846359.ece

385,2020/02/18,BBMP staff locked up by gang of four,"Accused wanted them to give him documents related to a plot at Hosahalli

A gang of four, including a landlord, allegedly locked up a woman assistant revenue officer of the BBMP and other staff in the office premise in RPC Layout near Vijayanagar on Saturday. Police arrested the prime accused Shivakumar soon after the incident came to light. Property dispute is said to be the reason.

BBMP staff on Monday staged a protest demanding strict action against the accused.

A police officer from Vijayanagar police station said that based on a complaint by Nirmala S.M., 55, an assistant revenue officer, the accused had been arrested.

The officer, in her complaint, alleged that she was locked up along with her staff from 5 p.m. till 10 p.m. Shivakumar, along with his associates Sachin, Omkar N. and Dakshinamurthy, came to the office in the evening and demanded documents related to a plot situated in Hosahalli. As he sought documents from 2003-04, the staff asked for a few days’ time.

But Shivakumar was allegedly not ready to listen and he locked the gate from outside. His associates allegedly snatched mobile phones and other belongings. The staff were told that they would not be allowed to leave until the documents were produced, she said in her complaint.

The family members, who tried to call the staff on their phones, reached the office around 10.30 p.m. They recorded the incident on video before alerting the police.

387,2020/02/18,Commuters begin taking bicycles inside Chennai Metro trains,"While some have said it has made their travel easier, other commuters are asking for clarification on what kind of bicylces are allowed on the trains

No sooner did the Chennai Metro Rail allow commuters to take their bicycles on to trains, than quite a few Chennaiites began taking full advantage of the provision.

Vedanarayanan Mahadevan, a 28-year-old resident of Kolathur regularly travels by the Chennai Metro. “I travel to Thirumangalam station, park my bike and head to Ekkatuthangal and then take a share auto to my office. Today, instead of that, I cycled to Thirumangalam, took the bicycle on the train all the way and then reached my workplace. It was a very convenient and seamless form of travel,” he says.

Commuters can take small and handy cycles only in Special Class, which means, they pay twice the normal fare. “I have to pay parking charges and for last-mile connectivity too, everyday; so, instead of all that, I will be paying a little more for the ticket, which I don’t mind. I save time to a great extent and cycling makes for a good exercise. I plan to take it regularly henceforth,” he adds.

Uma Reddy, a resident of Porur who travels to Shollinganallur every day says she was delighted when this initiative was introduced. “It becomes too tiring to take the car or bike every day to work. While this may be more expensive, I don’t mind paying as I can drastically save time and it becomes a great way to work out,” she adds.

But there are some commuters who are unhappy that they have to pay for special class and some say there is not much clarity on what kind of bicycles can be carried inside trains. Some have posted on Twitter too, about the need for a clear mention of the rule: if any cycle can carried or only ones that can be folded. A commuter Arun Ramachandran posted, “The notice is vague what is small ,smart, handy bikes? The London Underground clearly says only folding bikes allowed. The most common bikes on road are nearly 6-7 feet long and might not even fit into the turnstiles. CMRL should have a very clear bike cycle policy.”

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), not just foldable ones, any cycle that is compact and can be carried inside trains, will be allowed.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/commuters-begin-taking-bicycles-inside-chennai-metro-trains/article30850904.ece
388,2020/02/18,NGT pulls up Tamil Nadu’s local bodies for failing at waste﻿ management,"The Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal has taken suo motu cognisance of reports of waste dumped in Porur lake

Local body authorities are failing in their duty to collect waste from residents, segregate waste at source and recycle where possible and dispose of the remaining waste in a scientific manner, the Southern Bench of the National Green Tribunal observed.

Taking suo moto cognisance of allegations of indiscriminate dumping of plastic waste in a portion of Porur Lake, the bench of Justice K. Ramakrishnan and expert member Saibal Dasgupta reminded the authorities of their duties under the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. .

Based on a newspaper report, the Bench took cognisance of the matter noting that the lake is now filled with dumping of plastic waste and it has become a dumping ground. “It is also seen from the photograph that cattle are grazing in that area, eating the plastic, which is likely to affect the health of the cattle as well as the food chain,” the bench observed.

Stating that the water body was in a ‘pathetic condition’, the bench said that it has been repeatedly pointed out by the Supreme Court and the NGT in several cases that there is a duty on the part of the State government as well as local authorities to maintain water bodies that will provide a better eco-system along with water sustenance. It will also enable water recharge facility improving the ground water level in the locality, they said.

389,2020/02/18,Madras HC reserves order on Kalki Bhagavan’s kin plea,"Preetha Krishna had challenged a lookout circular which prevented from going abroad

The Madras High Court on Monday reserved its orders on a writ petition filed by Preetha Krishna, daughter-in-law of ‘Kalki’ Bhagavan, challenging a lookout circular issued by the Income Tax department on December 5 preventing her from flying abroad without a I-T clearance certificate.

Justice Anita Sumanth deferred her verdict after hearing arguments advanced by the petitioner’s counsel Nithyaesh Natraj and the senior standing counsel for I-T department A.P. Srinivas and after taking the counter affidavits on file.

After conclusion of arguments, Mr. Natraj urged the court to consider his client’s request for an interim order permitting her to travel abroad from February 24. She had filed an affidavit of undertaking before the court stating that her husband and daughter would be available in India.

Referring to an order passed by a Division Bench of the High Court in 2018 allowing Sivaganga MP Karti P. Chidambaram to fly abroad when a lookout circular against him was pending, the counsel said a similar relief could be granted for his client too.

On the other hand, Mr. Srinivas told the court that a search and seize operation conducted at the residences, trusts as well as companies run by Sri Bhagavan alias Vijay Kumar, his wife Amma Bhagavan alias Padmavati Vijay Kumar, son N.K.V. Krishna and the latter’s wife Ms. Krishna had led to recovery of huge amount of valuables.

Searches in 38 places

The operation was carried out on 38 premises in Chennai, Chittoor, Hyderabad and Bengaluru and one of them was Ms. Krishna’s residence on East Coast Road here from where unaccounted cash of ₹23.87 crore and foreign currency totalling $1.25 million (valued approximately to be ₹9 crore) had been seized by the I-T sleuths.

Further, 5,678 grams of gold jewellery worth ₹1.68 crore and 433.47 carats of diamonds worth ₹1.7 crore were found in her residence and placed under prohibitory orders. During the course of search, it was found that unaccounted cash had been generated by companies and trusts in which the petitioner was either a shareholder or trustee.

It was found that trusts/companies run by Sri Bhagavan and his son were involved in generating unaccounted cash which worked out to ₹409 crore. Further, ₹131 crore had been transferred through hawala channels to be invested in foreign entities in which the petitioner and her husband were holding beneficial interests, the I-T department alleged.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/madras-hc-reserves-order-on-kalki-bhagavans-kin-plea/article30846816.ece
390,2020/02/18,‘Sri Lanka has stopped releasing seized boats’,"Centre’s submission in High Court

The Centre on Monday told the Madras High Court that since 2015 Sri Lanka had stopped releasing boats of Indian fishermen apprehended on charges of trespassing into foreign waters for illegal fishing, particularly through the banned method of bottom trawling.

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar were told that the decision to not release the boats was taken as a measure of deterrence and that the Sri Lankan government had also amended its laws in July 2017 and January 2018 to prevent illegal fishing and bottom trawling by foreign vessels too.

“The Sri Lankan government has been prosecuting the fishermen arrested for fishing in Sri Lankan waters before the Magistrate courts concerned and also the Sri Lankan courts have been ordering the presence of the owners of the boats for the release of the fishing vessels,” the counter affidavit read.

It was filed in response to a public interest litigation petition filed by Fishermen Care, a non-governmental organisation represented by its president L.T.A. Peter Rayan, accusing the Centre of not having provided sufficient funds for the rehabilitation of Indian fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy.

Assuring the court that the Centre had been taking continuous efforts to get the boats as well as the arrested Indian fishermen released, the counter stated that the issue had to be sorted out only through diplomatic channels, since the jurisdiction of the Indian courts would not extend to a foreign country.

In so far as allocation of funds for rehabilitation of fishermen was concerned, the Centre said that that it had released ₹.184.93 crore in the last five years to the State government for the implementation of the Blue Revolution: Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries scheme.

Further, another ₹.300 crore was allocated for providing assistance for deep sea fishing and constructing a fish landing centre at Kunthukal in Ramanathapuram district. A specific advice had also been issued to the State government to give priority to fishermen, who had lost their boats while granting assistance, it said.

The scheme was being implemented specifically for the benefit of the fishermen belonging to Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Pudukottai and Ramanathapuram and those who fish in the Palk Bay region. They were being provided financial assistance for provision of housing, drinking water and construction of community halls.

The fishermen were also being trained in deep sea fishing, long lining and on-board processing of fish and the Centrally sponsored scheme provides for conversion of trawlers into resource specific deep sea fishing vessels through 100% subsidy with a ceiling of ₹15 lakh per vessel, the Centre said.

After taking the counter affidavit, filed through senior central government standing counsel J. Madhanagopal Rao on file, the judges directed the petitioner’s counsel L.P. Maurya to file his rejoinder in two weeks.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sri-lanka-has-stopped-releasing-seized-boats/article30846811.ece

393,2020/02/18,Let Murasoli Trust prove it is not squatting on panchami land: NCSC,"Commission claims it has powers to probe complaint that SCs were denied land

The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) has told the Madras High Court that it has all powers to inquire into a complaint received against Murasoli Trust, which publishes the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s official organ, of squatting over a panchami land assigned during the British era for the exclusive use of those belonging to the Scheduled Castes (SCs).

In a counter affidavit filed before Justice C.V. Karthikeyan, the Commission, represented by its vice-chairman L. Murugan, said the scope of the inquiry initiated by it was not to give a finding on the title of the property like a civil court, as claimed by one of the trustees R.S. Bharathi of DMK, but only to the limited extent of finding out whether it was a Panchami land or not.

“If at all the petitioner is innocent and the disputed land is not a panchami land, they could declare to the whole world in black and white with proper documents. On the other hand, the petitioner is making unwanted allegations against this respondent,” the counter affidavit read.

The common counter, filed on behalf of the NCSC as well as Mr. Murugan in his personal capacity, stated that it was the duty of the commission to find out whether any panchami land had been “fraudulently” taken away by people not belonging to the SCs. It also stated that the trust had indulged in mudslinging against the vice-chairman.

“Even if the complaint is politically motivated, nothing prevents the petitioner from establishing their innocence and genuineness during the course of inquiry,” the counter affidavit added.

The counter was filed in response to a case preferred by the trust to restrain the NCSC from inquiring into a complaint lodged by R. Srinivasan of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who accused the trust of having usurped over 12 grounds of panchami land at Kodambakkam in Chennai. The trust had claimed that NCSC lacks jurisdiction to decide the title of a property.

The trust also accused Mr. Murugan of bias. It alleged that he had failed to shed his ties with BJP even after assuming office as the vice-chairman of NCSC.

When the case was heard on Monday, senior counsel P. Wilson, representing the trust, said he had filed a petition to amend the cause title of his case.

Initially the trust made the NCSC, represented by its vice-president, the first respondent to the case. Now, it wanted to amend it and make the NCSC, represented by its secretary, a party respondent. However, Assistant Solicitor General G. Karthikeyan took strong exception to the amendment petition and said the commission could not be represented by its secretary. He sought time for filing of a separate counter affidavit opposing the latest plea for amendment. Accepting his request, the judge adjourned the case to March 6.

When the complainant’s counsel S. Ravi pointed out that while the trust was, on one hand, asserting with authority that the property was not a panchami land, on the other it was claiming that it was only a tenant on that property, the judge said those arguments could be made during the final hearing of the case after the completion of pleadings.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/klp6qt/article30846777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18MURASOLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/let-murasoli-trust-prove-it-is-not-squatting-on-panchami-land-ncsc/article30846778.ece
394,2020/02/18,TNPSC exam scam echoes in Tamil Nadu Assembly,"The AIADMK and DMK engaged in a heated debate in the Assembly on Monday over malpractices in the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC) examinations that occurred under their respective governments.

During the debate, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami asked whether the DMK was willing to withdraw the cases on the basis of which orders were given by the court staying investigation into such malpractices during the DMK regime between 2006 and 2011. He insisted that there was material evidence in the case.

The TNPSC scam was raised in the House by DMK MLA S. Sudharsanam, against the backdrop of the arrest of those involved in the Group IV and II examinations.

Certain remarks made by DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan, Minister D. Jayakumar and DMK MLA S. Sudharsanam over the issue were expunged by the Speaker.

However, Minister for Personnel and Administrative Reforms D. Jayakumar listed out the actions taken by the CB-CID in connection with the current cases. He then said that during the previous DMK government, the DVAC had conducted searches at the house of a former TNPSC Chairman. DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan objected to this.

Intervening in the debate, the CM said Mr. Jayakumar only made a reference to the case to point out that such malpractices had happened in the past too.

“The DVAC conduced raids and there is some evidence that has been uncovered.

395,2020/02/18,Seemai Karuvelam: HC ropes in NEERI,"Batch of petitions on ill-effects of invasive species on groundwater to be heard on June 10

The Madras High Court on Monday called for a report from National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) at Nagpur on the supposed ill-effects of Seemai Karuvelam (prosopis juliflora) trees, an invasive species found across the State, on the environment, with particular reference to the water table.

A Full Bench comprising Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, Justice M.M. Sundresh and Justice M. Sundar took the decision at the instance of Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) general secretary Vaiko, an MP, who appeared as a party-in-person and insisted upon eradicating the species to save the water table.

It was in 2017 that a Bench of Justices A. Selvam and P. Kalaiyarasan (since retired) had begun a crusade against Seemai Karuvelam trees by not just ordering their eradication but also by forming a team of 180 advocate commissioners to supervise the work done by government officials besides instructing the judicial officers to over see the work.

Funds were solicited for the work and a separate bank account was opened in the Indian Bank branch inside the premises of the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court. However, subsequently, the case was referred to a Full Bench of the court since doubts were raised over the appropriateness of terming the species as harmful without conclusive scientific evidence.

In May 2017, a Full Bench led by the then Chief Justice Indira Banerjee added four more members to a government-constituted eight-member committee, under the chairmanship of the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Research), and directed it to submit a report after conducting a detailed study on the supposed ill-effects of Seemai Karuvelam.

Hearing delayed

Although the committee had submitted its report on October 9, 2017, the case was not taken up for hearing after that until the incumbent Chief Justice noticed the delay and decided to take up the case on Monday when advocate T. Mohan, representing a public interest litigant, claimed that there were many inconsistencies in the report submitted by the committee.

He said the committee had at one place stated the most observed negative impact of Seemai Karuvelam was on water channels and waterbodies and at another stated that it did not affect groundwater level. He said the report contradicted itself from page to page.

At this point, Mr. Vaiko urged the court to include an expert from NEERI into the committee. After considering his plea, the court directed the petitioners before the court to submit before the committee, all materials that were available with them to prove the deleterious effect of Seemai Karuvelam so that it could file another comprehensive report to the government.

396,2020/02/18,Drugs worth ₹3.4 crore seized by Customs,"About 6.8 kg of methaqualone, a drug that acts as sedative and hypnotic and made famous in the film The Wolf of Wall Street, was seized by Chennai Customs, according to a press release. The seizure is worth ₹3.4 crore.

On Sunday, based on a tip-off that a huge quantity of narcotic drugs was being smuggled out of the country, the Courier Intelligence Unit of Air Customs sifted through a city warehouse. The team took out a parcel that was declared to contain ribbon rolls and apparels.

When officials opened the parcel, it had ribbon rolls but they seemed heavier than usual.

In a hollow cavity inside, there were plastic pouches with white crystalline powder. There were 57 such pouches. They were tested using a narcotics testing kit and seized under the Narcotics, Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. They were also sent for confirmation test.

A resident of the city had booked the parcel to Australia.

397,2020/02/18,Inter-State chain snatcher nabbed,"Police got inputs about accused from counterparts in other States

The Thirumangalam police have arrested a 29-year-old habitual chain-snatching accused from Maharashtra, who is involved in offences at Anna Nagar and the surrounding areas since December.

Following a series of complaints of chain snatching in Anna Nagar, Thirumangalam, Arumbakkam and Kilpauk, a special police team was constituted.

After scrutinising footage from 60 CCTVs, the police team zeroed in on the movement of a suspect, who was roaming on a bike with an Andhra Pradesh registration number plate. The police got inputs from their counterparts in four other States. He was identified by the Maharashtra and Telangana police.

Investigations disclosed that a two-wheeler used by the man for the offence had been stolen from Hyderabad.

As soon as he struck again on February 1, the police team intensified its search and nabbed the suspect, who was identified as Amol Balasaheb Shinde alias Amol of Parbhani in Maharashtra, during a routine vehicle check on Sunday. He was remanded in judicial custody. Investigation revealed that he was involved in chain snatching offences in other States too.

398,2020/02/18,Corporation told to inspect MGR statue,"The Madras High Court on Monday directed the Greater Chennai Corporation Commissioner to inspect a statue of former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran, reportedly installed without permission outside the Varasakthi Vinayagar Temple at Nesapakkam, and submit a report to the court by next month.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha passed the order on a public interest litigation petition filed by M. Gopla, a local resident and a retired railway employee. Petitioner’s counsel A.P. Suryaprakasam told the court that the temple in question at Nesapakkam was nearly 275 years old.

Constructed as per the Agama rules, it had been designed in such a way that devotees would be able to see the main tower, flag mast and the deity together. However, Over the years, local politicians had begun installing party flag masts and statues of political leaders, thereby blocking free view of the deity inside the temple.

After repeated representations, the Congress and DMK Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam partymen removed the idols of former Chief Minister Kamaraj and C.N.

399,2020/02/18,In situ redevelopment offers hope to dwellers along waterways,"Plan to rebuild 1.08 lakh housing units at a cost of ₹10,000 crore in major cities

As many as 59,607 families along city waterways such as Buckingham Canal, Adyar and Cooum are waiting to be resettled.

A recent government order has given hope to many of these residents, if they are not encroachers, of getting a new home, most of them in situ, on unobjectionable land close to their residence.

Work on enumeration of families living in 87 slums along the Buckingham Canal started recently. However, it has been disrupted owing to protests by residents. The number of families living along the canal is estimated to be over 40,000. All these families will get new houses in the vicinity.

According to the order, the government has allocated over ₹10,800 crore for the in situ redevelopment in slum areas in various parts of the State. The funds will be from the Central and State governments and beneficiary contributions.

This is part of the plan to redevelop 1.08 lakh housing units in situ.

A total of 13.55 lakh houses will be constructed in various urban areas, including Chennai, under the slum free cities programme.

Families in many slums along waterways such as Buckingham Canal are likely to get new houses in the residential neighbourhood where land parcels have been identified.

Civic agencies such as the Chennai Corporation have started exploring the possibility of identifying land resources along waterways for in situ redevelopment of slums.

The Corporation has demolished houses of 11,661 families in slums along the waterways, resettling them far away. With the allocation of funds, many of the remaining families need not relocate to far away places.

To cost ₹10 lakh

“We have enumerated 71,268 families along waterways in the city. We have resettled 11,661 families so far,” said an official.

Each of the redeveloped house is expected to cost ₹10 lakh. The space available for eco-restoration will not reduce because of the in situ redevelopment of slums, said an official.

However, those who have encroached upon waterbodies will not get such houses, officials clarify.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/in-situ-redevelopment-offers-hope-to-dwellers-along-waterways/article30846672.ece
400,2020/02/18,Include Union Territory in 15th Finance Commission: Ramadass,"‘Peg expenditure of Centre and U.T. on CSS at 90:10 instead of the current 60:40’

Former MP M. Ramadass has suggested a set of measures to the Centre to lift the Union Territory out of its financial distress, including, as a first step, its inclusion in the 15th Finance Commission.

In a statement, Mr. Ramadass called for waiver of the ₹2,177 crore loan as on the date of opening of public account and for the reimbursement of the government servants’ pension payment, as being done in the case of Delhi.

While calling for pegging the ratio of expenditure of the Centre and the Union Territory on centrally-sponsored schemes (CSS) at 90:10 instead of the present 60:40, Mr. Ramadass also wanted the annual increase in central assistance to be 18% to offset inflationary impact.

He said the Union Budget for 2020-21, with financial outlay of ₹30,42,230 crore, has disappointed the fund-crunched Puducherry, both in terms of paltry increase in the transfer of resources as well as absence of any new scheme of financial relief.

The central assistance to Puducherry, no doubt, is higher than that of last year (₹1,601 crore) by ₹102 crore, but it is meagre when viewed in the backdrop of serious problems faced by the UT, he said.

In real terms, the increase is just only 6.4% for Puducherry but for Delhi, the respective escalation is 37.4%, from ₹812 crore in 2019-20 to ₹1,116 crore in 2020-21.

“When a financially comfortable Delhi receives 37.4% increase, a mere 6.4% increase to a financially afflicted territory is highly iniquitous and unjustifiable,” he said.

‘Reduced real value’

Further, viewed in the context of 8% running inflation, 6.4% increase reduces the real value of this year’s outlay of ₹1,703 crore to ₹ 1,566.8 crore. This outlay may just be sufficient to repay the principal and interest commitment of the UT’s debt, which was ₹1,550 crore last year.

The government has found it difficult to present full-fledged budgets consecutively for eight years, pay salaries to its employees in various departments and public sector organisations for months on end, honour its pension commitment, pay its contractors and suppliers for the services rendered, provide grants in aid and purchase provisions for schools and health institutions.

The three key fiscal parameters — revenue deficit, fiscal deficit and primary deficit — of the government have grown beyond sustainable limits, leading to high ratio of fiscal deficit to State income and a high debt ratio.

“Puducherry is a highly in-debt Territory in the country. The financial crisis has added to the woes of already ailing economy here,” he said.

According to the former MP, the non-inclusion of Puducherry under 15th Finance Commission (FC) has precluded the possibility of obtaining greater finance from the Centre. The estimated share of Puducherry under the 15th FC would be around ₹3,518 crore, which is higher by ₹1,815 crore than the present allocation, he said.

He suggested that the Centre provide financial assistance of ₹3,500 crore including assistance for CSS as compared to ₹1,890 crore provided last year.

He urged the Puducherry government to submit a report to the Union Finance Minister highlighting the above issues.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7a3mpm/article30846670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAMADASS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/include-union-territory-in-15th-finance-commission-ramadass/article30846671.ece
401,2020/02/18,Students should revive agriculture: Viswanathan,"‘NSS camps give students glimpse of village life’

The National Service Scheme (NSS) Special Camp is organised every year in an adopted village with active participation of students from Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT). This year’s NSS programme was inaugurated in Government Higher Secondary School in Pennathur near Vellore on Monday.

Activities during the camp include volunteering at government schools, conducting clinical blood tests and identifying blood group of students and creating awareness on conservation of water and land resources in the chosen village.

Volunteering at schools

The volunteers teach mathematics, computer science and English. They impart knowledge on handling mental stress, higher education opportunities in India and abroad, facing examinations with ease, development of individual skills and compliance with traffic rules to the school students.

VIT chancellor G. Viswanathan, who inaugurated the camp, said it would enable students to understand the life and culture of villagers.

‘Clarify doubts’

He asked school children to desist complacency and pro-actively clarify doubts from teachers and to master the ubiquitous English language.

Recalling that the Palar river was once a perennial river, he said that farming activities flourished in Vellore district. With their efforts, students should try to revive agriculture, which remains the mainstay industry for the entire nation, he said.

403,2020/02/18,"On day four, anti-CAA protesters dig in their heels","Agitators persist with their demand for a resolution against CAA in the Assembly

Dismayed over the State government’s refusal to pass a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the Assembly, the protesters at Old Washermenpet in Chennai continued their agitation for the fourth day on Monday.

The agitators, including a large number of Muslim women, persisted with their demand for the passing of Assembly resolutions against the CAA, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register, during the ongoing Budget session.

Vowing to continue their peaceful agitation against the ‘regressive’ and ‘anti-people’ Act, the protesters said they will, at the least, need an assurance from the State government that it will resist the CAA which, according to them, will penalise citizens, especially minorities.

While the protests have largely been led by the youth, people of other age groups have also been taking part.

A. Katheeja Beevi, a doctor by profession, who has been protesting since 12 noon on Friday, said, “It seems that there is no respect for the feelings of the public in our democratic country. Now, we feel as if we are under autocratic rule. So many people, including many from other religions, have gathered here and are putting forth a demand. Why is the government not acceding to our demand? Can the people in power bring in any law they want with scant regard for the views of people like us?”

“From children to elderly women, everyone has come together. No one has paid any heed to our problems. We left our homes and have been protesting day and night without any sleep. We will not budge until the State government accepts our demands,” a protester said.

Badrunnisha of Royapuram, who is in her eighties, said, “With the enactment of the CAA, the officials will ask for the birth certificates of even my parents. There used to be a time when births took place in houses. How can someone get a certificate [for that]?”

The youth were seen regulating the crowd and the traffic to ensure that the protest remained peaceful.

404,2020/02/18,"Murugadoss, Darbar distributors enter into a truce, HC closes cases","‘It was not fair on the part of litigants to take courts for a ride’

The Madras High Court on Monday expressed its displeasure over film director A.R. Murugadoss having filed a petition about a week ago seeking police protection from film distributors of Rajinikanth starrer Darbar but now not interested even in pursuing a complaint lodged against them with the police.

Justice P. Rajamanickam said, it was not fair on the part of litigants to take the courts for a ride. When the plea seeking police protection was listed for hearing, Additional Public Prosecutor M. Mohamed Riyaz told the court that the city police had registered a First Information Report on the basis of the director’s complaint.

The complaint stated that the distributors were threatening him for the loss suffered by them due to distribution of the movie though they were actually supposed to raise their grievances only with the producer. After the registration of the FIR, the complainant as well as the accused appeared to have settled the issue amicably, he said. On his part, advocate Vijayan Subramanian, representing Mr. Murugadoss, told the court that after the registration of the FIR, the film distributors’ association had assured the film directors’ association that the petitioner shall not be disturbed any further in this regard and hence his client had decided not to pursue the complaint.

He had also written a letter to the police asking them to drop all further proceedings.

405,2020/02/18,India’s disturbing trauma narrative,"In the silence over violence being perpetrated against children, the country appears to have lost its moral compass

If the seizure of a pair of slippers of an 11-year-old as evidence in an investigation in a sedition case in Bidar, Karnataka, was not ludicrous enough, the imprisonment of a mother of a student in the same case for having contributed to the script of an apparently seditious primary school play, the arrest of the principal for allowing it to be performed in her school, and the interrogation of the children by uniformed police officers in the absence of any child welfare workers, would make a perfect script for an Orwellian nightmare.

Violation of rights

For those puzzled readers who may be wondering what the pair of slippers might have to do with this surreal theatre, it was the very object referred to in the play, according to media reports, when a child says “the boy who was selling tea till the other day is asking us for documents. I’ll ask him where he was born and where his papers are. If he does not provide them, I will beat him with my slippers”. Even if some patriots might argue that a child’s slippers could indeed be used to wage war on our great nation and the remand report for the two women “found grounds for suspicion that the two influenced the children”, the students themselves insisted, even after repeated interrogation, that they wrote the play themselves.

On the other hand, one child told HuffPost India, “We were scared. The policemen raised their voice every time they questioned us.” Not surprisingly, many students have stopped going to school since then.

I imagine most people would think that this story must be fake news not only because it is so utterly absurd but also because our police who cannot find a moment to stop the lawless mayhem on our roads which have made India one of the world’s largest traffic-death countries must surely be doing more important things. But the soul-crushing truth is that these events did happen. Leaving aside the numbing irony that a law designed by the British to suppress the freedom of speech of our avowedly non-violent independence activists should now be used by the police to suppress the freedom of expression of schoolchildren, my anguish is because of the terror that these children must have experienced as a result of this ordeal.

Not only did the arrest of the mother, a single parent, leave the child in the care of a neighbour but the arrest of the principal of their school left all the children without their trusted headmistress. Simultaneously, the police, threatening as they must have seemed to the children in their full regalia and having carted away the mother and principal to jail, were trying to get them to squeal incriminating evidence which could be used against these very trusted adults.

On ‘toxic stress’

These traumatic experiences are not only a violation of the fundamental rights of the child but are severely damaging to their mental health. As the media reported, one child said when her mother was finally released, “I felt lonely and sad because all I have is my mother. I have never lived without her for a single day. So I was terrified.”

The most damaging kind of trauma is that which results in “toxic stress”, a term used to describe a child’s experience of persistent adversity or abuse. Persistence, with no hope of escaping the threatening situation, is the hallmark of toxic stress. Perhaps the most vicious example is unfolding in Kashmir where, after two decades of living in a context suffused with the fear of violence from one side or the other, children have been subjected to six months of a lockdown, losing their fundamental rights of freedom to learn, play and be carefree. Worse, they must witness, silently, the mounting rage and helplessness that dominates the emotional landscape of their parents and their community, compounding their own feelings of insecurity, hopelessness and alienation. There are now many reports of the mental health crisis engulfing young people in the Valley.

The events in Kashmir and Karnataka are not an aberration. Consider the harrowing accounts of the experiences of children in a shelter home in Muzaffarpur, Bihar, where young girls were kept locked up for most of the day and where they were raped, after being sedated, at night. Investigators observed many signs of mental health problems, for example remarking on how “strangely they behaved”, laughing and crying in rapid sequence, remaining silent for long periods, and appearing to be severely depressed. Many girls had self-inflicted injuries, a behaviour associated with trauma in children. Conditions in other shelter homes were not much better, with appalling stories of cruelty and torture, and several instances of suicidal behaviour and mental breakdown.

Yet another example of unspeakable violence has unfolded in the past week with dozens of young women being insulted, paraded and forced to remove their innerwear to prove they were not on their period by their principal and school staff after a used personal hygiene product was found in a garden of their school, in Bhuj, Gujarat. “There are no words to describe the humiliation that we faced,” said one of the students, as the media reported. No doubt, the overall atmosphere in such a school must have been atrociously oppressive.

Breach of trust

Among the most primal emotions which humans experience in their earliest years of life is fear. Fear is key to survival for, in leading to behaviours such as crying, it prompts a trusted adult to respond with affection, food or, most importantly, safety. But there are times when the fear can have catastrophic consequences and this is when the threat is persistent and unpredictable and, especially when, it is perpetrated by an adult who the child has been taught to trust and rely on for their protection — such as the police or the school principal or the child welfare worker or the army. It is this breach of the bulwark of trust which is the most poisonous toxin for the mind, and it is this feature which binds all these forms of trauma together.

When the Donald Trump administration in the United States implemented its policy to reduce illegal immigration by separating children from their parents at the U.S. border with Mexico, there were harrowing consequences on the mental health of the children. A report, published by the U.S. government’s own inspectors, confirmed that separation of children from their parents had caused grievous psychological harm and laid the foundations for lasting and profound mental health problems in later life. Virtually every major American professional society concerned with mental health, public health or children’s health condemned the government’s actions as an assault on children’s rights and well-being. While there has been a deathly silence from most professional groups in India in response to the gratuitous levels of violence being perpetrated against our children by the state, a few courageous institutions stand out for doing their job. In the past week, a panel of the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights concluded that “it is clear that the police violated the rights of the children at the [Bidar] school”.

Let me emphasise that my concerns about traumatising children have nothing to do with taking sides with a particular brand of politics or ideology, but simply about upholding the foundations of science, the law, ethics and, ultimately, our humanity. I have little doubt that the children of Shaheen Urdu Medium Primary School, the Muzaffarpur shelter home, the Shri Sahjanand Girls’ Institute and all over Kashmir, cry to see their beloved country descend into such madness that it has lost its moral compass. To be sure, I weep with them too.

407,2020/02/18,In national interest?,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertion on Sunday that his government stands by its decision to dilute Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and to introduce the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is a product of high-handedness, prompted by the brutal majority enjoyed by his party in Parliament (Front page, “Will stand by decision on Art. 370, CAA: Modi,” Feb. 17). His justification, that these decisions were “in national interest and necessary”, does not hold water, given that there are umpteen number of matters of national interest to be addressed on priority, like improving the economy; job creation; resurrecting ailing PSUs, etc. Also, why should a government that can invite Members of European Parliament to visit J&K, in order to get a ‘normalcy’ certificate, refuse to heed to the resolutions passed in international bodies?

A. Jainulabdeen,

Theni, Tamil Nadu

The assertion of the Prime Minister that the government will stand by its decision on Article 370 and the CAA despite international pressure shows only shows the government’s autocratic approach. He further stated that these measures were taken in national interest. Is keeping the people of Kashmir even without basic facilities of communication and freedom of speech and keeping the local leaders behind the bars, in national interest? The ‘normalcy’ claimed by the government is only illusory. Other countries, and the European Union, have already expressed their anguish and concerns about the situation. The UN Secretary General also expressed his concerns. In such a scenario, it does not speak well for the government to discard those comments, simply saying that Kashmir is an internal matter. Let it be an internal matter; but the worry is the democracy is at peril there. The government has a responsibility to look after the welfare of the Kashmir people and not to run military raj indefinitely. As for the CAA, it is sad that countrywide protests have not had any impact on the Prime Minister, perhaps emboldened by the parliamentary majority he enjoys. Many non-BJP State governments have passed resolutions against the CAA in Assemblies. Does the Central government think that it can implement the CAA without the cooperation of the people and the non-BJP State governments?

409,2020/02/18,Fighting an epidemic,"Reports of a drop in new coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in China followed by those of a surge in them within a span of a few days are all that we get when we need real information about the situation. It appears to be due to China’s ‘managed transparency’. Then, China deserves credit too for making available samples of the pathogen for scientists for launching clinical trials on potential vaccines and drugs. In the context of the spread, scale and severity of the disease in China and globally, the WHO has warned countries against laxity in taking preventive measures. It is premature to say that the worst of the outbreak is over. As of now, the global community cannot claim to have contained the circulating virus.

The face-masks — the visible symbol of the epidemic — the 14-day quarantine of infected persons and persons who might have been infected, the incubation period of 10-14 days, and the lockdown of residential areas instil a certain fear among people of all nations. The limited public activities, reluctance to use public transport and fear of the crowd are an ineluctable fallout of the outbreak in affected areas. The infection proves to be fatal in roughly around 2%; it means 98% of the infected persons recover. In the absence of vaccines and drugs, prayers are held across the world for divine intervention, but sceptics are not quite of their efficacy.

Epidemics like COVID-19 make us acutely conscious of our fragility and vulnerability. It is instructive to see how people respond to the outbreak. Health workers exposed to infection work at great risk to their health and lives. The Chinese whistleblower doctor lost his life to the killer virus. In contrast, the epidemic has engendered a lot of hostility towards the Chinese, people with Chinese-like features and returnees from China as they are perceived to be potential infectors. Clearly, an emergency or a crisis brings out the best and the worst built into us by evolution. Collective and concerted action tempered with courage and compassion is now needed to grapple with the deadly and dreadful virus.

412,2020/02/18,People’s CM,"Arvind Kejriwal’s political career bears testimony to the under-appreciated fact that adherence to a vision for people-centric governance can surmount a political power’s corruptive influence (Editorial, “Delhi at the Centre,” Feb. 17). His transformation from an abrasive, pugnacious politician who revelled in flaunting his chutzpah in combative and politically incorrect ways, into a mellowed and consensus-seeking leader who has his ears firmly planted to the ground has been remarkable. It took some time for him to cultivate the sobriety and sagacity to realise the distractedness and counterproductiveness of fighting unequal battles with the formidable Central government. But once he disembarked from the bandwagon of street-fighting, there has been no going back on the journey to consolidate power by focusing on the mundane livelihood issues that impacted the daily lives of the hoi polloi. He turned his limited powers from a handicap into a blessing as a narrow band of governance offered unlimited opportunities to innovate in areas like health, education, water supply, public transport, etc.

It remains to be seen how the Delhi Chief Minister navigates the brute legislative majority’s twin seductions of invincibility and complacency. It seems prudent to check the ambition to expand the AAP’s footprints as a regional party can only survive and flourish in its circle of competence and influence.

V.N. Mukundarajan,

Thiruvananthapuram

Arvind Kejriwal, who has taken over the reins of office as Delhi Chief Minister for the third time, has obviously decided to bury the hatchet as far as his confrontation with the Centre is concerned and his extending an invitation to PM Modi to attend his swearing in signified that he has decided to let bygones be bygones. (“Kejriwal extends olive branch to Centre after taking oath for third term,” Feb. 17 ). It might not be time yet for Mr. Kejriwal to join the ranks of senior politicians but the AAP leader has proved beyond any measure of doubt that he is keen to adopt a pragmatic approach and get on the same page as the Central government in the interests of the people of Delhi. As a matter of fact, during his second tenure as Chief Minister, Mr. Kejriwal had mellowed down quite a bit and had brokered peace with the Lt. Governors who had been a thorn in his flesh. This had enabled him to concentrate on governance and work towards the development of the National Capital Region and also to secure a better deal for all Delhi-ites. The tremendous amount of goodwill that he had managed to gain has been instrumental in his sweeping the polls in 2020 though the BJP used every trick in the book to bring him to heel.

C.V. Aravind,

Bengaluru

The idea of inviting 50 “nirmatas of Delhi” as special guests to the swearing ceremony is quite novel and characterises the political and working style of Arvind Kejriwal, the down to earth Chief Minister. His unique politics of “work and performance” has stolen the hearts of Delhi-ites and put him back at the helm to continue his engagement with people’s developmental, welfare and civic issues and find solutions. While the AAP government has been successful to a large extent on education, power and water fronts, the issues of housing, transportation and pollution continues to be formidable. Given the political antagonism and ideological differences, there may not be much of a change in the Centre’s approach towards the Delhi State government. During AAP 2.0, more than half the time was spent bickering with Lieutenant Governor, until the Supreme Court came to its rescue by delineating the respective powers. Mr. Kejriwal should now completely eschew confrontationist attitude and concentrate on solving people’s issues such as pollution, housing, etc., even while continuing the good work on other areas of development and welfare, more efficiently within the given limitations of resources and powers.

414,2020/02/18,"DYFI activists in Navi Mumbai detained, later released","They were staging anti-CAA, NCR protest for third day

Around 400 activists from Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), were arrested and then released on personal bonds at various places by Navi Mumbai police on Tuesday. On the third day of their protest, they were initially detained inside a library in Belapur.

Tuesday was the third day of the DYFI protest over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) along with issues of unemployment and privatisation of PSUs and education.

The activists, who had received shelter at the BTR Memorial Library in Agroli village in Belapur, on Monday night, woke up to barricades and police presence.

“From the day we started the protest on Sunday, we have been facing police repression. On Sunday, it was at Uran, Monday at Wahal and now here. At the end we successfully finish our day’s march, this too we shall overcome,” said Preethy Sekhar, DYFI State secretary and all-India joint secretary.

Ms. Sekhar said that the ruling combine of the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress were solely responsible for this ‘repression’. “Walking to Chaitya Bhoomi holding our national flag is not a crime. They say we do not have permission, we ask then why are they not giving the same as they are the authorities responsible to give it,” she said.

“We had been telling them for three days that they are free to protest anywhere. But we can’t allow them to march on road and create traffic issues. They said they want to reach Dadar, we asked them to take a bus or a car to the place and continue with the protest. We have put them into around 10 police stations in Navi Mumbai,” Navi Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Kumar said. “They were arrested under section 135 of Bombay police Act for defying the orders. The section is bailable and they will be released on personal bond,” he said.

By night, activists were being released on personal bonds and released at different locations. “Around 44 of us were arrested at Taloja police station and after signing the personal bond, we were taken to Thane Railway Station and released. Some from other police stations were released at Panvel railway station. All have been released at various places but most of us are have our belongings at the library in Belapur so we will have to go back. The march is not called off yet,” Dynaneshwar Mote, DYFI State Secretariat said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rdruhf/article30855497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19BMDYFI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dyfi-activists-detained-in-navi-mumbai-on-third-day-of-protest-against-caa-nrc/article30850709.ece
415,2020/02/18,Policewoman’s daughter writes to CM seeking help to locate mother’s body,"Suchi fears police might harm her father, flays Fadnavis for not meeting them

The daughter of slain assistant police inspector Ashwini Bidre has written to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackrey requesting him to help find her mother’s body.

In a letter dated February 10, Siddhi Gore, also called Suchi at home, has begun with wishing Mr. Thackrey for Shiv Jayanti. She speaks about the hard times she has been facing at home since she was six.

Suchi, who is now 10-and-a-half years old, highlights how her father, Raju Gore, has been frequently travelling to Mumbai for hearings in the case. She says a police officer killed her mother and now she is afraid that the police might harm her father too.

The letter criticises former CM Devendra Fadnavis who had kept the father-daughter duo waiting for a whole day at Mantralaya promising to meet them, but did not grant them an audience. She further says her father has been wanting to meet Mr. Thackrey but then she recollects her experience with Mr. Fadnavis, and she feels afraid.

She speaks of Assistant Commissioner of Police Sangeeta Alphonso who managed to nab the culprits but could not carry out enough search operations to locate the body due to lack of funds.

“She had written the letter herself without informing us. Suchi is in Class V and is very active in co-curricular activities in school. She has been hearing all the discussions in the house since day one and also accompanies me sometimes to Mumbai from Kolhapur,” Mr. Gore said.

Mr. Gore also said his daughter knew he had been wanting to meet Mr. Thackrey and since it was not happening, she gave it a try with the letter requesting the CM to meet him. “She photocopied the letter at school, despatched it by speed post, and then told us about it.”

He also said as per media reports, the weapons used in the Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare, M.M. Kalburgi, and Gauri Lankesh cases were dumped in Vashi creek and the CBI was taking the help of U.S.-based technology to find them. “I would like to request the CM if the same technology could be used to find my wife’s body as well.”

Bidre was posted with the protection of civil rights unit in Konkan Bhavan, Belapur, and was a resident of Roadpali in Kalamboli. She went missing on April 15, 2016, and a missing person’s case was registered on July 14, following a complaint by her brother Anand Bidre.

On January 31, 2017, a kidnapping case was registered after which the key suspect, police inspector Abhay Kurundkar, who was attached to the Thane Rural police, was arrested on December 7.

After it was revealed in the investigations that the missing policewoman was murdered, sections of murder were invoked on February 27, 2018.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qn4yym/article30846935.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BM-Bidre-daughter,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/policewomans-daughter-writes-to-cm-seeking-help-to-locate-mothers-body/article30846934.ece
416,2020/02/18,Students from north-east subjected to racial slurs: TISS forum,"Students of from north-eastern States at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) have said they have been at the receiving end of racial discrimination over the past few days due to the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2, also called coronavirus.

The Northeast Students’ Forum has issued a statement highlighting the rise in the number of such cases and called for the TISS administration and government bodies to take necessary measures to keep it in check. They highlighted a recent case of a student from Nagaland and her friend being subjected to outright racial discrimination at Maitri Park in Chembur on February 10.

“Not only was a video of the visiting friend filmed without consent and circulated through social media by neighbouring people to raise an alarm about a potential carrier of coronavirus from China, but when confronted for this blatant misinformation and breach of privacy the student also met with other forms of slurs and threatening behaviour,” the statement said. Prof. Asha Banu, dean, Student Affairs at TISS, said they initiated the process for the student to be accommodated on campus on an emergency basis but stated that the issue was a larger one and society as a whole needed to be sensitised.

The statement added that several other students from the north-east have been subjected to name-calling such as “Corona” and “Coronavirus” at various public places. “We would like to bring this matter to the notice of concerned authorities to adopt adequate measures to ensure safety of students who are vulnerable to racial discrimination,” it said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/students-from-north-east-subjected-to-racial-slurs-tiss-forum/article30846927.ece
417,2020/02/18,Jolt to BJP as four NMMC corporators resign ahead of civic polls,"Ahead of the elections to the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) in April, four corporators from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) resigned from the party on Monday.

The prominent among them was Suresh Kulkarni, three-time standing committee chairman, and a staunch loyalist of BJP leader Ganesh Naik. Mr. Kulkarni, who had shifted to the BJP from the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) along with Mr. Naik, had given hints on quitting the party last week when he invited top Shiv Sena leaders to a programme which Mr. Naik was not part of.

The other three are Mr. Kulkarni’s wife Radha, Sangeeta Waske, and Mudrika Gavali. The four corporators from Turbhe submitted their resignations to NMMC Commissioner Annasaheb Misal and municipal secretary Chitra Baviskar. They had also met Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray last week.

“I want to stay close to the people of my ward who don’t want me to stay with the BJP. Majority of population are Muslims and Dalits and they want me but not the BJP, hence I chose to resign,” Mr. Kulkarni said, adding that he has not yet decided which party he will join.

The NCP had 52 members in the House and the support of 5 Independents, while the BJP had just 6 members. But before the last Assembly elections, Mr. Naik along with 55 NCP and Independent corporators joined the BJP. Two NCP corporators, Ashok Gawde and his daughter Sapna Gawde, stayed back in the party. Following this, the BJP took control of the NMMC.

“He resigned after Thane Guardian Minister Eknath Shinde had helped him get some of his works done,” Leader of Opposition from the Shiv Sena, Vijay Chaughule, said, hinting that Mr. Kulkarni is likely to join the Sena.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jolt-to-bjp-as-four-nmmc-corporators-resign-ahead-of-civic-polls/article30846918.ece
418,2020/02/18,‘Sexual harassment doesn’t just include physical contact’,"Police personnel, lawyers discuss prevention of crimes against women and children at seminar

Police officials and legal experts came together to discuss various aspects of crimes against women and children and measures that can be taken to prevent or address them, at Adani Electricity Management Institute (AEMI) last week.

The event was attended by Deputy Commissioner of Police (Enforcement) Rajendra Dabhade, assistant police inspector Surekha Dighe from the Crime Banch’s Crimes Against Women Cell, advocate Rajiv Shah and Mumbai District Legal Services secretary Vikram Singh Bhandari.

Ms. Dighe spoke about steps that parents and school administration can take to ensure security of children.

Referring to the Mumbai Police’s ‘Police Didi’ initiative, Ms. Dighe said, “Police Didi goes to various schools and tells children about good and bad touch. It is observed that the culprit in most child abuse cases is a person known to the victim. It can be a family member or a close friend.”

She said officers from the force visit private and public schools and teach minute details that can help one identify a person with wrong intentions. “We have even conducted workshops for principals and teachers.”

Mr. Dabhade said the Crime Branch and the special juvenile protection unit are working hard for the safety of public and registration of offences is increasing since people are aware.

The seminar, organised by Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited, also saw Mr. Shah explain the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act and its ambit.

“Sexual harassment doesn’t just include physical contact. Just staring at you, following you, implied or explicit promise of special treatment, threat of detrimental treatment, threat about present and future employment, interference with work or creating intimidating and hostile work environment are also considered an offence,” he said.

The advocate also said victims of sexual harassment at the workplace should always register complaints. “Tolerating work harassment is waiving off your constitutional rights,” he said.

Mr. Bhandari spoke about the need to build an environment that frightens the culprit and allows the survivor to walk with pride. He also touched upon the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

“Both girls and boys are victims of sexual abuse in India. The POCSO Act has provided protection to these children irrespective of their gender. Under the ‘Manodhairya Scheme’, we provide financial assistance to the families of the child who has undergone such assault. Any person having the knowledge of such an assault can report it in any police station. If a person knowingly hides such information, they can also be punished under the POCSO Act,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gnzlh7/article30846881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18bm-Adani-Electricity-Event1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/sexual-harassment-doesnt-just-include-physical-contact/article30846882.ece
419,2020/02/18,Relax time limit for serving liquor: AHAR to State,"Hotel association writes to ministry, says time extension will make Mumbai 24x7 a success

The Indian Hotel and Restaurants Association (AHAR) has written to the Ministry of Labour and Excise to allow the time limit for serving alcohol to be extended to 3.30 a.m. from 1.30 a.m. AHAR believes the Mumbai 24x7 project will not be successful unless the time limit is extended as it will not be affordable for restaurants.

Last month, the State government pushed through with the Mumbai 24x7 project which allows restaurants and malls in select commercial to function all night. The move met with a tepid response from Mumbaikars but officials are hopeful that as the word spreads, it will catch up. Meanwhile, AHAR president Shivanand Shetty met Minister for Labour and Excise Dilip Walse-Patil and the Excise Commissioner last week to submit the association’s demands.

AHAR has sought a review of the Bombay Prohibition Act and Bombay Foreign Liquor rules and also that the 5% value added tax (VAT) on liquor served in restaurants be scrapped on the ground that it is an additional financial burden. Also, a price hike forces people to go to illegaly-run places or drink secretly in public, leading to a law and order problem.

Other demands include abolition of the permit system for personal consumption, no hike in licence fee, bringing down the age of drinking from 25 to 21 for all forms of alcohol, and having only two to three dry days in a year.

The letter from AHAR reads, “We as legitimate licence holders should be allowed to keep our licence working up to 3.30 a.m. or else, illegal drinking habits will start mushrooming around the food trucks, resulting in loss of revenue for the State.”

Explaining the rationale behind these demands, Mr. Shetty said, “Wine shops do not have VAT but restaurants having FL-III licences do, and so people prefer buying alcohol from wine shops. That is why we want it to be scrapped.” FL-III is a permit room licence or a licence for alcohol sale at a hotel, on which excise duty has been paid at special rates.

On reducing the legal drinking age, Mr. Shetty said, “The legal age for voting is 18, and for marriage it is 21. It is not like people are waiting to turn 25. College students also drink these days. So Maharashtra should allow all alcohol by the age of 21.” AHAR is in its 41st year and has around 8,000 members in Mumbai.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/relax-time-limit-for-serving-liquor-ahar-to-state/article30846872.ece
420,2020/02/18,Fire at GST Bhavan damages documents; inquiry ordered,"No casualty reported; structural audit of govt.-owned building to be carried out

Several important documents, including those belonging to audit section of the Department of Goods and Services Tax and files related to the appellate authority — which handles disputes on recovery and payments — were damaged in a fire at GST Bhavan in Mazgaon on Monday. Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has ordered an inquiry into the incident. No casualty was reported.

The fire broke out on the ninth floor of GST Bhavan at Maharana Pratap Chowk around 12.35 p.m. The blaze was declared level 4 (major) by 1.14 p.m. and 16 fire engines, two turntable ladders, and nine jumbo tankers were deployed. Fire brigade officials said the flames spread to the eighth and part of the 10th floor. The fire was brought under control by 3.30 p.m., but its cause is yet to be ascertained.

Renovation work was being carried out in the government-owned building. Most employees used the staircase to run out to safety. “People on the ninth floor were evacuated by firefighters and PWD officials. The staircase was clear and therefore, people on the upper floors could climb down as the electricity was cut off,” Satish Shinde, a peon at GST Bhavan, said.

Chief Fire Officer Prabhat Rahangdale said the fire flared up because of papers, wooden furniture, and construction materials lying on upper floors. “As soon as the fire broke out, the in-house firemen started evacuating people. By the time, the fire engines had reached the spot, and all the people were evacuated. There was no report of anyone trapped. Around 120 firemen were deployed and no injuries or casualties were reported,” Mr. Rahangdale said.

The building’s firefighting system was not fully functional but the fire hydrants were in working condition. The hydrants and the underground water tank were also used in dousing the fire, Mr. Rahangdale said, adding a structural audit would be done in the building.

Officials said the ninth floor had the office of the additional commissioner of GST but it was in the process of being shifted to the seventh floor.

Meanwhile, Mr. Pawar, who was at YB Chavan Centre at the time, rushed to the spot. He told media persons that after the fire in Mantralaya, instructions were issued (related to fire safety). “Even then, this happened. Some say a short circuit in an air-conditioner led to the blaze. The road was shut for traffic to allow the fire engines to reach on time. We will have to conduct an inquiry into the cause and to find out which papers were burnt.”

Mr. Pawar also said that around 3,500 people work there, and first thing he asked was if anyone was missing but there were none. “The wood and papers lying there led to the fire flaring up. I have been told nothing very important was there on the ninth floor.”

When asked if a fire audit would be carried out, he replied in the affirmative. Soon after, the government ordered a probe.

Officials said the fire had resulted in the loss of important documents. While these documents would be recreated since they have been digitised to be safely restored on an external server, the procedures in some disputed matters where the ruling is pending could be delayed. The government response to the audit points raised by external agencies would also be delayed. The State is however not expecting any impact of the fire damage on the coming budget.

“We will probe what led to the fire but at the same time check if permissions for renovations were in place or not. A report on the loss of the documentation will be arrived in the next 48 hours,” additional chief secretary (finance), Manoj Sunik, told The Hindu.

Police inspector Pradeep More said, “The cooling work was being carried out till late in the evening. No evidence of sabotage has been found till now as earlier a fire had broken out on the sixth floor of the same building. We will look into the losses suffered by the department and further investigations will be carried out later.”

The national flag saviour

Amid the chaos and evacuation, Kunal Jadhav, a peon at GST Bhavan, ran to the terrace to pull down the Tricolor, to prevent it from burning.

“I was clearing the parking area as the fire vehicles, which were on their way, would need space. After someone mentioned about it, I saw that the wind was forcing the flames to blow towards the flag. I thought that it was my duty to prevent any damage to the national flag and therefore I climbed onto the terrace from a different side and pulled it down,” Mr. Jadhav said.

421,2020/02/18,DYFI activists detained again,"Protesters say they will continue march till Wednesday

Activists of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) were detained again on Monday, the second day of their protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

“On the second consecutive day of our protest, we were detained, and again, we had the same thing to say: either arrest us officially or allow us to protest. We told them, even if we are not granted permission, we will continue with our protest wherever we are,” DYFI State Secretary Dnynaneshwar Mote said.

The protest march against CAA, NPR and NRC, along with various other issues, began in Uran on Sunday. On Sunday, close to 500 activists who were detained were allowed to go by evening, following which they continued with their protest till Wahal, as per plan. On Monday, when the march began at Wahal, NRI police detained around 1,000 activists and took them to the Navi Mumbai police headquarters in Kalamboli. “We were detained in one hall in the headquarters. Police announced we were not arrested and were just detained for a few hours,” Mr. Mote said.

“We tried to convince them that they are free to protest till Dadar as per their plan, but use a vehicle and travel by road. We asked them not to march on foot as it could cause traffic issues and someone could even pelt stones at them. But they seemed to be adamant. Hence, we let them march with police bandobast,” a police officer said.

“We are voicing our anguish against the privatisation of education and public sector undertakings, and against unemployment. Some youths from Nashik have joined us to voice concerns regarding the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Every day, there are more members in the protest. Our target is to reach Dadar Chaitya Bhoomi by Wednesday and we will accomplish it,” said Prasad Subramanium, media spokesperson for DYFI.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dyfi-activists-detained-again/article30846858.ece
422,2020/02/18,‘Mountaineering is a battle against nature’,"Veterans discuss civilian, military perspectives of the sport

Soldier and veteran mountaineer Colonel Ranveer Jamwal on Monday said while those on the sidelines like to refer to mountaineering expeditions as ‘conquests’ for lack of a better word, he would describe them as battles for survival against nature itself.

Col. Jamwal and Umesh Zirpe, an avid mountaineer, were addressing media at the Mumbai Press Club on Monday to discuss the civilian and military perspectives of mountaineering.

Col. Jamwal said most deaths during mountaineering expeditions occur due to human error. “Knowledge of basic survival skills comes with experience. One can not become a mountaineer just by undergoing a crash course offered by commercial companies. For example, one needs to be anchored firmly to the ground when at the peak of a mountain. There are high chances of people slipping off once they reach the peak. I have seen it happen. I have my military training and passion to thank for my success,” he said.

Speaking about the feasibility of retrieving the bodies of mountaineers who lost their lives during expeditions, Col. Jamwal said, “Statistically there are more than 50 bodies still on the Everest, but practically speaking it is all economics that works out there. Recovering a body will cost ₹10-₹15 lakh, as it takes three to four Sherpas, who each charges ₹3-4 lakh. Also, there are no volunteers to bring the bodies downhill.”

He also referred to the difference in approach of various cultures when it comes to mountaineers who die on expeditions. “In India, the State governments help get a body down but in many foreign countries, they believe that if a passionate mountaineer loses his life there, his body belongs to the mountains,” Col. Jamwal said.

Mr. Zirpe, a tax consultant, led India’s largest civilian expedition to Mt. Everest last year. He said mountaineering is a way of life and one can start it at any age and stage of life, if they have the passion for it.

Mr. Zirpe spoke about the criteria one has to fulfil before being eligible to scale a mountain, “There is not much competition in mountaineering as compared to other adventure sports. It is better to try climbing onto high altitudes after the age of 10 because it takes awhile to get your body adapted to higher altitudes.”

Col. Jamwal, however, spoke against the commercialisation of mountaineering and said one has to have patience and go through rigorous training in order to finally be able to trek to high altitudes and scale mountains like Everest.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/duz77i/article30846849.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18bmEverest-mountaineers,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mountaineering-is-a-battle-against-nature/article30846850.ece
423,2020/02/18,"Toy retailers protest duty hike, to meet Piyush Goyal","‘Steep hike will not increase revenue, but affect the employment and progress of children in India’

Retailers of toys are planning to meet Union Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal to highlight their plight and seek a review of the hike in import duty on toys from 20% to 60% .

Addressing a press conference on Monday Farooq Shabdi, president, United Toys Association said, “The toy industry in India is on the verge of dying. Because of the duty rise, the prices of the products will go up by 100% and no one will be buying from us. Our business is going to suffer.”

The retailers under the banner of United Toys Association said that the duty hike will result in rise in prices by up to 100% in the maximum retail price (MRP) of the existing range of imported toys in India.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the Union Budget, had announced a rise in the import duty on toys from 20% to 60%. This has been opposed by importers and local traders. Clarifying that they were not against the Make in India initiative of the government, Mr. Shabdi said that Indian manufacturers are not yet well-equipped to compete with imported toys.

“About 85% of the annual toys requirement of India is met by imported toys and 70% of the import is from China,” he said adding that China was part of a global market which makes it easier for them to recover the capital investment made on moulds and other technologically advanced machineries by making their products available on a global platform.

“India, on the other hand, has a local market for these products and it will take much longer to overcome the expenditure and earn profits,” he said.

Gulshan Asija, spokesperson of the association, said the government brought about these changes with good intention, but it did not consider all aspects of the story. “Only a few manufacturers’ suggestions were taken, and importers and traders did not get proper representation in the discussion,” he said.

Mr. Shabdi explained that the duty hike will not lead to rise in government revenue, but will affect the employment and progress of children in India. “It is estimated that within three to four months, the existing stock of imported toys will dry up,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/51sebl/article30846842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BMTOYS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/toy-retailers-protest-duty-hike-to-meet-piyush-goyal/article30846843.ece
424,2020/02/18,"Tug driver hits loader, DGCA begins probe","The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is probing a ground incident where an electric vehicle pull baggage trolley vehicle hit the engine cowling of a SpiceJet aircraft and knocked down a loader at Mumbai airport on Sunday night.

The flight, SG-6439, to be operated on the Mumbai-Goa sector at 9.20 p.m. was being loaded with passenger baggage when the incident occurred around 8.15 p.m..

“There were no passengers or crew on board. A driver breath-analyser test was carried out and it was found to be negative. While the cargo loading was in progress, a tug after unloading the cargo hit a bulk freight loader or BFL. The BFL eventually impacted the engine number 2 cowl, causing damage. The tug driver was reversing his vehicle,” a DGCA official said.

In a statement, a SpiceJet spokesperson said, on February 16, a SpiceJet Boeing 737 aircraft had a ground incident of “engine number 2 cowl damage” by a tug driver, when he inadvertently accelerated the cargo tug (electric vehicle pull baggage trolley vehicle) hitting BFL and eventually the cowling. “There was no passenger or crew on board. A loader suffered a minor injury on his leg and was provided medical assistance. He is stable,” the statement said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/56m3vb/article30846855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18bmSpiceJet,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tug-driver-hits-loader-dgca-begins-probe/article30846831.ece
425,2020/02/18,Thane GRP arrest four for operating fatka racket,"Two of them stole phones at Vitawa, police recover five mobiles

The Thane Government Railway Police (GRP) arrested four people on Monday for allegedly running a fatka racket in Thane and are believed to be involved in five incidents in January this year. Of the four who were arrested Hussain Shah (24) and Danish Sheikh (25) stole mobile phones from train commuters by slapping and distracting them, while Bilal Khan (25) and Mohammad Sayyed (32) sold them, the police said.

“Shah and Sheikh had a previous record of committing fatka crimes in the region. We checked our records and located their current whereabouts,” said Smita Dhakne, senior police inspector, Thane GRP station. They have been charged under Section 382 of the Indian Penal Code, which pertains to committing theft by acts that may have resulted in death. Ms. Dhakne said the two are under police custody and being interrogated.

Police officials said Mr. Shah and Mr. Sheikh used to commit the crime at Vitawa, which lies between Thane and Kalwa stations.

Though the police suspected their involvement for some time their current whereabouts were not known.

Traced to Kashimira

Mr. Shah was traced to Kashimira in Mira Road. Upon sustained interrogation, he confessed to the crime and led the police to Mr. Sheikh. The duo had stolen five mobile phones from their fatka operations worth ₹56,700. Police officials said it wasn’t the value of the phone but the increase in the frequency of the thefts around mid-January which caught their attention.

The two sold the five phones to Mr. Khan, who lived in their area, who in turn sold them to Mr. Sayyed, a resident of Andheri. “We managed to get back the five phones. Khan and Sayyed have also been arrested for selling stolen mobile phones under Section 411 of the IPC,” a GRP official said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/k8rp4b/article30846826.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BM-GRP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/thane-grp-arrest-four-for-operating-fatka-racket/article30846827.ece
426,2020/02/18,History-sheeter held from Delhi for 2019 murder of guard in Powai,"Native of U.P. has two other murder cases against him; killed victim over Ludo

Three months after a security guard of a Powai building was found murdered, the police on Sunday arrested his former colleague, who has been on the run since the offence came to light. The police said this is the third murder case against Avinash Pandey (38), with the first two being registered in Uttar Pradesh, from where he hails..

According to the Powai police, the victim, Ankit Singh (22) and Mr. Pandey were employed together as security guards at Lodha Supreme on Saki Vihar Road in Powai. Singh was found with his throat slit in the parking lot of the building on October 27 morning and Mr. Pandey, who was on the same shift, was since missing.

“We made inquiries into Pandey’s background and found out that the Aadhaar card he had submitted as ID proof to his employer had been obtained using fake information, which further pointed the needle of suspicion towards him. We formed several teams and sent them to various locations, including his native place in U.P., ” Assistant Commissioner of Police Milind Khetle, Saki Naka division said.

Through several visits over the last three months, the investigating team got a sense of his movements from people known to him. Officers said the investigation was challenging as Mr. Pandey never stayed in one location for more than a couple of weeks. He also frequently changed SIM cards and cell phones. The police developed informants in U.P. and circulated his pictures among security agencies in various cities in U.P., in case he tried to take up a new job.

On February 15, the police got a tip off that Mr. Pandey had come to Delhi and sent a team to verify the information. The team picked up Mr. Pandey from near Kamla Market in Delhi on Sunday evening, and brought him to Mumbai. He was later arrested and remanded in police custody till February 21.

“Pandey and Singh used to play online Ludo on the night shift and bet money. But they would get into frequent arguments when it came to paying up. One such argument happened on the night of October 26, during which Pandey murdered Singh. He fled the city immediately,” Mr. Khetle said.

Investigations revealed that Mr. Pandey was charged with murder in U.P in the year 2000 over a personal dispute. He also allegedly murdered his cousin in U.P. in 2008 over a property dispute and is still wanted for it.

“Pandey also spent some time in Mumbai between 2000 and 2008, and we are finding out if he committed any crime during that time,” Mr. Khetle said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/te2xwv/article30846821.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BM-Ankit-Singh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/history-sheeter-held-from-delhi-for-2019-murder-of-guard-in-powai/article30846823.ece
427,2020/02/18,Mumbai sweats it out at 38.1 degrees,"City sees warmest Feb. day since 2017; Tuesday will be warm too

Mumbaikars began the work week in sweltering conditions, with the city recording its warmest February day in three years. The maximum temperature on Monday, at 38.1 degrees Celsius, was seven degrees above normal and a huge rise from Sunday’s 32.6 degrees. Mumbaikars can expect similar weather on Tuesday.

Mumbai had an “unusually short” winter this year, and temperatures have risen this month. February 13 was the warmest winter’s day this year so far, with the maximum temperature at 35.7 degrees Celsius.

Monday was the warmest day of the winter season and also the warmest February day since 2017. That year, the city had reported 38.8 degrees Celsius. In 2012, the warmest February day recorded 39.1 degrees Celsius. The all-time record for highest maximum February temperature is on February 25, 1966, when it went up to 39.6 degrees Celsius.

Monday’s minimum temperature was also a degree warmer than usual, at 19.8 degrees Celsius.

K.S. Hosalikar, Deputy Director General of the India Meteorological Department said the rise in temperature was because of easterly winds. For heat wave-like conditions, more than one station should report such high temperatures, he said. However, in Mumbai, Colaba is 34 degrees Celsius and Santacruz reported a very high temperature. “You can call them heat wave-like conditions that are likely to continue on Tuesday,” he said.

February, he said, usually sees such spikes — especially after February 15, when there is a transition from winter to summer -- and temperatures can go very high or very low. “These spikes are a short occurrence; there might be some in March too.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-sweats-it-out-at-381-degrees/article30846783.ece

429,2020/02/18,KTM 390 Adventure review: When adventures await,"While the KTM 390 Adventure has the capability to go almost anywhere, it also looks to be a fantastic long-distance road bike

The KTM 390 Adventure has just made its India début. It promises to be just the sort of fast, premium and (relatively) affordable go-anywhere motorcycle the Indian market has been sorely missing. The 390 certainly looks the part and has quite some presence. In person, you will realise that the 390 ADV is a considerably large machine — it is bigger than the BMW G 310 GS in every dimension, and is taller and wider than the Royal Enfield Himalayan as well. Thankfully, it isn’t as hefty as the 199kg Himalayan, but at 177kg kerb weight, it is about 8kg heavier than the BMW.

Substantial it may be, but the 390 Adventure certainly isn’t pretty. Just like KTM’s big ADV family, its trademark insect-like styling is instantly recognisable — but it is not for everyone. There are a few interesting details, though. The fuel tank plastic, for example, is infused with colour, instead of being painted, and this should help keep a cleaner look after a period of time and wear-and-tear.

As far as comfort and practicality go, this bike is miles ahead of anything else KTM offers in India. The 14.5-litre fuel tank is the largest on any India-made KTM to date, and you should easily get well over 300 kilometres on a full tank. A new subframe has liberated vast seating space for the rider, and there’s a decently-sized pillion seat as well.

Technology-wise, there is the now-familiar, full-LED headlamp that comes right off the 390 and 790 Duke. The TFT display is also nearly the same, but this one can display turn-by-turn navigation assists if you purchase the optional KTM MyRide Navigation App for ₹600. And then, of course, there are the headline-grabbing electronic assists. The bike gets a bi-directional quickshifter that works decently well, even if it’s not as smooth and crisp as the system in the 790 Duke. There is also a three-axis IMU that enables a cornering ABS feature, and a corner-sensitive traction control system.

Our first taste of the 390 ADV was on some rocky, gravelly trails, with a few steep climbs strewn with large boulders. First things first, the ergonomics are quite decent, in terms of the feet positioning and shape of the fuel tank, but most of us agreed that we would have liked a taller handlebar for when standing up and riding.

Switching to the faster, more open trails, the 390’s trademark raucous power delivery was great fun, especially when you cross the magic 6,000rpm mark. But just as the 390’s excellent top-end thrills in the fast stretches, its grumpy bottom end makes it a pain when climbing steep and technical trails at low speeds. There is no significant pull below 3,000rpm, and you have to slip the clutch quite a bit to get things going if you lose momentum. Shorter gearing (or at least a change in the final drive ratio) would have been nice here, but the set-up is identical to that of the 390 Duke.

In the dirt, the off-road ABS mode which deactivates the rear wheel intervention worked beautifully, but the same cannot be said for the traction control. A number of us encountered an unusual issue where the TC would randomly cut in briefly, robbing you of all power, and this was with the system fully turned off and while the engine was running.

It is on the road where the Adventure’s 1.5-degree increase in steering rake and 77mm increase in wheelbase over the 390 Duke reveal their biggest change. While we didn’t get to evaluate high-speed stability, it is clear that this bike feels nothing close to as fidgety or on-edge as the Duke. Instead, there is an enjoyable sense of stability, which comes without a major sacrifice in agility and front-end feel, despite the 19-inch front wheel.

As far as comfort goes, the riding position is commanding and simply excellent. What you should know is this is a bike that will be easier for taller riders. On the road, the 855mm seat height will be just about manageable if you’re over 5ft 6in, but things can get quite tricky off-road if you don’t have long legs to mask a lack of talent.

Performance-wise, the BS-VI engine makes the same 43hp/37Nm as the BS-IV motor in the 390 Duke, although the exhaust note sounds a bit more muffled. What is new, however, is a redesigned curved radiator with a dual-fan set-up. The intention is to improve cooling efficiency and redirect the hot air away from the rider.

The KTM 390 Adventurealso looks to be a fantastic long-distance road bike. The ₹2.99 lakh ex-showroom price is stunning when you consider how much this bike has to offer. If KTM can offer a reliable and niggle-free experience from the start, the 390 Adventure could be quite a special machine.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/7giq6h/article30852009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19bgm390KTMAdventure21jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/adventures-await/article30852018.ece
430,2020/02/18,Audi Q8 review: Soup up your drive,"With an Audi Q8, you will never have to worry about anyone having the same ride as you

Nowadays, just having a big luxury SUV doesn’t help you stand out from the crowd. Exclusivity and style matter a lot more and that is exactly what the new Audi Q8 offers. How? Being a CBU import, Audi offers a wide gamut of personalisation options both inside and out, so no two Q8s will be the same. However, being an import also means a four-month waiting period — though it will be worth the wait.

Then, you have style. The Q8’s SUV-coupé design puts it in a very niche segment, and is the SUV’s biggest draw. The sharp-looking matrix LED headlamps grab your attention first, with the massive octagonal grille adding to the drama. The nose looks stunning, with a layered look for the bumper.

Moving to the side, there are 20-inch alloys as standard, with an option of 21-inch alloy wheels (seen here), and even 22-inchers, if you really want to stand out. The tapering roofline, which is the crux of the whole design, is rather subtle, but gives the car plenty of style. The Q8 might seem compact in pictures, but in the flesh, it has got plenty of road presence. You also get sportscar-like frameless doors that look cool. At the rear, the long, swooping LED tail-lamps look futuristic, and there are plenty of neat lines and cuts, in typical Audi fashion.

Step inside and you see an interior befitting of a car that costs over ₹1 crore. The design is slick and subtle but not devoid of drama. Here, too, you have an array of customisations, with 11 upholstery options and nine inlay trims to suit your choice. The cabin quality and fit-finish are excellent, and the materials give it an air of premiumness. Audi has also loaded the Q8 with tech. Dual MMI touchscreens are on offer — the one on top for navigation, media, infotainment, and the one below essentially replacing the plethora of buttons on the centre console used to control various features like climate control, drive modes etc. The screens are responsive, and you also get haptic feedback and a click to confirm commands. However, the lower screen does require you to take your eyes off the road to use the correct function.

Seat comfort is excellent; they come with a range of adjustability — basic adjustments are via buttons on the seat, with the lower touchscreen housing functions such as seat ventilation and more. Get in the rear and you will be surprised that, despite the low-slung roofline, you get decent headroom, and there is room to stretch out as well.

There is plenty of kit on offer too, with stand-out features including HD Matrix adaptive LED headlamps, adaptive air suspension, a panoramic sunroof, a parking assistant and a 1,920W Bang & Olufsen hi-fi system. Then, there are a few options over and above this — four-zone (rather than dual-zone) climate control, a head-up display, seat heating, ventilation and massage, and rear-wheel steering, to name a few.

Powering the Q8 is a 3.0-litre turbo-petrol engine making 340hp, which is plenty for this two-tonne-plus SUV. Performance then is swift, with a 0-100kph time of just 6.07sec. The 8-speed automatic gearbox is smooth and quick, working seamlessly with the engine. However, power delivery is progressive and you don’t get a strong punch. You also get drive modes like Eco, Comfort, Dynamic and Individual to choose from; they alter the performance of the engine, gearbox, steering, and even the suspension. Yes, the Q8 also has adaptive air suspension, which, in Comfort mode, offers a pliant and comfy ride. ‘Dynamic’ firms up the ride quite a bit. That said, even in its firmest setting, you don’t feel the jolts like you’d expect to in a big, heavy SUV with massive wheels. Expect the 20-inch wheels to deliver an even comfier ride. The steering is very light and handling is decent too, though this clearly isn’t a car to attack corners with.

Priced at ₹1.33 crore (ex-showroom, India), the Audi Q8 goes against a small group of SUV-coupés such as the Porsche Cayenne Coupé and the Mercedes-AMG GLE43 Coupé. And like the other cars in the segment, the Q8 is for those who want to make a statement. The concept-car looks, extensive features and luxury, all mean that it could very well be the go-to choice for the rich and famous.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/7ntoid/article30851635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19bgmaudiQ81jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/soup-up-your-ride/article30851638.ece
431,2020/02/18,T20: Mining data is as important as hitting sixes and fours,"How many world class batters do you need to win a T20 World Cup?

How many world class batters do you need to win a T20 World Cup? That’s a question Indian teams — both men and women — will be asking themselves. The women will get their answer earlier as their World Cup begins on Friday. The men will have to wait till October-November. Australia Women’s coach Matthew Mott has said that India have the most feared batting line-up in the world.

“They’ve got four world-class batters and when I say world-class I mean top of the tree guns,” Mott has been quoted as saying. Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues are in the Top 10 of the ICC rankings, while 16-year-old Shefali Verma last year became the youngest Indian to hit an international half-century, younger than even Sachin Tendulkar was. The batting has both potential and record.

Exciting line-up

It is an exciting line-up, and like many exciting line-ups, they have a tendency to swing from one extreme to the other. India are as capable of taking the game by the scruff of its neck and sauntering to a win as they are of collapsing unexpectedly and throwing it all away. Former captain Diana Eduljee has put it down to the players being “lazy”, which is both unfair and nasty.

If all the guns fire and if collapses are averted, this team has the potential to make it to the final. They have beaten Australia, the favourites, but a World Cup is different, especially one in Australia.

Sensibly, coach Woorkeri Raman refuses to buy into the hype. India are one of the favourites, he concedes, and says, “Even if the top order is firing, the winning runs will be the 20-odd from the lower order,” thus exhibiting the streak of pragmatism so essential to those in charge. India recently lost a tri-series final to Australia after losing seven wickets for 29 runs; only four days earlier they had beaten the same team by seven wickets while chasing 174.

Women’s cricket should not make the mistake that the men’s did at the 1992 World Cup (50-overs) in Australia, when India’s plan was for Krishnamachari Srikkanth to scatter the bowling at the top and for the remaining batsmen to walk though the opening he had created. It didn’t work then, and such a plan is unlikely to work now. Everybody has a role in a team, and to rely on just a few is both impractical and dangerous. It is easy to say, as some have, that the top four should bat through 20 overs to put India ahead, but team sport is about shared responsibility.

That “top batters” theory was for long the men’s favourite too. Rohit Sharma, K.L. Rahul (or Shikhar Dhawan), Virat Kohli were expected to make numbers 4 to 11 redundant, but the ideal solution seldom worked in practice. With Shreyas Iyer establishing himself in the middle order, the options have increased. In T20 cricket, it is all about increasing options, batting or bowling.

The “top batters” theory hasn’t always succeeded. Royal Challengers Bangalore’s record in the IPL is a counter to such thinking. At one point, their top three batsmen were Chris Gayle, A B de Villiers and Kohli — theoretically the formula for destroying any bowling anywhere. Yet, as results showed, this was top-heavy, and didn’t quite work. There is a lesson in this for the women’s team, as well as the men’s.

Team strategy

If unpredictability is their calling card, the women can make it work as part of team strategy. Recently Ravichandran Ashwin made a profound statement about bowling in the T20 format. “I think that six well-constructed bad balls could be the way to go forward,” he said. If the bowler doesn’t know what he is going to bowl, it is unlikely that the batter is going to. That is one way of looking at it. The other is the element of surprise that might force the batter to settle for something less than the boundary she might have struck.

What teams have going for them is the enormous amount of data that is available, the interpretation of such data and the response to specific data that have succeeded in the past. T20 is as much about batting and bowling as about getting the maths right.

When Indian men won the T20 World Cup in 2007, the effect on the cricketing world was profound. The IPL was inaugurated the following year, and from T20 sceptics, India became T20 proselytisers.

If the women’s team does well in the World Cup in Australia, a logical case can be made for a women’s IPL, an idea that has been in the air for sometime now.

Both the Indian teams are ranked fourth in the world, so they have something to aim for, and a couple of things to prove.",columns,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/n0agoz/article30845569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18WOMEN,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/t20-mining-data-is-as-important-as-hitting-sixes-and-fours/article30852202.ece
432,2020/02/18,Stories that jungles tell us,"If you are planning a wildlife travel expedition, make sure to stop, stare, listen and smell the forests and their enchanted secrets, says travel operator Pravin Shanmughanandam of Papyrus Itineraries

A recent edition of National Geographic Traveller India featured Pravin Shanmughanandam of Papyrus Itineraries, Tamil Nadu, as one of India’s responsible wildlife travel operators. “We have been tour operators for around three years, in and around the Anamalais, and we have done more than 250 wildlife tours,” he says.

Pravin is quietly elated that he was featured along with deeply committed conservationists such as Rahul Alvares, herpetologist and wildlife guide; Nayantara Jain, marine biologist and diving instructor; and Asad Rahmani, Member, Wetlands International South Asia. He is also modest. “They were looking at different habitats, I think, and the Anamalai forests offer a wealth of those.”

As a wildlife travel operator, he was asked for his recommendations on places to visit and has also been invited to a panel discussion on responsible wildlife tourism conducted by National Geographic in Delhi at the end of the month. “We have made a short film about the Kadar tribe who inhabit the Anamalai forests. We hope to screen it in Delhi, and subsequently across the country.”

In the forests of the night “Kadar is a story that softly calls to you from the jungle. In the Anamalais, the Kadar tribals step gently alongside creatures that inhabit these wild slopes and there exists an unspoken bond between them.

“This is the story of Loganathan who, as a child, was taught to revere all life forms that thrived here. This has been the way of the Kadar people. Every once in a while, perhaps unintentionally, boundaries are crossed and chaos comes calling. This is the story of that night in the jungle, under a moonless sky, when a lone male tusker elephant broke down Loganathan’s door and stood right before him.

“We collaborated with Faraway Collective, a Bengaluru-based, award-winning production company that makes audible unheard stories of unheard people from all corners of India. In Kadar, we highlight the lifestyle and importance of this tribe in conserving the natural environment of the Anamalai Hills. We, at The Papyrus Itineraries, ensure that they are the key aspect of our Nature and wildlife tours. The film presents the conventional wisdom of these indigenous people who help us navigate the dense rainforests.

“The film is roughly five minutes long and it took us two days to film it. We are planning to start screening it from the first week of March for private audiences. We will screen the film in Coimbatore that often encounters man-animal conflict, and initiate and interaction and discussion on the topic, among wildlife enthusiasts and conservationists.”

What makes you a ‘responsible’ wildlife tour operator?

To begin with, we do not chase sightings or species and never promise our guests either, but establish that the purpose of our tours is to always interact with Nature and wildlife in a meaningful, respectful way. That’s why most of our tours are walking ones where one gets to imbibe the essence of the forest and interact with its inhabitants in a truly natural way. It’s a more immersive and authentic way of travelling, we believe.

Sightings apart, we make sure the guests get to be a part of the “narrative” experience, where our naturalist and a local tribesmen (who always accompanies us) help interpret the forest, its sights, sounds, smell and tell-tale signs. They also share their personal experiences in the jungle. This creates awareness among our guests and allows them (especially city dwellers) to address popular myths about the forests. Usually, even if the sightings have been disappointing, the guests have these wonderful take-aways to dwell on. Our tours aren’t for everyone; they are for those willing to stretch their legs and learn. Our tours are much more than photo-ops. That’s why we don’t cater to all but choose and profile our guests.

How do you choose your guests?

Our staff ensures there is a limited number of guests so their safety is guaranteed. This also allows us to give each guest personal attention. We strictly prohibit usage of alcohol and we don’t promise luxury during such tours but assure them of basic creature comforts. Guests are instructed to wear browns and greens, avoid bright-coloured clothes and perfumes, and asked to maintain silence and follow instructions of the naturalists/guide. So, small numbers, proper etiquette, and attire ensures that the guests respect the environment they are about to enter.

What should a tourist look for when choosing a wildlife travel operator?

Ask if the tour operator employs guides from the native area. Naturalists may hail from various parts, given it’s a higher profile, but a tour programme that involves local people is always better. One doesn’t just gain knowledge but this also helps the local people in their livelihood. Such tourism helps conserve biodiversity of that place.

Make sure how many will be part of the group you are joining. Some parks allow many vehicles to enter a safari zone. Often multiple vehicles crowd a tiger making it such an unpleasant sighting. Limited numbers is a must, even if it means revenue loss.

Don’t get taken in by “guaranteed sightings” of a particular animal. Often tour operators do that. While it is possible a sighting may happen at a specific place in a particular season, sometimes some bird-watching tour operators employ play-back calls of a particular bird to lure them out, which disturbs and alters their natural behaviour. So choose operators who have a thorough knowledge of the terrain, the species, and their behavioural aspects so they can maximise the opportunities of sighting instead of coercing them.",travel,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/ey56zu/article30850807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0L9A9633-01,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/pollachi-based-papyrus-itineraries-has-been-selected-as-one-of-indias-responsible-wildlife-travel-operators-by-national-geographic/article30850809.ece
433,2020/02/18,Kiran Bedi criticises Puducherry Chief Minister on medical admissions probe,"The Lieutenant Governor on Tuesday said the investigation into the 2017 private medical college admissions case was on, and that a probe would reveal a nexus of many officials

Hitting back at Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy for not disclosing the complete picture of the probe carried out by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the 2017 medical admissions to private colleges, Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi on Tuesday said six officials of the private medical college management are facing prosecution and further investigations into the case are on.

“The investigations will now reveal the historical nexus and the modus operandi of operations. The names shall tumble (out) to the pain and embarrassment of many mighty and powerful (which can be officials too) or remain buried in CBI records,” she said in a WhatsApp message to reporters.

The Chief Minister on Monday had disclosed a communication he received from the CBI about its decision to close the probe against six senior government officials (against whom Ms. Bedi had sought a probe) for want of evidence. The Chief Minister had accused the Lt Governor of tarnishing the image of the officers by instigating the Medical Council of India to file a complaint against the officials with the CBI.

“Even if the supervising officers of the day were not being held criminally culpable the question which shall remain is, who were overseeing the colleges? If the investigating agencies did not get the clinching evidence to prosecute some, it does not take away the visible negligent roles they may have played from such supervising positions.” she said.

Ms. Bedi claimed that the Centralised Admission Committee sponsored students who were denied admission by the colleges and who finally got enrolled only because of the intervention by the Lt. Governor’s office.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/r4eck4/article30850074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18FEBTH--KIRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/kiran-bedi-criticises-puducherry-chief-minister-on-medical-admissions-probe/article30850075.ece

436,2020/02/18,"Cong. hits out at AINRC, AIADMK","Oppn. parties draw flak for stand on CAA

AICC secretary Sanjay Dutt has questioned the “silence” of principal Opposition party — the All India N.R. Congress — and “duplicity” of Puducherry unit of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam on Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Addressing a press conference here on Monday, Mr. Dutt said it was unfortunate that both the parties boycotted the recently held special session of the Assembly to adopt a resolution urging the Centre to repeal the act. The AINRC has so far failed to make public its stand on the issue.

He questioned the decision of the AIADMK to boycott the session after extending support to the Centre in getting the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill passed in Rajya Sabha. “It is a clear case of double standards,” he alleged.

Mr. Dutt said the Pradesh Congress Committee had submitted a memorandum to the President through the Lieutenant Governor’s Office seeking his intervention in protecting the reservation rights of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. Flaying the BJP government in Uttarakhand for its stand against giving reservation to SC and ST people, Mr. Dutt said, “The DNA of the BJP and the RSS is against socially deprived sections.”

To a question on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement that his government stood by its decision on Article 370 and the CAA, the AICC secretary said it again revealed the “dictatorial style” of functioning of the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.

437,2020/02/18,"Leave Puducherry, CM tells Bedi","Narayanasamy says CBI closed probe against Centac officials targeted by the L-G

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Monday asked Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi to “leave” the Union Territory at the earliest following the decision of the Central Bureau of Investigation not to proceed with the inquiry into medical admissions involving six government officials against whom Ms. Bedi sought probe.

The Chief Minister told presspersons here that the CBI wrote to the government on February 14 about its decision to close the probe against the officials who conducted the medical admissions in 2017 as it found no grounds to proceed against them.

From the day Ms. Bedi levelled allegations against the officials, the government had taken a consistent stand that the officers functioned within the rules and procedures.

The government had recommended to the Medical Council of India proper action against three private medical colleges and four Deemed Universities after they failed to admit students sponsored by the Centralised Admission Committee in 2017.

Following the instructions given by the government, the officials initiated action against the institutions, the Chief Minister said.

Officials threatened

Not listening to the government, the Lt. Governor went to the counselling centre threatened the officials. She then instigated the Medical Council of India to initiate a probe, he said.

Based on a complaint filed by MCI, the agency initiated a probe against the then Chairman of Centac Narendra Kumar, Secretary, (Health) B.R. Babu, Director of Health Department V. Raman, Centac convenor V. Govindaraj, and joint convenors K. Pazhaniradja and Janardhanan. The CBI interrogated the officials and inspected Centac office here as part of the investigation, the Chief Minister said.

“Now, the agency has closed the probe citing no wrong doings by the officials. The image of the officers was tarnished due to the style of functioning of Ms. Bedi. She is responsible for damaging the reputation of the officers,” Mr. Narayanasamy said.

‘Unbecoming of an L-G’

Maintaining that Ms. Bedi’s style of functioning was unbecoming of the constitutional position she held, the Chief Minister said “she should leave Puducherry at the earliest for the betterment of the region.”

Accusing the Lt Governor of violating rules, the Chief Minister said a panel of names were sent to Ms. Bedi for appointment as Secretary to the Lt Governor but so far she had failed to clear the names.

For the last several months, the Cabinet meeting was held without the presence of her secretary, he said and added that the absence of Lt Governor’s secretary was a clear violation of procedures.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/r4ry7f/article30845950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THPONDYCMPRESSER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/leave-puducherry-cm-tells-bedi/article30845951.ece
438,2020/02/18,Grandma goes to school: Troubled waters,"Grandma and her cousins were enjoying themselves at school. But, there seemed to be a problem.

The story so far: Grandma loved school. And, the icing on the cake was that she could swim in the river too.

Grandma’s triumph was short-lived as, very soon she sank. But, Phuli caught her at once.

“You didn’t teach me properly,” cried grandma indignantly, trying to get the water out of her eyes and ears.

“You can’t learn in a day!” said Phuli.

“You’ll do better tomorrow,” said Mini, a cousin.

“Come out of the water now! It’s late and you’ll get a terrible scolding if you delay any longer,” cried grandma’s maid. “I don’t know what your grandma will say if she knows that you’ve been swimming.”

“Don’t carry tales,” shouted the cousins.

A hitch

But, before the month was out, grandma’s grandpa had an indignant visitor.

“You must put a stop to this school nonsense!” he shouted, “Or you will be sorry.”

“Why?” asked grandma’s grandpa peering over his glasses.

“We are losing caste! No decent family will marry girls going to missionaries!”

“But they are not eating or drinking in school,” said grandma’s grandpa. “You don’t lose caste by merely listening.”

“But the carpenter and barber’s daughters are there too! Sitting with them will make our girls lose caste.”

“Nonsense! I saw the lot of them on the merry-go-round at the fair last week,” said grandma’s grandpa. “If that didn’t make them lose caste, then neither will a classroom.”

The visitor left grumbling.

In the meantime, grandma not only learnt to swim but also learnt the alphabet and numbers. Here too, Phuli beat them all as she had a great memory. Grandma loved the needlework classes and could soon crochet laces. Most of all, she loved to hear stories from the Bible the teacher told them.

Grandma’s grandma and aunts wondered if the missionary-mem was trying some underhand method of converting them. But they couldn’t help being impressed when the girls produced lovely pieces of lace.

“This time next year, we’ll learn history and geography too!” said grandma’s eldest cousin.

One day, grandma’s grandma announced that grandma’s cousin would not go to school any more as her wedding was fixed. The girl burst into tears.

“Don’t cry, silly girl,” said grandma’s grandma. “You will have other things to learn now.”

Grandma felt upset, but she cheered up at the thought of a wedding in the house.

439,2020/02/18,Not a quarter more,"What seemed like just n-i-n-e-t-y days, now seems a lot better with some activities that are definite improvement to studies.

Only a few more months of school left! Woohoo! Usually, there’s nothing but studies from Jan to March because all the fun stuff like Sport’s Day, Annual Day and the camping trip are done. It’s one long snooze fest!

I think my school realised how boring this was for everyone so this year they decided to add a whole bunch of extra things to the calendar — they’re calling it School++. The name makes it sound like we’re all going to do more school. And nobody needs that.

School++ turned out to be a whole bunch of extra sessions on things like Empathy!!! Anger management !!! Growing up !!! I’m adding the exclamation marks because the posters around school use them and it makes me laugh. Like using exclamation marks is going to get us excited about a session on Organisation Skills!!!

Pick one

Then, last week, we were told to do something called Independent Community Service and spend our time helping those less fortunate than ourselves.

Anyway, I had a week to figure out something. And even though the parents refused to help me — (“It’s called INDEPENDENT!”) they felt they could shoot down my ideas.

Dog walking

Me: I’ll walk our dog, and that helps you guys!

Parents: You’re meant to walk the dog anyway. Here. Take him now.

A books and bake sale

Me: I will sell brownies and text books and we can give the money to a charity.

Parents: You don’t know how to bake! And no, you can’t sell your text books even for a ‘good cause!’

A walkathon

Me: I’ll walk round and round the building and people can pay me money for every round I do! I’ll give the money to a charity!

Parents: First try walking to the main gate on your own! Hahahahahaha!

Anyway, they finally liked my idea for a tetra pack collection drive. I take used tetra packs and give it to a charity that upcycles them into bags! Not bad huh?

Of course my parents said I couldn’t just go and knock on 400 apartment doors, so they made me create a form, make posters and do a whole bunch of pointless things. I think they were just annoyed they couldn’t find a reason to shoot down this idea. Maybe my parents should do an empathy session.

It was actually fun going to everyone’s houses and asking them for the tetra packs! I got juice at one place, and cookies at another and got to play with a lot of puppies and cats. Of all the things I did in School++, this was my favourite.

Anyway, I now have an entire room filled with tetra packs which the PB keeps throwing at me and W the dog keeps chewing. It’s so annoying! Gaaaah! Maybe I should attend that anger management session.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/1ll7f3/article30849919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21-YT-Bug-Boy,https://www.thehindu.com/children/not-a-quarter-more/article30849921.ece
440,2020/02/18,ADB-assisted water project gets govt. nod,"Uninterrupted supply for city

The State government has given administrative approval for the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-assisted 24X7 uninterrupted water supply scheme for Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi cities.

The government has approved the outlay of ₹2,511 crore submitted by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA), the implementation agency, for the Kerala Urban Water Supply Improvement Project (KUWSIP). The ADB loan will constitute 70% — or ₹1,757.7 crore — of the total amount. The State will chip in with the remaining 30% (₹753.3 crore) as its share. Additionally, the government has asked the KWA to obtain the loan at favourable terms and conditions of repayment.

What is envisaged

The KUWSIP will be carried out in the two cities over a 10-year period.

Rehabilitation and renovation of production facilities, replacement of old and leaky water distribution pipelines and faulty meters and division of the KWA distribution network into District Metering Areas (DMA) for efficiency are among the highlights of the ADB-assisted project.

Other activities that would be undertaken as part of the initiative include equipping the network with flow meters and pressure control devices and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) technology, and survey and preparation of a GIS map of the network.

Reduced water loss

Through these activities, the KWA hopes to slash the volume of Non-Revenue Water (NRW) — water lost through leakage, theft, and misuse — from 51% in Kochi and 44% in Thiruvananthapuram to 20%.

On February 5, Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty had informed the State Assembly that his department hopes to start work on KUWSIP this year and complete it in 2029.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/adb-assisted-water-project-gets-govt-nod/article30846402.ece

The three-day National Conference of Cities for Zero Waste organised by the city Corporation concluded here on Monday with the Thiruvananthapuram Declaration, which called for a joint effort in managing waste. A collective called Cities for Zero Waste was formed at the meet, consisting of urban local bodies in different parts of the country working towards zero-waste status.

The collective will facilitate knowledge sharing on waste management techniques between these local bodies. Through the declaration, the local bodies made a commitment to reduce the waste produced and increase the amount of waste treated at source. A change in lifestyle and consumption habits by increasing awareness among the public was called for. Extended Producer Responsibility will be given top priority. Green protocol will be implemented.

Security and respect

The local bodies will ensure the participation of youths and students in waste management and environment protection activities. They will also ensure job security and respect for those involved in the collection, segregation and recycling of waste.

Support will be extended for water conservation and agricultural activities within the city and outside. The collective will meet every two years to take stock of their progress towards achieving zero-waste status and to plan for the future.

Mayor K. Sreekumar handed over the declaration to Minister for Local Self-Governments A.C. Moideen at the valedictory function. Mr. Moideen said wide-ranging awareness campaigns need to be carried out by the local bodies to ensure the participation of the public in the work towards achieving zero- waste status. He said that Kerala could be a model for this.

Corporation hailed

The achievements of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation in waste management after the closure of the Vilappilsala plant was a lesson in this aspect.

The government is aiming to declare at least half of the local bodies as zero-waste this year, he said.

Delivering the keynote address, V.K. Prasanth, MLA, said the city Corporation had managed to create a successful model in the treatment of septage waste, by introducing a licensing system for septage collectors and treating the waste at the Muttathara plant.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/eofla6/article30846350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TVTVZEROWASTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/a-new-collective-to-make-cities-waste-free/article30846351.ece

444,2020/02/18,Corporation brings out zero-waste plan,"Dumps at Erumakkuzhi, Palayam will be closed down, converted to other facilities

The city Corporation on Monday announced a zero-waste action plan with an aim to declare Thiruvananthapuram as a zero-waste city by August this year. With the local body elections only a few months away, the action plan seeks to highlight and improve upon the Corporation’s achievements in decentralised waste management.

Announcing the action plan at the valedictory function of the three-day National Conference of Cities for Zero Waste organised by the Corporation, Mayor K. Sreekumar said the plan involved ramping up the existing community waste management systems and closing down two remaining dump sites at Erumakkuzhi and Palayam.

The number of locations with aerobic bins and material recovery facilities will be increased from the current 54 to 200 and the existing bins will be repaired. In addition, 200 portable aerobic bins will be introduced. Currently, kitchen bins have been installed in 15,000 households. This will be increased to 50,000 households.

Ten more resource recovery centres will be opened. A plastic recycling unit is also proposed to be opened. Mr. Sreekumar said the smart dry waste collection centres, opened in four locations in the city, have witnessed tremendous response from the public. Such centres will be opened in 200 locations. For this purpose, aid will be sought from private entrepreneurs or institutions. The number of dry leaf collection boxes will also be increased to 100. These activities are scheduled to be completed by July.

Park and parking

The technique of bio-mining will be used to segregate waste and clean up the dumping yards at Erumakkuzhi and Palayam market. The yard at Erumakkuzhi will be turned into a park, following the model tried at Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh. The dumping yard at the Palayam market will be cleaned and used for parking, as part of the market improvement plan of the smart city project. The Corporation plans to clean both dumps by August.

‘No burn’ campaign

The Mayor said that one reason for the success of the decentralised waste management system in the city was the awareness campaigns conducted by the local body. Such campaigns, including the ‘no burn’ campaign, will be stepped up. The functioning of the Green Army, an initiative of the Corporation comprising student volunteers, will be strengthened with vacation camps. The volunteers will be sent for a mass outreach programme on zero waste, targeting 2.25 lakh households.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ubrciz/article30846279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tv-Clean-citycol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/corporation-brings-out-zero-waste-plan/article30846280.ece

A project management unit (PMU) will be set up at the Capital Region Development Programme-II (CRDP) for the overall management, project development and coordination of the Outer Area Growth Corridor (OAGC) project in the capital district.

The 80-km four-lane Outer Ring Road (ORR), estimated at ₹4,868 crore, from the Vizhinjam bypass to Parippally, with a link from Vencode to Mangalapuram is the highlight of the OAGC, which has been cleared by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. It will be executed under the Bharatmala Pariyojana. Besides the overall management, the PMU will have to take care of the planning, budgeting, supervision, monitoring, and evaluation.

Unit’s mandate

The PMU will coordinate with bilateral and international agencies and will be responsible for the overall project management and coordination with engineering companies, special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and the State governments. The PMU will also advise the CRDP-II about the appropriate software, hardware, IT policy, and IT management.

The PMC will asked to identify and quantify risks like strategic, financial, regulatory, technology, social, environmental, risk impacts, and define a risk mitigation strategy.

Decongesting city

The ORR, expandable to six-lane, with a 10-metre-wide service road on either side and a right of way of 70 metres, has been conceived to exploit the benefits of the Vizhinjam international deepwater seaport and to decongest the core city area.

Around 500 hectares of land will have to be acquired for the ORR and the cost of land acquisition and dismantling of structures is around ₹2,829 crore at the prevailing rate. The State has to share 50% cost of land acquisition, excluding the government land which will be handed over for free to the National Highways Authority of India, the implementing agency.

The official action came after a 76-year-old woman petitioned authorities, pleading for retrieval of her property — a house — from her son.

Sources said Kaliammal of Santhanathapuram in Pudukottai Town was a widow and mother of five children including two sons. One of her sons died.

On January 6, she submitted a petition at the weekly grievances meeting chaired by Collector P. Uma Maheswari, saying that her son, Thiagarajan, was not taking care of her. Hence, the dhana settlement (gift deed) to him must be cancelled. She also stated that she was cheated by her son into making the settlement.

The Collector instructed the Revenue Divisional Officer, Pudukottai, to conduct an inquiry into the issue. Following the inquiry, officials cancelled the gift deed and restored the property in the name of Kaliammal under The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007.

447,2020/02/18,Move to allot Kallikudi market to FPOs receives mixed reaction,"The State government’s decision to allot a portion of shops built at Kallikudi to farmer producers’ organisations has received mixed reaction from city residents.

An integrated market was constructed at Kallikudi on the city outskirts at an estimated ₹77 crore and declared open in 2017.

A section of traders, who are reluctant to shift their operations to the new market, have welcomed the allotment, while a section of consumers oppose it.

“The new market at Kallikudi was built mainly to relocate the entire functioning of Gandhi Market so as to avoid traffic congestion and public inconvenience. If it is not shifted to Kallikudi, we presume that the very purpose of building the market by spending crores of money is defeated,” points out S. Pushpavanam, secretary, Consumer Protection Council, Tiruchi.

The traders of Gandhi Market have attended several meetings convened by officials before finalising the Kallikudi proposal. If they had reservations over the distance, they should have aired their views strongly before finalising the location. The reasons cited by traders for refusing to relocate are unacceptable, he says.

Most of the traders of Gandhi Market are not the original allottees. Several of them are illegally occupying the shops. If the market is not shifted, motorists and residents will have to suffer due to traffic snarls and encroachments for years together, he adds.

However, traders have welcomed the decision. They feel that it is a victory for their spirited struggle.

A.M.P. Abdul Hakkim, a vegetable trader at Gandhi Market, says traders have no hesitation in moving to a new market. But, it should be within two to three km radium within the city limit. The government’s move will help farmers, who are engaged in collective farming, as they can use Kallikudi market as a storage point.

According to Ve. Govindarajulu, general secretary, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangangalin Peramaippu, Tiruchi, traders have been opposing the location of the new market right from day one. No one accepted the move to construct a new market at about 15 km from Tiruchi. No resident will travel such a long distance to buy vegetables, fruits or flowers. The traders presented several petitions to the authorities, highlighting their reservation of the location.

He says the market was opened in 2018 against their wish. Only a handful of traders shifted their operation upon persuasion by authorities. But, they closed their shops within a week due to poor patronage. About 250 traders, who were allotted shops at Kallikudi, surrendered their keys to officials.

“We wholeheartedly welcome the government’s decision. There is no different opinion on shifting the 140-year-old Gandhi Market. Similar to onion mandi traders, we have begun the process of constructing a private market on 20 acres of land on Tiruchi-Chennai Highway.

450,2020/02/18,Prospective Bargur cattle-rearers look for institute’s guidance,"Tribal farmers on Panchamalai hills in Tiruchi district hope that the Advanced Institute for Integrated Research on Livestock and Animal Sciences (AIIRLIVAS), inaugurated recently by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami at Thalaivasal in Salem district, will render assistance in determining the suitability of climate for rearing Bargur cattle in their terrain.

The cattle is an indigenous breed found around Bargur hills at Anthiyur in Erode disrict. The breed, generally raised in herds, is known for its speed, endurance and trotting abilities and is sought after for carrying out agricultural operations in the hilly terrain. Also known as Semmarai in Tamil Nadu, the breed is a favourite during jallikattu, the bull-taming rural sport.

“At present, only bullocks famed for draught potential are being purchased at shandies in Anthiyur and brought to Pachamalai hills for ploughing operations. The necessity for cows of this breed has not arisen so far,” said Perumal, president, Tamil Nadu Tribal People’s Federation, Tiruchi district.

Bargur hills and Pachamalai Hills are home to the Malayalee tribal community and have mean sea levels ranging between 800 and 1,000 metres.

“Survival of the breed on Pachamalai Hills in view of similar climatic conditions is possible. The working ability of the breed is likely to be the same as in Bargur hills. But the adaptability of the breed in other hill terrain has not been documented yet,” A. Paramasivam, Associate Professor and Head, Bargur Cattle Research Station, said.

Though cows yield less milk — below two litres a day — it is rich in vitamins and calcium and is known to have high nutritive and medicinal value. In Erode district, the milk of Bargur cow is being sold at nearly ₹50 for half a litre.

As the cows mainly feed on grass and herbal plants and survive under zero-input conditions, rearing the breed entails only negligible expenditure. Also, its dung has a high manure value.

Possibilities are being explored for enhancing the milk yield of the cows through scientific means. Researchers have been trying out selective breeding of the cattle to increase milk yield.

It is in this aspect that the tribal farmers on Pachamalai hills are anticipating the support of AIIRLAS, which has an indigenous cattle breed rearing farm as one of its main sections.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/prospective-bargur-cattle-rearers-look-for-institutes-guidance/article30852780.ece

The App, Thirumathi Kart, was developed under a Department of Science and Technology-sponsored project, ‘Design and development of ICT-enabled cloud-based mobile application for self-promotion of products developed by self-help groups.’

The main objective of the project was to link customers with SHGs to empower women with sustainable income-generation options. While Thirumathi Kart will be the main app for public usage, the other two, Thirumathi Kart (seller) and Thirumathi Kart (logistics), are for use among the SHGs, according to M. Brindha, Assistant Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, NIT-T, who was part of the team that developed the apps.

The apps were launched by Collector S. Sivarasu in the presence of Mini Shaji Thomas, Director, NIT-T, and other officials at the inauguration of a five-day executive development programme, ‘Marketing strategies in the digital era: self-promotion of SHG products through Thirumathi Kart.’

Ms. Brinda said the Thirumathikart App would be available for download from Playstore after the end of the five-day training. Customers could find and buy products made by SHGs through the platform.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Sivarasu commended NIT-T for addressing a social cause by developing a customised app for SHGs. He called upon SHG members to make full use of the app and observed that its success depended on them.

Ms.Mini Shaji Thomas observed that ‘Thirumathi Kart would serve as a bridge between SHGs and customers. It would help SHG producers reach their targeted customers. She urged students to take up such socially relevant projects.

The number of visitors to Brahadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur has recorded a steady increase following the consecration ceremony held on February 5.

The splendid structural marvel, which stands as testimony to the construction skills of the Tamils, was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987 by UNESCO. It figures prominently in the itinerary of foreign tourists headed for the State as well as domestic visitors from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana on a pilgrimage tour.

The WHS records around 10,000 footfalls on ordinary days and not less than 30,000 during pilgrimage seasons.

The numbers have spiked during the last two weeks with a large number of devotees from Thanjavur and neighbouring districts, who were unable to attend the consecration, making a beeline to the temple particularly during weekends. On Sunday last, around 90,000 devotees visited the temple, according to official sources.

455,2020/02/18,Noon-meal scheme: salad days are here,"'Atchayapathiram' encourages students to bring raw vegetables from home daily.

Students of Subbiah Memorial School in Thennur will now be getting supplements such as fresh salads and accompaniments with their noon meal thanks to Atchayapathiram, an initiative to encourage students to bring raw vegetables from home daily.

The initiative was introduced after parents regularly complained about their children avoiding vegetables. “Most parents are children of daily wage labourers and do not get hot, healthy meals. The mid-day meals scheme provides healthy food which will be supplemented with these vegetables,” said K.S. Jeevanandhan, headmaster.

The idea was conceived by S. Sivakumar, former principal, District Institute of Education and Training, Kancheepuram. “This initiative will ensure that students learn the value of sharing, and are encouraged to grow as tolerant individuals who grow in a society without discrimination,” he said.

With fluctuation in prices of vegetables, it is difficult for parents to provide nutritious food and the school has taken the onus upon itself to feed them, including breakfast. “We give breakfast for the students, which are usually provided by donors. On days where donors are unavailable, I pay for it,” he said.

The school has 150 students, and even one bean pod or carrot from each student will make a world of difference. “If 150 students bring one carrot or bean, we will have enough for a week. We have been able to collect at least 2 kg of vegetables each day so far. The children do not eat vegetables at home, but here, out of fear they eat it,” he said.

Some students even pack food for dinner. “There are some whose parents work until late at night. They pack the noon meal or breakfast for the night. When all their meals are eaten at school, all their dietary needs, especially in growing children, must be met,” he added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/7io2vz/article30848657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY18-HEALTHYEATING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/noon-meal-scheme-salad-days-are-here/article30848658.ece
456,2020/02/18,Biomining begins at Ariyamangalam yard,"We will return the land as clean as a playground within two years: company

The biomining project at Ariyamangalam dump yard here has begun, with machines to segregate the waste mobilised at the site.

The process, which would take nearly two years to clear the accumulated garbage in the sprawling dump, officials said.

Speaking to The Hindu, S. Sivasubramanian, Corporation Commissioner said the project, costing ₹49 crore involved separating the waste into usable, recyclable, debris and non-recyclable items, processing them and transporting the by-products.

For instance, plastics would be sold to cement companies to be used as fuel for cement kilns. Hyderabad and Gujarat-based manufacturers would receive the plastics from Ariyamangalam. The work would be monitored regularly.

An Erode-based company, which was executing the project, had set up 30 conveyors and trommel machines in different parts of the 48-acre dump yard along with filters. Garbage brought by earthmovers was dumped onto the conveyor belts, which passed through multi-stage filters and separated into stones, combustible and plastic waste.

A representative of the contractor estimated the total waste accumulated at the dump yard as 7.60 lakh cubic metres. “We started work late last month and are aiming to clear at least 900-1,000 cubic metres of waste per day. We will return the land as clean as a playground within two years.”

Stones and debris could be transported to form roads or fill up low-lying areas. The processed manure could also be given to farmers for free, he added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/t15cbk/article30848649.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY18-BIOMININ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/biomining-begins-at-ariyamangalam-yard/article30848650.ece
457,2020/02/18,"Chasing a dream, Atalanta rides wave of remarkable run in Champions League","The team from Bergamo in the foothills of the Italian Alps takes on Valencia

Gian Piero Gasperini’s Atalanta is counting on the wave of enthusiasm generated by the Italian outsiders’ remarkable run in its Champions League debut season to surge past Spanish club Valencia in the knockout rounds.

The team from Bergamo in the foothills of the Italian Alps takes on Valencia on Wednesday in the last 16, first leg, at the 80,000-seater San Siro, which has nearly four times the capacity of its home stadium, 55 kilometres away.

“This is a game that we have been waiting months for,” said Gasperini.

“Being able to play on front of so many of our fans at a venue like San Siro is a beautiful achievement that we have been waiting a long time for.

“The Champions League is a dream which we’ll try to carry forward as much as possible.

“The whole city of Bergamo is practically travelling to Milan.”

The team’s stunning run comes despite losing its opening three Champions League group games, including 4-0 away to Dinamo Zagreb before a 5-1 loss at Manchester City.

The revival

But a 1-1 draw against Man City in the San Siro sparked the revival of ‘La Dea’ (The Goddess) who finished seven points behind the Premier League side in second to reach the knockout stage.

Atalanta’s confidence has been further boosted after seeing off AS Roma 2-1 in a cauldron in front of its home crowd at Atleti Azzurri d’Italia stadium on Saturday.

The win consolidated its fourth place in Serie A, six points ahead of the side from the capital and bolstered its hopes of Champions League next season.

“This victory gives us confidence for the next games, it was a fundamental clash to be won,” said Mario Pasalic, who came off the bench and hit the match winner 19 seconds later.

Tottenham vs Leipzig

Tottenham meets Leipzig in the other match on Wednesday.

Their current form is a remarkable achievement for a club with a modest budget compared to rivals Juventus, Inter Milan and AC Milan.

Their transformation follows the arrival of Gasperini in the summer of 2016 from Genoa.

The 62-year-old previously coached Crotone, Palermo and briefly Inter Milan, where he was sacked after a run of five winless Serie A games and just one point.

The team — founded 113 years ago by a group of students from a local school and named after Atalanta, a huntress in Greek mythology — had been relegated in 2003, 2005 and 2010.

Gasperini guided it to a fourth-place finish in his first season to qualify for the Europa League.

Last season it finished third, powered by Colombian Duvan Zapata’s 23 league goals, and qualified for the Champions League for the first time.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/fstf0e/article30854234.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19VALENCIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/chasing-a-dream-atalanta-rides-wave-of-remarkable-run-in-champions-league/article30854236.ece
458,2020/02/18,"Manchester United bests Chelsea, closes in on top four","Rebic nets winner for AC Milan in Serie A

Headed goals from Anthony Martial and Harry Maguire earned Manchester United a 2-0 win at Chelsea on Monday, putting it back in the hunt for a top-four Premier League finish.

In a high tempo, if often scrappy, game Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s United side made the most of its chances while Chelsea, whose form at home has been suspect all season, squandered a string of opportunities.

A fine glancing header from Anthony Martial just before halftime from an Aaron Wan-Bissaka cross put the visitors ahead. It was United’s first Premier League goal in four games.

Defender Harry Maguire made it two in the 66th minute, losing marker Antonio Rudiger to head home from a corner by United’s new Portuguese signing Bruno Fernandes.

VAR comes into play

Chelsea had two goals ruled out by VAR. Kurt Zouma scored from a corner in the 54th but there was a push in the area. Substitute striker Olivier Giroud’s headed effort in the 77th was cancelled when he was adjudged marginally offside.

The loss left Chelsea fourth, a point clear of resurgent rival Tottenham Hotspur led by its ex-coach Jose Mourinho. Chelsea hosts Spurs on Saturday. United, another of Mourinho’s old clubs rose to seventh, three points behind Chelsea.

Meanwhile in Serie A, AC Milan forward Ante Rebic continued his superb run of form by securing a 1-0 over Torino at San Siro that sent it within touching distance of the European spots.

The Croatia international latched onto a Samuel Castillejo cross to sweep home the decisive goal after 25 minutes, marking his fifth in the last five league games.

Milan moved into eighth place on 35 points but only trails seventh-placed Parma and Hellas Verona in sixth on goal difference.

India will have the privilege of an extra venue to the traditional four when it hosts the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup from November 2 to 21.

Making the announcement here on Tuesday, the FIFA Chief Women’s Football Officer Sarai Bareman said, “It’s a massive step forward for the game in India.”

Guwahati, Bhubaneswar, Kolkata, Ahmedabad and Navi Mumbai will be the venues for the event. The final will be held at Navi Mumbai.

“There is unlimited potential for football to grow in India. There is amazing passion too.

“We have picked venues that offer best logistics and sporting facilities and the platform for the players to perform,” said Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju. He thanked FIFA for allowing India to add an extra venue.

Speaking on the occasion, All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Praful Patel, who is also a member of the FIFA Council, said, “India has proved in 2017 (FIFA U-17 Men’s World Cup) that it can be a great host. We had done a professional job. This event will be a great impetus to Indian football and also prove that gender equality is here to stay.”

Patel added, “We want football to grow outside of the traditional area. North-east has become the epicentre of the game in the country and we are happy to add new venues to the football map.

“We look forward to bring the Under-20 and Club World Cup tournaments to in the near future.

“There is inspiration from the 3-3 draw our girls’ team forced against Romania (on Monday)”

Applauding the Indian girls’ effort, Bareman said, “It’s an incredible result against an European team. There are few countries with professional leagues for women. Women are not paid to play football.

“India should look at the positives from the under-17 women’s tournament.

“The tournament slogan ‘Kick Off The Dream’ perfectly captures the aspirational and empowering message for the tournament as we look to grow women’s football.”

Rijiju promised to take the movement forward by maintaining the trend set by Khelo India women’s league. “Every school and college should have a women’s team.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/3jm84d/article30852626.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FIFAPCDELHI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/navi-mumbai-to-host-final-of-fifa-under-17-womens-world-cup/article30852627.ece

Manchester United threw open the race for the final Champions League qualification spots in the Premier League by beating fourth-place Chelsea 2-0 thanks to headers by Anthony Martial and Harry Maguire on Monday.

With 12 games remaining, seven points separate Chelsea and 11th-place Burnley, with the team finishing fifth also set to earn a place in next season’s Champions League following UEFA’s decision to punish Man City for serious breaches of financial regulations by handing the English champions a two-year European ban.

Martial glanced in a header off a right-wing cross by Aaron Wan-Bissaka to give United the lead in the 45th minute at Stamford Bridge, before Maguire planted home a corner from January signing Bruno Fernandes in the 66th.

Maguire, United’s captain, was perhaps fortunate to still be on the field, with the match officials opting not to punish the England defender for appearing to kick out at Michy Batshuayi after tumbling off the playing surface in front of the dugouts.

""I know I caught him but I felt like he was going to fall on me and the natural reaction was to straighten my leg so that if he was to fall on me, to hold him up,” Maguire said. “It probably looks worse than it was.

""I did catch him ... but I knew at the time I had no intent to hurt him or kick him.”

Chelsea was on the wrong end of two other decisions by VAR, firstly disallowing a volleyed goal by Kurt Zouma in the 56th because of a push by Cesar Azpilicueta on United left back Brandon Williams. Azpilicueta seemed to have been pushed a split-second earlier by Fred.

Then, with 13 minutes to go, Olivier Giroud had a goal ruled out by VAR for a tight offside, leaving Chelsea manager Frank Lampard looking thoroughly glum as he sat in his technical area.

Chelsea has long been in fourth place, but has only won three of its last 11 games in the league to give a slew of rivals clubs hope of catching up.

One of them is United, which climbed to seventh place with this win - three points behind Chelsea and two adrift of fifth-place Tottenham.

""This season, we have been far too inconsistent,” Maguire said. “We have won at Manchester City, beat Chelsea at home, got a point against Liverpool, but we have let ourselves down against the teams where the pressure is on to break them down.”

Injury problems are starting to bite at Chelsea, too. Top scorer Tammy Abraham and winger Callum Hudson-Odoi missed the game because of injury, while central midfielder N’Golo Kante lasted 11 minutes before hobbling off. Center back Andreas Christensen didn’t come out for the second half after sustaining a knock to the head late in the first period, just before Martial beat the Denmark defender to a header for the first goal.

Nigeria striker Odion Ighalo, who signed for United on deadline day in the January transfer window, came on in second-half stoppage time for his debut and had a late chance saved by Willy Caballero, who again started in goal ahead of Kepa Azzibabalaga.

He played 247 times for the club, including in a victory in an FA Cup match against Sheffield Wednesday 13 days after the air crash in February 1958.

Harry Gregg, a former Manchester United goalkeeper called the “hero of Munich” for rescuing two teammates as well as a baby and her pregnant mother from the burning fuselage in the 1958 air disaster that killed 23 people, has died. He was 87.

Gregg died peacefully in a hospital, surrounded by family, The Harry Gregg Foundation said on Monday.

A former Northern Ireland international, Gregg spent nine years with Manchester United after joining as the world’s most expensive goalkeeper in 1957. He played 247 times for the club, including in a victory in an FA Cup match against Sheffield Wednesday 13 days after the air crash in February 1958.

The team was returning from a European Cup game when their airplane crashed after refueling in Munich. Gregg escaped the wreckage, having sustained only a bloody nose, but returned on two occasions to help teammates Bobby Charlton and Dennis Viollet and then a 20-month-old girl and her badly injured mother.

Gregg also helped revive United manager Matt Busby, who survived the disaster. Eight United players died in the crash.

""He will always be remembered for what he did at Munich,” Charlton was quoted as saying by the BBC, “but on top of that he was a really great goalkeeper.”

In his autobiography, called Harry’s Game, Gregg said the air disaster in Munich “established my identity” but “the notoriety has come at a price”.

""For Munich has cast a shadow over my life which I found difficult to dispel,” he wrote.

United said Gregg’s contribution to United “could never be underestimated.”

""Although it has been said many times before, we will not see his like again,” the club said. “In short, he was, without question, one of the great figures in United’s history and his name and deeds, both on and off the field, will always be remembered and revered.”

‘Tough nut’

Gregg was part of the team rebuilt by Busby after the Munich disaster but never won a medal with United, injury having ruled him out of the win over Leicester in the 1963 FA Cup final and restricting his appearances in two title-winning campaigns , in 1964-65 and 1966-67.

""A real tough nut,” United said of its former ‘keeper, “Gregg was vocal, commanding and abrasive.”

Gregg played 25 times for Northern Ireland, including at the 1958 World Cup, when he was selected as the best goalkeeper in the competition.

When Windsor Park in Belfast was officially reopened following development in 2016, Gregg was afforded a warm on-field ovation by the fans as well as meeting boxing champion Carl Frampton and golfer Rory McIlroy.

Four years earlier, then-United manager Alex Ferguson brought a full-strength squad to Windsor Park to face an Irish League XI in honor of Gregg, whose career at United ended without a testimonial.

In his program notes, Ferguson described Gregg as “beyond legendary” and “a most reluctant hero.”

The Chennaiyin FC players had left the Nehru Stadium wondering about the two points lost rather than the one gained after their final home game against Bengaluru FC on February 9 (Sunday).

Back in November, with the club languishing at the bottom of the ISL table, anyone associated with the team would’ve accepted this result against the defending champion without batting an eyelid. But things had changed.

Horrible campaign

Chennaiyin might have won a record-equaling second league title (2017-18) under John Gregory, but it also had several unwanted records under his reign last season. It secured the fewest points (9), least number of wins (2) and most defeats (13) by any team in the history of the competition.

The players looked worn-out all season, the footfall at the stadium going on a steep decline and a title-winning team reduced to an also-ran.

There were widespread calls for the club to replace Gregory and the Englishman almost announced his resignation at the end of last season's campaign.

The club, however, decided to stick with him, hoping for a change in fortunes.

After a barren run in front of goal in the current season, Chennaiyin pulled the trigger in late November and announced Owen Coyle’s appointment in the first week of December.

Since then, there has been a dramatic transformation - from the mood around the club to its fortunes in the league.

“Ideally any coach will want a pre-season. But when you inherit a squad, you have to quickly ascertain what’s at hand,” said Coyle after taking over. “Looking at the squad, I think there are some very good players here. Our job is to try and get them to the maximum level.”

Coyle has been successful in his efforts too. He has unlocked the attacking potential of the team and embraced an entertaining style that has also brought back fans to the venue.

“We do play with an element of risk because we had to play like that from where we were (bottom of the table),” said Coyle addressing concerns about the side's porous defence.

While CFC still concedes goals at a similar rate (1.67 per game under Gregory and 1.4 under Coyle), its striking ability has improved drastically. After scoring just four in six games (0.24 goals per game) under Gregory this season, Chennaiyin has found the back of the net 25 times in 10 games (2.5 goals per game).

Under Coyle's influence, Chennaiyin has garnered 20 points out a possible 30 and vaulted to fifth in the table. The club, whose season looked like it was over even before it began, can now secure a playoff spot by defeating Mumbai City FC in Mumbai on February 21 (Friday) – and that too with a game in hand!",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/j1i9y2/article30846399.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18VAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/isl-the-coyle-effect-and-cfcs-transformation/article30846400.ece

466,2020/02/18,CITU alleges police high-handedness,"It condemns arrest of MEPMA resource persons at Tourism Minister’s camp office

The Greater Visakha Nagar Committee of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) has deplored the “high-handed behaviour of the police with the MEPMA resource persons when they went to meet Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao to submit a memorandum of their demands’.

The resource persons went to the Minister’s camp office (residence) in the city on February 15 to submit a memorandum, seeking job security and payment of the wage arrears that have been pending for the past 14 months.

The resource persons were seeking an assurance from the Minister as the government has failed to address their grievances though the issue was brought to its notice on several occasions during the past six months, CITU Greater Visakha City Committee president R.K.S.V. Kumar told a media here on Monday.

Fulfil demands

“The resource persons were arrested and taken to the MVP police station and humiliated. The incident was recorded on video cameras,” alleged Mr. Kumar and sought action against the police officers involved in the issue.

He also sought a solution to the demands of the resource persons. CITU city secretary B. Jagan, Sramika Mahila Samanvaya Committee convener M. Kameswari and MEPMA Employees Union honorary adviser M.

467,2020/02/18,"Triple play service makes Internet, cable TV and phone cheaper","‘Subscribers need to pay around ₹250 a month for availing the three services’

In what appears to be a change in the trend of cable TV, broadband and phone connections being offered by different service providers, the city has now telecom and entertainment majors launching triple play services, that too at an economic price.

Triple play service is the package of broadband Internet and television, and telephone services that can be availed of through a single broadband connection.

The Reliance is offering IP-based TV channel services, while the Essel Group is said to be toying with the idea of launching non-IP based triple play services.

It all began when the AP Fibrenet was launched with a lot of fanfare during the Telugu Desam Party regime, with the promise of providing cable TV, broadband and telephone services on a single platform at a nominal price.

However, the project hit a roadblock after providing connections in certain pockets of the city.

Meanwhile, Jio Fibre launched its services on September 5 last year, offering broadband and phone connections free of cost for three months.

It extended the offer in December last.

It offered several packages such as bronze, silver, gold, diamond and platinum at monthly tariffs starting from ₹699.

The public sector telecom major BSNL too launched triple play services recently, in association with the local cable channel SDV. It utilises the optical fibre cable of SDV to provide the three services.

Subscriber base

“The AP Fibrenet has about 10 lakh connections in the State, of which more than 1.20 lakh are in Visakhapatnam district. Jio Fibre has around 3,000 connections,” Pakki Divakar, State president of Seemandhra Cable TV Operators’ Welfare Association told The Hindu.

Package details

“The subscribers of triple play service need to pay around ₹250 a month for availing of the three services as against ₹800 or more if they subscribe for the same independently,” explains Mr. Divakar.

AP Fibregrid is not in a position to give new connections and cable TV services due to non-release of optic fibre terminator (OLT) by the government.

“AP Fibernet has one lakh connections in Visakhapatnam district. It has a separate exchange on Andhra University campus. At ₹235 a month, we are offering all three services,” says N. Ramakrishna, Vizag City MSO.

468,2020/02/18,Former TDP MLA held for ‘obstructing’ evacuation drive,"‘The exercise was carried out without serving notice to residents’

Former TDP MLA Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy, party leader Gandi Babji and a few local residents were arrested on charge of preventing the officials to carry out the evacuation of the dwellings beside the Pentamma Cheruvu in Pedurthi area on Monday.

However, they were released after a while.

“As many as 56 families have been living near the cheruvu for the last 70 years. The government officials are trying to evacuate them without even serving a notice, which is mandatory as per the Supreme Court’s order,” alleged Mr. Satyanarayana Murthy.

He also claimed that the residents were being evacuated as part of the process to acquire six acres to make way for the housing projects proposed as part of the Land Pooling Scheme.

‘Alternative land not given’

“Even if the residents are encroachers, as per the GO 72 issued by the government, the residents should get 400 sq yards of land in exchange, which is not being provided in this case. The residents were even allotted pattadar passbooks for the land in the past,” alleged the former MLA.

He also alleged that the officials were also trying to take over the cheruvu land spreading over about 36 acres for the housing scheme.

“The officials are now trying to show the water body as a barren land. But as per records, it still holds water and ₹10 lakh was allotted by the YSRC government itself last year for the de-silting works,” Mr. Satyanarayana Murthy pointed out.

Drive not related to LPS: Joint Collector

However, a senior police officer said the TDP leaders were arrested as they tried to obstruct the official proceedings.

Meanwhile, Joint Collector Venugopal Reddy has clarified that the evacuation drive has nothing to do with the Land Pooling Scheme. “The drive was undertaken to reclaim the encroached land,” the Joint Collector added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/13qs5k/article30846674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VZ3FORMERTDPMLABANDARUSATYANARAYANAMURTHYANDLEADERGANDIBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/former-tdp-mla-held-for-obstructing-evacuation-drive/article30846675.ece
469,2020/02/18,Helmet for pillion riders to be made mandatory in Vizag,"Penalty will be collected from violators after awareness drives, say traffic police

After implementing the helmet rule with an iron fist, the city traffic police have launched a campaign to make wearing headgear compulsory for the pillion riders too.

According to police, a series of awareness programmes are being organised extensively and fines will be collected the violators soon. Records suggest that five pillion riders died while several others were injured in 11 accidents involving two-wheelers in the city last year.

‘Not a new rule’

“The risk in not wearing helmet is same for both the driver and the pillion rider. The risk is even bigger for the pillion riders when heavy vehicles hits a motorcycle from the rear. We have seen many such cases when pillion riders died due to head injuries while the rider escaped with normal injuries,” said a police officer.

Another police officer said this is not a new rule as it is already being implemented in cities such as Benguluru and Chennai. Recently, the Hyderabad Police have also launched a similar campaign.

“The city police had mooted the idea long ago but it was not implemented. This time, Police Commissioner R.K. Meena is serious about its implementation,” he said.

According to the ACP (Zone II) M.R.K Raju, campaigns are being organised to educate motorists that wearing helmet for pillion rider is mandatory.

“Campaigns are being organised at educational institutions. We are sensitising people in this regard during their routine inspections on the roads. We have put up posters at the major junctions about the rule,” Mr. Raju said.

The police would start collecting fines after the Police Commissioner gives his nod, he added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/84nrey/article30846659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VZ3HELMETRULE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/helmet-for-pillion-riders-to-be-made-mandatory-in-vizag/article30846660.ece
470,2020/02/18,Priyamvada Gopal in her book 'Insurgent Empire' looks at the dissent by British critics against the Imperial project,"A history of dissidence: Priyamvada Gopal in her book Insurgent Empire looks at the dissent by British critics, who were actively inspired by Black and Asian insurgencies, against the Imperial project

From the Revolt of 1857 in India to the 1905 ‘Mau Mau’ uprising in Kenya, Priyamvada Gopal explores a century of dissent against the Empire, both within the UK and in colonised countries in her non-fiction book Insurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance and British Dissent. Priyamvada, who teaches in the faculty of English, Cambridge University, was in Bengaluru recently.

Speaking of how the idea for the book came to her, Priyamvada says: “In the beginning of the book I write about how I got involved in public debates about the Empire and I realised two things; either there was an uncritical celebration of the Empire or there was complete amnesia about the fact that there was an Empire, and these were contradictory views.”

She points out that the Empire has largely been mythologised, and this has led to the distorted ways in which it is perceived. “There is hardly any teaching of Empire in British schools. So my final year students come to me knowing nothing and that became clear to me only after a few years of teaching in Britain. They knew there was an Empire and they knew Britain no longer had an Empire. They didn’t know what it was and how it began. They knew very little about slavery, about 1857 or any of the other wars in Africa, for instance.”

Priyamvada, thus, addresses this lacuna in her book. “It became clear to me that some kind of history had to be put in the public domain that allows students to start thinking about these issues. They would become adults and then they would keep hearing politicians, from across the political spectrum, say, ‘we should be proud of the Empire!’ So the book is to address that amnesia but also to push against the idea that Britain should be uncritically proud of it.”

Priyamvada challenges the claim that the past of the Empire, such as famines and massacres, must not be judged with present-day parameters. “It was my guess that it was never the case that everyone in Britain was completely behind the Imperial project. And sure enough that is what my research shows. I write in the book that there were plenty of people in Britain in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries who were critical of things being done in their name. Not just Jallianwala Bagh (that is the most famous example) but also of massacres all through the Empire. There were people in Britain who asked why is this being done in their name?”

Insurgent Empire tells a part of the story of the Empire through looking at British critics of Empire. “I say to my students you have a history of dissidence on the question of Empire. You have ancestors and a social past in which they said no.” The book also includes how British critics of Empire were actively inspired by Black and Asian insurgencies. “We are familiar with the idea that the British gave us the Parliamentary system, the idea of sovereignty and of nation, and the idea of influence from Britain to the colonies. We never talk about the reverse influence. If you are of the colonial notion and you have an empire for 200 years, and that Empire is constantly rebelling, then how can you not affected by that?”

Are there parallels between how the Empire suppressed dissidence and what is happening in the country now? “It is deeply ironic,” Priyamvada agrees, “When I witness the protests now, I can’t help thinking about the Meerut Conspiracy Case We have completely kept the colonial state, literally, word for word. The only thing that has happened is that if the Meerut Conspiracy people were charged for conspiracy against the King Emperor, you just now need to remove King-Emperor and put the government in its place.”

Priyamvada agrees that India has not de-colonised in many ways. “The Indian elite have imbibed colonial thinking to the point where they think it was good because it introduced railways, the English language or the idea of the nation. The short version would be this, did India really benefit from British from simply being moved to the nation formation and at what cost? So in other words, yes of course the idea of nation came to us from Europe, but was it right to just take it without any alterations, and without paying attention to what the context was in disparate kingdoms? In a way what we are experiencing now is blow back that actually what the British left us might have been a mixed bag. ...I always start my lessons with how I am here because of Lord Macaulay. He created a class of interpreters between us and the masses. That doesn’t make it a great thing, it shaped my life but it is also conceivable that India would have got on very well without the English language, so we can’t say it is a gift... it is only a fact.”

471,2020/02/18,"Chennai’s first lounge for puzzles, Untangle, is a gym for your brain","At Untangle, the city’s first lounge for puzzles, flex your grey cells to put together 1,000-piece movie posters and 3D models

On a refreshingly cool Saturday evening, when the rest of Chennai was probably out enjoying the weather or catching a movie, I found myself hunched over a table, trying to assemble a triangle out of three disjointed pieces of wood. A young man at the adjacent table is enjoying a plate of nachos, revelling in the success of putting together a 3D model of London’s Big Ben. Beyond him is a different sort of chaos — a family of three desperately trying to assemble a Lion King Puzzle.

We are at Untangle, a newly opened puzzle-solving lounge in Teynampet. Here, black tables and chairs are propped up against bright white walls, decorated with vibrant art. Nestled between the wall and the tables is an elaborately carved, giant sudoku table with numbered pieces.

For founders Senthilnathan and Subhatra, diving into jigsaw puzzles is a means to de-stress. Senthil, who previously worked in the banking sector for 12 years, says Untangle had its genesis during regular outings with their four-year-old daughter. “At all these activity centres, kids have fun, but adults are just waiting, twiddling their thumbs and checking their phones. When we go to places like restaurants or pubs, there’s nothing for the kids to do. So we thought why not combine these two and create a space where both adults and kids can have fun together?”

Indeed, most of Untangle’s customers so far have been families. They tend to gravitate towards the classic canon of puzzles — the jigsaw. The range of jigsaw puzzles here at Untangle is massive: from relatively simple 300-piece birds and animals, to mammoth 3000-piece landscapes and movie posters, complex 3D assembling of monuments, mosaic mind-benders and finally, the most fiendish of them all — puzzles with no image for reference.

Senthil says he has seen a few Hall-of-Famers already: a nine-year-old boy who assembled an imposing Eiffel Tower and an eight-year-old girl who blitzed through five puzzles in just 90 minutes.

If jigsaws don’t interest you, Untangle also has a collection of ‘sit and solve’ puzzles. They are logic or pattern-based and come with a task: either form a pattern or take it apart. Each take around five to 10 minutes to solve, with multiple difficulty levels. Senthil says customers usually enter with the idea of spending one hour but end up spending easily 3-4. What they are after is usually the sheer elation of cracking it.

He adds that none of the puzzles at Untangle are esoteric or need players to know a specific trick to solve them. They are puzzles that can be worked out just based on a hunch or a hint. “We’ve collected about 40 such puzzles from around the world. Some were invented in the past and have died down. Most of our customers are unfamiliar with these puzzles,” says Senthil. They even have a Tamil version of Scrabble.

Untangle also houses board games, but only those which do not involve any element of luck, like the roll of a dice. They are purely dependent on smart thinking and strategising. For now, Untangle plans to host regular events, like a jigsaw puzzle marathon, where you can sign up and help solve a 6000-piece monster.

Both Senthil and Subhatra flit across from table to table, patiently explaining the rules of various puzzles, nudging the players with clues and sharing their elation when it is solved. Subhatra, who runs Choc of the Town, also manages the cafe at Untangle, where you can get everything from filter coffee to waffles to aid you while flexing those brain cells.

Puzzle solving for some is a strictly solitary pursuit. For others, it is a chance to celebrate as a group, to have a meaningful interaction that doesn’t use emoticons. Walk into Untangle and you’ll experience the conviviality: fast talk, laughter, the pitter-patter of pieces being sorted. The one thing you’ll rarely see is someone’s head buried in a glowing phone screen. A poster on the wall proudly says ‘Wifi password: ThereIsNoWifiHere’.

Untangle is at KB Dasan Road, Teynampet, and is open Tuesday through Sunday, from 11 am to 9 pm. Costs ₹200 per head for an hour, and ₹100 per hour afterward.
