0,2020/03/02,Wrestling | Bajrang aims to peak during the Olympics,"Sakshi hopes the coronavirus crisis won’t ‘crush her dreams’

The spread of the coronavirus beyond the confines of the epicentre China has wreaked havoc with the schedules of a number of Indian Olympic hopefuls.

In wrestling, the Olympic qualifying tournament scheduled from March 27 to 29 in Kyrgyzstan now stands cancelled. Sakshi Malik, a bronze medallist from Rio 2016, has just one more opportunity (in May in Bulgaria) to make the grade and is hoping that the outbreak doesn’t “crush her dreams”.

Even as it doesn’t affect one of India’s biggest medal prospects at Tokyo 2020, Bajrang Punia, qualify as he did quite early, the 26-year-old said it was important to be sensitive to the crisis at a humanitarian level.

“A lot of people have died and that’s horrible,” Bajrang said at an event held to announce an association between JSW Group’s Inspire Institute of Sport and Herbalife Nutrition. “It’s not only about athletes, it’s about every person. As athletes in this country we don’t have to worry about it. But you can’t just ignore it.”

“China, Italy, Iran and many places in Europe…people can’t come from there or go there. What if there is an emergency and they can’t travel?”

Thus far the Tokyo 2020 authorities have been steadfast in their belief that the Olympics will go ahead as scheduled.

It is with this certainty that Bajrang plans to train, though he is unsure of the events he will take part in to fine-tune his preparations.

“My target is to peak during the Olympics,” Bajrang said.

“Every wrestler, including me, comes to the Olympics with the dream of winning a medal. I should not make any mistakes. My category (65 kg) is a tough one. There are around 12-13 wrestlers who can beat anyone. ”

At the recent Asian Wrestling Championship at home, Bajrang lost to Japan’s Takuto Otoguro, an opponent who he had failed to defeat in the 2018 World Championship title clash too.

“I couldn’t give my 100%. There was pressure and a few days before that I had typhoid. But I am working on my weaknesses. My leg defence has improved. Also, I used to concede points early and would recover later.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/x6zr38/article30965822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03PUNIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/wrestling-bajrang-aims-to-peak-during-the-olympics/article30965823.ece
1,2020/03/02,Basketball | Coronavirus cloud over 3x3 tourney,"Fears over the coronavirus has cast doubts over participation of a few teams in the FIBA 3x3 Olympic basketball qualifying tournament, which commences at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on March 18.

Chinese Taipei and Italy, two countries badly affected by the virus, sit alongside India, Switzerland and Spain in Pool D.

Visa issues

Players from these two countries could face difficulties in securing visas to travel to India.

As it stands now, the Indian government has placed restrictions on the entry of visitors from Chinese Taipei and Italy.

‘Wait and watch’

Basketball Federation of India secretary-general Chander Mukhi Sharma stated the host would take a wait and watch policy.

“We have not received any official communication yet from the government.

“Given that the coronavirus is a serious threat, we cannot make any special exemptions for players from any nation.

“Every player from every foreign team will be subject to the protocols and rules set by the Indian government,” Chander said here on Monday.

The awardees:

CHAMPION OWNER: Dr. M.A.M. Ramaswamy Chettiar Of Chettinad Charitable Trust. A.C. Muthiah accepted the award on behalf of the trust.

The famous gold with the brown belt silks, which dominated racing throughout the country, remains at the forefront and is still a force to reckon with.

5,2020/03/02,Fed Cup: India has tough start,"Takes on a full-strength China on Tuesday

India will open against the toughest team in the field, China, in the opening match of the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania women’s tennis tournament scheduled to be played in Dubai from Tuesday.

The Chinese team is pretty strong with Wang Qiang, Shuai Zhang, Zheng Saisai, Shuai Peng and YiFan Xu.

Interestingly, the players have been competing in the circuit and not returned home after the Australian Open.

The Indian team captain Vishaal Uppal said that it was a good thing that India would be playing the best team straightaway.

“The best time to catch a top-ranked team is in the first round. Having said that, we have to try and beat every team in this competition,” said Vishaal.

With the top two from the six teams making it to the next stage, India may have to win against tough teams to make progress.

Ankita the top choice

Ankita Raina will be the obvious No.1 player, and there should perhaps be no doubt that former World No. 1 and six-time Grand Slam champion Sania Mirza would figure in the doubles team.

Sania and the rest of the team did have a good training session on Sunday.

The captain may have to take a crucial decision on the second singles player from among Rutuja Bhosale, Riya Bhatia and Sowjanya Bavisetti. Karman Kaur Thandi pulled out owing to a stress fracture, paving the way for National champion Sowjanya, who was originally a reserve.

“Our team nominations will not be revealed till one hour before the tie,” said Vishaal.

India is scheduled to play Uzbekistan, Korea, Chinese Taipei and Indonesia in that order after the match against China.

6,2020/03/02,Brazilian teen Seyboth Wild outlasts Ruud for Chile Open title,"The 19-year-old wildcard collapsed to the ground in delight after Ruud sent a backhand wide on match point

Brazilian teenager Thiago Seyboth Wild became the youngest player to win on Latin America's 'Golden Swing' since Rafael Nadal in 2005 when he outlasted Norwegian second seed Casper Ruud 7-5 4-6 6-3 at the Chile Open on Sunday.

The 19-year-old wildcard collapsed to the ground in delight after Ruud sent a backhand wide on match point.

Seyboth Wild fired down 17 aces en route to his maiden tour-level title.

Ruud was full of praise for Seyboth Wild, who is two years younger than the Norwegian.

“He played amazing tennis all week. I can't be too upset about my loss,” Ruud said. “He proved that he deserved his wildcard and took very good care of his opportunity. Even though I'm not that experienced myself, I can see that he'll be around for many more years.”

The road to the title was not an easy one for Seyboth Wild as he had to overcome fifth-seeded Argentine Juan Ignacio Londero in the second round before advancing past top seeded Cristian Garin when the Chilean retired due to a left leg injury.

The 182nd-ranked Seyboth Wild, who had started the week with just two tour-level wins to his name, became the youngest Brazilian to win an ATP title.

He is expected to shoot up to a career-high 113th in the world when the new rankings are released on Monday.

7,2020/03/02,Hackers may have access to your smart device,"ESET, a Slovak cybersecurity firm, has for the last one year been working in collaboration with manufacturers of two specific WiFi chips, which were found to have been vulnerable to attack by hostile parties.

If you’ve been using an iPhone, iPad, Amazon Echo or Kindle or certain handsets from Google, Samsung or Xiaomi, there is a chance that your device has been accessed or taken over by hackers, thanks to a recently discovered vulnerability in the WiFi chips used in these devices.

ESET, a Slovak cybersecurity firm, has for the last one year been working in collaboration with manufacturers of two specific WiFi chips, which were found to have been vulnerable to attack by hostile parties. The manufacturers have since released for all the vulnerable devices security patches that users can install to address the vulnerability.

According to a report released by ESET, the vulnerability named Kr00k was discovered while the firm was conducting research into KRACK, a series of attacks on WiFi devices that was detected last year. In subsequent investigations, ESET discovered that WiFI chips manufactured by Broadcom ad Cypress had the Kr00k vulnerability. Chips from both these companies have a high market share and are used in a wide range of WiFi-enabled devices.

ESET said the devices that tested positive for the vulnerability include the Amazon Echo (2nd generation), Amazon Kindle (8th generation), Apple iPad mini 2, Apple iPhone 6, 6s, 8 and XR, Apple MacBook Air Retina 13-inch 2018, Google Nexus 5, 6, and 6s, Raspberry Pi 3, Samsung Galaxy S4 GT-19505, Samsung Galaxy S8 and Xiaomi Redmi 3s, as well as some WiFi access points by Huawei and Asus.

“Simply put, any device with a WiFi chip manufactured by these two companies is vulnerable to attack, as long as the device is connected to a WiFi network and the hacker is within the range of the same network,” a cybercrime official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. “Once a hacker gets access to any device for even a short period of time, they can do anything, including planting a malware or intercepting sensitive information that is being sent or received via the Internet,” the official added.

Indian cybercrime agencies are currently trying to gauge the number of devices featuring these two chips in circulation in the country to get a sense of the magnitude of the problem.

The Slovak firm states that the Kr00k vulnerability is triggered when the device in question experiences a disconnection with the network, called a “dissociation” in technical terms. The more concerning factor, according to officials, is that a dissociation can also be triggered manually.

“It is only a matter of sending a high energy pulse to the server, which can cause a temporary dissociation, while the user thinks that this happened due to a weak signal,” the official said. “A suitably designed malware can easily find its way to the user’s online storage space, like the Cloud, after which multiple possibilities, including data theft and financial crimes open up,” the officer added.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/4rb36t/article30965474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THAMAZONECHO,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/slovak-firm-spots-vulnerability-in-16-devices/article30965469.ece
8,2020/03/02,"Kind Words, This War of Mine and more: Video games that can be forces of social change","A homage to those games that help bring about positivity, guiding kids as they grow up, and educating people on mental health issues

Gaming is a powerful medium to do some good if used right. Just recently, we have seen the use of an interactive VR experience to help a grieving mother say goodbye to her daughter. While gaming companies invest a lot of resources in the next global sensation like Fortnite, a handful of independent studios are creating moving experiences to bring about meaningful change.

For those who watch The Game Awards every year, you may recognise the title of the story as one of their categories. A homage to those games that help bring about positivity, guiding kids as they grow up, educating people on mental health issues or just being a friendly hand in the dark to guide people out.

Kind Words

Developed by Popcannibal; Available on Steam

On Steam, the full name of the game is Kind Words (lo fi chill beats to write to). Which sort of sums things up. This is not just a word processor wrapped into a game, but a powerful method of getting that right piece of advice, or giving that right piece of advice. People just write out their concerns and put it out there, for some kind strangers to answer back. Building an anonymous positive community by just being kind.

This War of Mine

This War of Mine

Developed by 11 Bit Studios; Available on Steam

While this game has been around for a while, with all that’s been going on in the world today, it’s important to come back to This War of Mine. A game that is about war, but not from the perspective of a Call of Duty soldier, but that of the civilians as they hide, scrounge for food and survive their daily hell where they can be executed on sight. The Complete Edition of the game is out now and it also contains The Little Ones, which is even more poignant, putting you in the little shoes of our children. While we wage all our violent wars, there’s always the innocent that suffer.

Sayanora Wild Hearts

Sayonara Wild Hearts

Developed by Simogo; Available on Apple Arcade, Switch, Steam, PS4, Xbox One

Growing up is a difficult thing, which is why Sayonara Wild Hearts is different for different people. A music-driven sort of puzzle game, on the surface it’s a pulse-pounding fever dream that looks beautiful. At its heart, it’s almost an act of breaking free, a game that symbolises the various demons we need to confront in order to emerge and embrace ourselves for who we are.

Gris

Gris

Developed by Nomada Studio/Devolver Digital; Available on Switch, Steam, PS4, Xbox One

To the sceptics who feel that games are not art, I shove Gris in your collective faces. A hand-drawn masterpiece, much like Sayonara Wild Hearts, it uses visuals and deep symbolisms as it features a young girl named Gris, who has to navigate through her sorrow, find pathways and overcome all of those to claw her way back to life. Gris may mean something else to you, but to me it felt like it was telling me to find a way through the tough times, and focus on living your best life.

Celeste

Celeste

Developed by Matt Makes Games; Available on Switch, Steam, PS4, Xbox One

We all have our mountains to climb, and some we have been climbing since we were born. You play as Madeline, and ahead of her is a tough journey, as she has to climb up to the top of Mount Celeste. While this game may look as cute as Mario, it’s a supremely tough game, which is all about overcoming and emerging triumphant, no matter the hardships you face.

Hell Blade: Senua’s Sacrifice

Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice

Developed by Ninja Theory; Available on Switch, Steam, PS4, Xbox One

Mental health is something that should be treasured at all costs. Yet, how do we know we are facing a mental health issue? Hellblade is a fantasy horror on which creators Ninja Theory have spent hours working with neuroscientists to clearly define what people experience with psychosis. A condition where you can see things that aren’t there. Unlike the peaceful experiences of the games above, it features the talented Melina Juergens as Senua, a Pict warrior who has to rescue her dead love from hell itself.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/edmw7l/article30963555.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03bgkind,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/kind-words-this-war-of-mine-and-more-video-games-that-can-be-forces-of-social-change/article30963561.ece
9,2020/03/02,Apple iPhones get costly in India after import duty hike,"The price hike on iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max models along with iPhone 8 will be effective from Monday.

Apple has increased the price of some of its high-end iPhone models in India owing to an increase in customs duty on imported mobile phones and chargers along with social welfare surcharge in the Union Budget 2020.

The price hike on iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max models along with iPhone 8 will be effective from Monday.

Since iPhone XR and iPhone 7 are being assembled in India by Apple supplier Foxconn and Wistron, there is no price change on these hot-selling models.

The company has also exempted the popular iPhone 11 and iPad, Apple Watch and Mac desktops from any price hike.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max 64 GB will now be priced ₹1,11,200, while the 256 GB model will be at ₹1,25,200 and the 512 GB version at ₹1,43,200.

Earlier, the iPhone 11 Pro Max price started at ₹1,09,900.

The iPhone 11 Pro 64 GB version will be priced ₹1,01,200, 256 GB at ₹1,15,200 and iPhone 11 Pro 512 GB at ₹1,33,200. The iPhone 11 Pro earlier used to start at ₹99,900.

The iPhone 11 Pro Max 64 GB will now be priced ₹1,11,200.

The price hike is about ₹1,300 on iPhone 11 Pro series.

The iPhone 8 prices have also gone up.

The iPhone 8+ 64GB model is now at Rs 50,600, 128GB at Rs 55,600 -- up about Rs 700 from the earlier starting price of Rs 49,900. The iPhone 8 64 GB will cost Rs 40,500 and 128 GB at Rs 45,500.

Unlike the assumption, the coronavirus impact in China which has put stress on the production and supply of some Chinese brands has nothing to do with Apple, according to industry sources.

The price hike is solely on the bases of customs duty hike on imported mobile phones and chargers.

Mobile phones were earlier exempted from 10% service welfare cess but it will now be re-imposed on imported handsets over and above existing 20% basic customs duty in India.

The government has increased the import duty on PCBA (printed circuit board assembly) from 10% to 20% and chargers from 15% to 20%.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/7r7h9f/article30961567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08NETAPPLENEW,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/apple-iphones-get-costly-in-india-after-import-duty-hike/article30961563.ece

13,2020/03/02,Child dies as migrants’ boat capsizes,"Turkish President Erdogan warns millions of refugees will soon head to Europe

A young boy died when a makeshift boat packed with dozens of migrants capsized off the coast of Lesbos, the Greek port police said, as the number of people attempting to cross into Europe from Turkey surges.

Two children were found “unconscious” after the vessel overturned around 08:30 a.m. local time (0630 GMT) in the Aegean Sea. One of them could not be revived, while the other was taken to hospital, a spokeswoman said.

A further “46 people are safe” following the accident, the official said. No details were given on the nationality or age of the child.

Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned on Monday that “millions” of migrants will soon head for Europe as he mounted pressure on Western countries to give Turkey more assistance with the Syrian conflict.

Mr. Erdogan also said he hoped to reach a deal on a ceasefire in Syria when he meets his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin later in the week.

He warned Europe that it will have to shoulder its part of the refugee crisis triggered by violence in the region.

“After we opened the doors, there were multiple calls saying ‘close the doors’. I told them ‘it’s done. It’s finished. The doors are now open. Now, you will have to take your share of the burden’,” he said.

The migrant question comes as Turkey has launched a military operation in Idlib in northwestern Syria, after weeks of mounting tensions with the regime.

The Syrian government pledged to repel Turkish forces, telling the official SANA news agency that it was “determined to confront the flagrant Turkish aggression”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a7lwt1/article30965734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-children-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/child-dies-as-migrants-boat-capsizes/article30965735.ece
14,2020/03/02,"EU raises alert as virus toll crosses 3,000","Nine times more new COVID-19 cases outside China than inside: WHO; Italy cases double in 48 hours

The death toll from the new coronavirus epidemic surpassed 3,000 on Monday as more people died in China, Iran and the U.S. and Europe raised its state of alert.

The virus has now infected more than 89,000, spread to over 60 countries and threatens to cause a global economic slowdown — after first emerging in China late last year.

Also read | Why is COVID-19 not a pandemic yet?

With fears of a pandemic on the rise, the World Health Organization urged all countries to stock up on critical care ventilators to treat patients with severe symptoms.

China reported 42 more deaths on Monday — all in central Hubei province. The death toll in China alone rose to 2,912, but it is also surging abroad.

The World Health Organization said on Monday that the number of new coronavirus cases registered in the past day in China was far lower than in the rest of the world.

“In the last 24 hours there were almost nine times more COVID-19 cases reported outside China than inside China,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva.

In Brussels, EU president Ursula von der Leyen said the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) had increased its risk assessment for Europeans after Italy’s outbreak doubled in 48 hours.

The virus has raised fears for the world economy, with the OECD lowering its global growth forecast by half a point to 2.4%, the worst performance since the 2008 crisis.

China’s economy has ground to a halt with large swathes of the country under quarantine or measures to restrict travel.

Health officials monitoring the virus at the ECDC announced that it had increased its risk assessment to “moderate to high”.

In France, a woman, in her eighties, has died. The Louvre — the world’s most visited museum — closed on Monday after staff refused to work because of fears about the virus.

Elderly vulnerable

The WHO says the virus appears to particularly hit those over the age of 60 and people already weakened by other illness. It has a mortality rate of between 2-5%.

Saudi Arabia on Monday announced its first case of the virus, the Health Ministry said.

Iran reported 12 more deaths on Monday, raising the country’s toll to 66, the second biggest after China.

South Korea, the biggest nest of infections outside China, reported nearly 500 new cases on Monday, raising its total past 4,000. Four more people died, taking its toll to 22.

The leader of a secretive South Korean sect linked to more than half the cases apologised on Monday for the spread of the disease.

Shincheonji head Lee Man-hee’s plea for forgiveness came after Seoul city authorities filed a murder complaint against him for failing to cooperate in containing the epidemic.

U.S. deaths

A second person died in the northwestern U.S. state of Washington as President Donald Trump, who has downplayed the risk of a major outbreak, faced criticism over his administration’s preparedness.

EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said: “As of this morning, we have 2,100 confirmed cases in 18 EU member states and we have 38 citizens who have lost their lives.”

After an increase on Sunday, China’s National Health Commission reported 202 new infections on Monday, the lowest daily rise since late January, bringing the nationwide total over 80,000.

By contrast, Iran reported more than 500 new cases, raising its total number of infections to 1,501.

15,2020/03/02,Taliban says will resume operations against Afghan forces,"The declaration comes only a day after President Ashraf Ghani said he would continue the partial truce at least until talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban kick-off, supposedly on March 10.

The Taliban said on Monday they were resuming offensive operations against Afghan security forces, ending the partial truce that preceded the signing of a deal between the insurgents and Washington.

The declaration comes only a day after President Ashraf Ghani said he would continue the partial truce at least until talks between Afghan officials and the Taliban kick-off, supposedly on March 10.

It ran for one week ahead of the signing of the historic accord in Doha on Saturday, and continued over the weekend.

“The reduction in violence... has ended now and our operations will continue as normal,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP.

“As per the (US-Taliban) agreement, our mujahideen will not attack foreign forces but our operations will continue against the Kabul administration forces.”

Fawad Aman, deputy spokesman for the defence ministry, said the government was “checking to see if (the truce) had ended”.

“We have not had any reports of any big attacks in the country yet”, he added.

Since the deal signing on Saturday, the Taliban have been publicly celebrating their “victory” over the US.

Under the terms of the deal, foreign forces will quit Afghanistan within 14 months, subject to Taliban security guarantees and a pledge by the insurgents to hold talks with the Kabul government.

The dramatic fall in attacks due to last week’s partial truce between the Taliban, US and Afghan forces offered Afghans a rare opportunity to go about their daily lives without fear of violence.

Mr. Ghani warned the insurgents on Monday that he was not committed to a key clause in the Doha deal involving the release of thousands of Taliban prisoners.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/z6r80f/article30964645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TALIBKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taliban-says-will-resume-operations-against-afghan-forces/article30964646.ece
16,2020/03/02,Pakistan to request British government for Nawaz Sharif’s deportation,"Firdous Ashiq Awan, Special Assistant to Pakistan Prime Minister on Information, said Nawaz Sharif has neither undergone any heart surgery nor was he admitted to hospital for any emergency during the last three months.

Pakistan will request the British government to deport Nawaz Sharif, a senior official said while alleging that the “absconding” former Prime Minister was playing a “fixed match” regarding his illness while in London.

Casting doubts on the illness of the 70-year-old three-time former Prime Minister, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information Firdous Ashiq Awan said Nawaz Sharif has neither undergone any heart surgery nor was he admitted to hospital for any emergency during the last three months. He left for London in November last for treatment after the Lahore High Court allowed him to go abroad on medical grounds for four weeks.

According to Nawaz Sharif’s physician, the top leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is suffering from complex multi-vessel coronary artery disease and substantial ischemic and threatened myocardium for which he is due to undergo surgery.

But Ms. Awan said, “It is time to bring back the VIP prisoner who is having a lavish stay abroad.”

“The government has decided in principle to write a letter this week to the British government, seeking deportation of PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, as he is an absconder not fulfilling the terms and conditions of the bail granted to him on medical grounds,” she on Sunday.

She said Nawaz Sharif left for London on November 19 last year for his treatment but was yet to be admitted to a hospital there, indicating that “it was a fixed match played by him, his party and a section of the media on his health”, paving the way for his departure to London.

Ms. Awan claimed that Sharif and his younger brother Shahbaz had gone to London to protect the businesses of their children.

“Nawaz faked his health condition,” she alleged.

Last week, the Punjab government refused to extend Sharif’s bail, declaring that it had found no “legal, moral or medical ground” necessitating an extension in his stay abroad.

The Lahore High Court had, in October last year, granted bail to Sharif on medical grounds for four weeks, allowing the Punjab government to extend it further in the light of his medical reports.

The Islamabad High Court had also granted bail to Sharif in the Al Azizia Mills corruption case, in which the former Prime Minister was serving a 7-year jail term, clearing his way to travel abroad for medical treatment.

PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal said if Sharif decided to return to the country, the Imran Khan government will request him not to come.

He said the PML-N chief will challenge the government’s decision not to give him extension in his stay abroad in the court shortly.

PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bokhari told the PTI that if Pakistan wrote to the British government for Sharif’s deportation, the PML-N would also write to the U.S. government seeking opening of a case against Prime Minister Imran Khan regarding his [“illegitimate”] child.

She said Sharif was seriously ill and had heart-related complications, adding that the former Prime Minister was going to have a heart procedure shortly.

“Prime Minister Khan and his team should stop playing on the health of Sharif and concentrate on governance matters instead,” Ms. Bokhari said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xa1lvs/article30830137.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PAKISTAN-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-to-request-british-government-for-nawaz-sharifs-deportation/article30964498.ece
17,2020/03/02,COVID-19 | Virus kills member of council advising Iran’s Supreme Leader,"Expediency Council member Mohammad Mirmohammadi died at a Tehran hospital of the virus, state radio said.

A member of a council that advises Iran’s Supreme Leader died on March 2 after falling sick from the new SARS-nCOV, state radio reported, becoming the first top official to succumb to the illness that is affecting members of the Islamic Republic’s leadership.

Expediency Council member Mohammad Mirmohammadi died at a Tehran hospital of the virus, state radio said. He was 71.

The council advises Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as well as settles disputes between the Supreme Leader and Parliament.

Those sick included include Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar, better known as “Sister Mary”, the English-speaking spokeswoman for the students who seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and sparked the 444-day hostage crisis, state media reported. Also sick is Iraj Harirchi, the head of an Iranian government task force on the coronavirus who tried to downplay the virus before falling ill.

Iran has reported 978 confirmed cases of the new virus with 54 deaths from the illness it causes, called COVID-19. Across the wider Mideast, there are over 1,150 cases of the new coronavirus, the majority of which are linked back to Iran.

Also read | Viral economies: On coronavirus impact

Experts worry Iran’s percentage of deaths to infections, around 5.5%, is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be much higher than current figures show.

Trying to stem the outbreak of the new coronavirus, Iran on Monday held an online-only briefing by its Foreign Ministry.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi opened the online news conference addressing the outbreak, dismissing an offer of help for Iran by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

Iran and the U.S. have seen some of the worst tensions since its 1979 Islamic Revolution in recent months, culminating in the American drone strike that killed a top Iranian general in Baghdad and a subsequent Iranian ballistic missile counterattack against U.S. forces.

“We neither count on such help nor are we ready to accept verbal help,” Mr. Mousavi said. He added Iran has always been “suspicious” about America’s intentions and accused the U.S. government of trying to weaken Iranians’ spirits over the outbreak.

The British Embassy meanwhile has begun evacuations over the virus. “Essential staff needed to continue critical work will remain,” the British Foreign Office said. “In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the British Embassy to provide assistance to British nationals from within Iran may be limited.”

While Iran has closed schools and universities to stop the spread of the virus, major Shia shrines have remained open despite civilian authorities calling for them to be closed. The holy cities of Mashhad and Qom in particular, both home to shrines, have been hard-hit by the virus.

Police have arrested one man who posted a video showing himself licking the metal enclosing the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad, the most-important Shia saint buried in the country, according to reports by semiofficial news agencies. In the video, the man said he licked the metal to “allow others to visit the shrine with peace of mind”.

Meanwhile Monday, the virus outbreak saw itself dragged into the yearslong boycott of Qatar by four Arab nations over a political dispute.

A prominent columnist at Dubai’s government-owned Al-Bayan newspaper on Twitter falsely described the virus as being a plot by Qatar to hurt the upcoming Expo 2020 world’s fair in Dubai and Saudi Arabia. Noura al-Moteari later described the tweet as “satire” to after it gained widespread attention.

The Dubai Media Office similarly described the tweet as being written in a “cynical style” while distancing the Arabic-language daily from al-Moteari.

“Noura is a freelance writer and is not an employee of Al-Bayan nor does she represent the publication’s views,” it told the AP. “That being said, this has no relevance to any social media policy being practiced by the publication nor the state.”

The tweet comes after Qatar expressed disappointment Sunday that nearly all of its Gulf neighbors snubbed invitations to attend the weekend peace signing ceremony between the U.S. and the Taliban.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/eqm15j/article30962640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02IRAN-COVID19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-virus-kills-member-of-council-advising-irans-supreme-leader/article30962641.ece
18,2020/03/02,"NRC will not impact Bangladesh, Foreign Secretary Shringla tells Dhaka","The process is entirely internal; there will be no implications for the government and people of Bangladesh: Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) in India will not affect Bangladesh, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said on Monday in Dhaka. Addressing a seminar, the visiting Indian official said that the NRC was rolled out in Assam “entirely at the direction” of the Supreme Court of India.

“Let me clearly state here what our leadership has repeatedly confirmed at the highest level to the government of Bangladesh: this is a process that is entirely internal to India. Therefore, there will be no implications for the government and people of Bangladesh. You have our assurance on that count,” said Mr. Shringla at a seminar organised by the Bangladesh Institute of International and Strategic Studies (BIISS).

Fallout of NRC

Dhaka has in the past expressed concern over the fallout of the NRC, which is aimed at finding undocumented nationals of Bangladesh in India. The NRC process in Assam left nearly two million citizens out of the final NRC list of the State, which was declared on August 31, 2019.

Subsequently, Home Minister Amit Shah’s comments confirming the inevitability of a nationwide NRC and his public proclamations demanding the throwing out of “Bangladeshi infiltrators” had also drawn serious concern from the highest levels in Bangladesh. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina sent a message to India in an interview to a Gulf news outlet in January reiterating that she perceived the NRC as an internal matter for India to deal with.

Mr. Shringla’s current trip, mainly to plan the upcoming visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the centenary celebrations of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, comes in the midst of heightened tension in Dhaka over the recent killing of Muslims in Delhi. The Speaker of Bangladesh’s Jatiyo Sansad, Dr. Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, cancelled her visit to India a day before the Indian Foreign Secretary was to land in Dhaka.

Strong network

Mr. Shringla, who served as India’s envoy to Dhaka between January 2016 to January 2019, is believed to have a strong network of well-wishers in the Bangladesh government, and is expected to meet with Prime Minister Hasina and other notable people during his two-day trip.

The Foreign Secretary also assured Bangladesh that India would be willing to help find a “mutually acceptable” solution to both Bangladesh and Myanmar that would allow the million-plus Rohingya refugees to return home in Myanmar’s Rakhine province from the Chittagong refugee camps.

He acknowledged the iconic role of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in the founding of Bangladesh in 1971 and said the government of India was looking forward to the visit of Prime Minister Modi to the inaugural event of ‘Mujib Barsho’ centenary celebrations on March 17.

The Bangladesh government has invited a large number of international personalities, among them Congress president Sonia Gandhi and former President of India Pranab Mukherjee, for the inaugural event.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pjjy0o/article30962240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARSHVARDHANSHRINGLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nrc-wont-have-implications-on-bangladesh-says-foreign-secretary-shringla/article30962241.ece
19,2020/03/02,Israelis vote in 3rd election in a year,"Netanyahu is desperate to score a narrow 61-seat majority in parliament with his hard-line religious and nationalist allies before heading to trial two weeks later

Israelis began voting Monday in the country’s unprecedented third election in less than a year to decide whether longtime Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stays in power despite his upcoming criminal trial on corruption charges.

Netanyahu, the longest serving leader in Israeli history, has been the caretaker prime minister for more than a year as a divided Israel has weathered two inconclusive elections and a prolonged political paralysis.

With opinion polls forecasting another deadlock, Netanyahu is seeking a late surge in support to score a parliamentary majority along with other nationalist parties that will deliver him a fourth consecutive term in office, and fifth overall.

Also read: Explained | Why is Israel holding its third election in a year?

Both parties appear unable to form a coalition with their traditional allies. With the prospect of a unity government between them seemingly off the table after a particularly nasty campaign, Monday’s vote may well turn into merely a preamble to another election.

There was little fanfare in the days leading up to the vote, with a noticeable absence of campaign posters on the streets and public rallies that typically characterize to run-up to Israeli elections. With voter fatigue clearly a factor, turnout could prove to be decisive. Election day is a national holiday in Israel and the country usually boasts one of the highest voter turnouts among Western democracies. But the three-repeat vote and fears of the new coronavirus, which has so far has been kept largely in check, look to hinder turnout.

Israel set up some 15 stations to allow voting by hundreds of Israelis who have been ordered to remain in home-quarantine after possible exposure to the virus.

Netanyahu is desperate to score a narrow 61-seat majority in parliament with his hard-line religious and nationalist allies before heading to trial two weeks later. Netanyahu has failed to secure himself immunity from prosecution, but with a strong hold on power he could seek other avenues to derail the legal proceedings against him.

Netanyahu goes on trial March 17 for charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust stemming from accusations he accepted lavish gifts from billionaire friends and promised to promote advantageous legislation for a major newspaper in exchange for favorable coverage. He vowed he will prove his innocence in court.

Opinion polls forecast similar results to the previous two stalemates, and the deadlock raises the possibility of a fourth election in quick succession.

20,2020/03/02,COVID-19 | Wuhan closes makeshift hospital as new cases in China drop sharply,"Hubei had 196 new confirmed cases on Sunday, the National Health Commission said on Monday, sharply down from 570 cases a day earlier.

The Chinese city at the centre of the SARS-nCOV epidemic closed its first makeshift hospital, one of 16 hurriedly built to handle the epidemic, after it discharged the last recovered patients, state broadcaster CCTV reported on March 2.

News of the closure coincided with a sharp decline in new cases in Hubei province and the provincial capital Wuhan, but the country remained on alert as Chinese nationals returning home are testing positive for the virus.

China’s central Hubei province, the epicentre of the country’s the SARS-nCOV outbreak, reported less than 200 cases of new infections for the first time since January.

Hubei had 196 new confirmed cases on Sunday, the National Health Commission said on Monday, sharply down from 570 cases a day earlier and the lowest since January 24.

The decline was driven by a fall in new cases in Wuhan, where the virus first appeared last December, which reported 193 new infections, the lowest since January 26.

Mainland China had a total of 202 new confirmed cases, the lowest since January 22. Excluding new infections in Hubei, there were only six new cases in mainland China, the lowest since last month. That brings the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 80,026.

The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China reached 2,912 as of the end of Sunday, up by 42 from the previous day. Hubei accounted for all of the 42 new deaths, while 32 people died in Wuhan.

In line with the falling number of new infections, Wuhan closed its first makeshift hospital after it discharged the last batch of 34 recovered patients, CCTV reported.

As of February 28, Wuhan has created 16 temporary hospitals, adding 13,000 beds, with 12,000 people treated so far. Overall, the number of Wuhan hospital beds have risen from 5,000 to 23,000.

21,2020/03/02,Armed ex-guard holds about 30 hostage in Manila shopping mall,"The mayor of a section of Manila had earlier told journalists that a security guard was holding up to 30 people in an administrative office and had shot at least one person.

Police were in a standoff Monday with a “disgruntled” former security guard who shot at least one person and took about 30 others hostage at a shopping mall in the Philippine capital, officials said.

Workers and customers were evacuated from the V-Mall shopping centre in Manila early Monday after gunshots rang out and officers wielding assault rifles rushed to the scene.

“We have confirmed reports of... a hostage-taking of some of our employees by a former... security guard,” the mall management said in a statement.

The Philippines’ malls are centres of life that include everything from restaurants and shops to churches and medical facilities. The building was full when the violence began.

The mayor of the section of Manila that is home to the mall told reporters the “disgruntled” ex-guard had a pistol and claimed to have a grenade, but that had not been confirmed.

“At present we are unable to determine exactly how many are inside. Our estimate is around 30 people,” said San Juan city mayor Francis Zamora.

He added the hostages were being held in the mall’s administrative offices and at least one person was shot. The victim was rushed to hospital and was in stable condition.

Witness John Paul Buenavista told AFP he saw a wounded person -- believed to be a guard at the mall -- being put into a wheelchair and whisked away.

“We heard three gunshots. Then we saw people running, saying they saw someone getting shot,” he said.

Authorities are negotiating with the hostage taker, who has demanded to speak with other guards and the media.

“We’ll do our best to settle this issue peacefully,” Zamora said, adding the hostage taker was upset over his treatment by his employer.

Manila was the site of a high-profile 2010 hostage taking that ended in the deaths of eight tourists from Hong Kong.

That day-long ordeal started when an ex-police officer, armed with an M-16 assault rifle, hijacked a bus near Rizal Park, a popular tourist destination just a few blocks from police headquarters, in a desperate bid to get his job back.

Negotiations broke down after nightfall when the ex-officer began shooting passengers, prompting commandos to lob tear gas inside the bus before storming it and firing dozens of bullets into the vehicle.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e09x8t/article30458480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BreakNews,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/police-respond-to-reported-mass-hostage-taking-at-manila-mall/article30961642.ece

Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on March 2 two Indonesians had tested positive for SARS-nCOV after being in contact with an infected Japanese national, marking the first confirmed cases in the world’s fourth most populous country.

The two had been hospitalised in Jakarta, Mr. Widodo told reporters at the presidential palace in the capital.

The President said a 64-year-old woman and her 31-year-old daughter had tested positive after being in contact with a Japanese national who lived in Malaysia and had tested positive after returning from a trip to Indonesia.

Likening the U.S.-Taliban agreement at Doha to the long awaited release of a film, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said India is “watching the space” closely to ensure that gains of the last two decades are not lost.

“[The agreement] has been talked about for so long it is almost like finally seeing Pakeezah after 17 trailers,” Mr. Jaishankar said, referring to the 1972 Hindi film, which took 15 years to complete.

Gains at stake

“How it plays out, only time will tell…This is not the Afghanistan of 2001. To the United States and the West, our message is that the achievements of the last 18 years should be protected and not jeopardised,” he added.

While India has raised concerns over the future of democracy, human rights, women’s rights and other achievements made in Afghanistan since 2001, when the Taliban regime was last defeated, the issues were not addressed in the agreement between the U.S. and Taliban signed by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey on February 29. The agreement provides a timetable for withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan by May 2021 and an intra-Afghan dialogue in March 2020.

Speaking at the Centre for Policy Research’s “Dialogue 2020”, in conversation with former Foreign Secretary Shyam Saran, Mr. Jaishankar also said he believed the “real negotiations” would only begin now — a possible reference to the Intra-Afghan dialogue due to begin on March 10, as well as a Pakistan-Afghanistan dialogue facilitated by Washington on securing borders and ending terror safe havens.

“How cohesive are the various players... does the Taliban join the democratic set up, or will the democratic set up have to adjust to the Taliban...We are all watching this space,” the Minister said.

Delhi cautious

India stopped short of welcoming the U.S.-Taliban and U.S. -Afghanistan agreements announced on Saturday, texts of which were widely distributed in the media. According to an MEA statement, India “noted that the entire political spectrum in Afghanistan... has welcomed the opportunity and hope for peace and stability generated by these agreements.”

In sharp contrast, India had welcomed and congratulated President Ghani on winning the recently-held elections in Afghanistan. The U.S.-Taliban agreement does not indicate what the future of the Ghani government will be, describing instead a “new post-settlement Islamic Afghanistan government”, which has also been noted with concern by experts in India.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/b3jvw3/article30961528.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02JAISHANKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-taliban-agreement-is-like-long-awaited-pakeezah-release-says-jaishankar/article30961529.ece
24,2020/03/02,UN delegation on Palestine arrives in India to seek support on peaceful resolution of conflict,"India, which shares good relations with both Palestine and Israel, believes in a two-state solution in which both Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist peacefully.

A UN delegation on Palestine will visit New Delhi to seek India’s political and diplomatic support for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing conflict between Israel and Palestine.

India, which shares good relations with both Palestine and Israel, believes in a two-state solution in which both Israel and a future Palestinian state coexist peacefully.

The two-state solution envisions independent Israeli and Palestinian states coexisting side by side peacefully. The Palestinians see East Jerusalem as their future capital.

The delegation of the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP) will meet External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and senior officials in the ministry, as well as political leaders and think tanks during the 2-day visit from Monday.

The delegation intends to engage India in looking for ways how it could play a more proactive role in the settling of the question of Palestine, an official statement said.

The visit would also focus to enhance the coordination of the Committee Bureau and India on capacity building projects for Palestine, including within the context of South-South and Triangular Cooperation, it said.

The focus of the visit is on enhancing the political and diplomatic support of India for a peaceful solution of the question of Palestine and engaging Indian counterparts on synergies in capacity building for staff and institutions of Palestine, the statement said.

The delegation will include UN ambassadors and representatives of Senegal (Committee Chair); Indonesia and Malaysia (Committee Members); and the State of Palestine (Committee Observer).

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had visited Israel in July 2017 to commemorate 25 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries, becoming the first Indian Premier to do so.

During his visit to Israel, Mr. Modi did not travel to Ramallah. His standalone visit to Israel had led many analysts to question the future of the Indo-Palestine ties.

In February 2018, Mr. Modi made a historic visit to Palestine and skipped Israel, in a clear message that India is de-hyphenating its ties with Israel and Palestine.

The CEIRPP was founded on November 10, 1975 by the United Nations General Assembly in order to formulate a programme to enable the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination, to national independence and sovereignty, and the right of Palestine refugees to return.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/483345/article30816846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13-KALLOL-JaiGI4745OEF10jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-delegation-on-palestine-arrives-in-india-to-seek-support-on-peaceful-resolution-of-conflict/article30961359.ece
25,2020/03/02,N.Korea fires unidentified projectile: S.Korea defence ministry,"Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the launches in a statement but couldn’t immediately confirm how far the projectiles flew or whether the weapons were ballistic or rocket artillery.

North Korea fired two unidentified projectiles from a coastal area Monday as it resumed weapons demonstrations following a months-long hiatus.

The launches came two days after North Korea’s state media said leader Kim Jong Un supervised an artillery drill aimed at testing the combat readiness of units in front-line and eastern areas.

Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed the launches in a statement but couldn’t immediately confirm how far the projectiles flew or whether the weapons were ballistic or rocket artillery.

During a key ruling party meeting in late December, Mr. Kim expressed deep frustration over deadlocked diplomacy with the United States and said he won’t denuclearize if the U.S. persists with its hostile policy on his country. He also said he would unveil a new “strategic weapon” soon and no longer be bound by a self-imposed weapons test moratorium that coincided with his diplomacy with Mr. Trump.

Nuclear diplomacy between North Korea and the U.S. has largely stalled since the breakdown of Mr. Kim’s second summit with Mr. Trump in February 2019 in Vietnam. That summit collapsed because Mr. Trump rejected Mr. Kim’s demands for broad sanctions relief in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited disarmament step. Subsequent talks between Pyongyang and Washington reported little progress.

After the failed Hanoi summit, North Korea carried out a slew of short-range missile and other weapons tests. Mr. Trump downplayed them saying there were short-range weapons that didn’t pose a direct threat to the U.S. mainland.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9ggfzr/article30326341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NORTHKOREAUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nkorea-fires-unidentified-projectile-skorea-defence-ministry/article30961120.ece
26,2020/03/02,U.S. judge rules naming official to temporarily head immigration agency unlawful,"U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss in Washington ruled Ken Cuccinelli's appointment violated a 1998 law governing how vacancies in senior government positions may be filled until the U.S. Senate confirms a new permanent choice.

A U.S. judge on Sunday ruled the Trump administration did not act lawfully when it named a former Virginia attorney general as the acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and invalidated some new asylum directives.

U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss in Washington ruled Ken Cuccinelli's appointment violated a 1998 law governing how vacancies in senior government positions may be filled until the U.S. Senate confirms a new permanent choice.

Judge Moss said Mr. Cuccinelli's appointment would relieve the president “of responsibility and accountability for selecting acting officials” and could essentially allow the executive brand to fill many senior jobs “with nearly anyone” by simply creating a new position after a vacancy.

Last year five Honduran asylum seekers and the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services sued to challenge the lawfulness of asylum directives issued under Mr. Cuccinelli.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman Heather Swift said in an e-mail “we obviously disagree with the courts opinion and are looking more closely at it.” The Justice Department did not immediately comment.

Judge Moss' ruling said only the five asylum seekers who sued were entitled to new proceedings before USCIS and he declined to extend relief to others who had been denied asylum or ordered removed under Mr. Cuccinelli's directives.

Cuccinelli, who is performing the duties of deputy director of DHS, assumed the USCIS job as acting director through a series of moves.

After USCIS director L. Francis Cissna resigned in June 2019, his deputy director, Mark Koumans, assumed the post as director, as required under law, Judge Moss said.

DHS's acting head Kevin McAleenan then appointed Mr. Cuccinelli to serve in the newly created position as principal deputy USCIS director.

McAleenan, who has since resigned, also revised the order of succession at USCIS to place Cuccinelli's job ahead of Mr. Koumans, allowing Mr. Cuccinelli to take over as acting director.

Three weeks after taking office, Mr. Cuccinelli issued a revised policy for scheduling credible-fear interviews in expedited removal proceedings.

Mr. Cuccinelli's directive reduced time for asylum seekers to consult with others before their credible-fear interviews from 48 or 72 hours to “one full calendar day from the date of arrival at a detention facility” and prohibited asylum officers from granting asylum seekers extensions to prepare “except in the most extraordinary of circumstances.”

John Lewis, senior counsel at Washington-based advocacy group Democracy Forward, said the “decision raises serious questions about the lawfulness of other actions Cuccinelli has undertaken - or may yet undertake - and we and others will be looking at them closely.”

Much of DHS is still being run by acting officials, including the top person, chief of staff, general counsel, as is the top official at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9uu79o/article30960855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-judge-rules-naming-official-to-temporarily-head-immigration-agency-unlawful/article30960857.ece
27,2020/03/02,"COVID-19: Global death toll passes 3,000","The U.S. and Australia reported their first fatalities over the weekend, while infections nearly doubled in the past 48 hours in Italy

The number of deaths globally in the new coronavirus outbreak passed 3,000 on Monday, as China reported more 42 deaths.

The new fatalities were all in the virus epicentre Hubei province, the National Health Commission said, bringing the overall toll in mainland China to 2,912. Health officials also reported the lowest daily tally of fresh infections since late January, with 202 new cases.

In China, the number of reported new cases has gradually been declining, and there were only six confirmed new infections outside Hubei. The virus emerged late last year in Hubei in central China, but has now spread to more than 60 countries around the world.

The United States and Australia reported their first fatalities over the weekend, while infections nearly doubled in the past 48 hours in Italy, Europe's hardest-hit country.

The World Health Organization said Sunday that the virus appears to particularly hit those over the age of 60 and people already weakened by other illness.

The agency noted that most people with the COVID-19 illness only experience mild symptoms, while around 14% suffer severe disease like pneumonia and five percent become critically ill. It said the mortality rate in the outbreak appears to be between 2 and 5%.

22 deaths in South Korea

South Korea reported nearly 500 new coronavirus cases Monday, sending the largest national total in the world outside China past 4,000. Four more people had died, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, taking the toll to 22.

The figures are expected to rise further as authorities carry out checks on more than 260,000 people associated with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.

28,2020/03/02,COVID-19: Amazon confirms two employees in Italy have contracted the virus,"“Were supporting the affected employees who were in Milan and are now in quarantine,” company spokesman Dan Perlet said.

Amazon.com Inc said late on Sunday that two employees in Milan, Italy, have contracted the coronavirus and are under quarantine.

“Were supporting the affected employees who were in Milan and are now in quarantine,” company spokesman Dan Perlet said.

The world's biggest online retailer said it was unaware of any U.S. employees who had contracted the virus. On Friday, Amazon told employees to stop non-essential travel, within the United States and beyond. The company also confirmed on Sunday it is moving some recruiting interviews to video rather than in person.

The United States on Saturday hiked its travel advisory and urged U.S. citizens not to travel to the Veneto and Lombardy regions of Italy because of the coronavirus outbreak. Milan is the capital of the Lombardy region.

The New York Times reported the Amazon employees contracting the coronavirus earlier on Sunday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ia2zsa/article30827779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th27-BINDU-LANCGA271L4VR3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/amazon-confirms-two-employees-in-italy-have-contracted-coronavirus/article30960803.ece
29,2020/03/02,COVID-19 | New York confirms first virus case; U.S. ramps up preparations,"A woman in her 30s contracted coronavirus and was in quarantine in her home, Governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted

New York state confirmed its first positive coronavirus test, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Sunday night, as the U.S. government said it would start screening travelers for the virus and hike production of protective masks.

Mr. Cuomo said on Twitter that a woman in her 30s contracted coronavirus during a recent trip to Iran and was in quarantine in her home. He did not say where the woman lived.

“The patient has respiratory symptoms, but is not in serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving in New York,” Cuomo said.

At the federal level, President Donald Trump's administration scrambled on Sunday to reassure Americans as the disease spreads and businesses cancel conferences and flights.

Administration officials tried to calm market fears that the coronavirus could cause a global recession, saying the public had overreacted and that stocks would bounce back because of the underlying strength of the U.S. economy.

The first American died from coronavirus, a man in his 50s with underlying conditions in Washington state, officials said on Saturday. They still do not know how he contracted the disease.

The state on Sunday confirmed two other cases and locked down a long-term care facility where a resident and a worker also tested positive for coronavirus and 50 residents and staff are showing symptoms.

Over 70 cases have been reported in the United States, with most on the West Coast but new cases in the Chicago area and Rhode Island, aside from New York.

Stock markets plunged last week, with an index of global stocks setting its largest weekly fall since the 2008 financial crisis, and more than $5 trillion wiped off the value of stocks worldwide.

A key energy conference in Houston that brings together oil ministers and energy firms was canceled on Sunday with the organizers of CERAWeek noting that border health checks were becoming more restrictive and companies had begun barring non-essential travel to protect workers.

A world economy conference with Pope Francis due to take place in Italy later this month was also canceled.

'We’re Ready'

Mr. Trump said on Sunday that travelers to the United States from countries at high risk of coronavirus would be screened before boarding and on arrival, without specifying which countries.

Delta Air Lines Inc said on Sunday it was suspending until May flights to Milan in northern Italy where most of that country's coronavirus cases have been reported. Flights will continue to Rome. American Airlines Group Inc announced a similar move late on Saturday.

The United States has 75,000 test kits for coronavirus and will expand that number “radically” in coming weeks, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday.

Vice President Mike Pence said the government had contracted 3M Co to produce an extra 35 million respiratory masks a month. He urged Americans not to buy the masks, which he said were only needed by healthcare workers. Honeywell International Inc is the other major U.S. mask producer.

He also told Fox News that clinical trials of a coronavirus vaccine would start in six weeks but that a vaccine would likely not be available this season.

Democrats, who will challenge Mr. Trump for the presidency in the November 3 election, have criticized his administration for downplaying the crisis and not preparing for the disease to spread in the United States.

Mr. Pence, whom Mr. Trump appointed last week to run the White House's coronavirus response, said Americans should brace for more cases but that the “vast majority” of those who contracted the disease would recover.

“Other than in areas where there are individuals that have been infected with the coronavirus, people need to understand that for the average American, the risk does remain low. We're ready,” Mr. Pence told NBC's “Meet the Press.”

The United States has imposed limits on travelers who have visited Iran and recommended against travel to hard-hit areas of Italy and South Korea.

Mr. Trump said on Saturday that the United States was also considering shutting the country's southern border with Mexico to control the spread of the virus, adding: “We hope we won't have to do that.”

Mexico has reported four coronavirus cases. Its Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that both governments were in “close and effective communication, especially the health authorities.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/urbg93/article30960793.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NYVIRUSSCENE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-new-york-confirms-first-virus-case-us-ramps-up-preparations/article30960794.ece
30,2020/03/02,U.S. Presidential Election 2020: Pete Buttigieg dropping out of race,"Buttigieg took centre stage when securing a narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses

Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay U.S. presidential candidate from a major party, on Sunday ended his campaign to be the Democratic nominee in the November election against Donald Trump, U.S. media said.

The 38-year-old had risen rapidly from being a virtual unknown to becoming a national political figure, but he scored poorly in the latest primary in South Carolina, coming fourth with just eight per cent.

He was scheduled to address supporters later Sunday in South Bend, Indiana, where he was previously the mayor.

Buttigieg took centre stage when securing a narrow victory in the Iowa caucuses and earned national attention for his unflustered and professional approach in an often bitter Democratic nomination race.

But his showing in South Carolina on Saturday confirmed polls suggesting he struggled to attract support among black voters -- a key demographic.

With 48 per cent of the vote in South Carolina, the former vice president more than doubled the 20 per cent won by national frontrunner Bernie Sanders, reviving Biden’s campaign and positioning him as the leftist senator’s main rival.

Trump responded rapidly on Twitter, claiming that the Democratic party leadership would act to halt Sanders winning.

“Pete Buttigieg is OUT. All of his SuperTuesday votes will go to Sleepy Joe Biden. Great timing. This is the REAL beginning of the Dems taking Bernie out of play,” Trump wrote.

33,2020/03/02,Iraqi prime minister candidate Allawi quits as vacuum looms,"Allawi's appointment was meant to ease a crisis as the Shi'ite-led country faces a mass protest movement that broke out in October and brought down Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi

Iraqi Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Allawi withdrew his candidacy for the post on Sunday, accusing political parties of obstructing him, deepening a domestic crisis and threatening an unprecedented power vacuum.

His move came hours after parliament failed for the second time in a week to approve his cabinet amid political infighting in the oil producer, where mass protests and deadlock between lawmakers are delaying Iraq's recovery from years of war.

Allawi's appointment was meant to ease a crisis as the Shi'ite-led country faces a mass protest movement that broke out in October and brought down Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi.

President Barham Salih will begin consultations to choose a new candidate for a new prime minister within 15 days, the state news agency said. But Iraq could end up without a prime minister in the meantime if Abdul Mahdi, who stayed on in a caretaker capacity, also quits on Monday.

He issued a statement late on Sunday denying social media reports that he wanted to stay on, saying he would announce his intentions on Monday, which would have been the last day for Allawi to get his proposed Cabinet approved by parliament.

Salih appointed Allawi after squabbling lawmakers from rival parties failed for two months to decide on a successor to Abdul Mahdi, who resigned in November during mass unrest. Allawi had one month to form a government that was meant to organise early elections.

“I tried by all possible means to save Iraq from drifting to the unknown and to solve the current crisis, but during negotiations I faced many matters,” Allawi said in a statement, accusing politicians he did not identify of not being serious about reforms.

Highlighting volatile security, two blasts could be heard in central Baghdad early on Monday morning, with two Katyusha rockets hitting the heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and embassies, security sources said.

One missile landed near the U.S. Embassy but caused no casualties, the sources said.

The protests, which initially demanded jobs and services, quickly turned into calls for the removal of Iraqs entire ruling elite. Protesters had opposed Allawi because they view him as part of the system they want to bring down.

Security forces and powerful militia groups have fatally shot hundreds of mostly unarmed demonstrators. Around 500 people have been killed in unrest since October, most of them protesters, according to a Reuters tally from medics and police.

On Sunday, security forces killed one person and wounded 24 at an anti-government protest in Baghdad, a police source said.

Government officials say Allawis Cabinet selection was heavily influenced by renegade Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has gained from the general chaos in Iraq after the United States killed a senior Iranian commander in Baghdad in January.

Sadr said in a statement he supported Allawi for his decision to withdraw his candidacy and criticized the parties who obstructed him.

34,2020/03/02,COVID-19 | Washington nursing home on lockdown after two cases of virus found; two other confirmed,"Officials said the two latest cases involved men in their 60s with underlying medical issues

A nursing home near Seattle is locked down after a resident and a worker were found to have the coronavirus, officials at the home said, and two other cases in the area were confirmed on Sunday.

Officials with King County Public Health said the two latest cases involved men in their 60s with underlying medical issues. Both were listed in critical condition, one at Valley Medical Center, and the other at Virginia Mason Medical Center.

Separately, officials at the Life Care Center of Kirkland said in a statement late on Saturday that it was not accepting new patients or allowing visitors, family or vendors into the facility while officials focus on the health of the current residents and staff.

The two cases, announced on Saturday by Washington state officials, involved a worker who is in her 40s and in satisfactory condition and a 70-year-old woman who lived there and is in serious condition.

State officials said an additional 27 residents of the nursing home and 25 staff members were reporting symptoms of the virus, which can be similar to that of the common flu.

“Concerned family members or responsible parties may call our facility,” the statement said. “The facility is currently placing a hold on admissions as well to fully focus on our current residents and associates.”

A representative for the nursing home could not be reached by Reuters on Sunday for further comment.

The nursing home said members of its corporate clinical team were on site to provide assistance and that the home was in contact with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Washington Health Department.

On Saturday, officials said a Washington state man in his 50s with underlying health issues became the United States' first fatality from the coronavirus.

The patient, who was chronically ill before contracting COVID-19, died at EvergreenHealth Hospital in Kirkland, near Seattle, and officials are unsure how he was exposed to the virus, said Jeffrey Duchin, head of the Washington state Health Department's communicable disease unit.

35,2020/03/02,COVID-19 | Nigeria contacts 100 people who may have been exposed to virus patient,"The case, the first in sub-Saharan Africa, has prompted fears the virus could spread quickly in Lagos

Nigerian authorities have contacted around 100 people who may have been exposed to an Italian man who is the country's first coronavirus patient, a Lagos state official said on Sunday, in a bid to stop an outbreak in Africa's most populous country.

The case, the first in sub-Saharan Africa, has prompted fears the virus could spread quickly in Lagos. The densely populated commercial capital of 20 million people is the biggest city in a country of some 200 million inhabitants.

Health experts are concerned about an outbreak in a region where health systems are already overburdened with cases of malaria, measles, Ebola and other infectious diseases.

The Italian man arrived in Lagos on Feb. 24 from Milan on a Turkish Airlines flight that had a connection in Istanbul. The following day he travelled to neighbouring Ogun state and was in the country for almost two full days before being isolated.

Asked in a telephone interview about the number of people Nigerian authorities had been in touch with who may have had contact with the man, Lagos state Health Commissioner Akin Abayomi said: “It is around 100 people but that number is increasing every minute.”

The patient works as a vendor for cement company Lafarge Africa Plc in the southwestern state of Ogun.

“The number is going up all the time as we find people who were on the flight. We found people who were on the journey to Ogun, in contact with him at the factory and people at the hotel,” Abayomi said.

Health Minister Osagie Ehanire, speaking on Nigerian TV, said the man was responding to treatment and seemed to be “on the way to recovery”.

President Muhammadu Buhari's spokesman, in a statement issued late on Sunday, called for calm.

36,2020/03/02,Syrian soldiers killed in Turkish drone strikes: monitor,"Turkish drone strikes in Syria's Idlib province killed 19 regime soldiers on Sunday, a war monitor reported, as tensions soared between Damascus and Ankara.

The 19 died in strikes on a military convoy in the Jabal al-Zawiya area and a base near Maaret al-Numan city, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

The report came hours after Turkey shot down two Syrian warplanes, in an escalating offensive against the Damascus regime in the country's northwestern province of Idlib.

Following weeks of violence in and around Idlib, Turkey confirmed the launch of a full military operation against Russian-backed Syrian forces after 34 Turkish soldiers died last week in an air strike blamed on Damascus.

Tensions have intensified between rebel backer Turkey and the regime's main ally Moscow, but Ankara has insisted it does not want to clash directly with Russian forces.

The Syrian regime has vowed to retake the last opposition enclave in a nine-year civil war.

Ankara has also pressured Europe over the conflict by opening its border for migrants already in Turkey to cross into the continent.

The confrontation between Syrian forces and NATO-member Turkey has prompted worries over a wider conflict and a migrant crisis in Europe similar to that of 2015.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/syrian-soldiers-killed-in-turkish-drone-strikes-monitor/article30959397.ece
37,2020/03/02,Migrants clash with Greek police at border after Turkey opens floodgates,"It was the second straight day of clashes at the border crossing by the northeastern Greek town of Kastanies in which police drove back approaching migrants with volleys of tear gas

Greek police fired tear gas to repel hundreds of stone-throwing migrants who sought to force their way across the border from Turkey on Sunday, witnesses said, with thousands more behind them after Ankara relaxed curbs on their movement.

It was the second straight day of clashes at the border crossing by the northeastern Greek town of Kastanies in which police drove back approaching migrants with volleys of tear gas.

Video footage provided by a Greek government source and seen by Reuters showed riot police being pelted with teargas north of a border fence running through fields in the area, in what appeared to be from Turkish territory.

Greece placed its borders on maximum-security footing earlier on Sunday after hundreds of other migrants used porous crossing points to enter the country.

At least 600 people had arrived by sea on the Greek islands of Lesbos, Chios and Samos close to the Turkish coast within a few hours on Sunday morning, police said.

Along the northeastern mainland border, some migrants waded across a shallow section of the Evro River to the Greek side. Witnesses said there were groups of up to 30, including an Afghan mother with a five-day-old infant, by the side of a road after having forded the river.

The clashes occurred later in the day at the Kastanies crossing after riot police reinforced security there. No further details were immediately available as police were escorting reporters away from the scene, citing safety considerations.

A Greek government source said some migrants blocked from crossing had also thrown metal bars and hand-held tear gas canisters at police on the Greek side.

Turkey said on Thursday it would no longer restrain hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers in its territory from reaching Europe, their preferred destination, despite a commitment to do so under a deal reached with the European Union in 2016.

Turkey's turnabout came after an air strike killed 33 Turkish soldiers in northwest Syria where Ankara has deployed forces in support of rebels and to help secure its border against a new influx of refugees from the Syrian civil war.

Turkey has said funds promised by the EU to help it deal with 3.7 million Syrian refugees already in the country has been slow to arrive. Ankara had threatened several times in the past to open the floodgates if it did not receive more support.

The EU, its relations with Turkey tense over President Tayyip Erdogan's crackdown on dissent and hydrocarbon drilling off Cyprus, scrambled to respond to the new migrant crisis.

Officials at EU headquarters in Brussels called for emergency meetings of migration and foreign ministers to decide next steps, while EU border agency Frontex said it was in talks with Greece to help it guard the bloc's external frontier.

Rush to greek border

The announcement by Turkey, which is not an EU member, that it had stopped containing migrants within the country triggered an almost instant rush to the border it shares with Greece.

The crisis poses the toughest test for Greece since 2015 when it came precariously close to bailing out of the euro zone, and also brings into focus longstanding tensions with Turkey.

An automated text message sent to mobile phones in the northern border areas of Greece said the country had increased its security to a maximum, urging people not to attempt to enter.

Greece's Skai TV said Greeks were using loudspeakers in the Kastanies border area to tell migrants, in English and Arabic, that they were not welcome: “The Borders are Shut!”

Greece was the main gateway for hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers into Europe in 2015-16. More than 40,000 migrants are stuck on the Aegean islands, living in severely overcrowded camps and filthy conditions.

Greece has said it will not allow another mass influx of migrants. “This country is not a free-for-all,” Migration Minister Notis Mittarachi told Greece's Ant1 TV.

Greece accuses turkey

A Greek government source put the number of people gathered on the Turkish side of the border on Sunday at 3,000, while the International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated the number at 13,000.

“Yesterday there were 9,600 attempts to violate our borders, and all were dealt with successfully,” deputy defence minister Alkiviadis Stefanis told Skai TV.

“Not only are they not stopping them, but they are helping them,” he added. Greece has accused Turkey of actively guiding migrants to breach its borders.

On the island of Lesbos, a small group of Greeks attempted to prevent a dinghy full of migrants from coming in to berth at a harbour. “Go back to Turkey” a group of hooded individuals shouted.

Last week, there were clashes on Lesbos between riot police and locals protesting over a plan to create closed detention centres to house the migrant population. Local residents say the islands are carrying a disproportionate burden.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a9ejnr/article30959093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXGREECETURKEYMIGRANTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/migrants-clash-with-greek-police-at-border-after-turkey-opens-floodgates/article30959094.ece
38,2020/03/02,"COVID-19 | Virus deaths rise in Italy, government prepares economic support","Italy's Civil Protection Agency said the cumulative number of confirmed cases of the virus had jumped to 1,694 from 1,128 on Saturday

The death toll from an outbreak of COVID-19 in Italy has risen to 34, five more than a day earlier, officials said on Sunday, as the government prepared to boost spending to help the fragile economy.

The head of Italy's Civil Protection Agency said the cumulative number of confirmed cases of the virus had jumped to 1,694 from 1,128 on Saturday, virtually all of them coming to light since Feb. 20 in the worst such contagion in Europe.

Of that number, 83 people had fully recovered, while 140 patients were in intensive care. The vast majority of those who have tested positive have few, if any symptoms.

Around 90% of all cases are concentrated in the wealthy northern regions of Lombardy, Veneto and Emilia Romagna. The government has ordered that schools and universities must remain closed there for a second week, with large public gatherings still banned in an effort to halt the contagion.

As the human toll grows, the government is increasingly worried about the economic outlook. Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri announced the cabinet would approve this week 3.6 billion euros ($3.5 billion) of measures to help companies.

This came on top of an aid-package worth 900 million euros that was unveiled on Friday for the worst-impacted zones.

“I want to reassure Italians that we are well aware of the problems and dangers,” Mr. Gualtieri said, adding that if additional help was needed it would have to come at a European level.

Opposition politicians said the proposals were far too limited, with the head of the far-right League, Matteo Salvini, demanding “at least 20 billion euros” of additional spending.

Flights cut

One of the hardest hit sectors is likely to be tourism, which accounts for 13% of gross domestic product, with hotels reporting mass cancellations even in cities with few or no coronavirus cases, such as Rome.

Underscoring the challenges, Turkey on Sunday banned all flights to and from Italy, while both the United States and Japan advised their citizens not to travel to swathes of the north, including tourist hotspots like Venice and Verona.

Cinemas, discos and theatres, including Milan's prestigious La Scala opera house, must remain shuttered in the three hardest-hit regions for a further week, while museums will be allowed to reopen to a limited number of visitors.

For the first time, a church in the heart of Rome announced that it was closing as a precautionary measure after a priest who had been working there came down with the virus.

The St. Louis of the French in Piazza Navona is particularly popular with tourists because it houses paintings by Caravaggio.

A Roman Catholic news agency said the 43-year-old priest had returned to Paris by car in the middle of February and tested positive for the virus on Friday. Only two cases of the disease have come to light so far in Rome — two Chinese tourists in January — and it was not clear where the priest was infected.

Pope Francis said on Sunday he had a cold and would have to skip a week-long Lenten spiritual retreat for the first time in his papacy. The Vatican has played down speculation he might have coronavirus, saying he only had a “slight indisposition”.

The contagion has also hit the sporting world, forcing the cancellation this weekend of five top flight Serie A matches, which followed a similar disruption last week.

The chief executive of Inter Milan, which is vying for the Serie A title, warned on Sunday that the season might not finish at all if any more matches are postponed.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-virus-deaths-rise-in-italy-government-prepares-economic-support/article30958855.ece
39,2020/03/02,"Democrats Biden, Sanders brawl as U.S. Super Tuesday contests loom","Mr. Sanders’ surging campaign and calls for a political revolution have rattled a Democratic Party establishment worried that he is too far to the left to beat Mr. Trump in the Nov. 3 U.S. election

Joe Biden, fresh off his first victory in the 2020 Democratic U.S. presidential race, traded barbs with front-runner Bernie Sanders on Sunday before the Super Tuesday contests that could reshape the campaign to pick the party’s challenger to Republican President Donald Trump.

Strong support from African-American voters carried Mr. Biden to a resounding victory Saturday in South Carolina’s nominating contest, leading the former vice president to assert himself as a viable moderate alternative to self-described democratic socialist Sanders, an independent U.S. senator from Vermont.

Mr. Sanders’ surging campaign and calls for a political revolution have rattled a Democratic Party establishment worried that he is too far to the left to beat Mr. Trump in the Nov. 3 U.S. election. Strong performances by Mr. Sanders in the first three contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada catapulted him to front-runner status.

On Sunday, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders portrayed themselves as the only candidate who could attract liberals, moderates and independents to defeat Mr. Trump.

“I think the Democratic Party is looking for a Democrat - not a socialist, not a former Republican, a Democrat - to be their nominee and to bring the country together in a way that I’ve been able to do my whole career,” Mr. Biden said.

Mr. Biden’s reference to a former Republican appears to have been aimed at billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who skipped the first four state contests but has blanketed the nation with half a billion dollars in advertising.

Mr. Sanders countered that he has been voting with Democrats for 30 years in Congress and said his small-donor campaign draws support from members of all parties, including Republicans.

He attacked Mr. Biden for taking contributions from political organizations called Super PACs and billionaires, courting wealthy donors at what he said was the expense of working-class, middle-class and low-income people.

“I don’t go to rich people’s homes like Joe Biden,” Mr. Sanders said.

Mr. Biden is among the Democratic contenders set to help mark the 55th anniversary of a landmark civil rights march Sunday in Alabama, one of 14 states holding contests on Tuesday in the race to pick a challenger to face Trump on Nov. 3.

Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar will commemorate the anniversary of “Bloody Sunday,” when civil rights marchers were beaten by state troopers and local police while crossing a bridge in Selma.

The South Carolina win resurrected Mr. Biden’s struggling campaign in the state-by-state battle for the Democratic nomination, but he lags Mr. Sanders in fundraising and organization in Super Tuesday states and beyond.

Mr. Biden called the nomination battle a “marathon” and said he was in for the long haul.

“Super Tuesday’s not the end, it’s only the beginning,” Mr. Biden said.

Mr. Sanders planned to campaign on Sunday in heavily Democratic California, the biggest prize on Super Tuesday. Mr. Sanders leads opinion polls in California, where 3 million early votes have already been cast.

Mr. Biden won overwhelmingly in South Carolina, drawing 48% of the votes cast compared to 20% for Mr. Sanders. Edison Research exit polls showed Mr. Biden with 61% of African-American support there to Mr. Sanders’ 17%. After a third-place finish in South Carolina, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer exited the race.

Big bucks

Mr. Biden reported raising $5 million in the past 24 hours and his campaign on Sunday added to a growing number of endorsements from establishment Democrats, including U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a former Democratic National Committee chairwoman.

Mr. Biden got another boost before the march with the endorsement of Selma’s mayor, Darrio Melton.

Mr. Sanders leads in the overall national delegate count with 56 and Mr. Biden is second with 51, with another seven South Carolina delegates yet to be allocated. A candidate will need at least 1,991 delegates to win the nomination outright at the party’s convention in July.

The Sanders campaign quickly tried to get back the momentum after South Carolina, announcing it had raised $46.5 million from more than 2.2 million donations in February, a huge sum that dwarfed what any other Democratic candidate had raised last year in any three-month period.

Mr. Biden’s February haul was $18 million. Warren, who struggled to a fifth-place finish in South Carolina, raised more than $29 million in February.

The Sanders campaign announced a new wave of television advertisements in nine states that will hold primary contests on March 10 and March 17.

Following his South Carolina victory, Mr. Biden was endorsed by Terry McAuliffe, a former Virginia governor and former Democratic National Committee chairman, and Bobby Scott, an influential African-American U.S. congressman from Virginia.

At least five states - Alabama, North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas and Virginia - have big blocs of African-American voters that could help Mr. Biden.

Mr. Bloomberg, meanwhile, continues to spend.

40,2020/03/02,"No need to involve U.S. to resolve bilateral issues, Pakistan tells Afghanistan","Pakistan and Afghanistan have been at loggerheads for years with Kabul publicly blaming Pakistan for harbouring Taliban leaders after they were ousted from power Afghanistan in 2001

Any reservations Afghanistan has with Islamabad should be resolved bilaterally rather than involving the United States, Pakistans foreign minister said on Sunday, in reference to part of a joint U.S.-Afghan declaration on peace efforts.

The declaration was announced on Saturday by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg at a ceremony to coincide with the signing in Doha of an agreement between the Taliban and the United States.

“The United States commits to facilitate discussions between Afghanistan and Pakistan to work out arrangements to ensure neither countrys security is threatened by actions from the territory of the other side,” one of the clauses of the declaration reads.

Pakistan bristled

“They should talk directly to Pakistan. The U.S. is planning to withdraw and we will always remain neighbours, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told Reuters in an interview, referring to Washington's intent to withdraw troops from Afghanistan.

“If I have an issue with Afghanistan, I will not ask Washington to play a role.”

Pakistan and Afghanistan have been at loggerheads for years. Kabul publicly blames Pakistan for harbouring Taliban leaders after they were ousted from power Afghanistan in 2001, and allowing safe havens for attacks against international and Afghan forces.

Islamabad has denied these allegations and blames Afghanistan for giving anti-Pakistan militants refuge to plot attacks in Pakistan, which, in turn, Kabul denies.

“You know a trust deficit has existed and Pakistan has done its best to bridge that trust deficit,” Mr. Qureshi said, adding there are institutionalized mechanisms through which Afghanistan can raise “any issue under the sun” instead of turning to the United States.

He said that the U.S.-Taliban agreement in Doha would never have happened if Pakistan had not convinced everyone that there was no military solution to the 18-year conflict in Afghanistan.

The Doha agreement was signed by U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Abdul Ghani Baradar.

Under it, Washington committed to a full withdrawal in 14 months, and to working with allied international forces to do the same contingent on the Taliban keeping a pledge to renounce violence and sever ties with militant organisations threatening the Untied States and its allies.

Facilitation Role

Mr. Qureshi said Pakistan had facilitated the accord by persuading both the Taliban and the United States to find a political settlement, adding that getting both sides to see this had not been easy.

“We convinced the Taliban to put forward an authoritative delegation that has the capacity to implement what they agree upon, and that wouldn’t have happened without Pakistan’s facilitation,” Mr. Qureshi said.

Taliban leader Abdul Ghani Baradar, who signed the Doha agreement on the militant groups behalf on Saturday, was held in Pakistani custody for eight years after being captured in a joint raid with U.S. agents in 2010 in the Pakistani port city of Karachi where he was in hiding.

The arrest followed months of behind-the-scenes prodding by U.S. officials who saw inaction by Islamabad as a major threat to their Afghan war strategy.

Baradar was not handed over to Afghanistan or the United States and was released in 2018. After that he became the head of the Taliban’s negotiation team that held talks with the U.S. negotiators for over a year in Doha.

That was another demonstration of facilitation, Mr. Qureshi said, adding, You required someone who who enjoyed the confidence of the leadership to engage (with the U.S.) that would make the talks possible.

He (Baradar) played a very positive role.

Mr. Qureshi also said Pakistan played a part in pushing for the negotiation process to restart after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the plug on negotiations in September last year.

In October 2019, while the Doha talks were off, Washingtons chief negotiator, special representative Zalmay Khalilzad, and the Taliban political delegation held talks in Islamabad in a meeting that was not publicly acknowledged.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k5pykl/article30958492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-AFGHANISTANTALIBAN-PAKISTAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/no-need-to-involve-us-to-resolve-bilateral-issues-pakistan-tells-afghanistan/article30958493.ece
41,2020/03/02,Chennai has a new group of exploring cyclists,"Be it hills, temples or estuaries, this group of cyclists is willing to pedal far for the sights and sounds surrounding Chennai

Over 100 kilometres on a cycle might seem like a lot around Chennai, especially with the summer humidity creeping in, but some views make it worth it. Just ask Naren Aakash, an enthusiast who took some of his peers cycling to Pulicat and back last week.

“I plan to do this twice a month, on alternate Saturdays,” says Naren, founder of the fledgeling cycling group Triban Roadies that is now one-ride old..

There are many routes to cover: the next ones I am planning will be to the Pallavaram Hills, Poondi Dam and Mahabs,” he says. There is more to look forward to than just the destinations — the Pulicat trip, for instance, afforded the cyclists scenic glimpses of early morning fishing at estuaries en route. It was a route of varied sights and terrains; the group of four kicked off from Decathlon Mogappair at 5 am, having assembled at 4.45, and first cycled along a bypass till Red Hills.

“From Red Hills to Minjur, we took the Outer Ring Road. It has some ups and downs, but for the most part it’s a straight road without any junctions, so you can ride at your own pace and safely pick up speed if you want to,” continues Naren. Minjur onwards, the group stuck entirely to internal roads, crossing village after picturesque village on their way till Pulicat, stopping for bites, breath or just scenery as and when they felt like it.

“We also saw Pulicat beach and the light house. In fact, one of the cyclists had joined us with the sole aim of getting to the light house, “ says Naren. He goes on to explain how targets like these can act as motivators that help achieve fitness goals (or just cycling goals in general). “The man who wanted to reach the light house, for instance, was in his 50s. He had only cycled up to 50 kilometres before. We were expecting him to give in earlier, but he completed the 115 kilometre round trip with us,” he says.

Kindly note Safety precautions the team insists on:

Ride only on the left side of the road

Avoid overtaking

Wear bright shirts for visibility in the early morning

Tail lights, front lights, helmets, water and energy bars are mandatory

Average riding speed should be around 25 kilometres per hour

Naren is not the first one to try and build a cycling community in the city. He is certainly not the first to go exploring its lesser-known natural sights either. The one thing that sets him apart, however, is his insistence that all riders use a particular model of cycles for his trips — Tribans, a series of road bikes made by Decathlon.

“Depending on the focus of your ride, your cycle can belong to one of tree categories,” begins the cyclist who, apart from his regular corporate job, also works at Decathlon part-time. “For offroading, you go for MTBs (mountain bicycles). For short commutes, you use hybrids. And for long distances on flat roads, you use road bikes.”

42,2020/03/02,Chennai’s slow dance with silent discos,"Silent discos are slowly but surely making their way into the city, cropping up everywhere from standalone establishments to day-long picnics

Revellers in Chennai are finally warming up to the sound of silence.

In February alone, two popular events in town drew crowds with silent discos. The Big Picnic, hosted annually by Farhana Suhail and Shamshad Begum of Buva House, saw around 200 people on the dance floor the previous weekend, while Riviera 2k20 by VIT’s SPARTANs club drew nearly a thousand people.

“We had to divide them into batches of three, so everyone had space on the dance floor,” says student Shaswat Sharma of VIT. “This was the second time that we arranged for a silent disco; we also had one at our 2019 edition.”

One of the reasons silent discos seem to be picking up in the city is the mere ease of operations. Noise levels and disturbances are no longer a concern, and the biggest investment needed are headphones, which can be linked to basic sound systems or music streaming apps on smartphones. It helps that the music does not disrupt other goings-on, making it a viable option for multi-activity events.

The other reason, of course, is the sheer fun of it. As Farhana explains, “If you don’t like the music the DJ is playing, you can just change it. The buttons are there on the headphone itself, so the tracks you dance to are up to you.” Most silent discos in Chennai have headphones that pull in three different channels of music; the ones at The Big Picnic had five, with one of them playing live mixes by a DJ. VIT had three on offer — but with three DJs, each playing live into a separate channel.

Something more

There are many ways to amp up the fun quotient here. For instance, Oscines, the city’s first silent disco establishment, has LED headphones which blink out different neon colours for different sound channels so smaller groups can zero in on the same channel and vibe on the dance floor.

Founder Prashant Kumar, however, decided to take the neon aspect of these lights and run wild with it. “Our whole concept at Oscines is neon. We have dark lights, so if you walk in wearing white, yellow or orange, your outfit will glow. We also have neon face paint, for those who really want to get into the mood,” he says.

Having said that, Prashant’s plans for four-month-old Oscines (it opened last Navaratri, with a neon dandiya night) are still cautious, since Chennai’s response has been gradual. “Our dance floor currently has space for about 25 people at a time. We open only on Saturdays, because that is the only day we can expect a good crowd. But we are planning to try and keep it open on weekdays too, after the first week of March. Let’s see how it goes.”

Where to disco The Big Picnic’s headphones are up for hire, for those who want to organise their own events. Call 7305630496

Oscines Silent Disco is located in Thoraipakkam, and currently opens only on Saturdays. Call 7358016263

Admittedly, these are slim pickings, especially considering the fact that silent discos have been drawing crowds in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kolkata for years now. Chennai used to experience this as a once-in-a-blue-moon event, only at luxury hotels.

However, the recent pop-up discos have made the concept much more accessible, and future ones are likely to add to the trend.

It also helps that the headphones can be used for other activities as well. The Big Picnic, for instance, also used them for their silent theatre evenings. “People could watch movies under the stars, without being disturbed by other activities happening around them,” says Farhana.

Having said that, the main focus of her event this past weekend was the DJ. Though the duo spent a lot of time zeroing in on the perfect set of headphones, Farhana insists that finding the right DJ was key — “We had to find someone who knows Tamil, Hindi and English music, though we realised that the first two are much more popular in Chennai.”

Oscines, on the other hand, dispenses with DJs altogether. “They are too expensive for such a small setup. We have a number of playlists and different tracks, and when the dancers have specific requests, we are more than happy to play it from their phones, YouTube, or apps like Saavn or Spotify,” says Prashant. Oscines also offers snacks and beverages, some of which are included in the ₹470 per person charge that gives you an hour and a half on the floor. “We don’t serve alcohol, though,” he says, adding curtly, “Because this is a family place. Everyone is welcome to come and have fun.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/3qkw9j/article30963310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2MPDiscoBig-Picnic-2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/chennais-slow-dance-with-silent-discos/article30963312.ece
43,2020/03/02,Fight the bot menace,"Why overconfidence in robotics can put our loved ones in peril

The Hindu is a family newspaper with a strong ethical code. This is why, when they do a story on robot companions, they focus on companions for the children, rather than sex robots — a sunrise industry whose time has nearly come.

Nevertheless, their focus is timely. Overconfidence in robotics can put our loved ones in peril. Anyone who has seen a Boston Dynamics demonstration of their latest robot will realise the risks inherent in letting them loose on youngsters and senior citizens.

Most current robots cannot bend down and turn a doorknob without falling over. These are large, metallic items with extremely limited motor skills and the IQ of a kitchen implement. Does it make sense to let one loose on granny? Within five minutes of switching it on, it would probably decapitate her and say ‘Oopsie, I did a boo boo,’ because you were too cheap to buy from a reputed company, and they sent the children’s model by mistake.

But sex robots are a far more immediate threat. By ignoring them in the name of decency, we are failing in our duty to the public. Even if you pretend you’re not planning to buy one, as soon as prices go down, it’s important to know the facts. Worldwide, the most strenuous efforts in the field of robotics are being devoted to the development of sex robots, especially in Japan.

The best-selling models are actually large plastic dolls, sometimes with a coating of silicone, but they call them robots, because no one wants to admit that they are paying 10,000 dollars for a large plastic doll, because they like the cut of her jib. They cannot move. The ones that can talk have a limited vocabulary, mostly encouraging. But they do not represent a genuine menace so far. Actual sex robots would be far more risky, with electrocution being the least of your potential hazards.

As anyone who has seen The Terminator can tell you, some day soon, the robots will rise. Your sex robot will at this point take over your phone, your laptop, your Internet and Alexa, and you will be naked and vulnerable. Your chances of escaping and joining the survivors to start a guerrilla movement will be severely compromised.

Luckily, all this is applicable only to men. All energies in the sex robot industry have been exclusively devoted to developing female sex robots, from which we can infer that women themselves prefer humans. Which means that when the robots eventually do rise, men will be immediately wiped out. Women will have more of a fighting chance, and who is to say this is a bad thing? So all the best for the future, ladies! Just remember to keep some weapons handy, and wear boots with rubber soles.

With the government restarting the process of Air India’s (AI) disinvestment this year, Vistara chairman Bhaskar Bhat said they were evaluating the national carrier and that a decision on bidding would be taken later.

After its unsuccessful bid to sell 76% stake in AI in 2018, the central government, this time, has decided to offload its entire stake.

Mr. Bhat told reporters, “We are evaluating AI. Which company would not be interested in evaluating a sovereign airline of the country?... Whether we bid or not comes later.”

Asked if Vistara or Tata Sons were evaluating AI, Mr. Bhat replied: “We (Vistara) are a joint venture.”

The government in January restarted the divestment process of AI and invited bids for selling 100% of its equity in the state-owned airline, including AI’s 100% shareholding in AI Express Ltd. and 50% in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd. The last date for putting bids is March 17 and interested bidders should have a net worth of ₹3,500 crore.

46,2020/03/02,Used car sale platform Spinny raises $43.7 million,"Spinny, an online used car retailing platform, has raised $ 43.7 million in a Series B funding round led by The Fundamentum Partnership, a growth-capital fund for mid-stage technology companies in India backed by Nandan Nilekani and Sanjeev Aggarwal.

The round also counts new investors, U.S.-based General Catalyst Partners, KB Financial Group from Korea and existing investors Accel, SAIF Partners and Alteria Capital as co-investors.

Spinny currently has presence across four cities in India and it sold close to 10,000 cars through its platform.

Currently, the Indian pre-owned car market stands at about 4.3 million units sold annually, growing at about 14% CAGR.

49,2020/03/02,Sensex sheds more than 900 points on virus alarm in India,"New COVID-19 cases spur change in sentiment, resulting in over 1,500 declines

It was a volatile day at the stock markets on Monday with the benchmark Sensex falling more than 900 points from the day’s high, as reports of COVID-19 cases in India affected investor sentiment, even as most other leading Asian markets gained ground after the recent sell-off.

The 30-share Sensex, which lost more than 3,000 points in the previous six trading sessions, opened the day strong and surged nearly 800 points to touch a high of 39.083.17. It traded with significant gains for most part of the trading session before news poured in that two fresh COVID-19 cases had been detected in India. The news spooked investors and the benchmark Sensex fell to a low of 37,785.99, before closing at 38,144.02, down 153.27 points or 0.40%.

The broader Nifty settled the day at 11,132.75, down 69 points, or 0.62%. The India VIX index — a barometer for volatility — jumped nearly 8.5% to move further close to its 52-week high levels.

Nips pullback

“Detection of new cases of coronavirus in India has nipped the nascent pullback in the Indian equity market,” said Gaurav Dua, head, Capital Market Strategy & Investments, Sharekhan, adding that though the new developments were a worrying factor that could lead to further volatility in the short-term, the correction also offered a buying opportunity for investors.

On Monday, the Ministry of Health said that two individuals — one each in Delhi and Telangana — have tested positive for the virus after having returned from Italy and Dubai. The losses in the Indian market were in the midst of a pull-back rally in most other leading Asian bourses with Nikkei, Hang Seng and Kospi, all gaining ground on Monday.

In India, the reversal of sentiment was sudden with across-the-board selling, as the morning session saw less than 400 stocks losing ground, but as the session ended, there were more than 1,500 declines.

Foreign portfolio investors continued to sell Indian equities, with Monday’s net sales pegged at nearly ₹1,355 crore, even as their domestic counterparts attempted to provide some support with net purchases of ₹1,139 crore. In the Sensex pack, stocks such as Axis Bank, Bajaj Finance, State Bank of India, ONGC, Tata Steel, NTPC and Tata Steel lost more than 2% each.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/9iiqfm/article30965634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03Sensexcol,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sensex-sheds-more-than-900-points-on-virus-alarm-in-india/article30965635.ece
50,2020/03/02,"Sharp decline in PSB fraud amount, Centre tells Lok Sabha","An online searchable database of frauds reported by banks has been set up to enable mitigation of fraud risk.

Comprehensive steps taken to curb fraud in public sector banks (PSBs) have resulted in a sharp decline in the amount involved, from ₹50,329 crore in 2013-14 to just ₹3,781 crore in the first three quarters of 2019-20, according to the Finance Ministry.

An online searchable database of frauds reported by banks, in the form of Central Fraud Registry, has been set up to enable timely identification, control and mitigation of fraud risk and for carrying out due diligence during the credit sanction process, the Ministry said in response to a question in the Lok Sabha.

The Fugitive Economic Offenders Act is being invoked to attach and confiscate the assets of violators and strip them of the entitlement to defend any civil claim.

Copies of passports

The PSBs have been told to get certified copies of passports of promoters and directors and other authorised signatories of companies availing themselves of loan facilities of more than ₹50 crore. They also have been advised to decide on publishing photographs of wilful defaulters as per procedure.

The government has also asked these banks to strictly ensure rotational transfer of officials to mitigate the possibility of their involvement in any fraud. The bank heads have been empowered to issue requests for opening look-out circulars against suspects.

Inoperative companies

“For enforcement of auditing standards and ensuring the quality of audits, the government has established the National Financial Reporting Authority as an independent regulator... bank accounts of 3.38 lakh inoperative companies have been frozen,” said the government.

Gross NPAs

To another question, the Ministry said gross Non-Performing Assets (NPA) of nationalised banks, as per the Reserve Bank of India data on global operations, rose from ₹1,92,809 crore as on March 31, 2015, to ₹6,16,586 crore as on March 31, 2018.

“As a result of the government’s strategy of recognition, resolution, recapitalisation and reforms,” the NPAs declined (as per declared results of nationalised banks) to ₹5,56,991 crore as on December 31, 2019.

The nationalised banks have recovered ₹3,08,370 crore over the last five financial years and the first three quarters of the current financial year, which includes a record recovery of ₹86,014 crore during 2018-19.

ATM frauds

The Ministry, in reply to another question, said over 21,000 instances of fraud related to ATMs, debit/credit cards and Internet banking, involving about ₹128 crore, were reported by the scheduled commercial banks and select financial institutions from October to December 2019.

While ATM/debit card frauds to the tune of ₹73.65 crore were reported in October, it averaged about ₹10 crore in November and December last year.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nijzcd/article30537028.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THBURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sharp-decline-in-psb-fraud-amount-centre-tells-lok-sabha/article30965596.ece
51,2020/03/02,FICCI calls for measures to prevent spread of COVID-19 in India,"It suggested adoption of infection control practices and strengthening of screening at airports, among others.

Industry body Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) on Monday called for measures to prevent the spread of deadly coronavirus (COVID-19) in India, even as two more cases – one in Delhi and another in Telangana – were reported in the country.

It suggested adoption of infection control practices and strengthening of screening at airports, among others.

“Till date India has been relatively untouched. The most important part of our strategy must be screening and ensuring that the virus does not enter and parallelly a hospital preparedness strategy is in place,” FICCI president Sangita Reddy said.

She said this needs to be further backed by mapping of available health-care resources in both public and private sector, for sample testing, quarantine and treatment to prepare for likely spread.

52,2020/03/02,"Jack Welch, who led GE's rapid expansion, dies at 84","Welch - known as “Neutron Jack” for cutting thousands of jobs - bought and sold scores of businesses, expanding the industrial giant into financial services and consulting.

Jack Welch, who grew General Electric Co during the 1980s and 1990s into the most valuable public company in the United States, has died at age of 84, the conglomerate said on Monday.

Welch - known as “Neutron Jack” for cutting thousands of jobs - bought and sold scores of businesses, expanding the industrial giant into financial services and consulting.

Under him, GE's market value grew from $12 billion to $410 billion. But his push to build out the GE Capital financing business nearly proved the undoing of the entire enterprise during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago, and GE now trades at a fraction of its peak value.

President Donald Trump tweeted: “There was no corporate leader like neutron Jack. He was my friend and supporter. We made wonderful deals together. He will never be forgotten. My warmest sympathies to his wonderful wife & family!”

In December 1980, it was announced he would succeed CEO Reginald Jones and in April 1981 he took over as the company's eighth chairman and CEO. He served in that position until he retired in September 2001, succeeded by Jeff Immelt.

GE saw great growth and expansion under Welch's leadership. Through streamlining operations, acquiring new businesses and ensuring that each business under the GE umbrella was one of the best in its field, the company was able to expand dramatically from 1981 to 2001.

“Before you are a leader, success is all about growing yourself. When you become a leader, success is all about growing others,” Welch wrote in a book called Winning.

According to GE's website, Welch was born in 1935. He received his B.S. degree in chemical engineering from the University of Massachusetts in 1957 and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in chemical engineering from the University of Illinois in 1960.

In 1960, Welch joined GE as a chemical engineer for its plastics division in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. He was elected the company's youngest vice president in 1972 and became vice chairman in 1979.

In 1980, the year before Welch became CEO, GE recorded revenues of roughly $26.8 billion; in 2000, the year before he left, they were nearly $130 billion. The company was one of the most valuable and largest company in the world at the time of his retirement, up from America's tenth largest by market cap in 1981.

In 1999, Fortune named him the “Manager of the Century,” and the Financial Times named him one of the three most admired business leaders in the world.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pkau65/article30964916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WELCH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jack-welch-who-led-ges-rapid-expansion-dies-at-84/article30964917.ece

54,2020/03/02,34 queries in Census 2020 form,"Centre has proposed that the next phase of NPR will be conducted along with the first phase of Census between April to September 2020.

The Registrar General of India (RGI) has asked all States to “give highest importance, attention and time” to the Census and National Population Register (NPR) work as “the foundations of the statistics of the country” depend on them.

Also Read National Population Register data to be collected in a year

In a 14-page letter, dated January 29 and addressed to all the Directors of Census Operations (DCOs) in the States, Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India Vivek Joshi said, “The district level officials must be reminded of the importance of the census work and on ensuring that a clear message is sent to the charge officers to give the highest importance and attention (as well to devote sufficient time) for the House Listing and NPR work, on the results of which depend the foundations of the statistics of the country.”

The decennial census exercise will be conducted in two phases — House Listing and Housing Census from April to September 2020 and Population Enumeration from February 9 to February 28, 2021.

Centre has proposed that the next phase of NPR will be conducted along with the first phase of Census between April to September 2020.

On Sunday, the Uttar Pradesh government kick-started the process — the Census/NPR exercise will be conducted in the State from May 16 to June 30. U.P has seen violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the legislation’s link with the countrywide National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register (NPR).

According to Citizenship Rules 2003, NPR is the first step towards compilation of the NRC, though the government informed Parliament on February 4 that “till now, the government has not taken any decision to prepare National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC) at the national level.”

On Monday, the official Twitter handle of Census India said “division level meeting & training for #CensusIndia2021 & updation of NPR” was held in Lucknow. “All the Collectors of Lucknow division & other census officers were present in the meeting. The Director urged functionaries to complete the Census operations & NPR updation with full devotion & within given timeline,” the tweet said.

N.S. Pandey, DCO Uttar Pradesh told The Hindu that they have received the schedule of Census and NPR. “There are 34 questions in Census proforma and 14 questions in the NPR. The exercise will be conducted through a web based mobile application. NPR is only being updated, no new register is being created. Giving Aadhar details (for NPR) is voluntary. If you look at the schedule, it mentions that providing information (in NPR) is voluntary.” Mr. Pandey said.

Similar meetings were held in Goa, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya in the past one month.

The “pretest” or the trial NPR form collected details from 30 lakh respondents last year on 21 parameters, seeking specific details on “place of birth of father and mother, last place of residence” along with other information like Aadhar (optional), voter ID card, mobile phone and driving license numbers. The new NPR form, for the first time, is also expected to collect information on “mother tongue”. In 2010 and 2015, NPR collected details on 14 parameters.

Many State governments have objected to new fields in NPR such as “the place of birth of parents” as sometimes in villages and even in cities people are not aware about their own place of birth.

55,2020/03/02,SC to hear on March 5 plea for Omar Abdullah’s release,"“This is a matter of personal liberty,"" says Justice Arun Mishra

The Supreme Court on Monday agreed that a plea filed by Sara Abdullah Pilot against the continued detention of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah under the Public Safety Act (PSA) needs to be heard quickly as it concerns his personal liberty.

But the authorities told the court that Mr. Abdullah had been a “very vocal critic” of the abrogation of the special status of J&K under Article 370 even before it was actually repealed on August 5, 2019. They said his release now may prove prejudicial to the maintenance of public order in the new Union Territory geographically proximate to Pakistan. They reminded the court that 41,866 persons lost their lives in J&K in 71038 “incidents” since 1990. A detention order under the PSA was not based on any objective determination but rather on the “subjective satisfaction” of the detaining authority, they argued. The court cannot substitute its opinion for that of the detaining authority.

However, in a brief hearing on Monday, a Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra informed Ms. Abdullah's lawyers, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Gopal Sankaranarayanan, that the case would indeed be heard on March 5.

Also Read We do not hesitate to cross border to protect India against terrorism, says Rajnath

“This is a matter of personal liberty,"" Justice Mishra said. Justice Indira Banerjee, the other judge on the Bench, nodded in agreement.

Ms. Pilot has asked the apex court to direct the authorities to produce her brother in court and set him free immediately. She said she has had no information on his whereabouts.

Mr. Abdullah was first detained on August 5 last, when the President notified the abrogation of the special rights of the people of J&K. After detaining him for the maximum six months, a fresh detention order under the PSA was issued in February 2020.

District Magistrate of Srinagar Shahid Iqbal Chaudhary informed the court in his affidavit that Mr. Abdullah “was and continues to be detained in conformity with the mandatory provisions of the PSA and is kept in Hari Niwas (former palace of the erstwhile King, located near the Dal Lake), which has been temporarily declared a subsidiary jail”.

Mr. Chaudhary, represented by Attorney General K.K. Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, justified that the continued detention under the PSA was based on material and documents showing that Mr. Abdullah’s “activities”, even before his first detention in August 2019, was “calculated to disturb public peace and tranquility”.

The Magistrate said the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, the grounds of detention and the dossier prepared for his detention under the PSA all clearly indicated a “live and proximate link” between the activities of Mr. Abdullah and the “events that occurred in the past”.

The affidavit said the previous activities of Mr. Abdullah, which are available in the public domain, indicated that even in future he may act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order in J&K.

“The assertion that merely due to the efflux of time, due to detenu being in custody, there exists no material justifying the apprehension of public order being affected is ex-facie erroneous,” the affidavit said.

Mr. Venugopal argued that Ms. Abdullah had not explained why she came straight to the Supreme Court instead of the J&K High Court. “The High Court is fully functional. It has quashed 68 detention orders since August 2019 and confirmed 11,” he submitted.

The affidavit also claimed that Mr. Abdullah “purposefully failed” to make a representation before the Advisory Board constituted under the PSA or even the government against the detention. The Board is made up of a retired High Court judge and two principal judges.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hdxpe0/article30965845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THRDSARA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-hear-on-march-5-plea-for-omar-abdullahs-release/article30965846.ece

Members of the Indian diaspora recently held simultaneous protests in more than 15 cities across Europe to express their solidarity with the victims and survivors of the recent violence in Delhi, and to demand immediate action against the perpetrators.

Nearly 1,500 people participated in such protests, silent demonstrations and sit-ins in many places on Saturday despite inclement weather in some cities. During the protests, people paid tribute to the victims and appealed for peace between communities. They also sang songs and carried posters with messages of peace.

Opposite Embassy

In Berlin, the protesters marched towards the Indian Embassy, raising slogans against “atrocities committed by the police”. As the Indian Embassy objected to flowers being placed outside its premises, people in Berlin placed flowers on the street opposite the Indian Embassy as a gesture of condolence towards the victims. Despite the harsh weather, Indians in Belgium too protested to show their solidarity against communal atrocities, according to a release from Indians in Poland co-ordinating the protests across Europe.

While in Glasgow, Scottish people joined the demonstrators, who sang poet Faiz Ahmed’s poem ‘Hum Dekhenge’, the silent demonstration in Krakow, Poland, had participants wearing black.

A press release said slogans in English and Hindi, speeches and poetry, and a tribute to the protesters of Shaheen Bagh, marked the protests in The Hague, Netherlands. Some of the Indians in Helsinki, Finland covered their mouths with black cloth, symbolising curbing of dissent, during a silent protest.

Locals join

In Paris and Stockholm, people observed silence for a minute for the victims of violence in Delhi. French citizens too joined Indians at the meeting where the victims were remembered and white roses were laid near the Consular Office in Paris. The Indian diaspora in Sweden and Switzerland are working towards supporting relief activities in Delhi.

At a gathering in Geneva, which had Indians across Switzerland as well as Swiss residents participate, protesters highlighted the inadequate response of the Central government in curbing the violence.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi triggered a flurry of speculation after he took to Twitter late Monday evening to say that he was considering giving up his social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram from Sunday.

“This Sunday, thinking of giving up my social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & YouTube. Will keep you all posted,” tweeted Mr. Modi, immediately setting off a hashtag #NoSir to persuade him not to do so.

This Sunday, thinking of giving up my social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram & YouTube. Will keep you all posted. — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) March 2, 2020

His social media team refused to comment, only stating that it was the Prime Minister himself who would do the big reveal of his reasons.

Speculation ran rife on social media over why Mr. Modi, one of the first among politicians to unleash the power of social media in India and one of the highest followed leaders the world over, would announce such a thing.

It ranged from plans for launching an India-specific platform on the lines of “Weibo” in China, to a social media detox following the role played by certain accounts in fanning communal riots in Delhi.

One source said that since Mr. Modi had asked, in the past, for public campaigns on certain issues, he may be considering a campaign around social media detox with offline social intercourse aimed at social cohesion.

Mr. Modi has around 53.3 million followers on Twitter and by 35 million on Instagram.

On Facebook, he tops the list of world leaders with 44 million people liking his page.

Expressing his anguish over the ruckus that forced four adjournments, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla finally adjourned the House until Tuesday.

Rajya Sabha, too, witnessed multiple adjournments over the riots after the Opposition’s demand for an ‘immediate discussion’ was not accepted by the Chair even though Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu had assured a debate would be held on a later date.

Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad accused the government of sleeping when Delhi was burning for days.

Centre seeks suspension

Blaming the Opposition for disruptions and resorting to tactics such as bringing posters and tearing paper inside Lok Sabha, government sources said the Centre will move a resolution seeking suspension of ‘unruly’ Congress MPs including Gaurav Gogoi, Ravneet Singh Bittu, and Hibi Eden.

Countering the allegations, Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury accused the government of tearing democracy to shreds and said a ruling party MP had assaulted Congress MP fro Kerala Ramya Haridas on the floor of the House.

""I am personally pained at the developments in the House. You are not pained. I do not want to run proceedings under such circumstances.... Everybody should deliberate to ensure that the dignity of the House is maintained,” Speaker Birla told members before adjourning the House for the day.

When Lok Sabha met at 2 p.m. after the first half of the proceedings were adjourned to mourn the death of sitting member Baidyanath Prasad Mahto of the JD(U), Opposition members trooped into the Well of the House and started shouting slogans against the government.

Display black banner

As the Speaker took up the listed business, the Congress MPs walked across to the Treasury side, holding up a black banner calling for Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation.

An angry Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi attacked the Congress and said they were now talking about Delhi riots when 3,000 people were killed in Delhi in 1984 [anti-Sikh riots] under its watch.

BJP members, including Ramesh Bidhuri and Nishikant Dubey, then rushed to the Well and in the melee, some Congress MPs tore papers and tossed them in the air. Members from both sides then began pushing and shoving each till the proceedings were adjourned till 3 p.m.

While Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Smriti Irani were seen trying to pacify the agitated members, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi were present in the House during the uproar.

Govt. ‘asleep’

The Rajya Sabha too saw adjournments as the Opposition parties demanded an immediate discussion on the Delhi riots as soon as the session was convened. Opposition MPs from Congress, Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Dravida Munnetra Kazgham and the Left parties were up on their feet, shouting slogans.

Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad charged that the Centre ‘slept’ when violence rocked Delhi for three days, members shouted like 'Delhi is Burning' while three TMC members sported black bands on their eyes, which they removed after being told by Mr Naidu.

“The matter is definitely important and deserves to be discussed,” Mr Naidu said, adding he will admit a discussion and allot time after discussing with the Minister concerned as well as the Leader of the House and the Leader of the Opposition.

“Our priority should be restoring normalcy. We should see that normalcy is restored and then we can discuss ways and means of preventing it (such violence),” he added as he asked the House to send out a message in one voice on the issue.

In a boost to defence exports, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) won a $40 mn order for supplying four Weapon Locating Radars (WLR) to Armenia beating firms from Russia and Poland in the competition.

We won a competitive bid for supplying four Swathi WLR worth $40 mn deal to Armenia and the deal has been signed, a defence source said.

Indigenously developed

Swathi WLR was indigenously developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and manufactured by BEL.

It is an electronically scanned phased array radar and automatically locates hostile artillery, mortars and rocket launchers and tracks friendly fire to locate the impact point of friendly artillery fire to issue necessary corrections.

It is interesting to note that during the Kargil conflict in 1999, Indian Army faced limitations as it did not have any WLRs and they were the first weapon systems procured from the U.S. once the defence sales commenced a few years later.

According to the DRDO, the radar is designed to detect projectiles with small cross section across the battle space horizon, and has the capability to handle simultaneous fire from weapons deployed at multiple locations.

“The radar uses advanced signal processing techniques for detection and tracking projectiles in the presence of ground, weather clutter and other forms of interference in Electronic Warfare scenario,” the DRDO website says.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bel-bags-40mn-defence-deal-from-armenia/article30965564.ece
61,2020/03/02,Meghalaya extremists ask non-tribal group to leave,"“All precautionary measures are in place to bring the law and order situation under control,” Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said

Authorities in Meghalaya’s East Khasi Hills district eased curfew on Monday in view of school exams and relative peace after communal clashes had claimed three lives since February 28.

The curfew was reimposed for 12 hours from 6 p.m. due to a perceived threat to peace and tranquillity, District Magistrate M. War Nongbri said. Mobile Internet service in East Khasi Hills and five other districts remained suspended.

This followed an ultimatum issued by the extremist Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council (HNLC) to all Bengali Hindus to leave the Ichamati and Majai areas of the district within one month.

Ichamati, close to India’s border with Bangladesh, was where a Khasi Students’ Union member was killed in a clash between the Khasi tribal and non-tribal people over opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the implementation of inner-line permit for restricting the entry of outsiders into the State.

In a statement, HNLC general secretary Sainkumar Nongtraw warned of “mass bloodshed” if the Bengali Hindus failed to heed the group’s ultimatum.

The HNLC also alleged a “Hindutva connection” in the hostility shown by the Hindu Bengalis and likened the clashes in Meghalaya to those between anti-CAA and pro-CAA groups in Delhi.

On Monday, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma, Home Minister Lahkmen Rymbui, Health Minister A.L. Hek and General Administration Department Minister Comingone Ymbon visited the Shillong Civil Hospital to meet the people injured in the violence.

“All precautionary measures are in place to bring the law and order situation under control,” Mr. Sangma said, adding the government would take care of the medical expenses of the victims. “We appeal to all stakeholders and individuals to refrain from any kind of violence so that peace and normalcy can return,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/17hnoh/article30965124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-meghalay-cm-ani,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/meghalaya-extremists-ask-non-tribal-group-to-leave/article30965125.ece

The Ganderbal police said it presented a charge sheet against the two accused, identified as Muhammad Rafiq Shah, a resident of Shuhama, Ganderbal and Bashir Ahmad Lone, a resident of Brein Nishat for their involvement in FIR No. 71/2018, “pertaining to provocative speech at Chunduna Ganderbal”. They were booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.

The police on Monday presented the charge sheet against the duo before the court.

63,2020/03/02,Standing Committees make up for fewer sittings of Parliament: Naidu,"Work of the 24 DRSCs in examining Demands of all ministries equals 30 days of functioning of the Parliament

Fewer sittings of Parliament are compensated by the working of department-related standing committees (DRSCs) Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu said on Monday. He added that during the three week recess between the first and second halves of the current Budget session, the committees have done work worth 30 sittings of Parliament.

Also read | Second leg of Budget session, Day 1

There are a total of 24 department-related standing committees, of which eight are with Rajya Sabha and remaining 16 with Lok Sabha. The eight Rajya Sabha committees consist of 244 members from both the Houses, with 78 from Rajya Sabha and 166 from Lok Sabha. The standing committee system was introduced in 1993 with the panels drawing members from all political parties.

The general impression, Mr Naidu said is that the sittings of Parliament are steadily declining over the years. From 100-150 sittings in the 1950s, the number is down to 60-70 sittings per year.

Giving an account of the functioning of the standing committees, Mr. Naidu, at the beginning of the session, said the eight Rajya Sabha committees held 20 meetings and discussed the budgetary demands of 18 ministries. These meetings lasted total duration of 63 hours.

Equal to 10 House sittings

During a usual sitting of Parliament, the Houses are convened for six hours. Calculating it accordingly, the meeting of these committees amount to 10 sittings of Parliament.

“Proportionately, the work done by the 16 Committees of Lok Sabha amounts to another 20 sittings of the Parliament. In all, the work put in by the total 24 DRSCs in examining the Demands for Grants of all the ministries equals 30 days of functioning of the Parliament, which is quite significant,” Mr Naidu said.

He added that if the working of the committees is taken into account for the entire year, it will amount to significantly higher number of days.

Decries absenteeism

Mr Naidu also ticked off the parliamenterians for being absent from these committees. In case of eight Rajya Sabha committees the attendance was 45.3%. “Four of these eight committees have reported attendance of more than 50% which is welcome. The highest attendance of 65.51% has been in the meetings of the Committee on Health and Family Welfare.” Mr Naidu added. The lowest attendance was in the standing committee of the commerce ministry, which is headed by YSR Congress’s Vijay Sai Reddy.

“While the overall attendance of members of BJP and Congress accounting for a total of 142 members has been much higher than 50%, the attendance of members from other parties accounting for 102 members has been only about 40%,” Mr Naidu said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/z7q5tp/article30964671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-NAIDU-RSTVPTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/standing-committees-make-up-for-fewer-sittings-of-parliament-naidu/article30964672.ece

Just over 34,000 people have signed up for the National Pension Scheme for Traders, Shopkeepers and Self-Employed Persons, which was introduced on September 12, 2019, Union Labour and Employment Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar informed the Lok Sabha on Monday.

The Labour Ministry’s vision document in 2019 had set a target of 25 lakh enrolments for the scheme in 2019-2020. Retail traders, shopkeepers and self-employed persons who are between 18 and 40 years of age and have an annual turnover of ₹1.5 crore or less are eligible for the scheme.

BJP MP Saumitra Khan had sought to know whether the number of enrolments had been below the government’s expectations.

“As the scheme has been launched on September 12, 2019, only, the scheme is being popularised among the target groups,” Mr. Gangwar said in his reply. “Further, all State/Union Territory governments were requested for popularising and bringing more awareness about the scheme. The progress of the scheme is being reviewed regularly in the Ministry at senior level with State/UT governments, for taking initiatives under mission mode,” he added.

The move will entail repeal of the existing Punjab Lokpal Act, 1996, and the proposed new legislation would be applicable to the Chief Minister, Ministers, non-officials and officials of all public offices in the State, with the aim of further enhancing governance and checking corruption.

The bill envisages an autonomous body to inquire into the grievances and allegations against public functionaries in the State, and to make provisions for appointment of a Lokayukta and for the matters connected therewith, the government said in a statement.

The Lokayukta would have all the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The proposed law would also provide for prosecution of a complainant in case of a false complaint. Prosecution of the Chief Minister and MLAs can be sanctioned only by a two-thirds majority of the House under the new legislation. “Further, all sanctions by the Assembly, whether or not permission to prosecute is granted, would be binding on the Lokpal,” the government added.

The Cabinet also announced emergency measures, including the setting up of flu corners in all government and private hospitals, to prepare for any exigency arising from COVID-19.

68,2020/03/02,Nirbhaya case: Delhi court defers hanging of 4 death row convicts till further order,"One of them moved a mercy plea before President shortly after SC dismisses his curative petition.

A Delhi court on Monday deferred the execution of the death sentence of the four Nirbhaya gang rape case convicts indefinitely.

The four condemned men were supposed to be hanged to death on March 3 at 6 a.m.

Hours before what was to be their execution, Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana put on hold their execution when informed that one of the four, Pawan Gupta, has moved a clemency petition before the President on Monday.

Also read: Delay in hanging shows failure of system: Nirbhaya’s mother

The clemency petition was filed with the President shortly after a five-judge Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana dismissed Pawan's curative petition for lack of merits. The decision was taken by circulation by the judges in their chambers at 10.25 a.m. on Monday.

“We have gone through the curative petition and the relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out... The application for oral hearing is rejected. The application for stay of execution of death sentence is also rejected,” the short order on the curative petition said.

Even if the President rejects the mercy plea of Pawan before 6 a.m. on March 3, the law laid down by the Supreme Court in its Shatrughan Chauhan judgment of 2014 requires the convict to be given 14 days time to set his affairs straight and “prepare” for the execution.

Recently, the Centre had blamed the Chauhan judgment for being “convict-centric”. It urged the Supreme Court to revisit the 2014 verdict and make it victim and society centric.

Again, Pawan can legally challenge the rejection of the mercy plea in the Supreme Court. The fate of the other three convicts would also depend on how long his challenges would continue to hold up.

The government has appealed to the Supreme Court for permission to separately execute convicts who have exhausted their legal and administrative remedies without waiting for their co-convicts in the same case to finish theirs in due time. This appeal is pending in the court.

Organ donation

Separately, a Bench of Justices R. Banumathi and A.S. Bopanna dismissed a PIL petition filed by former High Court judge Michael Saldanha for directions to the government and the jail authorities to give the Nirbhaya convicts’ organs for medical research.

“To execute a person is the saddest part for the family . You [petitioner] want their body to cut into pieces... Have a humane approach to these things... Organ donation has to be voluntary,” Justice Banumathi addressed the petitioner.

The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an Special Investigation Team (SIT) plea seeking early hearing of its petition challenging the anticipatory bail granted in 2018 to jailed former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases.

“Application for early hearing is dismissed,” said a Bench comprising Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kand.

While refusing the plea, the Bench asked the SIT, “Is he inside the jail or not”.

Also Read SC refuses interim relief to Sajjan Kumar in 1984 anti-Sikh riots case

The Bench was referring to the case in which Sajjan Kumar has been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.

The SIT has filed an appeal against the Delhi High Court decision of February 22, 2018, upholding a trial court order granting anticipatory bail to Sajjan Kumar in two anti-Sikh riots cases, saying that according to records, he was available throughout the investigation.

He was granted anticipatory bail by the trial court on December 21, 2016 in two cases of killing of three Sikhs during the riots which had occurred after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her two Sikh bodyguards.

Sajjan Kumar had submitted that his name was never taken earlier and it was a case of fresh allegations coming up after three decades.

He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court in another 1984 anti-Sikh riots case on December 17, 2018. Kumar resigned from the Congress after he was convicted by the high court.

The case in which he was convicted and sentenced relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment’s Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1-2 in 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.

Kumar has also challenged in the apex court the Delhi High Court’s verdict of December 17 last year that awarded him life imprisonment for the “remainder of his natural life” in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.

It had also upheld the conviction and varying sentences awarded by a trial court to five others - former Congress councillor Balwan Khokhar, retired naval officer Captain Bhagmal, Girdhari Lal and ex-MLAs Mahender Yadav and Kishan Khokhar.

The extension to 24 weeks will also help victims of rape, girls with disabilities as well as minors, who may not realise they are pregnant until later, it had said, describing the draft legislation as progressive.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bill-for-extending-upper-limit-of-abortion-to-24-weeks-introduced-in-lok-sabha/article30962518.ece
73,2020/03/02,"Delhi, Telangana report 1 case each of COVID-19","Three students from Kerala, who had confirmed to have the virus, have been discharged from hospital after they recovered and tested negative.

Two more cases of COVID-19 - one in Delhi and another in Telangana - have been reported in the country, taking the total number of positive cases to five, the Union Health Ministry said on Monday.

According to Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, the person from Delhi who has tested positive had travelled to Italy, while the other one has a recent travel history to Dubai.

“Both the patients had self-reported after they developed symptoms. They tested positive. They are stable and being closely monitored. We are now contacting their family and others who have come in contact with them to ensure that the virus is contained and any case is picked up at the earliest,” he said.

The positive person in Delhi had self-reported at the RML hospital here after returning to India, while the one in Telangana had initially gone to a private hospital and then was referred to a government hospital.

There are now reports of an Italian tourist in India showing symptoms of the infection. The Health Ministry has maintained that he has not been confirmed for the virus and that a sample has been sent to NIV, Pune.

Minister of Health (State) Ashwini Choubey said 15 laboratories were working to fight the disease and 19 more would be set up. The three students from Kerala, who had confirmed to have the virus, had been discharged from hospital after they recovered and tested negative.

India’s first COVID-19 case was recorded in Kerala's Thrissur. A woman medical student from Wuhan who was admitted to the Government Medical College hospital, Thrissur, was discharged on February 20.

As many as 25,738 people are under community surveillance across the country.

Travel advisory

Dr. Vardhan said he had advised people to avoid non-essential travel to Iran, Italy, South Korea and Singapore. Thirty- seven people across the country were currently hospitalised after showing symptoms of COVID-19. The Union government was in discussion with Iran and Italian authorities to evacuate Indians there.

“So far 3,217 samples have been tested, out of which five have tested positive for COVID-19, while reports of 23 are awaited. Italy is reeling under a large number cases of COVID-19. China has so far witnessed 2,912 deaths due to coronavirus,’’ said the Minister.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation noted that it has been decided to expand the universal screening of passengers arriving on flights from Italy and Iran besides the flights from China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Nepal, Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u7ayqo/article30962372.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/two-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-india/article30962291.ece
74,2020/03/02,Chakma groups seek PM Modi’s intervention in ‘illegal’ Mizoram NRC,"No such survey was conducted in any village inhabited by the Mizos, who comprise almost 90% of the State’s population, says team in joint memorandum

Political leaders and NGOs belonging to the Chakma community have sough Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention for stopping the “illegal National Register of Citizens (NRC)” being conducted by the Mizoram government to identify alleged foreigners.

The exercise specifically targets the minority Chakmas, said a team that submitted a joint memorandum to the Prime Minister on Monday.

The team lead by Chakma Autonomous District Council (CADC) chief executive member Rashik Mohan Chakma included BJP’s lone legislator in Mizoram Buddha Dhan Chakma and the party’s national council member Nirupam Chakma.

They said that the Mizoram government had so far conducted the NRC, neither sanctioned by the Centre nor the Supreme Court, in at least 14 Chakma-inhabited villages in Mizoram’s Lunglei district. No such survey was conducted in any village inhabited by the Mizos, who comprise almost 90% of the State’s population.

The Lunglei district administration had on February 11 issued a notice to the presidents of the village councils asking them to participate in the “illegal NRC under the garb of verification and identification of unauthorised settlements” as well as to provide accommodation, food, translators, etc., to the survey team members.

‘Worse than Assam NRC’

Hundreds of Chakma villagers had to stand in the queue and fill the “proforma for identification of recent settlers within Mizoram and verification of their nationality and provide documents in proof of their citizenship such as voter ID, Aadhaar card, educational certificates and information on past residential addresses, etc., along with the duly filled survey form. Worst, the poor Chakma villagers had to provide food, accommodation and translators to the officials,” the Chakma leaders said in their joint memorandum.

Mizoram’s NRC form has six questions more than the one in Assam, the team pointed out.

These are: place of birth, religion, brief history and names of villages last settled with their period of stay, permanent address in the native country, physical features such as height, colour of hair and eyes and distinguishing marks, and ground or basis of inclusion in the voter list as per Form 6 by Electoral Registration Officer and Assistant Electoral Registration Officer.

Leaving out the Mizos and focussing only on the Chakmas was nothing but racial profiling on the basis of religion and ethnicity, the Chakma leaders said.

The Chakmas are Buddhist while almost all Mizos are Christians, a majority of them Presbyterian.

The Chakma leaders urged Mr. Modi to stand by his declaration at Ramlila ground in Delhi on December 22, 2019, that ever since his government had come to power in 2014 “there has been no discussion on NRC anywhere”.

The Chakma political leaders and NGOs urged the Prime Minister to immediately intervene into the matter by asking Mizoram to stop the illegal NRC, and issue a notification stating that no State government or Union Territory administration must conduct any NRC or NRC-like survey or exercise for identification of alleged foreigners.

They also urged Mr. Modi to instruct the Mizoram government not to use the data or documents obtained during the illegal NRC for any purpose and that a high-level Central team should be sent to investigate the survey targeting the Chakmas.

The NGOs that signed the memorandum included the Central Mizoram Chakma Students Union, the Chakma National Council of India, the Mizoram Buddhist Association, and the Mizoram Chakma Alliance Against Discrimination.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ymqpl/article30962092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200302-WA0015,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chakma-groups-seek-pm-modis-intervention-in-illegal-mizoram-nrc/article30962093.ece
75,2020/03/02,SC to hear on March 5 plea against detention of Omar Abdullah under PSA,"“This is a matter of personal liberty,"" says Justice Arun Mishra.

The Supreme Court on Monday agreed that a petition filed by Sara Abdullah Pilot against the continued detention of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah under the Public Safety Act (PSA) needs to be heard quickly as it concerns his personal liberty.

But the authorities told the court that Mr. Abdullah had been a “very vocal critic” of the abrogation of the special status of J&K under Article 370 even before it was actually repealed on August 5, 2019. They said his release now may prove prejudicial to the maintenance of public order in the new Union Territory geographically proximate to Pakistan. They reminded the court that 41,866 persons lost their lives in J&K in 71038 “incidents” since 1990. A detention order under the PSA was not based on any objective determination but rather on the “subjective satisfaction” of the detaining authority, they argued. The court cannot substitute its opinion for that of the detaining authority.

However, in a brief hearing on Monday, a Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra informed Ms. Abdullah's lawyers, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Gopal Sankaranarayanan, that the case would indeed be heard on March 5.

“This is a matter of personal liberty,"" Justice Mishra said. Justice Indira Banerjee, the other judge on the Bench, nodded in agreement.

Ms. Pilot has asked the apex court to direct the authorities to produce her brother in court and set him free immediately. She said she has had no information on his whereabouts.

Mr. Abdullah was first detained on August 5 last, when the President notified the abrogation of the special rights of the people of J&K. After detaining him for the maximum six months, a fresh detention order under the PSA was issued in February 2020.

District Magistrate of Srinagar Shahid Iqbal Chaudhary informed the court in his affidavit that Mr. Abdullah “was and continues to be detained in conformity with the mandatory provisions of the PSA and is kept in Hari Niwas (former palace of the erstwhile King, located near the Dal Lake), which has been temporarily declared a subsidiary jail”.

Mr. Chaudhary, represented by Attorney General K.K. Venugopal and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, justified that the continued detention under the PSA was based on material and documents showing that Mr. Abdullah’s “activities”, even before his first detention in August 2019, was “calculated to disturb public peace and tranquility”.

The Magistrate said the subjective satisfaction of the detaining authority, the grounds of detention and the dossier prepared for his detention under the PSA all clearly indicated a “live and proximate link” between the activities of Mr. Abdullah and the “events that occurred in the past”.

The affidavit said the previous activities of Mr. Abdullah, which are available in the public domain, indicated that even in future he may act in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order in J&K.

“The assertion that merely due to the efflux of time, due to detenu being in custody, there exists no material justifying the apprehension of public order being affected is ex-facie erroneous,” the affidavit said.

Mr. Venugopal argued that Ms. Abdullah had not explained why she came straight to the Supreme Court instead of the J&K High Court. “The High Court is fully functional. It has quashed 68 detention orders since August 2019 and confirmed 11,” he submitted.

The affidavit also claimed that Mr. Abdullah “purposefully failed” to make a representation before the Advisory Board constituted under the PSA or even the government against the detention. The Board is made up of a retired High Court judge and two principal judges.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hqzzwh/article30961922.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OMARABDULLAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-hear-on-march-5-plea-against-detention-of-omar-abdullah-under-psa/article30961923.ece
76,2020/03/02,Delhi violence: CJI says courts can’t stop things from happening,"He agrees to hear plea on Wednesday

Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde on Monday orally said courts were not “equipped” to handle palpable “pressure” being created to somehow step in and prevent violence in Delhi.

""We are not saying people should die. But this kind of pressure we are not equipped to handle. We cannot stop things from happening. We cannot prevent anything… We feel a kind of pressure on us... We cannot handle that. It is as if the court is responsible”, he remarked. Courts came into the picture only after an incident happened, he explained.

The CJI’s observations came when senior advocate Colin Gonsalves made a mentioning before him to urgently intervene and pass directions to arrest those delivering hate speeches and to prevent spread of violence.

Mr. Gonsalves was appearing for Maharashtra resident Shaikh Mujtaba Farooq and nine others from Delhi. The petitioners said they were attacked by mobs while peacefully protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Chief Justice Bobde agreed to hear their case on Wednesday (March 4).

Mr. Gonsalves alleged five or six prominent people were going about instigating violence. “At least 10 to 11 people are dying everyday. Last night, five or seven people died”, he submitted. The court should either take up the case in the afternoon or latest by Tuesday (March 3).

He said despite the deaths of people, a Delhi High Court Bench led by Chief Justice D.N. Patel had “very disappointingly” adjourned the next hearing in the case by six weeks. Earlier, the same High Court had adjourned a case for fair inquiry into the Jamia violence by several weeks, he submitted. Such long adjournments allowed these human rights cases to stagnate and gave the government elbow room, he stated.

But Chief Justice Bobde said courts could not handle such pressure.

“There are many things Your Lordships cannot handle, but we are here to help you... People are dying every day,” Mr. Gonsalves responded.

Chief Justice Bobde said, “We will hear, but you have to understand we cannot prevent such things from happening. We do wish peace, but we know we have limitations. We read media reports... it is as if we are somehow responsible”.

An inquiry committee headed by a retired judge should probe the police persons involved and exemplary compensation granted to victims. The Centre should be directed to call in the Army if the law and order situation further deteriorated, it stated.

The petition wanted the full list of persons detained by police and para-military forces made public and CCTV footage of riot-affected areas preserved.

78,2020/03/02,SC refuses to refer Article 370 matter to larger seven-judge Bench,"Constitution Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana says it will continue to hear the case on merits

A five-judge Constitution Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana on Monday declined a plea to refer to a larger Bench petitions challenging the abrogation of special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution.

The Bench said it would continue to hear the case on merits.

The President's notification on August 5 of 2019 abrogated the special status of J&K by blunting Article 370, which sources the privileges accorded to the erstwhile State in accordance with the assurances that were made in the Instrument of Accession signed between the J&K ruler and the Government of India.

After the order was pronounced, one of the lawyers for the petitioners sought an early date to resume the hearing.

The Bench said a date would be fixed after considering the dates for the nine-judge Sabarimala Bench.

The Bench had heard arguments and reserved its decision on whether there was a “direct conflict” between the judgments of 1959 and 1970 on the nature and extent of Article 370.

‘No conflict between orders’

Justice Ramana, who pronounced the 42-page order, concluded that there was no conflict between the 1959 and 1970 judgments.

The 1959 one, Prem Nath Kaul versus State of Jammu and Kashmir, indicated that Article 370 was applicable only till the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution was enacted on January 26, 1957. After that, no further changes could be made to the relationship between India and Jammu and Kashmir.

But the judgment reported in 1970 in Sampath Prakash versus State of Jammu and Kashmir was argued by some petitioners to have ignored the 1959 verdict by concluding that Article 370 was permanent in nature and a “perennial source of power” for the Centre to govern its relationship with the State of J&K.

The court explained that the “Constitution Bench in the Prem Nath Kaul case did not discuss the continuation or cessation of the operation of Article 370 after the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly of the State. This was not an issue in question before the court, unlike in the Sampat Prakash case, where the contention was specifically made before, and refuted by, the court”.

Finally, the order concluded that the court saw no reason to read into the Prem Nath Kaul case an interpretation that resulted in it being in conflict with its subsequent judgments.

“There are no contrary observations made in the Sampat Prakash case to that of Prem Nath Kaul, accordingly, the case of Sampat Prakash is not per incuriam,"" the Bench said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w2uo0/article30854010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-refuses-to-refer-article-370-matter-to-larger-seven-judge-bench/article30961396.ece
79,2020/03/02,"India is host to 457 migratory fauna, shows latest CMS list","While birds make up the bulk of such species, bats are the largest group of migratory mammals, according to scientists

With new additions to the wildlife list put out by the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species (CMS), scientists say that the total number of migratory fauna from India comes to 457 species. Birds comprise 83% (380 species) of this figure.

The Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) had for the first time compiled the list of migratory species of India under the CMS before the Conference of Parties (COP 13) held in Gujarat recently. It had put the number at 451. Six species were added later. They are the Asian elephant, great Indian bustard, Bengal florican, oceanic white-tip shark, urial and smooth hammerhead shark.

India’s role

“We had compiled a list of the 451 species of migratory animals found in India. With the addition of new species to the CMS Appendices, the number is now 457,” said Kailash Chandra, ZSI director.

Globally, more than 650 species are listed under the CMS appendices and India, with over 450 species, plays a very important role in their conservation, Mr. Chandra said.

Gopinathan Maheshwaran, who heads the avian section of the ZSI, said that birds make up the bulk of migratory species. Before COP 13, the number of migratory bird species stood at 378 and now it has reached 380.

According to Mr. Maheshwaran, the bird family Muscicapidae has the highest number of migratory species. “The next highest group of migratory birds is raptors or birds of prey, such as eagles, owls, vultures and kites which are from the family Accipitridae,” he added.

Mr. Maheshwaran said that the country has three flyways (flight paths used by birds): the Central Asian flyway, East Asian flyway and East Asian–Australasian flyway. Another group of birds that migrate in large numbers are waders or shore birds. In India, their migratory species number 41, followed by ducks (38) belonging to the family Anatidae.

The estimate of 44 migratory mammal species in India has risen to 46 after COP 13, said Lalit Sharma, who heads the wildlife section of the ZSI. The Asian elephant was added to Appendix I and the urial to Appendix II.

“The largest group of mammals is definitely bats belonging to the family Vespertilionidae. Dolphins are the second highest group of mammals with nine migratory species of dolphins listed,” he added.

Mr. Sharma pointed out that COP 13 has focussed on transboundary species and corridor conservation.

Fishes make up another important group of migratory species. Before COP 13, the ZSI had compiled 22 species, including 12 sharks and 10 ray fish. The oceanic white-tip shark and smooth hammerhead shark were then added, said K.K. Bineesh, a ZSI scientist. The total number of migratory fish species from India under CMS now stands at 24.

Seven reptiles, which include five species of turtles and the Indian gharial and salt water crocodile, are among the CMS species found in India. There was no addition to the reptiles list.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/z6fppy/article30958131.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/speciescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-is-host-to-457-migratory-fauna-shows-latest-cms-list/article30958132.ece
80,2020/03/02,"Water crisis looms large in Himalayan regions, finds study","Report flags rising dependence on freshwater springs

Eight towns in the Himalayan region of Bangladesh, Nepal, India and Pakistan were nearly 20%-70% deficient in their water supply, says a survey that appears in the latest edition of the journal Water Policy.

The researchers surveyed 13 towns across these countries to understand the challenges of the urban denizens of these regions. Unplanned urbanisation and climate change are the key factors responsible for the state of affairs, the study underlines.

Short-term strategies

The places surveyed are extremely dependent on springs (ranging between 50% and 100%) for their water, and three-fourths were in urban areas. Under current trends, the demand-supply gap may double by 2050, the researchers warn.

“Communities were coping through short-term strategies such as groundwater extraction, which is proving to be unsustainable. A holistic water management approach that includes springshed management and planned adaptation is therefore paramount,” Dr. Anjal Prakash of the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad, India, said in a statement.

“Across the region, the encroachment and degradation of natural water bodies (springs, ponds, lakes, canals, and rivers) and the growing disappearance of traditional water systems (stone spouts, wells, and local water tanks) are evident,” an accompanying press note underlines.

Although only 3% of the total Hindu Kush Himalayan population lives in larger cities and 8% in smaller towns, projections show that over 50% of the population will be living in cities by 2050, placing “tremendous stress” on water availability.

Rural areas have typically garnered much of the attention in terms of development and issues surrounding urban environments have been “sidelined”, the authors note.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/n65c62/article30957885.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01LAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/water-crisis-looms-large-in-himalayan-regions-find-study/article30957887.ece
81,2020/03/02,All eyes on Tulip Festival at Srinagar,"March event to attract locals and tourists to enjoy the spring season’s first blooming

From gauging the public mood to catching the early trends of the tourism sector in Kashmir, all eyes are on 13 lakh tulips blooming at Srinagar’s Indira Gandhi Memorial Tulip Garden this year.

After a long and harsh winter, the tulip garden, spread over 30 hectares at the foothills of Zabarwan hills facing the Dal Lake, is the first public event that will attract locals and tourists to enjoy the spring season’s first blooming.

This year, the Jammu and Kashmir Floriculture Department has added one lakh more tulip bulbs and five more varieties to its total collection of 12 lakh, to ensure its status as the Asia’s biggest tulip garden.

“The sprouting of bulbs is in progress and are expected to bloom at the scheduled time of the Tulip Festival in March,” Director Floriculture, Kashmir, Farooq Ahmed Rather said.

Thrown open in last week of March, the tulip festival provides a rare platform for locals to come out of homes and celebrate at one place. It saw a footfall of 2.58 lakh visitors in 2019, significantly up from one lakh visitors in 2014.

“It remains to be seen if the garden attracts locals or not. It will reflect a shift in mood. More than that, it’s important for the tourism industry that visitors start travelling to Kashmir. This will be the first indicator of the likely trajectory of the tourism season in Kashmir this year,” said Nasir Shah, tourism player who heads the Culture and Nature Expeditions (CNE) company.

Sheikh Altaf, in-charge of the garden, hopes to see the garden open for 40 days. “A water channel has been added too in the backyards of the garden to prolong visitors’ stay in the garden. We hope to see three lakh visitors this year,” Mr. Altaf said.

Origin in Persia

With origin in Persia, the tulip has travelled a long way to add colour and charm to the Valley. Kashmir’s tulip garden, compared to Holland’s Keukenhof, is home to more than 70 varieties of tulips of different colours.

The tourism industry suffered a major loss in 2019, with tourist flow slowing down by 33% to 5.58 lakh tourists from 8.30 lakh in 2018. Most of the foreign countries continue to have negative travel advisories for Jammu and Kashmir, since the August 5 move of the Centre.

Huge loss

According to the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI), the tourism sector suffered ₹2,615 crore loss and over 50,000 job losses since August 5, 2019, which saw a prolonged period of shutdown and a curfew on the use of Internet in the Valley.

83,2020/03/02,Soon Lepakshi mural paintings will narrate their tale,"ASI to arrange audio-visual commentary in Veerabhadra temple

The Veerabhadra temple at Lepakshi is known for its architecture and mural paintings, but very little authentic information is available on it. This scenario is set for a change as the mural paintings will soon speak. There will be an authentic audio-visual commentary relating to every panel of painting.

For understanding the cultural practices, the religious beliefs and the popular mythological stories of the 16th century Rayalaseema region, one needs to take a keen look at the mural paintings on the walls and roof of the mandapas of the Veerabhadra temple.

Very soon people can listen to an authentic version of the history and story behind the mural paintings with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) proposing a project to help all tourists and pilgrims know about it by listening to a commentary in popular languages for a small price.

Conservation

Unfortunately the vagaries of nature have spoiled the richness of these paintings. The ASI laboriously protects these paintings by giving a chemical treatment to the surface and plugging some leaking holes on the roof to stop further deterioration of the quality of the murals.

A chemical coat was given in 2017-18 financial year and another coat is scheduled in 2020-21. The Veerabhadra, Ramalingeswara temple, the ceiling of the mahamandapa of the Raghunatha temple, sayanagara, Parvati shrine around the Veerabhadra temple, and the mahamandapa between the main temple and natya mandapa are the places, where one needs to look for these paintings.

Many pilgrims visit the temple to worship the presiding deity Lord Shiva and barely notice the skills of the artisans of the Vijayanagara kingdom.

The authentic history of the temple and the place is not easily available for visitors. There are guides who do not have the official authority from the ASI or government agencies, but they are engaged by the tourists or pilgrims to satisfy their urge for some information.

“There is no consistent version of history or mythology that is told by these guides leading to the visitors taking home several different versions of the stories about the place and temple,” said Krishna Chaitanya representing the ASI.

Survey done

The ASI has proposed a kiosk on the outer edge of the temple where an audio-visual display would be available corresponding to every panel a visitor wishes to understand. A preliminary survey has been done and the audio-visual equipment would be placed there by the end of the next financial year.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wj4nqm/article30966346.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VJPAGEMURALPAINTINGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/soon-lepakshi-mural-paintings-will-narrate-their-tale/article30966347.ece

J&K Tourism Development Authority (JKTDA) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Nagendra Singh Jamwal said the Lord Venkateswara temple being established by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) would add a feather to the pilgrimage tourism in J&K.

MoU planned

“JKTDA is planning to have a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with A.P. and other tourism departments across the country, by mapping the gorgeous gardens, sparkling rivers, shrines, lakes, heritage structures, handicrafts, landscapes, trekking, valley and the beauty of nature in J&K in GIS,” Mr. Jamwal said.

Vijayawada Central MLA Malladi Vishnu said that Andhra Pradesh, which had historic temples, was known for temple tourism, and the government was keen on extending all help to JKTDA in promoting tourism.

Roadshow

Tours and Travels Association of Andhra president K. Vijaya Mohan said the people of Kashmir Valley and the local tour operators were very friendly and the hospitality of the travel and tour operators was good in J&K. He thanked the JKTA for helping the A.P. tourists during the recent floods and other calamities.

JKTDA assistant director Javid, JKTA organising committee chairman Nasir Shah and members participated.

Later, the authority officers and the tourism alliance members organised a roadshow and explained different packages being offered in J&K to the tour operators who came from Visakhapatnam, Rajamahendravaram, Tirupati, Vijayawada, Kakinada, Nellore and other places.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wev7cu/article30966310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VJPAGE3JANDKTOURISM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jammu-and-kashmir-a-safe-tourist-destination-say-officials/article30966311.ece

88,2020/03/02,CITU demands purchase of onions inside market yard,"Members of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) rallied inside the market yard on Monday, demanding that onions be purchased inside the yard. According to the protesters, traders have stopped purchasing onions in the market about 15 days ago.

Speaking with The Hindu, the president of market yard union, T. Ramudu explained that the government has recently changed policies. “Instead of having an auction, the government has started tendering. This has angered the traders, who are refusing to buy onions in the market,” he said.

Mr. Ramudu added that farmers are suffering due to the stalemate between government and traders. “The farmers are being forced to sell their produce outside the market yard. The farmers are losing their profits and even the government is not able to collect cess on the sales,” he added.

“Not just farmers, even the labourers who work in the market yard do not have any work,” he said. The CITU demanded that the government take necessary steps to make sure that the onions are purchased in the market yard.

Apart from that, the CITU demanded that a public toilet be opened for women in the yard. “It is causing inconvenience to women labourers as there is no toilet in the yard,” Mr. Ramudu said. The union also demanded that the yard’s gate towards the bus-stand be opened.

The protesters called on market yard secretary Jaya Lakshmi to submit a memorandum.

TDP senior leader and leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Yanamala Ramakrishnudu has said that it is the responsibility of the government to ensure the contentious points relating to the scrapping of the Capital Region Development Authority(CRDA) and the decentralisation Bill, which were rejected by the Council, were not presented in the speech by the Governor before the start of the Budget session. Addressing reporters at the party national office here on Monday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu said since the government prepares the speech of the Governor, the onus of ensuring that these contentious issues are not included in the speech rests on it.

Stating that the both Bills were referred to the Select Committee by the Chairperson of Legislative Council, which also rejected them under Rule71, the former Finance Minister said the government was trying to bring back the Bills through the Governor’s address.

“We will again oppose any move to introduce the Bills, as we urge the government not to bring them again for discussion in the Assembly,” said Mr. Ramakrishnudu.

90,2020/03/02,‘Save Amaravati’ campaign to be taken to Delhi,"Joint Action Committee chalks out course of action in Ongole

The Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti Joint Action Committee (APSJAC) on Monday decided to wage a protracted struggle against the three capitals move of the YSR Congress Party government.

Holding a strategic session here under the leadership of Andhra Pradesh Aquaculturists’ Association State general secretary A. Kondal Rayudu, they felt that the ‘Save Amaravati’ campaign should be taken to the streets of New Delhi to draw the attention of the BJP-led NDA government at Centre and demand its intervention to stop the decentralised capital move of the Jagan Mohan Reddy government.

“We are perplexed at the stance of the Bharatiya Janata Party. While a section of the leaders belong to the saffron party, led by its State president Kanna Lakshminarayana, expressed solidarity with the agitators, another group seems to be indifferent to the cause,” said Andhra Pradesh Farmers’ Federation president Yerneni Nagendranath.

The meeting decided to hold different forms of protests across the State from now as retaining the capital at Amaravati was just not the problem of farmers of the capital region but concerned the people of the entire State, said APSJAC Prakasam district convenor A. Venkteswara Rao. Congress president Rahul Gandhi would shortly visit the capital region to extend the party's support to the stir as the three capital, said its newly-appointed State vice-president Sripathi Prakasam.

91,2020/03/02,BJP complains to Governor on demolition of temples,"‘Govt. encouraging Owaisi to organise meets against CAA’

A delegation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by its State president Kanna Lakshminarayana submitted a memorandum to Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan at the Raj Bhavan here on Monday seeking action against the demolition of Hindu temples and the “attacks” on Hindu dharma.

Mr. Lakshminarayana told the Governor that the incident at Pithapuram in East Godavari in which some idols were desecrated and the burning of a temple chariot in Nellore district were being projected by the police as acts of some insane persons to dilute the investigation. He further said the government was encouraging Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi to incite religious passions by organising public meetings against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) after it was duly ratified by Parliament and Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the pains to assure the minority communities that the CAA posed no threat to their citizenship.

But, the All India Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen and some parties unleashed a vicious campaign on the sensitive issue to derive political mileage. It was intended to destabilise the Central government, he said.

Mr. Lakshminarayana alleged that a YSR Congress (YSRC) MLA provided funds for a meeting on CAA in Guntur where Mr. Owaisi made a provocative speech. He said Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has no right to continue to be the Chief Minister if his party extended tacit support to forces which were bent on driving a wedge among various sections of society.

Dues to paddy farmers

The State BJP chief said he took various issues to the notice of the Governor and highlighted the fact that the State government owed ₹2,000 crore to farmers for paddy procurement done by it and a sum of ₹500 crore towards the subsidy given by the Central government to Gopala Mitra groups was pending release for a long time.

92,2020/03/02,Sex workers seek ‘unorganised sector’ tag,"They oppose women’s groups who label them as victims

Even as March 3 is observed as the 20th International Sex Workers Rights Day, the community is keen to become the new entrant into the ‘unorganised sector’.

New Network of Sex Workers (NNSW) has been calling for their profession to be recognised as ‘work’, as it is voluntarily chosen by consenting adults. The sex workers have always been at loggerheads with the ‘reformers’ and champions of anti-trafficking activities, who they say seek to ‘reform’ them by denying them the right to articulate their life choices.

It all started in 2001 when over 25,000 sex workers had gathered in Kolkata to oppose the women’s groups that sought to label them as ‘victims’ who had to be rehabilitated. The violence against sex workers witnessed next year further strengthened their grit and they decided not to be ‘shouted down’ by starting to observe the day on March 3. With 1.5 lakh members, the NNSW is said to be the largest network of the fraternity comprising male, female and transgenders representing 60 organisations.

Blame the narration

Sex workers decry the very ‘victim of trafficking’ narration put forth by the government agencies. “All sex workers are portrayed as victims of trafficking, brothels as dens of exploitation and clients as abusers perpetrating trafficking. This discourse has more than effectively moulded the average citizen’s opinion of sex workers. Also, the State leaves no stone unturned to ‘rescue’ sex workers, while they are actually hitting at their very source of livelihood,” says R. Meera, Secretary of Women’s Initiatives (WINS), a social organisation working for the rights of sex workers. Section 370 of Indian Penal Code is being misinterpreted and abused by law enforcement agencies to arrest their clients, she pointed out.

Ms. Meera cites a study titled ‘Raided’ published by VAMP (Sangli), Saheli Sangh (Pune), Kerala Network of Sex Workers, UKMO Karnataka and JSS Jharkhand in 2018 that revealed how sex workers were forcibly ‘rescued’ and sent to rehabilitation homes. “Seventy per cent of the rescued women returned to their profession after being released, which shows they are not victims as being projected, but voluntarily chose the profession,” she explained.

The NNSW also appeals to the government to consult the sex workers groups before passing the Anti-Trafficking Bill, waiting since 2017.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/y52a0z/article30965831.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03-VJ-SEXWORKERSDAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sex-workers-seek-unorganised-sector-tag/article30965832.ece

94,2020/03/02,A.P. not in list for WB-aided scheme for water-stressed areas,"Union Minister of State responds to YSRCP MP’s question in RS

The Union Minister of State for Jal Shakti and Social Justice and Empowerment Rattan Lal Kataria has said that Andhra Pradesh was not in the list of States that benefited from the ₹6,000-crore Atal Bhujal Yojana partially funded by the World Bank.

Answering an unstarred question raised by the leader of the YSR Congress Parliamentary Party V. Vijaya Sai Reddy in the Rajya Sabha, the Minister replied that 8,353 gram panchayats in seven States, that is, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh have been selected for the scheme during the period 2020-21 to 2024-25.

The Minister said that under the Central Sector Scheme the groundwater resources would be developed and managed sustainably with community participation. The scheme was being implemented with the financial assistance of the World Bank with a sharing pattern of 50:50 between the Government of India and the World Bank.

Selection criteria

The names of the participating States were decided based on consultation, criticality of groundwater situation, willingness and degree of preparedness, Mr. Kataria said.

Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy in his question wanted to know why the Rayalaseema region which was water stressed and the groundwater resources were over exploited was not included in the project. He also sought the reasons for the exclusion of the drought-prone region, but the Minister’s answer was a general one.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/e0n2ws/article30965345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VJVIJAYASAIREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ap-not-in-list-for-wb-aided-scheme-for-water-stressed-areas/article30965346.ece

The government has set up 1,820 paddy procurement centres in the State to see that farmers do not face any hassles and the state has so far procured 44 lakh tonnes during the kharif marketing season, said Civil Supplies Department Commissioner Kona Sasidhar.

The farmers are receiving spot payment mostly and in some cases there was delay as there there was delay in the clearance of dues by the Central government. The matter was taken up by the State with the Union Civil Supplies Minister in New Delhi, he said.

The second and third quarter funds are due to the State government, the Commissioner said. That is the reason behind the delay in the clearance of payments over the past two weeks. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has held a high-level review meeting in this regard and directed the department to take advances from banks and Nabard to clear the dues of the farmers.

The farmers’ dues would be cleared by Wednesday, he said, it was not fair on the part of a section of the media to blow the issue out of proportion. He asked the farmers to call toll-free number 1902 in case of any problems arising in paddy procurement.

A five-day national training programme on millets discussed the possibilities of intercropping millets in commercial crops and major millets.

Since the area that had been traditionally used to cultivate millets is presently replaced by cash crops like soya, groundnut and cotton intercropping is an option to bring back millets, according to M.L. Sanyasi Rao, Programme Manager of Watershed Support Services and Support Network (WASSAN).

A total of 30 participants from Punjab, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have participated in the programme organised here from February 26.

The main aim of the training was to discuss best practices on millet production, processing facilities, value chain mechanism, marketing etc. and to share and exchange the Andhra Pradesh and Odisha Millet Mission experiences on millets with the north and central Indian regions.

Participants from Madhya Pradesh and Punjab raised the issue of moisture in Kodo millet leading to food poisoning.

Field visits

The five-day programme comprised three days of practical training, including field visits, and two-day classroom sessions.

In the technical sessions resource persons like Principal Scientist from Agriculture Research Station, Vizianagaram, Samuel Patro, nutritionist Salome Yesudas and an expert on millet processing units, Srinivas, an expert on farm mechanisation and, Peter, Dinesh Kumar and Susantha from Regularising Rain-fed Agriculture (RRA) Network, delivered lectures.

Mr. Sanyasi Rao spoke about the experience of millets production and processing in Andhra Pradesh particularly ‘Guli ragi’ system and zero-budget natural farming practices.

An exposure visit was organised to Seethampeta in Srikakulam district to interact with ‘Guli ragi’ farmers and to witness the use of tools like cycle de-weeding, wheel sprayer, etc. Participants also visited Manyam Grains Pvt Ltd, a millet processing unit established at Mamidipalli village in Anakapalle mandal.

97,2020/03/02,CM to formally launch APEMCL,"The corporation to work in coordination with Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board

The State government, through an order recently, established AP Environmental Waste Management Corporation Limited (APEMCL) which acts as a facilitator between waste generating industry and companies that use industrial waste for other purposes such as fuel. Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy will formally launch the corporation soon.

The APEMCL will provide an effective mechanism for collection, transportation, storage, treatment, processing, delivery, and disposal of industrial and other waste. The corporation, which works in coordination with the AP Pollution Control Board (APPCB), will also follow the ‘platform business model’.

When contacted, APPCB Chairman B.S.S. Prasad says that the APEMCL obtained the authorisation of the APPCB on February 17 as a facilitator of the waste disposal from a generator to the receiver. Both generator and receiver should benefit from the disposal of the waste. So, a pricing committee for fixing the charges for the waste management plus a service charge for the corporation. It will be in line with the pricing strategy adopted by the bio-medical waste sector. A tripartite agreement will be reached between the generator, the receiver and the APEMCL in the process.

Categories

The industry has to dispose of the hazardous and other wastes as per the disposal option given through the APEMCL. A total of 5,485 industries located in the State fall under red and orange categories (Industrial sectors having pollution index score of 60 and above - Red category; industrial sectors having pollution index score of 41 to 59 – Orange category). Of this, 2,550 fall under Visakhapatnam zone, while 2,117 are in Vijayawada zone. Remaining are in Kurnool zone, he says.

These industries generate significant quantities of liquid waste, hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste and air pollutants. The waste generated by these industries can be a source of fuel for other industries. For instance, the waste generated in a pharma industry can be fuel, if processed, to cement companies. So, the government came up with the decision to manage and scientifically dispose of the waste, he says.

Objective

The existing waste transportation, storage, treatment, and disposal facilities in the State are apparently not equipped to handle such large amounts of waste. Here, the role of APEMCL comes into the picture. One of the objectives of APEMCL is to enhance these facilities so that they can sufficiently deal with industrial and other waste, he says.

The government has constituted the Board of Directors for APEMCL with Special Chief Secretary (Environment Forests Science and Technology EFS&T) as Chairman. APPCB chairman will be the member secretary of the Board. While commissioner (industries), APIIC managing director, Commissioner (transport) and APEMC managing director will act as directors. The government is yet to appoint the managing director of the board, he adds.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cm-to-formally-launch-apemcl/article30965179.ece

The State government has accorded administrative sanction of up to ₹ 5 lakh each for 76 churches and church-run-institutions across the State for grant-in-aid towards construction and repairs under a Minorities Welfare Department scheme against proposals received by the district Collectors between 2016 and early 2019.

Principal Secretary to Govt. Md. Ilyas Rizvi issued a Government Order to this effect on Monday.

As part of the scheme, 66 churches and church-run-institutions would be given ₹5 lakh each and 10 others would be given less than ₹5 lakh for carrying out construction or repairs, renovations, construction of compound walls and others by the A.P. State Christian (Minorities) Corporation, the order states. The total grand-in-aid amounts to about ₹3.6 crore.

The Mandal Parishad Development Officers or Municipal Commissioners concerned would have to verify and ensure that the institution doesn’t violate any rules and works are completed in three months.

The churches recommended by the Collectors are from Krishna, Kurnool, Prakasam, East Godavari, West Godavari, Anantapur and Kadapa districts.

The scheme of supporting churches in carrying out repairs, maintenance, new construction and others was first introduced in 2002 and a sum of ₹30, 000 towards repairs and ₹1 lakh as a maximum permissible amount towards new constructions was announced.

Later the maximum permissible amount was enhanced to ₹3 lakh in 2016 and ₹5 lakh in 2018 by the then government.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/grant-in-aid-sanctioned-for-infrastructure-at-churches/article30965148.ece

The official said that the raid parties had zeroed in on Chittapra and Rasanapalle in Chittoor rural and thandas in Madanapalle division.

Surveillance at check posts

“Our personnel had mounted surveillance at the border check posts. Our constant exercises during the last couple of months have contributed to the drastic fall in the ID liquor making and transportation of the contraband across inter-State borders. There is also a fall in the crime rate in the district. Those working at the liquor dens are forced to find alternative means of livelihood,” she said.

Naga Lakshmi said that earlier, a few members of the ID liquor making units had caused tried obstructing the path of the raid parties by placing boulders on the approach roads. “Such incidents have recently taken place near Madanapalle. The police are also alert to the possibilities of physical attacks by the men at ID liquor dens,” the official said.

The youth alleged that Tahsildar Mahboob Basha had promised creating a layout and providing house sites to all the poor who had put up huts there. But the promise never materialised and some new beneficiaries were seen in the latest list of house site pattas to be given on Ugadi, he reportedly told the police demanding action against the MRO.

Missing names in beneficiaries’ list

Three years ago about 400 people had built huts in 12 acres of land in Survey No. 356 with the Communist Party of India (CPI) taking the lead. However, those were forcibly removed on December 27 last year. When the CPI leaders sat on an indefinite fast opposing the removal, residents were promised house site pattas by Ugadi. When they did not find their names in the latest list of beneficiaries, they again pitched huts on the government land 15 days ago.

Officials said the land belonged to the State government and only eligible people would be given house site pattas. Further, they said any encroachments would be cleared and they began removing the huts with the help of JCBs with police personnel on the watch.

CPI leader lobbies

The CPI district secretary D. Jagadeesh also went to the spot when he came to know that the huts were being removed. The CPI leader came to the District Collector’s office to represent the matter at ‘Spandana’ progarmme. However, officials declined to to oblige his plea to spare the huts.

Meanwhile, a police picket has been set up at the site to ensure no untoward incident takes place.

Acharya Nagarjuna University(ANU) will introduce foreign language courses for students looking for a promising career overseas, said Vice-Chancellor P. Rajasekhar.

Students will have an option to pursue higher studies in countries like Germany, France, China and Japan after completing the Post Graduate Diploma courses to be offered by ANU, said Mr. Rajasekhar, during his visit to the ANU P.G.Centre here.

“We are planning on introducing the language courses offered by Hyderabad-based Institute of English and Foreign Languages for the benefit of students in Andhra Pradesh,” he told The Hindu.

Some of the new courses included linguistic and translation studies and comparative literature. A Centre for South Indian languages including Tamil and Kannada would also be brought in place to offer diploma courses on the Dravidian languages, he said.

105,2020/03/02,JAC flays police for disallowing it to hold meeting against CAA,"‘It is nothing but clamping down on freedom of expression’

The Adoni JAC, which is spearheading the agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), has criticised the police for denying it permission to organise a public meeting at Adoni in the district on Sunday.

Addressing the media here, the JAC members accused the police of clamping down on freedom of expression.

“We approached the Adoni DSP seeking permission 14 days ago. On Saturday, the police denied us permission stating that Section 30 is in force in the town,” the JAC members said.

The JAC members, however, asserted that they would continue with their efforts to spread awareness among people on the three issues.

Special Correspondent in Anantapur writes: The Left parties demanded that the Centre repeal the CAA and desist from implementing the NRC and the NPR. Flagging off a bus yatra here, they vowed to spread awareness on the “draconian laws.” CPI(M) district secretary V. Rambhupal, along with CPI district secretary D.

107,2020/03/02,Yoga turns into a movement among kids in this mandal,"8-year-old champion Pujitha becomes an inspiration to many

An eight-year-old girl from Thanam, a small village near Parawada, about 50 km from here, has turned into a yoga expert in a span of four years, thanks to the CSR initiative of the NTPC Simhadri Super Thermal Power Plant.

Hailing from a BPL family with her father eking out a living as a daily wage earner, the story of K. Srujana Pujitha from the Government Residential School at Thanam has become a source of inspiration to many.

An academically average student with no big ambition, her life changed when she started training under a certified yoga trainer engaged by NTPC Simhadri in 2016. With seriousness and passion to improve, she learnt the art very fast. Now she practises over 200 types of asanas, including the most difficult ‘purnaruchika, mayura, purnachalaba and ganda berunda.’

Promising future

“She has already won several awards and I am sure she has the potential to win at international level provided proper encouragement is given to her,” yoga teacher Ch. Anjaneyulu told The Hindu.

With increasing recognition of her expertise, she is quite elated and determined to learn further. “Sky is the limit for me to learn to keep myself healthy,” she said.

From securing the silver medal in Nellore State-level competition in 2018 to a gold in Kurnool at another State-level event in 2019 and a bronze at the district level, Pujitha became the first girl ever from Visakhapatnam to be selected for an international yoga competition held in Chandigarh in 2018.

She aims to take up a government job in the future to bring financial security to her family. Her parents are now very happy that she has a promising future. Drawing inspiration from her, her younger sibling has also started learning yoga.

Support for trainees

NTPC Simhadri under its CSR programme is imparting yoga training by engaging Mr. Anjaneyulu. Currently, it is being taught to over 4,000 students of government schools in Parawada mandal.

An official of NTPC Simhadri said besides promoting yoga in a big way, they were also providing yoga suits, equipment, mats and travel expenditure for students to enable them to take part in various events.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/nc4o51/article30959079.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02VJPAGEYOGA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/yoga-turns-into-a-movement-among-kids-in-this-mandal/article30959080.ece
108,2020/03/02,"Traffickers target tribal children from A.P., 4 other States","They are being engaged as bonded labour, say NGO organisers

The poor and illiterate people of the Agency areas of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha and Chhattisgarh are easy prey for traffickers who are luring them with job offers.

“More than 200 tribal folk, particularly children and women, were trafficked in the last few years, of which 50% were children aged between 8 and 15 years. Taking advantage of the poverty and illiteracy among the tribes and adivasis, mediators are exploiting them,” an NGO organiser said.

The rescue of six tribal children of Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh on February 25 once again exposed the trafficking of poor tribal people to plain areas of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. About 20 youth of the same place were also found travelling to Salem for work. All the rescued, including five minor boys and a girl of Jagdalpur, belong to Gond tribe and were engaged as bonded labourers.

On February 27, the railway police rescued four tribal children near Visakhapatnam and they were also found to be from the agency areas in Chhattisgarh.

Bus intercepted

On a tip-off, an NGO, Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA) along with the CID police, intercepted a private bus going from Jagdalpur to Tamil Nadu and rescued the victims. Police took two alleged traffickers, Mithilesh and Kiran, into custody on February 25.

“BBA Jagdalpur coordinator Sandeep observed the movements of the traffickers in the tribal hamlets and alerted us, and we rescued the children with the help of AP CID and the Ibrahimpatnam police,” said State BBA coordinator G. Tirupati Rao.

Network in hamlets

In 2016, the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) officials raided an NGO campus at Nidamarru in Krishna district and rescued 35 tribal children, natives of Odisha, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. In the same year, an NGO Saathi rescued 13 Gond tribe girls. They were from Kishangunj district in Bihar and Kanker district of Chhattisgarh.

The Government Railway Police (GRP) rescued 15 tribal girls of Odisha at the Vijayawada railway station and took the alleged trafficker, Reena, into custody in February 2017. The girls were engaged in a spinning mill at Timmapuram village in Guntur district.

“Last year, a city-based NGO rescued 12 tribal girls aged between 10 and 14 years,” the CWC members said.

A police officer preferring anonymity said the mediators developed contacts with the suppliers in tribal hamlets in Jagdalpur, Kanker, Malkangiri, Visakhapatnam Rural and other places, who were paid ₹5,000 and above per head.

Horrible conditions

“The working conditions are horrible. We have to stay in sheds and work for more than 18 hours a day. There are no medical facilities, toilets and bathrooms. In some places, security personnel and dogs prevented us from leaving or seeking help,” said a minor boy.

Mr. Tirupati Rao said there were instances of exploitation of minor girls at work spots. The government should step up vigil on trafficking through trains, buses and private vehicles. Police, Revenue, Labour, Women Development and Child Welfare, Education and other department officials should conduct raids to prevent trafficking of tribal children, the BBA State coordinator said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/8cbub4/article30961010.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02VJONGPAGE2TRAFFICKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/traffickers-target-tribal-children-from-ap-4-other-states/article30959041.ece
109,2020/03/02,‘CCTV footage will disprove TDP claim on rowdies at airport’,"Protest was voluntary, spontaneous outburst by people, says YSRCP leader

YSR Congress Party senior leader Koyya Prasad Reddy on Sunday dismissed as a bunch of lies the allegation of TDP that goons from Kadapa and Pulivendula were responsible for blocking the convoy of former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu at the Visakhapatnam Airport on Thursday.

“CCTV footage will prove that not a single rowdy was present at the airport. In fact, people from North Andhra gathered voluntarily to express their ire over Mr. Naidu for spitting venom against the State Government’s decision to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital,” he told reporters.

Admitting that he was also present at the airport in his personal capacity to register his protest over Mr. Naidu’s ‘pro-Amaravati and anti-North Andhra stand,’ he said YSRCP as a party had no role in the protest. In fact, the people were so furious over Mr. Naidu’s statements against North Andhra that they did not want to allow him to undertake a visit in the region, he claimed.

“Whatever happened at the airport was a spontaneous outburst by the people who wanted to see North Andhra region get benefited due to decentralised development model being adopted by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy,” he said.

He said in the TDP itself Mr. Naidu did not have much following, adding Visakhapatnam East MLA Ganta Srinivasa Rao, West MLA P.G.V.R. Naidu and former Minister Ch. Ayyanna Patrudu did not visit the airport to welcome Mr. Naidu.

‘Time for U-turn’

Mr. Reddy said the TDP president was known for making a series of U-turns in the past and appealed to him to make another U-turn in the larger interest of the State by supporting formation of three capitals.

He found fault with Mr. Naidu’s wife Nara Bhuvaneswari for “enacting a drama by spending two hours at the airport and accompanying the TDP president to Hyderabad instead of attending the wedding of Mr. Patrudu’s son”.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cctv-footage-will-disprove-tdp-claim-on-rowdies-at-airport/article30959027.ece

The 24-year-old software professional who tested positive for COVID-19 in Hyderabad on Monday worked for a Bengaluru-based company. He had travelled by an Indigo flight from Dubai to Bengaluru on February 20 and had worked with 13 colleagues in the Bengaluru office before coming to Hyderabad by bus on February 22.

This has sent the Health departments of both Telangana and Karnataka on an overdrive to identify all the people who came in contact with him since the night of February 20.

In Telangana, the Health Department officials have constituted a 20-member team of doctors and para-medics under the supervision of the District Medical and Health Officer, Hyderabad, to treat the patient and eight of his family members. The Health Department is trying to zero in on all the 27 passengers who had travelled by GO Tour Travels and Holidays AC sleeper bus on February 22.

112,2020/03/02,‘Students should know about culture of the land’,"Writer Vijaya Sridhar has said that an education system that lays equal emphasis on the enrichment of intellectual and emotional faculties of the children was the need of the hour.

She was delivering the presidential address at the district-level Kannada Sahitya Sammelana held in the city on Monday.

She said that scoring good marks in the exam should not become the sole purpose of education. The children should be apprised of the rich culture and tradition of the land and their obligations towards the environment and the society. An educated person who has knowledge of the cultural tradition of the land and is sensitive to the problems faced by the common people can bring positive changes in the society. In the present employment scenario, the youths with emotional intelligence are in great demand and are offered good jobs, she said.

Regret

Expressing regret over the decline in enrolment to Kannada medium schools, she pressed the State government to take determined decisions to save Kannada medium education. She said that women writers in Kannada are experimenting with diverse themes in recent times. She also called upon the women writers to strive to create awareness on the evils of drug and alcohol addiction through their literary works.

Speaking on the occasion, writer Sannarama demanded implementation of the Dr. Sarojini Mahishi report on reservation of jobs for Kannadigas in the private sector.

113,2020/03/02,Bill to acquire lands for industrial projects tabled,"It replaces Ordinance promulgated on November 20, 2019

In a bid to attract investors and provide them land in the State, the government on Monday introduced the Karnataka Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2020, in the Legislative Assembly for amending Section 109 of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act, 1961. This pertains to acquisition and conversion of agricultural lands for industrial purposes.

The Bill provided for deemed exemption to purchase land for industrial purpose to the extent approved by the State High Level Clearance Committee (SHLCC) or the State Single Window Clearance Committee under the Karnataka Industrial (Facilitation) Act, 2002.

It also granted permission for sale of lands exempted under section 109 after utilising such land for a period of seven years for the purpose for which it was permitted. The Bill replaced the Ordinance promulgated on November 20, 2019.

After the SHLCC, the Chief Minister under his chairmanship clears investment projects. In case the land acquisition was delayed after the SHLCC’s approval, then the process for land acquisition would be considered as “deemed approval.”

The Bill was tabled in the background of the government’s decision to hold a Global Investors’ Meet in Bengaluru in November 2020.

Other Bills

The Karnataka Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Bill, 2020 was tabled in the House to make a deemed provision for change of land use from the master plan whenever any land is procured by the Planning Authority, Local Authority, Karnataka Housing Board, Karnataka Slum Development Board, Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board, Karnataka Small Scale Industries Development Corporation or Rajiv Gandhi Rural Housing Corporation Ltd. for public purpose.

The other Bill tabled was the Karnataka Regulation of Pay and Pension of Teacher in Higher Educational Institutions Bill, 2020, to regulate pay, pension and pensionary benefits admissible to the teacher working in government colleges, universities established by the law and in government aided higher educational institutions under the control of the State government. It replaced the Ordinance promulgated earlier.

For Universities

The Karnataka State Universities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, was tabled to bifurcate Gulbarga University and to establish Raichur University.

It would cover Raichur and Yadgir districts.

The Sarvajna Kshetra Development Authority Bill, 2020, was tabled to establish the authority for development and maintenance of the Sarvajna Kshetra, including the place of birth of Sarvajna and other places situated around Hirekerur in Haveri district.

114,2020/03/02,Madhu Bangarappa launches attack on JD(S) leadership,"The simmering discontent within the Janata Dal (Secular) seems to be coming out in the open. A few months after the party MLCs met to express dissatisfaction over the way senior leaders treated them, it was the turn of former legislator and party’s working president Madhu Bangarappa, who on Monday blamed the party seniors for leaders quitting the party.

“The party leaders are taking wrong decisions. If action is not taken to remove confusion, the party may face a major tragedy,” he told presspersons. Identifying himself as an “inactive leader” in the JD(S), he said: “I will not resign on my own. If they want, they can ask for my resignation or remove me. The party workers and I are hurt. Workers have lost confidence in the party and it is not responsive to workers.”

Mr. Madhu was responding to the statement of former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who recently said that those who want to leave the party to achieve bigger things could go, and that he could not be convincing them.

His outburst in public comes close on the heels of another party leader and former Minister G.T. Deve Gowda going against the party’s decision to not participate in the election to elect an MLC.

He turned his ire at the nomination of Ramesh Gowda and Dharme Gowda, who are currently MLCs. “Who decided on nominating Mr. Ramesh Gowda? The party should seek his resignation. Similarly, Mr. Dharme Gowda wanted to leave the party. Even he should not have been made MLC,” he alleged.

Mr. Madhu said that Basavaraj Horatti was sad while he stepped down from the post of Legislative Council’s chairmanship. “If (former JD(S) State president) H. Vishwanath was made Minister, he would not have quit the party. Many in the party worked to bring a wedge between Mr. Vishwanath and Mr. Kumaraswamy. I had tried to convince Mr. Vishwanath not to quit the party.”

Meanwhile, a couple of legislators told The Hindu that Mr. Madhu was airing the problems within the party. “He is upset that the party did not identify him. He was forced to contest elections twice for Lok Sabha.”

A legislator said that most party leaders and workers are upset at the way they were ignored during the 14-month tenure of JD(S)-Congress coalition government, and even now the leadership, including former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and Mr. Kumaraswamy, is not trying to address the disenchantment among the leaders and workers.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/madhu-bangarappa-launches-attack-on-jds-leadership/article30965626.ece
115,2020/03/02,Pell-mell in Assembly over Yatnal’s controversial remarks on Doreswamy,"Opposition protests result in CM cutting short his reply on motion of thanks to Governor’s address

Bharatiya Janata Party MLA and former Union Minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal’s controversial remarks — describing H.S. Doreswamy as a “fake freedom fighter” and “Pakistan agent” — created ruckus in the Legislative Assembly on Monday with both the Opposition Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) members staging a dharna in the well of the House seeking permission to discuss the issue.

The protest by the Opposition came in the way of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa replying to the debate on motion of thanks to the address by Governor Vajubhai R. Vala to the joint session. The Chief Minister had to wind up and restrict his reply to 15 minutes as nothing could be heard in the din.

Speaker Vishveshwar Hegde Kageri adjourned the House twice before finally adjourning for the day as the Opposition members refused to withdraw their protest.

Earlier, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah raised the issue of “derogatory” remarks by Mr. Yatnal soon after the House paid tributes to three dignitaries who died recently. But the Speaker said he would consider providing permission to Mr. Siddaramaiah after completion of the Chief Minister’s reply as listed in the day’s agenda. However, Mr. Siddaramaiah insisted that the issue be taken up before the Chief Minister’s reply as it was a serious matter that amounted to breach of Constitutional provisions.

“It is a matter that amounts to contempt of the House as a BJP MLA has insulted the freedom fighter,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said, and urged the Speaker to use his discretionary powers to allow him to raise the issue.

However, Law Minister J.C. Madhuswamy appealed to the Speaker to stick to the pre-decided agenda, while Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi too endorsed his views.

The Speaker asked the Chief Minister to commence his reply, but this angered the Opposition members who trooped into the well of the House and began their protest. They shouted slogans against those violating Constitutional provisions.

After lunch, the Opposition Congress members continued to remain in the well of the House demanding the Speaker to allow discussion on the matter using his discretionary powers under Rule 363 of the House. The Speaker asked Mr. Siddaramaiah to submit a notice seeking detailed discussion.

He said the issue was not an emergency one as leaders of the ruling and Opposition were trading charges about Mr. Yatnal’s remark for the past one week.

Mr. Siddaramaiah insisted that the matter was serious and significant. Mr. Yediyurappa too suggested the Congress members should give in writing seeking a discussion on the the matter.

Amidst of all these, RDPR Minister K.S. Eshwarappa urged the Speaker to suspend Mr. Siddaramaiah from the House for calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi a “mass murderer” in the past.

As Congress members refused to withdraw their protest and continued slogans against the government, the Speaker conducted the proceedings of the House and asked the Minister to table Bills. A total of eight Bills were tabled amidst slogans and counter-slogans by the Opposition and ruling party members.

With Congress members continuing to protest before the Chair, the Speaker adjourned the House for the day. Mr. Kageri said the House would discuss about the Constitution and its relevance on Tuesday and Wednesday.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/msz1k2/article30965610.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGCOUNCILRUCKUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pell-mell-in-assembly-over-yatnals-controversial-remarks-on-doreswamy/article30965611.ece

“People of the State are with us, which was evident with the results of the recent byelections to the Assembly and general elections to Lok Sabha. If you continue to criticise us, then people will start talking lightly about you. I’m saying this out of concern for you,” Mr. Yediyurappa told the Opposition during his reply in the Assembly to the address by Governor Vajubhai R. Vala to the joint session of the State legislative Houses.

“Numbers are important in democracy. We have proved that we have the support of people by winning 12 of the 15 Assembly seats that went to bypolls. This is a moral victory for the government and the party. We won 26 seats (including Mandya) in the Lok Sabha polls as against only one by you,” he said, particularly in reference to Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah.

In his 15-minute reply, which was read out amidst din by the Opposition members, the Chief Minister maintained that his government had handled rescue and rehabilitation of flood-hit people in an efficient and transparent manner.

He wondered how far it was correct to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not visiting the flood-hit areas when Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and a team of officials had inspected these areas.

Describing the notification of the Mahadayi Water Disputes Tribunal’s award by the Union government as a big victory, he reiterated that the State government would earmark funds in the State Budget for taking up the project on a fast-track basis.

‘Won’t give even an inch of land’

Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa on Monday declared that there was no question of giving away even an inch of land to the neighbouring State of Maharashtra, which was trying to “rake up” the boundary issue.

A king cobra, which was also kept in quarantine, died on Saturday following liver problem, according to the zoo authorities.

The tiger and two pairs of king cobra, along with lesser whistling teal and monitor lizard, had been brought to the zoo under an animal exchange programme from Pilikula Biological Park in Mangaluru on February 28. They had been kept in the quarantine enclosures after their arrival.

The sudden deaths has shocked the zoo management and the veterinarians, who have retrieved some organs from the deceased tiger and king cobra and sent them to the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals in Bengaluru for further investigation for ascertaining what led to the death. “The deaths were sudden and our vets had very little scope to save them,” said zoo Executive Director Ajit Kulkarni.

The tiger collapsed in its enclosure and the vets suspected heart attack as the reason. “The tiger and cobra were found to be in good health when our vets went to Pilikula to pick them up,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tiger-king-cobra-die-at-mysuru-zoo/article30965565.ece
118,2020/03/02,Unseasonal rains stave off fire threat,"Moderate to heavy rains lashed Bandipur and Nagarahole national parks on Monday providing short-term relief from the scourge of forest fires.

Almost 70 per cent of Bandipur received good showers lasting nearly 70 minutes and it has soaked and saturated the soil. T. Balachandra, Director, Bandipur Tiger Reserve, said GS Betta, Bandipur, Omkara, Kalkere, Hediyala, Nugu, and part of Kundkere ranges received showers and this will help stave off fire for at least another 10 days.

“In case we receive another spell of rains it will facilitate the growth of fresh shoots and will significantly diminish the threat of forest fire.’’

Similarly, Veeranahosahalli, Anechowkur and other parts of Nagarahole received rains which will provide relief for a few days against the outbreak of fire. Unseasonal rains lashed most parts of Mysuru district and surrounding regions, providing relief from the searing heat.

Mysuru city received light to moderate rains in the early hours of Monday. But there was a sudden burst of showers late in the afternoon lasting nearly 30 minutes which helped bring down the temperature to a certain extent.

119,2020/03/02,"Funds sought for airport expansion, Kushalnagar railway line","Progress of two infrastructure projects in Mysuru region hinges on allocation made by government in State Budget

All eyes are on the State Budget as the progress of two infrastructure projects in Mysuru hinges on government’s allocation of funds.

The two projects are the airport expansion and the railway line to Kushalnagar both of which have been grounded for some time now though they have received administrative nod and clearance.

The expansion of Mysuru airport depends on the purchase of land and its transfer to the Airport Authority of India (AAI) which can take up the runway extension. According to the authorities, the existing airport is spread over 490 acres and the first phase of the expansion project requires 115 acres.

This will pave way for extending the runway length from 1,740 metres to 2,400 metres so as to facilitate operation of Boeing and Airbus flights which cannot operate at present due to the short runway. This has prevented the introduction of more direct and long-distance flights from Mysuru to the rest of the country. At present only ATR type of aircraft provide short-haul flights from Mysuru to Chennai, Hyderabad, Goa, Belagavi and Bengaluru.

Mysuru MP Pratap Simha has sounded off Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to make allocation for land acquisition in the budget to be presented on March 5. He said the total extent of land required for airport expansion was 240 acres but provision for 115 acres of land should be made to expedite the runway extension. Mr.Simha has sought ₹200 crore from the Chief Minister to facilitate land acquisition by KIADB so that it can be transferred to AAI.

Sources in the AAI said once the land is transferred, the work on runway extension and subway construction will commence simultaneously as the Director General of Civil Aviation has already given the go-ahead for subway construction in Mysuru. Stakeholders in the tourism and industrial and business sector aver that once the airport is expanded the economy of the region could witness a drastic change as it would not only lure more investors, resulting in establishment of industrial units, but also give a boost to the tourism sector.

The other project is the railway line connecting Mysuru to Kushalnagar which not only lacks traction but also has no support from a large section of the people in Mysuru and Kodagu.

The 87-km-long new railway line also has received administrative clearance but its progress hinges on land allocation by the State government. Otherwise, the project has a negative rate of return as per the railway cost-economic analysis. Hence Mr.S imha has appealed to Mr. Yediyurappa to acquire land and transfer it to the railways besides making financial allocation in the budget for the project to get started.

However, the railway line project has evoked strong opposition on the grounds that it would be environmentally disastrous for the hilly district of Kodagu which was devastated by landslides and floods in 2018 and 2019. It could also escalate human-elephant conflict which is already high in the region and hence there is a demand for jettisoning the project.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/i2iclh/article30965552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02MYSAIRPORT2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/funds-sought-for-airport-expansion-kushalnagar-railway-line/article30965553.ece
120,2020/03/02,State seeks special funds from Centre for irrigation projects,"It has requested for soft loan or interest-free loan if grants cannot be given

Seeking to fast-track irrigation projects, the State government has sought “special assistance” from the Centre to complete the pending works to expand the irrigated area, especially in the backward Kalyana-Karnataka region that is covered under Article 371 (J).

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, sources in the government said, has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking special funds for irrigation on the lines of the Centre allocating money to fast-track irrigation works in Bihar. “While we have asked for special assistance through grants, the Centre has been requested to provide money either as a soft loan or an interest-free loan if grants cannot be given,” sources added.

According to an Irrigation Department estimate, the State requires about ₹1.8 lakh crore to complete all irrigation works in the State to reach the maximum irrigation potential of about 40.66 lakh hectares. The department estimates that ₹1.12 lakh crore was needed to complete 245 ongoing irrigation works and about ₹50,000 crore for resettlement and rehabilitation of villages if the Almatti reservoir height was increased by 5 m.

Sources said the Upper Krishna project, which was launched in 1966, was yet to be completed. “Of the three phases, works were yet to begin in stage 3 of the first phase. Adequate funds have not been allocated over decades leading to huge pendency. Most of the water could be utilised in the development of Kalyana-Karnataka region,” sources said.

Sources said that though the requirement of funding to UKP was high, the assistance from the Centre, if it comes, will be spread across the State.

More allocation to irrigation

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who will be presenting the Budget on March 5, is expected to increase allocation to irrigation to hasten completion of pending works. The Irrigation Department, it is learnt, has sought at least ₹25,000 crore annually for at least five years that will ensure completion of the projects. Government sources said: “There will be increase in allocation to irrigation and agriculture sector this year.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-seeks-special-funds-from-centre-for-irrigation-projects/article30965517.ece

123,2020/03/02,"HC directs State to fill posts of doctors, health staff by Nov. 30","‘State liable to pay compensation for maternal deaths caused due to non-availability of doctors at health centres’

Observing that State government cannot come out with its “usual excuse of financial constraints” to provide proper health services, the High Court of Karnataka has set November 30 as deadline for the State government to fill vacancies of doctors, specialised doctors, staff nurses, paramedical staff, health workers, and health assistants at all levels in public hospitals and health centres.

All vacant posts should be filled in a phased manner and while doing so, immediate priority should be given to vacancies in Community Health Centres (CHCs) and Primary Health Centres (PHCs), and if regular appointments are likely to take time, appointment of essential staff such as doctors, nurses and health workers, should be made on contract basis, the court said.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Pradeep Singh Yerur issued the directions in its recent interim on a PIL petition, filed by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority. The petition had sought directions to the government to effectively implement health schemes to check maternal mortality, to fill vacancies in posts of gynaecologists and paediatrics etc.

Pointing out this issue is related to the class of families who cannot afford to access private medical facilities, the Bench said failure on the part of the State government to fill the posts would amount to violation of fundamental right of right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.

“... in a case of women belonging to a family below poverty line suffering maternal death due to lack of availability of doctors at the grassroots level facilities, her family can claim compensation by taking recourse to public law remedy for violation of Article 21 of the Constitution,” the Bench observed, while directing the government to submit by March 20 the phase-wise schedule to fill posts.

The Bench also asked the government to appoint a committee of high-ranking officers rank in every district to monitor functioning of taluk hospitals, PHCs, CHCs, and sub-centres by constantly reviewing the facilities provided and services rendered. The committee can also supervise implementation of schemes of the State and Union governments for pregnant women, lactating mothers and newborn, the Bench said.

Referring to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India on “Performance of Audit of Reproductive and Child Health Care under the National Rural Health Mission” of March 2016, which pointed out large number of vacancies in public hospitals and health centres, the Bench said the report shows a very dismal picture about the facilities at the grassroots level in the State. The government has not placed any document to show that either the situation has improved after 2017 and vacancies in health facilities at grassroots level had been filled.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-directs-state-to-fill-posts-of-doctors-health-staff-by-nov-30/article30964870.ece
124,2020/03/02,Violation of UGC norms alleged in CUK recruitment process,"Journal publications and experience among key violations

Central University of Karnataka (CUK), the only Central university in the State, is facing allegations of violating guidelines set by the University Grants Commission (UGC) in the ongoing process of recruiting 67 professors and associate professors.

A key violation has been in terms of considering journal publications by aspirants and years of experience. While on September 16, 2019, the UGC came up with a list of approved journals and said that publications in those were to be considered while recruiting, in many cases the old list has been taken into account. Within a week of the issuance of the UGC public notice, CUK issued a notification on September 25, 2019 inviting applications for the recruitment of 67 professors and associate professors to 30 departments. It also mentioned clearly that the changed UGC guidelines on research publications were to be considered for the selection of candidates.

As a result, many aspirant candidates who did not have the required number of research papers published in the UGC-approved list did not apply for the posts. However, there were many others who did so despite not meeting the criteria, and the scrutiny committee did not reject their applications and considered them for interviews.

Only some departments — Geology, Geography, Linguistics, and Physics — rejected candidates who did not meet the criteria. Other departments, including Computer Science, Electronics and Communication Engineering, Life Sciences, History and Archaeology, Tourism and Hotel Management, Education, Commerce, and Business Studies, did not stick to the UGC guidelines on the research papers to be considered. However, they made a conditional selection by putting an asterisk in front of their names and the remarks “subject to submission of publication evidence as per UGC norms” and “subject to submission of past service documents”. Even this was not uniform, as only some were picked with such a rider, while others with a comparable number of publications and years of experience were not.

This issue was raised by Ganapati Sinnoor at the 49th meeting of the executive council (EC), the highest governing body of the university, held on November 14, 2019. The EC discussed the issue and “resolved to consider the matter on quality parameter also as suggested by UGC”.

Yet, some of the scrutiny committees, defying the EC, continued to violate the UGC letter dated September 16, 2019, which categorically advised considering only those research papers published in the UGC-approved list, as well as the university’s recruitment notification, which also incorporated the UGC guidelines to frame the eligibility criteria on the research papers to be considered.

As per the recruitment notification, a minimum of eight years of teaching experience as assistant professor in the relevant subject is a criterion to be chosen for the post of associate professor. However, there have been many instances where candidates who did not meet the requirement were selected for interview. Under this norm, too, there have been inconsistencies, with some with inadequate years of experience being pushed forward.

The Hindu accessed details of over 30 candidates of comparable credentials, and there were discrepancies in who got to the next level and who did not.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ytqxd5/article30964817.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGCUK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/violation-of-ugc-norms-alleged-in-cuk-recruitment-process/article30964818.ece

128,2020/03/02,Yatnal’s remarks against Doreswamy create ruckus in Assembly,"The issue of BJP MLA and former Union Minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal describing centenarian freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy as a “fake freedom fighter and an agent of Pakistan” created a ruckus in the Legislative Assembly on Monday with the Opposition Congress and Janata Dal(S) members staging a dharna in the well of the House, seeking permission to discuss the issue.

The protest came in the way of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa replying to the debate on motion of thanks to the address by Governor Vajubai R. Vala to the joint session of the Legislature. The Chief Minister had to restrict his reply to just 15 minutes as nothing could be heard in the din created by the Opposition members who shouted slogans.

Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri had to adjourn the House for 30 minutes as the Opposition members refused to withdraw their protest.

Earlier, Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah raised the issue of ‘derogatory’ remarks by Mr. Yatnal soon after the House paid tributes to three dignitaries who died recently.

But the Speaker made it clear that he would consider providing permission to Mr. Siddaramaiah to speak on the issue after completing the reply by the Chief Minister as listed in the day’s agenda. However, Mr. Siddaramaiah insisted that the Yatnal issue should be taken up before the Chief Minister’s reply as it was a serious matter that amounted to breach of Constitutional provisions.

“It is a matter that amounts to contempt of the House as a BJP MLA has insulted the veteran freedom fighter,” Mr. Siddaramaiah said and urged the Speaker to use his discretionary powers to allow him to raise the issue.

However, Law Minister J. C. Madhuswamy objected to this and appealed to the Speaker to stick to the agenda. Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and Kannada & Culture Minister C. T. Ravi endorsed his views.

Following their suggestions, the Speaker asked the Chief Minister to commence his reply to the House and Mr. Yediyurappa did so.

This angered the Opposition members who trooped into the well of the House and began their protest.

129,2020/03/02,Devanooru Mahadeva questions Education Minister on his comment on freedom fighter Doreswamy,"Well-known writer and activist Devanooru Mahadeva has written an open letter to Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar expressing dismay over the latter’s comments on centenarian freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy.

Defending former Union Minister and BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, who has stirred a controversy by calling the Gandhian a “fake freedom fighter” who behaves like a “Pakistan agent”, Mr. Suresh Kumar had said, “If one speaks what they ought not to, they will have to hear what they ought not to.” BJP leaders have been accusing Mr Doreswamy, who has been active in anti-CAA protests, of making derogatory remarks against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In his open letter to the Education Minister, Mr. Mahadeva has said that the utterances of the freedom fighter on the “failings” of Mr. Modi’s administration had been grossly and deliberately misconstrued to project them as derogatory. He has said in the letter that trying to suppress and silence the freedom fighter rather than have the courage to address the questions raised by him makes us “intellectual Lilliputs.”

It is unfortunate that some MLAs “let their tongues loose, while others appear to have lost their tongues” rather than take their roles as people’s representatives seriously, said Mr. Mahadeva. “There are serious issues in Mr. Yatnal’s own district of Vijayapura which has become a ‘migration capital.’ People who have voted him are leaving for Goa and Mahashtra in search of jobs. The big industrial cluster in his district is empty because with no basic facilities like power to run it. A people’s representative from such a region should have been busy setting these things right, with little time left to speak of other things. But MLAs have become irresponsible, while people who have voted them to power and ought to remind them have become indifferent,” rued the writer.

“They say that bad fruits in a basket spoil the good ones too. This saying came to my mind on seeing your statement about Mr. Doreswamy,” Mr. Mahadeva has said in conclusion in the open letter.

Following comments of Mr. Yatnal about Mr. Doreswamy, several BJP leaders and minister have jumped to the defence of the former. Opposition Congress and JDS have strongly condemned Mr. Yatnal and demanded an apology from him. However, Mr. Yatnal has said that he stands by his statements and would not apologise.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/48hk4/article30918116.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25bgbgsssyatnG9R75QVUA3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/devanooru-mahadeva-questions-education-minister-on-his-comment-on-freedom-fighter-doreswamy/article30961990.ece
130,2020/03/02,Giving children a ride to school and back,"For as long as locals could remember, school-going children in the remote hamlet of Pachedoddi inside M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary used to trek to school — nearly 6 km in each direction.

Trudging along uneven terrain and slippery slopes, negotiating their way through the jungle to school and back was an energy-sapping endeavour every day. The fear of a lone tusker or a stalking leopard was also in the back of their minds. This not only affected their performance at school, but also inhibited their potential for growth. However, a minor initiative by the authorities, including Minister for Primary and Secondary Education Suresh Kumar, the district administration and the Forest Department, is set to be a game changer for them.

The department has introduced a vehicle to transport schoolchildren from remote hamlets to their schools. Now, the students who used to walk nearly three hours daily can take the vehicle to get to school and back in about 20 minutes each way.

The exercise commenced on Friday and the schoolchildren who made their first trip were an excited lot. That the initiative has come during examination time is all the more a boon for the students and their parents, said V. Yedukondalu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, M.M. Hills wildlife division.

He told The Hindu that this arrangement was similar to the facility introduced for the villagers of Doddaane and two other villages that lacked last-mile connectivity in the absence of motorable roads. This has benefited nearly 200 people, who earlier had to trek 2-3 km to secure basic amenities. Even an ambulance could not reach these villages, and people had to labour to get LPG cylinders and carry them. Following the introduction of the vehicle service, the locals heaved a sigh of relief.

The daily ordeal of the schoolchildren came to the notice of Mr. Suresh Kumar, who is also in charge of Chamarajanagar district, during an interaction with them early in February.

The issue subsequently figured in the Eco Development Committee meeting and it was decided to replicate the Doddaane model and provide transportation facility to the schoolchildren, said Mr. Yedukondalu. There are about 20 students in the village, some of whom are in high school and most in primary school.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uvx23u/article30959127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGMYSSCHOOLVEHICLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/giving-children-a-ride-to-school-and-back/article30959128.ece

The fragrance of Udupi Mallige (jasmine), which enjoys the Geographical Indication (GI) tag, might spread wider once the proposal drawn up by the Horticulture Department to create a Farmer Producer Organisation (FPO) for the growers gets approval.

Bhuvaneshwari, Deputy Director of Horticulture, told The Hindu that the Directorate of Horticulture in Bengaluru is expected to soon approve the proposal, which will lead to mallige growers getting support right from cultivation to marketing.

Udupi Mallige, also known as Shankarpura Mallige, is cultivated by about 7,000 growers in Shankarpura, Shirva, Innanje, Bantakal, Katapady and surrounding areas in Udupi district. According to the crop survey done in 2018-19, Udupi Mallige is grown on 116 hectares in Udupi, and its production is estimated at 863.55 tonnes, valued at ₹12.09 crore.

The FPO wil get ₹35 lakh as formation cost, ₹15 lakh as working capital, ₹22.5 lakh for machinery, amd ₹10 lakh equity grant from the Small Farmers’ Agri-Business Consortium. The growers will get cold storage facility and godowns under the FPO.

Individual issues of the growers could be taken up by the 50 Farmer Initiative Groups (FIGs), comprising of about 20 farmers, that are proposed to be formed under the FPO. In a build-up to the process, the department has already got 1,000 jasmine growers in the district to agree to join the FPO, which is a requirement, with the help of the NGO Sampada.

132,2020/03/02,Arecanut prices up 20% as yield takes a hit in Karnataka,"The price of arecanut has escalated by around 20% in a short span of three months because of the mismatch in demand and supply.

The price of rashi idi variety of arecanut, which was ₹34,000 a quintal in the first week of December, has hit ₹40,800 now. The price of saraku, chali and other varieties have also increased.

Mallesh, an arecanut trader from Channagiri, blames it on the decline in yield owing to inclement weather in arecanut-growing areas. He said the semi-arid regions of Karnataka witnessed three consecutive droughts from 2017. There was a significant loss of yield owing to moisture stress. In Davangere district, arecanut on more than 7,000 hectares of land completely dried up in 2019 owing to drought. Also, the arecanut yield in Holalkere and Hosadurga taluks of Chitradurga district, Tarikere taluk of Chikkamagaluru district, Shikaripur and Sorab taluks of Shivamogga district, and Hanagal and Hirekerur taluks of Haveri district, where growers are dependent on borewell water, came down during this period owing to depletion of the groundwater level, he said.

The heavy rain that lashed Malnad regions from August to October last year triggered kole roga, also known as fruit rot disease, in arecanut crop in the region. In Shivamogga district, arecanut crop on more than 13,000 hectares was infected. Mahabaleshwar, an arecanut grower from Tirthamattur in Tirthahalli taluk, says that more than 80% of the crop cultivated on his five-hectare land was destroyed by kole roga.

From the past three months, caterpillar and inflorescence dieback infestations have been reported in arecanut crop in Malnad region. While cold conditions prevail here at night and in the morning, the noons were scorchingly hot. The extreme heat during noon, which was unusual in Malnad during winters, triggered infestations, owing to which premature dropping of arecanut flowers and tender nuts was reported. Root-grub disease has also been reported from plantations in the command area of Tunga and Bhadra reservoirs. Insiders in the market feel that owing to these infestations, arecanut yield during the next phase of harvesting is likely to remain low, and arrivals of the produce in the market will not be on the expected level.

Shantharaj, an arecanut trader, said that as the inventories with the farmers as well as with the mandi merchants are low compared to the demand, and as there will be a decline in arrivals owing to pest and fungal infestations, the demand and supply mismatch will continue and prices will remain bullish for the next few months.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/il5e1x/article30959115.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGARECANUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/arecanut-prices-up-20-as-yield-takes-a-hit-in-karnataka/article30959116.ece
133,2020/03/02,Youth arrested for hunting porcupine,"Alerted by their higher-ups, Forest Department officials on Sunday arrested Manjunath, 23, a resident of Jewargi, on the charge of hunting a porcupine.

According to the officials, Manjunath posted on TikTok, a video-sharing social networking site, a clip that showed the hunted and smoked porcupine. Procupine is a protected animal under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act. The video went viral and eventually caught the attention of officials at Aranya Bhavan, who in turn alerted the Kalaburagi forest officers. “We tracked down Manjunath, a resident of Jewargi. During preliminary interrogation, he revealed that the exact location of hunting was a forest area at Sindagi taluk in the neighbouring Vijayapura district.

There were three more persons with him –– Bagappa, 23, Bhimappa, 19, and Nagesh, 20 — who are from Sindagi and are all absconding, officials said.

134,2020/03/02,Environmentalists oppose shooting leopard in Tumakuru,"Environmentalists have demanded that the State government not issue a shoot-at-sight order against the man-eater leopard in Tumakuru district.

After visiting the family of the deceased girl, Chandana, at Baichenahalli on Sunday, Forest Minister Anand Singh said he would issue the kill order on Monday. Angered by this, environmentalist, T.V.N. Murthy asked the Minister how the leopard which killed the girl and three other persons in that area would be identified.

“If they shoot the wrong leopard, the behaviour of the other leopards living in that area will also change, and it may also disrupt the gender ratio of leopards. If they kill a mother leopard, then there is a possibility that the cubs of that mother will turn into man-eaters, or the cubs may die without food,” he said. He says shooting the feline would only worsen the situation.

Mr. Murthy said that no one has seen the leopard that has been attacking. “They are unnecessarily targeting leopards as man-eaters without conducting a detailed study to prove that all four persons were killed by leopards,” he said. He said locals had just heard the screams of the victims and then found their bodies. “It may have been a wolf, a bear or a leopard,” he said.

Lakshmamma, 60, of Bannikuppe village was found dead on October 17, 2019, while Anandaiah, 58, of Doddmaralavadi, which neighbours Bannikuppe, also died in a leopard attack on November 29, 2019. Samarth Gowda, 5, was killed in Manikuppe village of Gubbi taluk in Tumakuru district on January 10, 2020.

In all four cases, the leopard had not eaten the human flesh. Mr. Murthy said this was because the animal might have left because of the disturbance caused by the people who came in search of the victims. Most of the times, animals attack out of fear of being attacked, he explained.

Habitat destruction

Rampant stone quarrying in the buffer zone of forest areas and deemed forest areas in the district are forcing animals to stray into villages. Environmentalist Gundappa alleged that in the buffer zone of Devarayanadurga, stone quarrying was being done. Explosives are blasted during evenings, which disturb nocturnal animals like leopards, he said.

Because of this disturbance, they move into calmer areas such villages to live and in search of food. They kill stray dogs, goats, sheep and cows there. “The fields which grow ragi and pulses have now turned into lantana bushes and shrubs as farmers have started discarding agriculture. These fields have become nice hiding places for leopards and other animals,” he said.

Mr. Murthy urged the government to establish a leopard rehabilitation centre in Tumakuru. Such a centre will help save captured leopards and cubs and prevent attacks, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/environmentalists-oppose-shooting-leopard-in-tumakuru/article30959085.ece
135,2020/03/02,Ministers promise shoot-at-sight order to kill man-eater leopard in Tumakuru,"Forest Minister B.S. Anand Singh on Sunday assured the residents of Baichenahalli village in Tumakuru district that the State government would issue a shoot-at-sight order to kill the man-eater leopard that has created a fear psychosis among locals. He also announced that the combing operations would start on Monday.

The Minister visited the village and consoled the parents and grandparents of the three-year-old girl who was killed in a leopard attack on Saturday. The leopard attacked the girl in front of her house while she was playing around 8 p.m. and dragged her to a distance of one and a half furlong.

Mr. Singh expressed regret over the death of the girl, Chandana. He also said that there were eight or nine leopards in Hebburu police station limits and that he would order the authorities to kill the man-eater as four people in the area had been killed in leopard attacks.

He also announced a compensation of ₹7.5 lakh to the family of the deceased girl and a pension of ₹2,000 a month for five years.

Angry villagers urged the Minister and officials to kill the leopard at the earliest.

District in-charge Minister J.C. Madhuswamy said though the law does not permit the killing of leopards, he and Mr. Singh would speak with the officials concerned and try to get a shoot-at-sight order in this case. He also said he would speak with officials to clear the thorny bushes, shrubs and other plants in that area which have become a hiding place for leopards.

The Minister made an appeal to the villagers to clear bushes in their farms to prevent leopards from hiding there. “If the farmers fail to do so, I have told the Deputy Conservator of Forests to clear them on private lands and collect the amount [for it] from the farmers,” Mr. Madhuswamy said.

136,2020/03/02,"Diverting Yettinahole water is not acceptable, says Gowda","‘Let the issue of drinking water crisis be addressed first’

The former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda has said that diverting water lifted from the Yettinahole in the Western Ghats to areas beyond the initial plan of the project is not acceptable.

Mr. Gowda told reporters here on Sunday that the Yettinahole project was taken up to provide drinking water to areas around Kolar district. “Let the issue of the drinking water crisis be addressed first. It is not acceptable to divert the water to some other place. I will not sit quietly if it happens,” he said when asked about reports suggesting diversion of the Yettinahole waters to Vani Vilas Sagar in Chitradurga district.

The Janata Dal (Secular) national president said he would concentrate on strengthening the party’s base in the State. The former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy had met political strategist Prashant Kishor, he said, and added that he was aware of the development.

“I have seen the worst phase of my party. In 1989, the party faced difficult times. B.L. Shankar, V.S. Ugrappa, Y.S.V. Datta and a few others were with me when all tall leaders had distanced themselves. Today, we have several leaders across the State. I am not bothered about one leader leaving the party,” he said.

He said he had not lost confidence though he was 87 years old. He would continue to travel across the State and strengthen the party.

Regarding the violence in Delhi, he said the incidents were the result of the failure of the police and intelligence in the national capital. The party in power at the Centre had been treating those opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act as anti-nationals, he said, and added that it was not right.

Mr. Gowda received a rousing welcome on Sunday as he reached Hassan by train. Hundreds of his supporters had gathered to welcome him when the train reached the station. They showered flowers on him and took selfies.

He was in Hassan to take part in a programme organised in memory of A.C.

137,2020/03/02,Experts give students tips on how to score better in exams,"‘It is a pity that most parents do not think beyond engineering and medicine’

‘Score Even More’, an event to help class 10 students score better in their examination, organised by The Hindu Group of Publications in association with Samarth Group of Colleges, was held at the Bio Tech Hall of the BVB College of Engineering and Technology here on Sunday.

The programme aimed to help students have a better understanding and presentation of the subjects.

Addressing the gathering, Akhilkumar Halagatti, Director, Samarth Group of Colleges, Hubballi, said that it was the dream of every parent to see that their children score better in examinations and shape a good career.

“They want their children to achieve, which they could not. However, most the parents have no correct idea on how to help their children prepare for examinations and what kind of support they need,” he said.

Mr. Halagatti suggested that parents draw a plan for their children in advance and support the career that their children wish to pursue rather imposing their dreams on them.

“They need to estimate the capacity of their children well and support them accordingly. It is a pity that most of the parents do not think beyond a career other than engineering and medicine. In fact, in science itself over 60 different career options are available and these options ensure better job placements,” he said.

He said that apart from science, technology and medicine, there was another domain that offered good career opportunities like the civil services, but the number of candidates appearing for these examinations from the south is lower compared to the north.

It is the high time that the parents should stipulate their children to tap the potential in this field, he added.

Ameen-e-Mudassar, CEO of CIGMA India, has guided the participating students through memory training and examination tips on how to score better.

He said there is nothing called good memory or bad memory. “There is trained memory and untrained memory, and the former helps perform better.” Through his motivational speech and some practical methods, Mr. Mudassar has told the students how to train the memory, concentrate on studies, and answer well.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/l8hebt/article30958903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BGSCORE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/experts-give-students-tips-on-how-to-score-better-in-exams/article30958905.ece

139,2020/03/02,Joshi asks Doreswamy to exercise restraint,"He questions Doreswamy’s criticism of PM, Savarkar

The BJP again appears to have picked freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy for attack as Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi on Sunday asked him to exercise restraint over his tongue.

BJP MLA and former Minister Basanagouda Patil Yatnal had drawn the ire of prominent political leaders after he called Mr. Doreswamy a “fake freedom fighter” and a “Pakistan agent”.

While protests criticising such remarks against Mr. Doreswamy are still going on, Mr. Joshi said that if the freedom fighter continues to use offensive language against democratically elected such as Prime Minister Narendra Modi, somebody would get ready to respond to him in the same language.

Speaking to reporters at Toranagal in Ballari district on Sunday, Mr. Joshi questioned Mr. Doreswamy’s alleged “derogatory criticism” against Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar and Mr. Modi.

“Mr. Doreswamy should also control his tongue. He loosens his tongue while criticising Savarkar ... If you want that nobody should speak in such a way about you, then you, as a freedom fighter, should accordingly conduct yourself, both in words and deeds,” Mr. Joshi said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/joshi-asks-doreswamy-to-exercise-restraint/article30958644.ece
140,2020/03/02,State needs ₹1.8 lakh crore to complete all irrigation projects,"Cost escalation blamed on water disputes, delay in clearances, land acquisition, and insufficient funds

As Karnataka legally battles with neighbouring States over its share in the inter-State river waters, it also has a huge financial burden to complete existing projects. For, the government now estimates that about ₹1.8 lakh crore is needed to complete all irrigation projects, including that of drinking water schemes.

Over the last 10 years, about ₹87,000 crore has been spent on irrigation projects, creating irrigation potential of 4.47 lakh hectares in the State. Once the irrigation projects are completed, the State will also have created a maximum command area of 40.66 lakh hectares.

While an estimated ₹1.12 lakh crore is required to complete 245 ongoing irrigation works in the State, another ₹50,000 crore is estimated for the resettlement and rehabilitation of villagers in more than 20 villages and about one lakh acres of land that will be submerged once the height of the Almatti dam across the Krishna is increased from 519 ft to 524 ft. This is besides funds needed for other projects, including lift irrigation and tank rejuvenation, all of which require over ₹15,000 crore.

Acknowledging the estimation that has been drawn, government sources said: “These estimates hold good currently. Annually, we see an average cost escalation between 8% and 10%. Over the years, budgetary allocation towards irrigation projects has not been enough, resulting in cost escalation.” If irrigation potential has to be achieved quickly and at a lesser cost, the government has to set aside at least ₹25,000 crore annually for the next five years and set a deadline for their completion, sources said, and pointed out that the ₹80,000-crore Kaleshwaram project in Telangana was inaugurated last year, about three years after its launch.

Currently, irrigation potential has been created for about 29.19 lakh hectares across Karnataka, which has the maximum potential of 40.66 lakh hectares. If the budget allocation is any indicator, between 2010 and 2015, Karnataka spent a total of ₹29,729 crore against the budgetary allocation of ₹34,494 crore, creating irrigation potential in an area of 3.08 lakh hectares. However, as the cost of projects escalated, between 2015 and 2020, despite spending nearly the double of what was spent in the preceding five years, about 1.39 lakh hectares of irrigation potential was created. For the record, against the budget allocation of ₹73,195 crore, the State spent ₹57,335 crore.

Big-ticket projects

Projects in the Krishna basin, Upper Bhadra project to irrigate central Karnataka region, and Yettinahole drinking water project are among the big-ticket projects that have seen huge escalation in costs and are also moving at a slow pace owing to issues related to inter-State water dispute, environment, forests, land acquisition, and finance, among others. While the Mahadayi project has seen cost escalation from ₹94 crore in 2000 to ₹1,677.30 crore now, the Yettinhole drinking water has seen an escalation of cost from nearly ₹13,000 crore in 2014 to about ₹25,000 crore, and Upper Bhadra project has seen cost escalation from about ₹6,000 crore in 2008 to about ₹20,900 crore now. Currently, the Mekedatu drinking water project is estimated to cost around ₹9,000 crore. However, delay in receiving permission to start the project could escalate the cost further.

‘Difficult to raise loans now’

While there has been no plan to raise money through bonds, the government seems to have limited option to raise money from the market as it is closer to the borrowing limits. Sources said that in the current situation, it is difficult to raise loans. “Various irrigation projects are currently being financed through bank loan. The State has availed of about ₹7,000 crore from banks which is due for repayment in a period between 8 and 10 years,” sources said, and added that there was no proposal currently to raise money from the market.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7t4ee5/article30958602.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGYETTINAHOLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-needs-18-lakh-crore-to-complete-all-irrigation-projects/article30958606.ece

Amid speculation over Budget proposals in the light of financial strain the State is currently going through, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is set to present his Budget on March 5 as the legislature session resumes on Monday.

Both the Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) are expected to raise the issue of BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal and other BJP leaders’ continued statements against freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy.

The Chief Minister’s reply to the Governor’s speech could witness some stormy moments. The problem of toor farmers, who have been affected owing to the fall in the price below the minimum support price, could put the government in a tight spot.

The JD(S), which has accused the BJP of causing confusion on farm loan waiver, is expected to raise the issue.

143,2020/03/02,Greens for night traffic ban on NH 766,"Habitat of two endangered species — Bengal tiger and Asiatic elephant

Benny Ajantha, award-winning wildlife photographer from Pathanamthitta, could not resist slowing down his vehicle at the sight of a tigress and her cubs waiting by the wayside to cross National Highway 766 in the Bandipur National Park late last week.

A known wildlife enthusiast and lensman, Benny, moved by the plight of the big cat, bats for a ban on motor vehicles on roads passing through highly protected tiger and elephant reserves.

Talking to The Hindu on the occasion of World Wildlife Day on March 3, Mr. Benny recalls a previous incident in which he sighted a herd of sambars and elephants crossing a road after an impatient wait for some time owing to frequent passage of vehicles.

Dusk-to-dawn ban

M.N. Jayachandran, Kerala State Wildlife Board member, and C.S. Dharmaraj, environmental activist from Wayanad, back the demand for a dusk-to-dawn ban on night traffic in the highly protected areas of reserve forests to save the wild fauna from speeding vehicles.

According to them the demand from various quarters for lifting the night traffic ban on NH 766 betrays the ignorance of people on the need for wildlife and environment conservation. The Bandipur forest is the natural habitat of the Bengal tiger and Asiatic elephant, two endangered species.

The 272-km NH 766 connects Kozhikode and Kollegal in Karnataka and 34 km of the road passes through ecologically sensitive forests in Wayanad and the core areas of the Bandipur reserve in Karnataka.

Wildlife roadkills

The ban on night traffic on the road was ordered invoking provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act in 2009 in an effort to check wildlife roadkills in the area, says Mr. Dharmaraj.

The situation is not much different on the road passing through the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary in Idukki. Though the speed limits on this forest road have been restricted to 30 km an hour, speeding trucks and tipper lorries had run over as many as 85 wild animals in a short span of six months from January to June in 2016, Mr Jayachandran says.

Killing of animals

Mr. Benny says there are reports of killing of nocturnal animals such as tiger, elephant calf, sambar, etc., by speeding vehicles on the Bandipur forest stretch during the pre-ban period and hence strict enforcement of the ban is a must in the interest of eco-conservation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bpcabk/article30966444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tvTiger,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/greens-for-night-traffic-ban-on-nh-766/article30966236.ece

146,2020/03/02,Misleading report kicks up controversy,"Circular on abstaining from drugs

A recent Calicut University circular that sought an affidavit from students and parents at the time of admission saying that the former will abstain from drugs and liquor kicked up a row on Monday after a section of the media carried misleading reports about it. The circular also warned of action against students, without notice, found violating the guidelines.

Eyebrows were raised as the media reports claimed that “even parents will have to abide by the circular and stay away from drugs and liquor”. It was said to be applicable on university campus and affiliated colleges.

Recommendation

The circular was based on a recommendation by an in-house panel of the university. A news report on the issue was first carried by a language daily, which was picked up by news channels later. Soon, it became a point of debate on social media as well.

However, it later turned out that the circular had only made it mandatory for students to refrain from using drugs or liquor on the university campus and in affiliated colleges and parents did not fall within its ambit.

The affidavit said, “I will not engage in any activity related to the use or sale of drugs and liquor and will be willing to undergo punishment for it without notice.”

C.L. Joshi, Registrar, said the circular had been put on hold for now. “The university Syndicate is scheduled to meet on February 7. A final order will be issued only after the Syndicate ratifies the suggestion in the circular,” he added.

Sources pointed out that the affidavit only dealt with the use of drugs and liquor on campuses and that fact was not specifically mentioned because it was obvious.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/misleading-report-kicks-up-controversy/article30966213.ece

He showed reporters thousands of rounds of ammunition and hundreds of expended cartridges stockpiled in batches and invited sceptics to take a count. He said efforts were on to trace the missing ammunition.

He rebuffed the CAG’s finding that 1,415 INSAS 5.56 mm bullets were misplaced and said the police had accounted for every single round.

Exaggerated figure

The CAG’s conclusion that 1,576 AK-47 rounds were missing was grossly exaggerated and a CB verification had revealed a loss of only nine bullets.

Earlier, he had claimed that the police had accounted for the 25 assault rifles deemed missing by the CAG.

The Cabinet is scheduled to frame a set of rules to govern the process of police procurement and utilisation of government funds.

CM’s reply in House

Replying to K.M. Shaji's question in the Assembly, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said there is no need at present for the case to be handed over to the CBI. Required action will be taken based on the Crime Branch investigation report.

The Public Accounts Committee of the Assembly is looking into the CAG's findings.

However, he said 12,061 cartridges were found missing in the period from January 1990 to October 2018.

The previous United Democratic Front government had formed a three-member board in 2015 to look into the missing cartridges.

The board had concluded that hardly any cartridges had gone missing and tried to play down the discrepancy as due to the stock taking method of noting the number on top of each box rather than counting the individual cartridges.

The UDF government had thus tried to bury the fact that the bullets had gone missing, Mr. Vijayan said.

Inspection

He said that it was in 2016 that the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government carried out one more inspection and 11 police personnel were arraigned as accused in a case regarding the missing cartridges.

Meanwhile, BJP State president K. Surendran said the Chief Minister, perhaps, had something to be afraid of to refuse an inquiry by the CBI in the case.

He said the CAG’s findings had indicated certain extremist elements in the police force.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/only-3636-rounds-missing-cb/article30966207.ece
148,2020/03/02,"13 bird, 7 butterfly species newly spotted in Munnar","In all, 188 bird species recorded

A recent faunal survey in the Munnar Wildlife Division has recorded the presence of 13 bird and seven butterfly species that were hitherto unrecorded in the high-range landscape. The species have now found their way into the management plans of the national parks and sanctuaries in the region.

The four-day exercise, conducted by the Forest Department in association with the Travancore Natural History Society, a Thiruvananthapuram-based non-governmental organisation, last week covered all the protected areas in the Munnar Wildlife Division.

The presence of 188 bird species was recorded with the highest number being found in Chinnar (144), followed by Eravikulam (103). The additions to the bird species are Indian long-billed vulture, Ruddy-breasted crake, Malayan night heron, Taiga flycatcher, Indian cormorant, Rufous-bellied hawk eagle, Spotted owlet, Oriental scops owl, Brown wood owl, Alexandrine parakeet, Jerdon’s bushlark, Skyke’s warbler and Clamorous reed warbler. With their discoveries, the Munnar checklist for bird species has grown to 245.

Among other interesting finds, the State bird Great Indian hornbill and Mountain hawk eagle (Legge’s hawk eagle) were spotted in Chinnar. The endemic species recorded included Nilgiri wood pigeon that was spotted in all sanctuaries, Nilgiri pipit which was commonly found in all the high-elevation grasslands, Broad-tailed grass warbler (Broad-tailed grassbird), Nilgiri flycatcher, Black-and-Orange flycatcher, White-bellied sholakili, Scaly thrush (Nilgiri thrush) and Nilgiri blackbird.

As many as 173 butterfly species were recorded during the survey. The seven newly recorded butterfly species are Sahyadri clear sailer, Indian common shot silverline, Oriental common awl, Oriental spotted angle, Oriental chestnut angle, Black angle and Rounded palm-redeye.

The State butterfly Malabar banded peacock was spotted at Anamudi Shola. Several other species such as Sahyadri birdwing, African marbled skipper and the African grass jewel, and endemic ones, including Malabar raven, Nilgiri clouded yellow, Palni bushbrown, Red-disc bushbrown, Nilgiri four-ring, Nilgiri jewel four-ring, Palni four-ring, Palni fritillary, Nilgiri tiger and White-disc hedge blue were also found. The survey also revealed the presence of 30 Odonata species, among which five species, Anax guttatus, Lathrecista asiatica, Neurobasis chinensis, Orthetrum chrysis and Vestalis gracilis, were recorded for the first time. The researchers observed that all of these are typical lowland species and could have ascended owing to the warmer climate in the lower slopes.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nsi2cj/article30966208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tv-Munnar-faunacol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/13-bird-7-butterfly-species-newly-spotted-in-munnar/article30966202.ece
149,2020/03/02,Lapses in registry at de-addiction centre,"3 of those marked dead alive: police

A day after reports emerged that 33 residents at Puthujeevan Trust Hospital for Psychological Medicine and De-addiction at Thrikkodithanam here died in eight years, a detailed probe on Monday unearthed serious irregularities in the registry of residents at the institution.

A police investigation has found that three of the 33 persons marked dead in the registry are alive. Based on the finding, a detailed probe into the whereabouts of the remaining persons has been launched.

As per the registry, 18 residents died while or after being shifted to various hospitals and four reportedly committed suicide. Seven persons died after discharge. Official sources say the list also includes names of those who died at a destitute centre run by the trust.

A primary examination of the hospital register by Additional District Magistrate (ADM) Anil Oommen the other day revealed that 33 residents died in eight years. The ADM also found a dispute between the hospital management and the Payippad grama panchayat over the licence for the institution.

Report soon

The ADM is slated to file a report to Kottayam District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu soon.

While a woman and two men died between February 23 and 29 with almost similar symptoms, six are undergoing treatment at Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Kottayam. A special medical board has been monitoring the health condition of the six. The team headed by Ranju Raveendran, Professor, Forensic Medicine Department of the MCH, comprises Sheela Kurian and V. Satheesh, heads of General Medicine and Psychiatry Departments respectively.

“Five of them are doing quite well while one has been admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. A preliminary assessment points to a pneumonia outbreak,” Dr. Raveendran says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lapses-in-registry-at-de-addiction-centre/article30966195.ece

151,2020/03/02,Flow diverter stent from SCTIMST to treat aneurysm,"Device developed by SCTIMST has better grip on walls of arteries

A research team of the Sree Chitra Thirunal Institute of Medical Science and Technology (SCTIMST) has developed an innovative intracranial flow diverter stent for the treatment of aneurysms of the blood vessels of the brain.

The new technology is ready to be transferred to the industry and for further clinical trials, both animal and human, an official release issued by the SCTIMST on Monday said. Intracranial aneurysm is a localised ballooning, bulging or dilation of arteries in the brain, caused by progressive weakening of the inner muscles of the wall of the blood vessels. Spontaneous rupture of the aneurysm can result in bleeding into the space around the brain, resulting in a condition called subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), leading to paralysis, coma or death.

An attractive minimally invasive option is to deploy a flow diverter stent to bypass or divert blood flow away from the aneurysm, thus reducing the chances of its rupture due to the pressure of blood flow.

Flexible

Flow diverters have the advantages of being flexible and adaptable to the shape and course of the vessel. It also promotes healing of the vessel wall by removing the constant stress of blood flow on it. The Chitra flow diverter is designed to have better grip on the walls of arteries so that the risk of migration of the device is minimised.

The unique design in its weave also makes this stent resistant to kinking or twisting, when it is placed in tortuous arteries and those with complex shapes. Even a 180 degrees bend does not occlude the lumen of the stent. Flow diverter stents are currently not manufactured in India and the imported ones cost ₹7-8 lakh.

The team was led by Sujesh Sreedharan, Muraleedharan C.V. and Ramesh Babu (Biomedical Technology Wing, SCTIMST); and Jayadevan E.R. and Santhosh Kumar K. of the Department of Imaging Sciences and Interventional Radiology with Rajeev A., Subhash Kumar M.S., Anku Sreekumar, Jnana N.J., Sree Hari U and Liji G.V.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ymr2uh/article30967011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tvtvSCTIMST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/flow-diverter-stent-from-sctimst-to-treat-aneurysm/article30966190.ece
152,2020/03/02,₹200 cr. sought from rail board,"For land acquisition for Thiruvananthapuram track doubling, Nemom terminal

The Railway Board has been approached for additional funds for payment to the State to expedite land acquisition for the completion of crucial doubling works and for the ambitious coaching terminal at Nemom.

A sum of ₹200 crore has been sought and the zonal railway headquartered in Chennai is hopeful that the board will provide the funds as the State is according priority for fast-tracking land acquisition, a top railway official told The Hindu.

The amount, once provided, will be deposited with the State for payment towards the cost of acquiring land for doubling 7 km of rail line from Thiruvananthapuram Central to Nemom and for the coaching terminal at Nemom.

Inadequate allocation

The move comes as only ₹88 crore was allocated in the 2020-2021 Union Budget for doubling via Kottayam, ₹5 crore for doubling from Thiruvananthapuram to Kanyakumari and ₹50 lakh for the coaching terminal. Railways had sought ₹500 crore for these three crucial works.

Railways have also written to the State seeking to divert the ₹50 crore deposited with the State exchequer in 2017, for acquiring land for the Sabari project, for acquiring land in the Thiruvananthapuram-Nemom corridor, the official said.

The government has sought ₹207 crore from Railways for the cost of acquiring 14.8 hectares for doubling the rail line from Thiruvananthapuram Central to Nemom and for the coaching terminal at Nemom. “The additional funds from the board and the ₹50 crore parked with the State exchequer will be enough for land acquisition,” he added.

Review meeting

Meanwhile, Southern Railway General Manager John Thomas has convened a meeting in Chennai on March 5 to review the progress of the ongoing doubling works and that of the coaching terminal at Nemom.

The completion of the doubling of the Ettumanur-Kottayam and Kottayam-Chingavanam railway corridors and the issues flagged by the Transport Department at the meeting Chief Secretary Tom Jose and top officials had with the General Manager here on February 27 will come up.

Railways want the doubling of the Nemom stretch and the track doubling via Kottayam to be completed in two years to bring more long-distance mail and express trains to the capital.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/200-cr-sought-from-rail-board/article30966178.ece
153,2020/03/02,Jacobites begin ‘prayer protest’,"Police accused of misrepresenting court orders, favouring Orthodox faction

Members of the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, led by their metropolitans, began a five-day prayer protest at Marine Drive here on Monday, alleging that a handful of police officers are ‘misrepresenting’ court orders and acting in favour of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church by facilitating their takeover of churches where members of the Jacobite faction are in vast majority.

Catholicos Baselios Thomas II inaugurated the protest. This is the second phase of the agitation seeking ‘justice for the Church members.’ Among those who addressed the protesters was metropolitan trustee Joseph Mar Gregorios.

Outrage

Speakers expressed outrage at the faithful being ‘driven out’ of churches and ‘forced entry’ into church buildings by breaking open locks. Members of the Jacobite faction had taken out a protest march to the office of District Police Chief (Rural) on February 29.

They said the rival faction was keeping the police and district administration on tenterhooks through pressure tactics.

The protesting members also sought curbs on lower courts passing orders on cases relating to 357 churches under Supreme Court’s consideration, speedy submission of reports to the apex court on 304 cases pending before it, a relook of orders about forcing out members of the Jacobite faction despite they being in overwhelming majority in churches, and upholding of justice and impartiality, said Kuriakose Mar Theophilus. The protest will end at 6 p.m. on Friday.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lg5i47/article30966117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03TVKIJACOBITE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jacobites-begin-prayer-protest/article30966118.ece
154,2020/03/02,Vallasadyas reduced to 10 a day,"62-day season begins on August 4 at Sree Parthasarathy temple at Aranmula

The Palliyoda Seva Sanghom (PSS), the apex body of various Palliyoda Karayogams that own ‘palliyodams’ (snakeboats), has decided to restrict the number of Vallasadya (feast) to a maximum of 10 a day.

PSS secretary P.R. Radhakrishnan said the decision was to ensure the quality of the ritualistic feast and its smooth conduct. There were complaints of lax conduct of the ritual owing to the increase in the number of feasts.

Entry passes

Mr. Radhakrishnan said the PSS would issue entry pass to all the Palliyodam crew members and the special invitees of the person who make the offering. He said the PSS, in consultation with the Travancore Devaswom Board, would also take other steps for improving the conduct of Vallasadya.

Vallasadya is a sumptuous feast given in traditional style to the snakeboat crew by devotees as an offering to the presiding deity at the Sree Parthasarathy temple at Aranmula.

The snakeboats of Aranmula are known as ‘palliyodam,’ which means a vessel belonging to the deity of Parthasarathy temple.

The Vallasadyas offered at the temple are on the rise every year, forcing the temple authorities to extend the period of Vallasadya from 45 to 62 days in recent years. Presently, ‘karayogams’ on the banks of the Pampa in the upstream and downstream of Aranmula have their own palliyodams. Each karayogam maintains its palliyodam with utmost care. They launch the vessel into the Pampa with much fanfare during the Onam festival.

Invitation to crew

As per the custom, devotees who offer the feast have to invite the snakeboat crew of their choice. The boat crew will reach the temple on their snakeboat for the feast, singing hymns in praise of Lord Krishna (Vanchippattu). The feast is served to them immediately after the Utchapuja at the temple.

From August 4

Mr. Radhakrishnan said the PSS would start the Vallasadya offering at the Aranmula temple from August 4. The 62-day annual season of Vallasadya at Aranmula will come to a close on October 4. Devotees who wish to make Vallasadya offering to the deity could make bookings at the PSS office (Phone: 8281113010) at Aranmula, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gv79jx/article30966093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tvpt-snakeboatcrew21,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vallasadyas-reduced-to-10-a-day/article30966067.ece

Hridayapoorvam, an initiative of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) for serving meals to patients and bystanders at the Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha, has completed 1,000 days.

A public meeting to mark the occasion was held on Sunday. It was inaugurated by Public Works Minister G. Sudhakaran.

The DYFI launched the scheme on June 3, 2017 to ensure no one goes hungry at the hospital. Their initial plan was to distribute food to 500 people daily. However, the response to the initiative was overwhelming.

DYFI district president James Samuel said that they had distributed more than four lakh food packets. “On an average, we distribute around 4,000 meals packets daily to inpatients, outpatients, and bystanders at the medical college hospital,” he said. The scheme has been made a success with the help of 149 regional committees of the DYFI. The DYFI is not collecting money from the public for the initiative. The responsibility of food distribution is divided among regional committees. On a given day, volunteers under a particular unit would go door-to-door and collect meals wrapped in plantain leaves and other eco-friendly packaging materials. The food thus collected was brought to the hospital in a vehicle and distributed among the needy every afternoon.

156,2020/03/02,Paddy farmers turn to solar energy for pest control,"Solar light traps deployed in 64 polders in Kallara

Following the growing awareness on environmentally sound technologies, paddy farmers in Kallara — the rice bowl of Kottayam — are now harnessing solar energy to get rid of pests that have infested their fields.

Solar light traps, a low-cost method for killing harmful insecticides, have been deployed in 64 polders spread over 600 hectares of the village.

Insecticides

The introduction of the low-cost technology, according to officials with the Department of Agriculture, intends to end the indiscriminate application of costly insecticides on the crop.

The trap comprises a stand with a vessel, besides a solar panel and an LED bulb.

The light attracts the insects that die after falling into the homemade insecticide kept in the vessel.

“The trap, which will function from 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m., attract insects and they die after falling into the homemade insecticide. Beneficial insects that add value to agriculture, however, will be spared as the light will not function after 10 p.m.,” explains an official. The insecticide in the vessel will be replaced every alternate days.

Joseph Jeffry, agricultural officer, Kallara, says the farmers are extremely enthusiastic about using the method, which is much cheaper and environment-friendly. “The propagation of the method will definitely bring down the indiscriminate pest control methods which demand higher cost and time,” he says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9bjmcx/article30965992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv03spolarrtrap,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/paddy-farmers-turn-to-solar-energy-for-pest-control/article30965985.ece

A milk co-operative in Maharashtra has agreed to supply condensed milk to the Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd. (Milma) to meet the summer milk demand in Kerala.

Crisis

Milma had faced a sudden crisis just ahead of summer. The Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) had cut down its milk supplies to Milma which were used to fill the supply-demand gap in Kerala.

161,2020/03/02,NCP likely to field woman candidate for Kuttanad byelection,"Party to meet today to prepare panel of candidates

The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) State leadership is understood to have zeroed in on a woman candidate for contesting the Kuttanad Assembly byelection.

The party leadership would meet on Tuesday and prepare a panel of three names, including the woman leader who is active in national-level organisational activities, and forward it to the central leadership for final approval.

Proposal

Sources told The Hindu that the proposal to field the woman candidate has gathered momentum in the wake of Thomas K. Thomas, brother of the deceased member Thomas Chandy, Salim P. Mathew and some other regional leaders staking a claim for the seat. The Left Democratic Front (LDF) State leadership and Communist Party of India (Marxist) district leaders are reportedly not keen on fielding either Mr. Thomas or the other leaders. This would give way for the woman candidate.

LDF confident

The LDF exudes confidence of retaining the seat with a comfortable majority and hence it would take due care to avoid a row over the candidate, the sources said.

The claims made by P.J. Joseph and Jose K. Mani, leaders of two warring factions in the Kerala Congress (M), for fielding their nominees, the alleged failure of the Congress in containing the raging differences of opinion among the two and the strain in the relations between the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena are all expected to work to the advantage of the LDF.

Cong. candidate?

The Congress is seriously considering to take over the seat and field its candidate.

The government declaration on the completion of 2 lakh houses under the Life Mission for indigent and weaker sections and the opening of a food court for dishing meals at ₹25 in Alappuzha district have all emboldened the LDF to face elections with confidence. A decision would be made very soon, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/27wdjl/article30966425.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kuttanad-map-revcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ncp-likely-to-field-woman-candidate-in-kuttanad/article30964373.ece
162,2020/03/02,Pinarayi Vijayan says missing cartridges case not to be handed over to CBI,"The CAG had found that live cartridges had disappeared from the State police armoury

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that there is no need at present for the case regarding the disappearance of live cartridges from the police armoury, as flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), to be handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

In reply to K.M. Shaji’s question in the Assembly on Monday on whether the case would be handed over to the CBI, he said that a crime branch investigation was going on. Required action would be taken based on the investigation report. The Public Accounts Committee of the Assembly was looking into the CAG’s finding regarding the missing cartridges.

Also Read Missing rifles: HC calls for action taken report

He said that as many as 12,061 cartridges were found missing from January 1990 to October 2018. The previous United Democratic Front (UDF) government formed a three-member board in 2015 to look into the issue. The board had concluded that hardly any cartridge had gone missing, and tried to play down the discrepancy was due to the stock-taking method of noting the number on top of each box rather than counting the individual cartridges. The UDF government had thus tried to bury the fact that the bullets had gone missing, said Mr. Vijayan.

He said that it was in 2016 that the Left Democratic Front government carried out one more inspection and 11 police personnel were arraigned as accused in a case. A police official who had served as the Quartermaster Havildar at the SAP battalion from 2013 to 2015 was arrested. Since the investigation was progressing effectively, there was no need for another agency to investigate the case at present.

Also Read To prove CAG wrong, Kerala police publicly count rifles

To a question from the Opposition on whether a Minister’s gunman, who was the third accused in the case, would be shifted from the position, the Chief Minister said that action would be decided after the investigation. A comprehensive investigation was being carried out whether similar cases of armoury going missing had happened in the other armed battalions.

On the Opposition’s question as to whether the exhibition of rifles through the media would affect national security, Mr. Vijayan said that it was important to inform the public that not a single rifle had gone missing. A check carried out in the bell of arms had accounted for all of the 660 INSAS rifles and none were missing as pointed out by the CAG. He said the police had counted 647 rifles in the armoury and verified their serial numbers. An India Reserve Battalion unit deployed in Manipur had the remaining 13 guns in its custody.

Mr. Vijayan said that the leaking of the CAG report before it was placed in the Assembly should be viewed seriously.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/m5zhko/article30961712.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PINARAYIVIJAYAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-pinarayi-vijayan-says-missing-cartridges-case-not-to-be-handed-over-to-cbi/article30961713.ece

164,2020/03/02,Man’s body handed over to relatives,"Kannur native tested negative for COVID-19

The Kannur native who died at the Government Medical College, Ernakulam, had tested negative for COVID-19 as per results received from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.

However, the virus was not identified by the NIV.

The body of the 36-year-old, who had arrived here from Malaysia, was handed over to relatives after the results from Pune confirmed that the infection was not COVID-19. The initial test done at NIV, Alappuzha, had declared the patient negative for COVID-19 on Friday, when the patient was admitted to the medical college.

According to the medical college authorities, the patient was seriously ill when he was admitted to the isolation ward of the medical college. He was treated for viral pneumonia along with co-morbid diabetic conditions.

The infection was at least five days old and was possibly not treated, the hospital authorities said.

Under surveillance

As part of COVID-19 surveillance, nine more people had been put under scanner on Sunday. Seven were in home quarantine, while two have been admitted to hospitals. While one person was admitted to the isolation ward at the medical college hospital, another was admitted to a private hospital on Sunday. One person in isolation at the medical college was discharged. Forty-seven people in the district are under home quarantine.

Two samples were sent to Alappuzha NIV for examination.

165,2020/03/02,Heat action plan in the works for State,"KSDMA to formulate steps for tackling heat-related health issues in humans, animals

With the rise in temperature levels posing significant challenges for Kerala, especially on the health front, the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) is bringing out a heat action plan for the State. The Kerala State Heat Action Plan 2020 will be released shortly following a stakeholders’ meeting planned for this week, KSDMA officials said.

As its name suggests, the action plan will lay out guidelines and short and long-term strategies for tackling heat-related incidents. It will list measures to be adopted by government departments and agencies, District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMA) and general public for tackling heat-related health issues in humans and animals.

Dos and don’ts

The action plan will, among other things, specify first-aid measures, procedures for equipping hospitals, dos and don’ts for the public and identify groups vulnerable to heat incidents. It will also include summer-time care of animals which will primarily be the responsibility of the departments of forests, animal husbandry and dairy development.

In October 2019, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) had directed all States to prepare heat action plans. On its part, the KSDMA had already set the groundwork for it after discovering that 1,671 heat-related health issues were reported during the 2019 summer in the State.

Sunburn, sunstroke

This included 800 sunburn cases and 32 sunstroke cases. Heat-related incidents had also caused one death that year.

“The temperature regime across urban and rural Kerala is changing. The response to it largely involves an element of behavioural change also. The government is attempting to adapt our systems to tackle the changing heat regime. Though we have a standard operating procedure for drought, we do not have one for heat,” Sekhar L. Kuriakose, member secretary, KSDMA, said.

On another front, the KSDMA is ensuring the availability of accurate scientific data for issuing heat alerts. It will shortly equip all the 14 district collectorates with ultraviolet (UV) index meters for measuring solar UV radiation levels. The meters have been purchased and are undergoing tests.

Heat index updates

The KSDMA has also requested the India Meteorological Department to provide regular heat index updates.

166,2020/03/02,"PIL wants audio, video recording of HC proceedings","Petitioner wants the Madras HC website to be on par with that of Supreme Court

A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court for audio and video recording of the court proceedings; prompt uploading of daily orders and judgments on the court website and provision of Wi-Fi facilities in all court halls besides encouraging the use of monitors, laptops and tablets by judges as well as lawyers.

India Awake for Transparency, a non-profit private entity registered under the Companies Act of 1956 and represented by its Director Rajender Kumar of Mylapore, has filed the case seeking a direction to the High Court’s Registrar-General to implement the changes suggested by the petitioner company in a representation made on November 18.

According to the petitioner, the Madras High Court website was not as good as the one maintained by the Supreme Court and the Bombay High Court which ensure that every is detail of the case is available to the common man at the click of a button.

It wanted the Madras High Court website to be upgraded on a par with that of the Supreme Court. The representation insisted upon doing away with the practice of listing appeals first for condonation of delay, if any, and then once again for hearing it on merits. The petitioner company said both could happen simultaneously thereby saving time.

Referring to the High Court Registry raising many queries on maintainability of cases and refusing to number them, the representation said it was for the courts and not registry to decide upon maintainability.

167,2020/03/02,HC seeks State’s response on pleas to evict anti-CAA ‘squatters’,"You cannot try to satisfy both sides, judge tells govt. counsel

The Madras High Court on Monday sought the response of the State government and the police by March 9 to a couple of public interest litigation petitions that called for the eviction of all those who were protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act by squatting on public roads without police permission and causing inconvenience to the public.

When the petitions were listed before Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy, they wanted to know what action the police had taken so far on the issue. In reply, Government Advocate (criminal side) P. Kritika Kamal told the court that an FIR had been registered with regard to a protest near Salem old bus stand, against which one of the two PIL petitions had been filed.

“Then, it is all the more a reason for you to act. You cannot try to satisfy both sides,” the senior judge on the Bench said and adjourned further hearing on the PIL petition to March 9 after Additional Government Pleader R. Vijay Kumar sought time for the appearance of Advocate General Vijay Narayan to argue the case on behalf of the State. The PIL petition regarding Dindigul had been filed by G. Kannan, a local resident.

His counsel G. Karthikeyan brought to the court’s notice that even at Mannady in Chennai an entire road had been blocked, though just three anti-CAA protesters were squatting there. He said that such incidents were happening across the State.

In yet another PIL petition, which had been listed before the Bench for deciding its maintainability, the petitioner M. Syed Ibrahim, an advocate, urged the court to ban all anti-CAA protests in the State. The petitioner claimed to have registered Tamil Nadu Egathuva Prachara Jamath in 2012 and to be supporting all good initiatives of the Centre as well as the State government. Referring to a violent clash between anti-CAA protesters and the police at Old Washermenpet on February 14 and the subsequent act of the protesters of squatting on public roads in many districts since then, he said that ordinary citizens were put to “wanton” inconvenience and loss.

Viswanathan, Commissioner of Police, Greater Chennai and the leaders of Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam and Popular Front of India.

The petitioner claimed that a Division Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha had passed an interim order on February 18 banning the Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisations from going ahead with its plan to lay siege to the Secretariat on February 19. Yet, the organisations took out a massive rally in the city on that day and the police did not prevent the protesters from participating in the rally, he alleged.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/j4onxw/article30966246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THCAAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-seeks-states-response-on-pleas-to-evict-anti-caa-squatters/article30966247.ece
168,2020/03/02,PMK asks government not to appeal against court order cancelling doctors’ transfers,"Appealing will further complicate the issue rather than resolve it, PMK leader S. Ramadoss said in a statement

PMK founder S. Ramadoss on Monday said the State government should not appeal against the Madras High Court order cancelling the transfer orders of 135 government doctors, who had gone on a strike, with a number of demands, including wage increases, last October.

In a statement, Dr. Ramadoss said the Madras High Court has cancelled the transfer order only after clearly stating that the government doctors, who have been demanding reinstatement of 50% reservation in post-graduation courses for Tamil Nadu government doctors, wage increase as per service and other demands, have no right to protest whatsoever.

“The 135 protesting doctors were transferred to far away places and were given 17B notifications. The doctors went to the Madras High Court, which gave a ruling cancelling the transfer orders and said the Tamil Nadu government had not approached the matter properly and found merit in the demands placed by the doctors,” said Ramadoss.

He further said that reports of Tamil Nadu government’s appealing against this cancellation of transfer orders will further complicate the issue rather than resolve it.

“A government that cares about the welfare of the people should not think of ‘winning’ in a situation but in ensuring that such a situation doesn’t arise in the future. The Court has reversed the transfer orders only after stating that the government doctors don’t have a right to protest. By accepting the Madras High Court’s order, the government can ensure that the government doctors won’t protest in future. This will benefit all,” he said. The transfers of experienced doctors affected functioning of hospitals affecting scores of poor patients, he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/pmk-asks-government-not-to-appeal-against-court-order-cancelling-doctors-transfers/article30963122.ece
169,2020/03/02,"In Tamil Nadu, primary health centres have now been transformed into Ayushman Bharat health and wellness centres","These centres will now screen for diabetes, hypertension and cancer and will also provide trauma care

A total of 1,384 existing Primary Health Centres (PHC) and 460 urban PHCs across Tamil Nadu have been transformed into health and wellness centres under the Centre’s flagship programme -- Ayushman Bharat. Of the 8,000-odd health sub-centres in the State, 985 have so far been transformed into health and wellness centres, while the remaining will be converted in a phased manner.

The creation of 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres across the country is one of the two components of Ayushman Bharat; the aim being providing comprehensive primary health care. To do this, existing PHCs, urban PHCs and health sub-centres are being converted into health and wellness centres in the State through the National Health Mission (NHM) - Tamil Nadu.

K. Senthil Raj, mission director, NHM-TN, said the objective of transforming existing primary healthcare facilities into health and wellness centres was to provide comprehensive primary healthcare to people. “The focus is primarily on screening for Non- Communicable Diseases. Screening for diabetes, hypertension, cancers of the cervix, breast and oral cancer will be available. The centres will provide medications for diabetes and hypertension, and refer those diagnosed with cancer to higher centres for further treatment/management. Apart from this, trauma care, including for injuries from falls and poisonous bites, will be provided,” he said.

While PHCs provide round-the-clock services, health sub-centres function from morning to evening, he said. As per the Government of India’s instructions, health sub-centres are being transformed into health and wellness centres in a phased manner as there were requirements of training the existing staff, he said, adding: “In each health unit district, one block has been identified for universal health coverage. All health sub-centres in these blocks have been transformed into health and wellness centres.”

District-level public health officials said that while a majority of the services at PHCs remained the same after being transformed into health and wellness centres, it is the health sub-centres that now offer additional services. One of the main additions are facilities to collect blood samples, an official said.

“Blood samples for blood sugar or blood pressure level or haemoglobin are being collected at the sub-centres, and transported in a vehicle to the nearby PHC or block PHC. If a person needs his/her urea or creatinine levels checked, the village health nurse would make arrangements to transport the samples to the PHC. Earlier, medications for diabetes and hypertension were not available at the sub-centres. Now, these medications are available for patients, and about 25 drugs have been added to the sub-centre for the benefit of patients,” the official added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/esynso/article30962993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02MARTH--PHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/in-tamil-nadu-primary-health-centres-have-now-been-transformed-into-ayushman-bharat-health-and-wellness-centres/article30962994.ece

They were concerned about the goodwill the government would earn if the mega project gets implemented, he claimed. “All villages will get internet facility through this scheme,” he said.

The Chief Minister said Mr. Babu took part in a video-conference with him just four days ago. “If he had opted for voluntary retirement, he must have left by now. Is he not still in his job?” he asked.

175,2020/03/02,AIADMK appears disinclined to give Rajya Sabha berth to DMDK,"Strong competition for 3 seats within ruling party, say leaders

Notwithstanding the request and expectations from the DMDK for a Rajya Sabha berth, the ruling AIADMK appears to be disinclined to fulfil its ally’s desire, as there was no specific agreement between the parties on this during last year’s Lok Sabha elections.

Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, when asked if the DMDK would be given a seat in the upcoming Rajya Sabha polls, remained non-committal, said, “Alliance parties naturally ask for seats. The party leadership will decide.”

Many second-line party leaders are of the view that there was no necessity to accommodate the DMDK’s demand as the ruling party was in a position only to nominate three candidates and there was pressure within the organisation for the seats. “Unlike our alliance agreement with the PMK, where we committed to share a Rajya Sabha seat, we did not have a similar arrangement with the DMDK,” said a senior AIADMK leader. “Like our Chief Minister said they [DMDK] have the right to ask [for a seat]. But, it may not be appropriate to seriously expect us to give a seat,” he said.

‘At least 10 to 15 seniors’

Another AIADMK leader pointed out that at least 10 to 15 seniors in the party were expecting to be nominated. “Of them, at least five are serious contenders. When we have a strong competition within our party for the three seats, how could we part with one seat to an ally,” he asked.

However, he acknowledged that there may be some voices within the party supporting the DMDK’s request, considering the need to keep the alliance intact till next year’s Assembly polls. “Only because of this possibility, our CM has said a high-level committee will decide and the party leadership will announce the candidates,” he added.

Asked whether not accommodating the DMDK would weaken the alliance, he said, “We are in alliance because of our common objective to keep the DMK out of power. If parties are in an alliance for a Rajya Sabha seat, it would amount to opportunistic politics.” The party should choose someone who will strongly put forward its stand on various issues in the Upper House, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-appears-disinclined-to-give-rajya-sabha-berth-to-dmdk/article30959290.ece
176,2020/03/02,"Villages in Madurai, Virudhunagar keep menstruating women away","Superstition and fear of reprisal keep them confined to unhygienic rooms

Every time a woman in Pottal Pacheri gets her monthly period, she makes her way to a dilapidated room in the middle of the village where barely two people can stand comfortably.

Even if she does not get it after 30 days, she usually ends up going to the room. “People will otherwise begin speculating over what caused the delayed period,” said R. Thangaselvi, 40, a resident of the village.

The women of Pottal Pacheri simply call the structure a room; some call it a “guest house”. The room’s badly damaged roof scares the women; they said they were in the room during the day but slept outside their houses at night. “When it rains, water fills the area. The roof can fall at any time because it has been 22 years since the structure was built but no one has really maintained it,” said S. Palaniammal, 42.

Inside the room, a soiled pillow and two old mats hang from hooks on the wall. Dried animal waste can also be seen inside.

Menstruating women, considered “untouchable” during their monthly period, are isolated in the rooms. The women are convinced that calamities will befall the village if they break the practice. “We may never be able to bear children again. How can we risk that?” asked S. Mahalakshmi*, a resident of Koovalapuram.

Similar rooms are found in Pudupatti, Pottal Pacheri and Koovalapuram in Madurai district, and in Saptur Alagapuri and Govindallapuram in Virudhunagar district. The villages are located with 5 km of one another. Going by the villagers’ accounts, the rooms have existed for at least five generations. Young women from the villages said they did not dare question the emotions and practices of the villagers, and hence followed the practice.

Windows closed

While the structure in Pottal Pacheri is quite decrepit, other villages have pucca structures with concrete or thatched roofs.

In Koovalapuram, Govindallapuram and Saptur Alagapuri, the rooms are fairly ventilated. However, the windows are almost always closed. In Koovalapuram and Pudupatti, the rooms are provided with fans and lights.

Outside the guest house in Koovalapuram and inside all other structures hang brightly coloured bags that have a period package. Women usually carry clothes, utensils, soap, sanitary napkins and sometimes talcum powder. Since it is a monthly visit to these guest houses, the cloth bags remain firmly tied and usually occupies the same position each time one person uses it.

None of the rooms has toilets. Menstruating women go to the fields to answer the call of nature at night or at dawn. A number of women have complained of rashes, infections and complications in their pregnancy due to the lack of hygiene.

Most of the rooms do not have proper water supply. Food is provided based on the whims of the families of menstruating women. “When they give us food, they literally throw it from a distance so as to avoid any form of touch. If they even accidentally touch us, they will go and take a bath. We cannot partake in any functions or activities [during the period],” said C. Annathai (30), a resident of Pottal Pacheri. Even women visiting the village who get their period were asked to stay in the room, she said.

“Everytime I get my period, I go back to my mother’s house in Theni. This is a practice that I cannot relate to and it is easier when I am in my home,” said M. Lakshmi* (21), a resident of Pudupatti who moved here two years ago after her marriage.

E. Shanmugavalli, who lives in Pottal Pacheri, said many women send their children to hostels in nearby towns like Sattur, Peraiyur and Krishnankoil to avoid the practice altogether.

Awareness programme

In Govindallapuram, the room used by menstruating women was constructed with funds from a rural local body as a room for the area’s self-help groups (SHGs) for a sum of ₹3 lakh. Since there is no toilet facility, the panchayat members were collecting ₹2,000 from each household, said S. Pechi*, a resident of the village.

In Koovalapuram, a worker of the district administration said the funds allocated for the construction of a room at their local school had been redirected to build a second “guest-house” in the village.

‘No stigma’

Madurai Collector T. G. Vinay said he had informed the District Social Welfare Officer and asked the Revenue Divisional Officer to approach the villagers and convince them that there was no stigma attached to menstruating women.

“More discussions will soon follow. We are investigating,” Mr. Vinay said.

In the past week, media attention on Koovalapuram’s practices for menstruating women through messages on WhatsApp have had both a positive and negative effect. “People in the village are merely following their beliefs. Nobody is forced to go to these rooms. They do it on out of their own will,” said Koovalapuram panchayat president T. Dhanasekaran.

He said the “negative news” about the village has damaged the reputation of the Scheduled Caste community in these villages, the only community to follow the practice.

177,2020/03/02,Tamil Nadu has seen dip in number of road accidents since 2016: Transport Authority,"Officials give credit to measures taken to correct black spots

The recent accident involving a container lorry and the Kerala State Transport Corporation (KSRTC) bus in Tiruppur has put the spotlight on the need for rigorous road safety measures in the State. The Road Transport Department’s safety wing, however, said the total number of accidents has been coming down since 2016.

Citing data, a senior official of the State Transport Authority said fatalities have been coming down. He said the total number of fatalities in 2019 was 10,525 against 12,216 in 2018 (January to December). In 2017, the total number of deaths recorded was 16,157, while in 2016, which has been kept as the base year, it was 17,218.

T.S. Jawahar, Transport Commissioner, acknowledged that one of the main causes of road accidents was black spots on highways. He said as per the Report on Road Safety, nearly 170 black spots were identified in 2013-14 all over the network of highways.

Black spot analysis was done based on the direction of the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety to identify accident spots where 5 or more fatalities were recorded between 2013 and 2015. A total of 85 black spots in 2014-15 and 64 in 2015-16 were identified.

In 2016-17, these spots were marked in 44 places, which were recommended for corrective measures. Mr. Jawahar said the measures involved short, mid and long-term steps comprising fixing of barricades, speed breakers, installation of highmast lights and reflectors and improvement of intersections.

Monitoring system

Mr. Jawahar added that the automatic monitoring system, for which the State government allotted ₹25 crore, once implemented would prevent speeding and bring down accident rates in the coming years. According to Highways Department sources, for the State, which has a total of 6,634 km of National Highways and 11,169 km of State Highways, during 2014-15 to 2018-19, a total amount of ₹1,152.19 crore was allocated for black spot correction. This lead to the decrease in fatalities. The National Highways Authority of India too, which identified 78 black spots last year, has corrected 17 of them and work is under way at 43 spots.

The cost in terms of medical expenses, loss of work, productivity, income and physiological and psychological suffering is pegged at around ₹22,200 crore annually in Tamil Nadu. “We ensure that road safety is an integral part of road design right from the planning stage and when accidents happen, our officials visit the spot immediately to assess the reason along with the police officers. A Road Accident Data Management System that is under the combined control of the police and the highways department helps keep tab of causes and efforts taken to reduce accidents,” an official explained.

A former Highways Department engineer explained that though highways were designed for high speed, the police took steps to curb speeding.

178,2020/03/02,Islamic leaders call on Rajini to discuss CAA,"He understood the merit in our arguments, says federation chief Bakavi

Representatives of the Federation of Tamil Nadu Islamic and Political Organisations met actor Rajinikanth at his Poes Garden residence on Sunday to discuss issues surrounding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.

Moulvi P.V. Kajamoideen Bakavi, head of the Federation, told journalists that its members were concerned over the actor’s comments in support of CAA, prompting them to meet him in person and explain their opposition to the law.

“We sent a letter and wanted to meet him to explain our point of view. Mr. Rajinikanth accepted that fear had been created in the minds of people and said we shall all work towards removing that fear,” Mr. Bakavi said. “He understood the merit in our arguments,” he added.

In a statement on social media, Mr. Rajinikanth said he felt happy meeting and hearing the views of functionaries of the Tamil Nadu Jamaat Ul Ulama. He said he agreed with their view that love, unity and peace must be the primary objectives of a nation.

179,2020/03/02,‘AIIMS will come up in Madurai as per schedule’,"Union Minister lays foundation for ₹325-cr. medical college

Assuring that an All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) will come up in Madurai as per schedule, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Sunday said the Centre would extend all necessary support to the health sector.

Laying the foundation stone for a new government medical college which will come up on a sprawling 22-acre area at an estimated cost of ₹325 crore in Ramanathapuram, he said the proposed AIIMS would have state-of-the-art infrastructure and research facilities on a par with international standards. The funds had been earmarked and the project work would be expedited by the agencies concerned, he said.

Lauding the State government for the proactive measures being taken in the health sector, Dr. Vardhan said the parameters achieved by the State in MMR/IMR were impressive. He appealed to the Health Ministry officials to ensure that there were no maternal deaths.

“Take it as a challenge,” he said, adding that unless the cause of death was unavoidable, there should not be any casualties.

Quoting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he highlighted the plan to have 75 new medical colleges built in as many districts by the time the country celebrates its 75th Independence Day in 2022. The idea was that the government should reach out to the districts that had never received adequate attention since Independence and bring them into the mainstream. Tamil Nadu had benefitted from the initiative as it had received approval to start medical colleges in 11 districts, including Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar, within six months, he added.

He lauded Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, State Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar, Health Secretary Beela Rajesh and Ramanathapuram Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao for preparing the Detailed Project Report, which facilitated the speedy sanctioning of funds by the Centre.

180,2020/03/02,NRC absurd and dangerous: PMK,"CAA is a ‘very normal law and amendment’, says Anbumani

At its special general body meeting in Chennai on Sunday, the PMK, an ally of the BJP and the AIADMK, issued a call for adopting an Assembly resolution against the proposed National Register of Citizens. However, the party defended its support for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, describing it as a “very normal law and amendment”.

PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss said, “There is no clarity among the people about CAA, a law that gives citizenship to minorities (Hindus, Jains, Christians, Buddhists, Sikhs and Parsis) from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. It is a very normal law and amendment. It does not take anyone’s citizenship away. It is not mentioned anywhere in the law that someone’s citizenship will be taken away.”

At the same time, he said the NRC was “absurd and dangerous”. “The PMK is against it, and it is not needed. The party founder (S. Ramadoss) has opposed it on many occasions and has written to Prime Minister Modi [about it]. It is not only us, but the Tamil Nadu government also agrees with this. Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said he had spoken to Modi about NRC, and that the latter had told him that NRC will not be implemented in India,” Dr. Ramadoss said.

The party leadership urged its cadre to work hard to put the PMK in positions of power in the State in order to implement its “dream policies”. Dr. Ramadoss urged MLA-hopefuls to mingle with the public as the 2021 Assembly election, which will be held in the absence of two tall leaders, M. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa, following their death, is an important one for the party.

He claimed that a DMK man had told him that money meant for distribution to voters had already been sent to 37 constituencies. “The DMK is fully dependent on money and Prashant Kishor (its election strategist). But we trust the people,” he said.

Dr. Ramadoss said a decision on an alliance will be taken before the Assembly election.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nrc-absurd-and-dangerous-pmk/article30959062.ece
181,2020/03/02,‘Popular mood on CAA prompted Rajini to alter stance’,"Actor must have sensed the prevailing public sentiment in the wake of the Delhi riots, says CPI(M) State secretary

Actor Rajinikanth, a strong votary of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, has blamed the Home Ministry and an intelligence failure on the part of the Centre for the recent riots in Delhi, and has sought to steer clear of his pro-BJP political image. CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan feels the prevailing popular mood against CAA has prompted the actor to alter his stand. Excerpts:

In the wake of the Delhi riots, Mr. Rajinikanth has hit out at the Centre. How do you view this?

Everyone has been expressing concern over the riots, and Mr. Rajinikanth also would have felt strongly that this should be condemned. No one can be happy about the loss of human lives. When it comes to CAA, he should seek the opinions of all sides before taking a stand. In the beginning, he seemed to echo the BJP’s view on the issue. The reality is that this is an unnecessary Act deliberately imposed on the people. CAA is not going to resolve any of the pressing issues facing the country. On the contrary, it has created a divide among the people and triggered riots. I think Mr. Rajinikanth has sensed it.

Does that mean he is distancing himself from the BJP?

Mr. Rajinikanth himself has clarified that he cannot be branded as a voice of the BJP just because he supports the party on some issues. Probably, he is under compulsion to diverge from his earlier stand as he would have sensed the prevailing public sentiment. It is everyone’s expectation that he should take the secular tradition and pluralism of Tamil Nadu into consideration and take a political decision. I do not think he is a BJP supporter. But the views he had expressed were construed to mean that he was on the BJP’s side.

There has been a change in him. Otherwise, what is the need for him to hold consultations with Muslim representatives? It is good that he is not adamantly sticking to his stand.

What kind of an impact do you think he will make in politics?

That could be determined only after he launches his party and publicises his stand on many basic and vital issues and the solutions for them.

Will the AIADMK government benefit electorally by declaring the Cauvery delta a protected agricultural zone?

I do not think their efforts will pay electoral dividends. The AIADMK government continues to toe the BJP line on all issues. The announcement will not give any boost to agriculture. The nature of the delta’s landscape is not uniform. Tail-end regions never get adequate water. One side is surrounded by sea and has been converted into shrimp farms. The government should promote agro-based industry. The role of the farmers ends with harvest, and they have nothing to do with post-harvest operations. Food processing industries alone will improve the situation.

How do you view the DMK’s prospects?

In the current circumstances, the DMK and other secular parties will certainly win an election. The trend that prevailed during the Lok Sabha poll continues, though the subsequent bypolls were won by the AIADMK. But byelections are not the indicators of what people are thinking.

Your Rajya Sabha member T.K. Rangarajan’s term is set to end. Will you be approaching the DMK for a berth?

No. We do not have any representation in the Assembly. Our party did not discuss the issue with the DMK during the seat-sharing talks for the Lok Sabha polls.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/yl1np1/article30959054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02BALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/popular-mood-on-caa-prompted-rajini-to-alter-stance/article30959055.ece
182,2020/03/02,Indian Medical Association flags depiction of unscientific facts in Malayalam films,"The Central Board of Film Certification urged to constitute medical advisory committee, after audience response to ‘Joseph’ and ‘Trance'

An increasing number of medical professionals have been flagging unscientific representation of facts related to medical field and treatment of diseases in Malayalam films in recent times.

Now, the Kerala chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has intervened in the issue, requesting the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to take the opinion of a medical advisory committee before certifying films depicting medical issues.

The IMA has, in a letter to the CBFC as well as the Culture Minister, requested to constitute such an advisory committee consisting of experts from the medical field, as a large number of people are often misled by such messages in films, which often have no scientific basis.

Two films

The letter specifically cites two much-appreciated films from recent times, ‘Joseph’ and ‘Trance’.

In ‘Joseph’, directed by M. Padmakumar, the narrative revolves around a retired police officer investigating the death of his former wife, and uncovering an organ harvesting racket. According to the letter, people were discouraged from signing up for organ donation.

In the case of ‘Trance’, released two weeks ago, the IMA said that the movie had certain sequences which made misleading comments on psychiatric and psychotropic, leading to concerns among patients.

“Since cinema is a very powerful medium, what is being said through it reaches a lot of people, creating the kind of impact we cannot imagine of. For instance, in the case of ‘Joseph’, the number of organ donations came almost to a standstill in 2019, after the movie was released. This was at a time when there were more than 3,000 patients waiting for various organs. Till then, we were making immense progress in organ donation. After this dip, we had to organise a lot of awareness campaigns to dispel fears regarding organ donation, which the government is overseeing using stringent norms,” says P. Gopikumr, State Secretary of IMA.

He says that after the release of ‘Trance’, some psychiatrists reported their patients requesting them to change their medications, as the movie had specifically named some of these medicines as causing brain damage and other serious problems.

Social media posts

The movie had led to posts from several doctors and psychiatrists in social media over the past few days, countering some of the claims made in the movie.

“What if some one with severe depression were to commit suicide because someone told him about what’s mentioned in the movie about psychiatric drugs? What if he himself watched the movie and decided to stop his medications without consulting his doctor? Being an ardent movie buff myself, it hurts me to say that malayalam cinema needs to start researching more and may even discuss with professionals and make all movies technically sound,” posted Samin Sameed, a doctor, in Facebook.

Mr. Gopikumar says that more films on scientific and medical subjects should come in Malayalam films to make people aware, but these should be factually accurate.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4b4zy2/article30966994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tvtvtrance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ima-requests-censor-board-to-constitute-medical-advisory-panel/article30964859.ece

185,2020/03/02,'Geetha Govindam' and 'HIT' cinematographer Manikandan on his work mantra,"The ace technician speaks about how 'HIT' filmmaker Sailesh Kolanu's clarity on the subject made a difference

Chennai-based DoP, Manikandan had worked in Mukunda, Srirasthu Subhamasthu, Geetha Govindam and now the just-released HIT. Is he elated at the appreciation the movie is getting? “HIT is a story that I fell for. From a cameraman’s perspective there’s a different way of approaching a thriller — a certain amount of ratio in the use of lighting and contrast. I followed the script keenly. I was with Sailesh Kolanu (director of HIT) for one month discussing our plans. Despite being a first timer, Sailesh had great clarity. He also had a clear idea of the technicians and why he wanted to designate a particular person for a department. He apparently took notes on my work after watching my films. I could understand him perfectly in his narration.”

After Geetha Govindam, he must have been flooded with offers? “I got an opportunity to be associated with web series Queen and Auto Shankar. There was so much scope for experimenting, but at the end of the day movies are more energising and give a high after release,” he says. Elaborating on the difference between the two, he says OTT is a strong and a new platform and it is growing by the day.

“There is a duration limitation in films, but in web series there is lot of input required in all spheres. Screen has a grandeur, people watch high quality television series but we need to match that and do better than that, so we need to invest more,” he says.

Dispelling the myth that when a debutant director is at the helm, producers engage strong technicians to back him up, Manikandan says, “The director gives two or three years to the script and he knows what he is doing before he embarks on the project. There is always an interaction between the director and technicians and there is scope for trying a new approach.”

Manikandan was exposed to photography in school where it was one of the vocational subjects. He learnt negative exposing and development there and found the entire process interesting. At Chennai’s MGR institute, he studied cinematography and met lot of well-known personalities in the field.

“I worked as operative camera man in many films and now that I have become a DoP, I rope in many students who graduate from that college as apprentices,” he says and adds, “After converting to digital, I worked on a Tamil film which fetched awards.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/gvfcif/article30963299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym03manikandan-1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/geetha-govindam-and-hit-cinematographer-manikandan-on-his-work-mantra/article30963300.ece
186,2020/03/02,Into the wild: Rana Daggubati on 'Kaadan' and running with herds of elephants,"The 'Baahubali' actor opens up on his new film where he plays the jungle man, and being the voice of animals

For nearly two years, actor-producer Rana Daggubati sported long beard and a lean look, and had stated that it was his look for his new film. Now that the trilingual — Haathi Mere Saathi in Hindi, Aranya in Telugu and Kaadan in Tamil — is up for release on April 2, the actor laughs and says, “Now you know why I looked like that,” referring to his role of a ‘jungle man’.

Directed by Prabhu Solomon who earlier tapped into the wilderness for his Tamil films Mynaa and Kumki, the new film is a fiction inspired by true incidents and people, particularly environment activist Jadav Payeng. The Padma Shri winner who hails from the ‘Mising’ tribe in Assam, converted more than 1300 acres of barren land into a reserve forest.

Rana plays Bandev, the jungle man, who stands up against urbanisation encroaching into jungle corridors.

“We have meetings in conference rooms and are unaware about the larger world out there. Every animal, plant and insect plays a role in sustaining Earth. We don’t know enough about people living in proximity with the wild — the tribes, elephant trainers... When we have a problem, there are forums to complain. Where do the animals go when their homes are invaded? Bandev is their voice,” Rana explains.

The film talks about the threat to forests, geographically appropriating the regions for Hindi, Telugu and Tamil versions. “Prabhu knows the terrain and its problems thanks to his earlier films. In areas near Coimbatore, forest land is being converted to tea estates, Kaziranga in Assam and Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh have different issues,” says Rana.

Prabhu met Rana when the actor had completed Baahubali and was looking like “an amateur bodybuilder”. Prabhu narrated the story before he went on location recce to different places, including Kaziranga National Park. “When he returned, he told me something 20 times more detailed. Everything that was there in the story was layered further, with information about true incidents and people. Prabhu first described the jungle and its issues, and then detailed the character of Bandev — where he comes from and why he cares for the environment,” recalls the actor.

Acting for Baahubali required both Rana and Prabhas to bulk up and look like warriors. Rana then sported a lean, muscular look for Ghazi and now, a nearly-malnourished and lean look for Aranya. “When I was younger, I would go about these transformations crazily. Then I learnt there’s a scientific process and work with fitness trainers and nutritionists,” says Rana. He turned vegetarian and occasionally vegan to shed the Baahubali muscles. He admits that it’s ideal to lead a healthy, balanced lifestyle for 20 to 25 years, adding, “But that’s not my job. There’s no fun if I don’t play unique characters and don’t look the part.”

Rana underwent a look test with a short beard and was almost tonsured. But Prabhu wasn’t convinced. “He said ‘ottalai’ (it doesn’t stick/gel with the character),” laughs Rana. The actor was asked to lose his heavy muscles and look lean, almost malnourished.

As he got leaner, Rana trained for 15 days with Kumki elephant trainers, cinematographer Ashok Kumar; the costume and makeup team also stepped in. This was like an orientation period before they would shoot for more than 100 days in six jungles, including deep forests of Kerala, Satara, Mahabaleshwar and Thailand.

The three languages have different supporting cast and Rana had to shoot each shot, each scene thrice. “Forest officers, tribes and trainers in south India would look very different from those in the North. So Prabhu would look at someone and say ‘ivara paatha Maharashtrian madiri irukkare’ (he looks like a Maharashtrian) and would change him for the Telugu version,” says Rana.

The first shooting schedule was the toughest. Rana shot for 30 days in the jungles, with no mobile connectivity and no co-stars. The disconnect from the outside world helped him get into the zone this film required. The silence of the jungle as well as the sounds that arise from the conversations between animals, made the experience surreal: “It’s magical when the sun goes down and you see things glittering in the dark.”

He listened to stories of forest rangers to understand their world and believes that cinema can be a big influence in highlighting the importance of ecological balance. “And we are doing it in a mainstream format,” Rana adds.

The team shot in the forests of Thailand with herds of elephants. Looking back, Rana says it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience: “Anything can happen when you run with a herd of 15 elephants.” The jungle was also peaceful, he remembers: “All that greenery makes you calm.”

It’s been 10 years since he debuted as an actor with Sekhar Kammula’s Leader and since then, has constantly sought the alternative space, not wanting to do the regular hero-worshipping Telugu films, “After Leader, very few people here told me the kind of stories I was looking for. So I went to Mumbai and then to Chennai since I liked the films that directors like Bala and Ameer were making. Now, I am glad we have more than a handful of Telugu filmmakers presenting different content so often.”

Summer 2020, he says, looks promising and cites Anushka Shetty’s Nishabdham and Ram’s Red, among others, for promising something new: “The millennials are doing something right,” he sums up with a laugh.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/5rylo5/article30963292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rana-Aranya,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/into-the-wild-rana-daggubati-on-kaadan-and-running-with-herds-of-elephants/article30963293.ece
187,2020/03/02,Catching up with Sibiraj and Jayaprakash on the sets of ‘Kabadadaari’,"How an evening with the cast and crew of the upcoming Tamil cop film panned out

“Take polaama?” asks director Pradeep Krishnamoorthy, peering into the monitor. He is happy with the way the frame is set — an angry Sibiraj pointing a gun at Jayaprakash. “Ready ah?”

Not everybody is. Cinematographer Rasamathi, perched precariously atop two stools that have been stacked on top of each other, spots someone’s shadow in the corner of his frame. It is one of the light boys who is getting things ready for the next shot. He moves away, and the shot is canned successfully.

All this action is taking place inside a dingy room at Sathyalok School for Special Children in Porur. On another day, it might have been a classroom packed with students. But today, the crew of upcoming Tamil film Kabadadaari (remake of Kannada hit Kavaludaari) have converted it into a ‘hideout’ of a disgruntled journalist, played by Jayaprakash.

“It’s again a father character, but quite different from what I’ve been playing for a very long time,” says Jayaprakash, when we catch him during a short break, “Generally, I’m called for the soft-spoken, nice man roles. But I’m happy that the makers of Kabadadaari wanted to ‘de-glamourise’ me.”

So, Pradeep and Jayaprakash sat down to design the look of an “unhealthy, unsuccessful man who is generally frustrated” for the film that is now being shot in both Tamil and Telugu. “I love this team,” says Jayaprakash, who will soon head to shoot in picturesque locations of Courtallam for Karthick Raju’s upcoming bilingual.

Cop tales

Sibiraj has just completed a close-up shot of him keeping a gun inside his pocket. He sinks into a chair and whips out his phone to check messages, and informs me that he has a handful of projects like Walter, Ranga, Ranger,Maayon and Vattam in his line-up. In Kabadadaari, he plays a traffic cop for the first time. “Just think about how they carry out their duties in the summer months,” he says, “My respect for them has increased a lot.” In the movie, Sibiraj happens to investigate a crime that happened three decades ago — something that he feels will be new to Tamil audience.

By now, the crew is moving the equipment and lights to an exterior location inside the premises of the school. Supervising them is Rasamathi, who will have to can some top-angle shots for the next sequence featuring Sibiraj and Jayaprakash. We use this break to catch up with the most busy man on set: director Pradeep, who is already discussing the next day’s schedule with producer G Dhananjayan. “When I do a remake, I keep my brains aside. The original essence should not be missed,” says Pradeep, who previously helmed Sathya, a remake of the Telugu hit Kshanam.

Role play

Pradeep is also doing a short role in the film. Mention that to him and he starts smiling, “That was a big accident.” An actor who was originally chosen for the role wasn’t very convincing and Pradeep had to step in at the last-minute.

The sun is going down fast and Pradeep and team are in a hurry — for, he has to complete a few sequences before the light fails him. Says Dhananjayan, “Shooting is like war; if we achieve something that we planned for the day, the war is won and we feel happy.” That evening at the Sathyalok School for Special Children, the team of Kabadadaari were proud winners.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/8q9ztl/article30963250.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2MPKABADARRI1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/on-the-sets-of-kabadadaari/article30963252.ece

189,2020/03/02,‘There’s a magical power in Rahman Sir’s studio’: Singer Nakul Abhyankar,"The 'CEO in the House' and 'Koode' singer talks about working with A. R. Rahman, how reality shows helped him and more

Nakul Abhyankar was living his childhood dream, two years ago. He was at AR Rahman’s studio, in front of the musical genius, to record ‘Neeli Kanumallo’, the Telugu version of ‘Mazhai Kuruvi’, sung in Tamil by Rahman.

The experience for Nakul was borderline-surreal despite a steady rise in his music career: reality show participant to reality show winner to graduate diploma in music at KM Music Conservatory to film singer.

“Whatever experience you have, counts for nothing when you are at his studio for the first time,” says Nakul. “It was overwhelming for me”. The realisation of a childhood dream can be for anyone. Nakul grew up listening to, and later playing on his keyboard, the tunes of Rahman. It was the latter who spurred his fascination for film music. So, to sing in front of his idol was a moment to treasure.

“On one hand, it was emotional for me. But at the same time, he is a music director and I am a singer. And, we had to work together to bring the song out.” Nakul was torn between his disbelief of working with Rahman and actually working with Rahman.

‘Neeli Kanumallo’ had several high-pitch portions. “Generally, with these portions, we tend to push a lot and we end up stressing on certain parts. But this song had to flow smoothly like butter. It was tricky.”

The song, ultimately, came out well. “Sir loved it.” After a brief pause, he adds: “There is a magical power that exists in that studio. You end up doing things you don’t expect yourself to do.”

In the family

Nakul moved from Bengaluru to Chennai in 2013, when he decided to quit his IT job and join Rahman’s KM Music Conservatory. But he didn’t realise his passion for music during his days of nine-to-five drudgery.

His isn’t that clichéd story that many upcoming writers and artists share. The IT job was just a detour. His pursuit of a career in music was organic. One of his grandfathers was a Haridasa (raconteur) and the other a Yakshagana artist. “All my cousins learnt music. My brother was greatly talented in singing. He taught me a lot. So, it wasn’t like someone had to tell me to learn music. I would just pick up the harmonium in the house and start playing the national anthem or rhymes.”

‘Neeli Kanumallo’ from Nawab (Telugu)

‘CEO in the House’ from Sarkar (Tamil)

‘Manase Manase’ from Are Marler (Tulu)

‘Koode’ from Koode (Malayalam)

He was a part of the school’s music team, as a keyboard player. In 2009 and 2010, respectively, Nakul won the Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Kannada and finished in the top-nine of Sa Re Ga Ma Pa Hindi. Participation in these reality shows helped him immensely. “These shows aren’t just about fame. They help you get contacts and validation. For example, the judges of the show, like Hamsalekha Sir, are big names in the industry. When they evaluate your singing, you know where you stand. So, yes, [reality shows] opened a lot of doors for me.”

Nakul got his first song, ‘Kendhaavara Hoove’ (Kirataka) after composer V Manohar liked his performances in Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. “But the studio environment is completely different. It takes some time to get used to it. I had to sing my first song thrice to be approved by the composer.”

Despite getting to sing in films, he felt the need to learn more about music. Which is when he enrolled at KM Conservatory. “I already had some training in Indian classical music. And, Indian classical is melody-driven. But western classical has more to do with harmony. And, film music is a marriage of harmony and melody. At KM, I learnt a lot of western techniques, orchestration, opera singing, programming… My voice and style before and after KM are completely different.”

For someone who was always sure about a profession in music, Nakul’s still uncertain if he should specialise in one aspect of it — the education at KM broadened his scope. So, apart from singing, he also composes music -- he has so far scored for Unarvu (Tamil), College Kumara (Telugu and Tamil), Kannad Gothilla (Kannada), and Bicchugatti: Chapter 1 (Kannada), which is set to release later this year. When he has no singing or composing projects, he says, “I hang around Rahman Sir’s studio to program for him.” The studio where magic happens.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3dhavb/article30962288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28bgm-Nakul1JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/theres-a-magical-power-in-rahman-sirs-studio-singer-nakul-abhyankar/article30962289.ece
190,2020/03/02,"BIFFes: ‘I have watched Sholay 500 times,’ says Iranian filmmaker Shahed Ahmadlou","The 'Cinema Donkey' director says that Ramesh Sippy’s curry western spurred him to make movies

The 12th edition of the Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFes) opened on Thursday with the Iranian dark comedy Cinema Donkey, written and directed by Shahed Ahmadlou.

It was one of the films that had a packed house on the festival’s first day. Ahmadlou says, “The movie is about friendship and peace and how important it is for the world. There is no other way to achieve success other than love and honesty.”

The message it tries to convey might sound banal. But more than the moral, it is the story that matters, especially with films. And, Cinema Donkey has an intriguing plot. According to the film’s official synopsis, it is about a filming group making a “film that has a message for humanity. They need a professional donkey for a few scenes. The budget and time limitations have made it difficult for them to find a donkey. Until the production group finds a donkey wandering in the woods.”

To film this seemingly simple, bitter-sweet tale, wasn’t easy for Ahmadlou. One of the reasons was using a real donkey in the film. “In the end, a donkey is a donkey. It tends to do what it wants to,” he says, straight-faced, “And, we are trying to make a movie about some people making a movie. Whatever problems the characters faced in the movie, we faced them too.”

Crazy about Sholay

Ahmadlou, 45, started his career as an actor. He then began making experimental films, some of which won awards from domestic and international festivals. He won the UNICA Gold Medal for the short film Cinema Dog.

He got into films after watching Ramesh Sippy’s Sholay. “I have watched it over 500 times. I have it on my phone. I watch it at least once a month.” Asked what he likes about the movie, he raises his brows, sighs theatrically, and says, “everything.” Satyajit Ray is another Indian director he admires.

Ahmadlou’s predecessors, like Abbas Kiarostami and Majid Majidi, have been building a rich legacy for Iranian cinema. They have also influenced filmmakers of many countries, especially through film festivals. “In Iran, you can make an independent movie with a low budget. And, you get to know from these festivals that people all over the world are liking it. It gives you the strength to keep pushing yourself. Each and every word you hear from other filmmakers from other cultures, you put it together and make a book within yourself, from which you can learn.”

As with most film industries in the world, Ahmadlou says, Iran too has separate spaces for mainstream and art-house cinema. “The movies that balance art and entertainment end up being successful and also stand the test of time,” he adds.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/zfduto/article30962217.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGM-SHAHED,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/biffes-i-have-watched-sholay-500-times-says-iranian-filmmaker-shahed-ahmadlou/article30962218.ece
191,2020/03/02,Tiger Shroff feels that ‘SOTY2’ failed because fans couldn’t accept him getting beaten up on-screen,"The actor’s next action film ‘Baaghi 3’ is set to release on March 6

Actor Tiger Shroff says his action star image made it difficult for his fans to accept him in the character of a student who gets bullied and beaten up in Student of the Year 2. The Karan Johar-backed sequel also featured Ananya Panday and Tara Sutariya and was set in a fictional college campus but did not do well at the box office.

Tiger said he understood why the audience couldn’t connect with the film.

“I got a lot of feedback from my fans as well, saying, ‘We used to see you as this one-man army take down machines single-handedly and here you’re getting beaten up in college, we couldn’t digest that.’ I guess it’s my fault and my failure to not do it convincingly,” Tiger said in a group interview.

The actor, known for his action films, is back to the genre with Baaghi 3.

Tiger said a good action film needs an emotional story, without which all the stunts in a film would appear as a showpiece: “If there’s no emotion or reason in an action movie, then that action just becomes a show-reel and feels like a decoration. Once the action has a reason, then that action multiplies and the audiences also feel connected and more engaged.”

The action has been scaled up for the third movie in the franchise, which will be directed by Ahmed Khan.

“It’s man vs man, man vs machines and man vs nature, quite literally. I’m fighting helicopters and tanks. All the action that is seen in the trailer is all live. Very little VFX has been used in this film. I give all the credit to Ahmed sir and Sajid (Nadiadwala) sir,” he added.

For the longest, the actor has been attached to star in the Hindi remake of Rambo, which reunites him with his War director Sidharth Anand.

There has been no movement on the project so far but Tiger said the film has not been shelved.

“It is still happening. It is pushed right now. It doesn’t make sense doing two back-to-back more or less Rambo-like films.”

The trailer of Sooryavanshi starring Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif has been released. Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh also reprise their roles of Singham and Simmba from the franchise's previous films.

The movie traces the story of a super cop, who is Mumbai’s Anti-Terrorism warrior, taking on foes across the city, while also trying to protect his family and the people around him. Some scenes in the trailer also indicate Akshay Kumar’s character speaking against discrimination of Muslims in India, in what seems to be a commercial masala outing with subtle messaging.

Sooryavanshi is directed by Rohit Shetty and written by Sajid-Farhad, and is the fourth in the series of cop movies Shetty has made: Singham, Singham Returns and Simmba.

At the trailer launch, Akshay Kumar rode a superbike to arrive at the event, posting on Twitter, “Veer Sooryavanshi ditched the helicopter for a bike to beat the Mumbai traffic for the #SooryavanshiTrailer launch today.”

Actor Sobhita Dhulipala has been roped in for an important role in director Sashi Kiran’s Major. The film marks Telugu superstar Mahesh Babu’s debut as producer and is inspired by 26/11 martyr, Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan. The film stars Adivi Sesh in the title role.

Sobhita says her character in the bilingual film is impeccably detailed.

“The arc of my character in Major is impeccably detailed and done with honesty. Goodachari, my debut film in Telugu went on to become a critical and commercial success, so it is doubly wonderful for me to reunite with the same team for a film as feisty as Major,” Sobhita said.

195,2020/03/02,Drastic fall in forest fires all over the State,"Across the State, 314 incidents were reported against 1,670 last year, a decrease of over 80%

Forests in Telangana have recorded a drastic fall in forest fire incidences in the first two months of this year thanks to better planning and management. While this is so, the Forest Department does not want to claim that rampant forest fires are a thing of the past.

The reduction in the number, compared to incidences for the corresponding period last year, is a good augury. Especially for the former composite Adilabad district which encompasses some pristine forests in the Adlabad Territorial Circle and more importantly the Kawal Tiger Reserve (KTR), both boasting of a good, wild animal population.

Against a cumulative 510 fires which were reported from both the Circles in the first two months of 2019, only 31 have been reported this year, almost a 90 per cent decrease. In the State, 314 forest fires were reported against the 1,670 of last year, a fall of over 80 per cent.

The highest number of fires, 48, have been reported from Nagarkurnool district.

Well-planned fire lines

“We have intensive fire line planning, and will continue the operations till the end of this month,” revealed KTR Field Director C.P. Vinod Kumar, who is also the Conservator of Forest for the Adilabad Territorial Circle.

The fire lines are nothing but torching of dried up leaves which are piled up in a neat long heaps along roads passing through the forests to curtail spread of fires which get ignited due to negligence of road users or others.

“We now have six quick response teams (QRTs) stationed at strategic locations so that they can rush to the spot from where a fire alert has been reported.

The team consists of five fire watchers who move in a vehicle,” the top official said as he talked of the measures taken to control the devastating fires.

“These teams are equipped with modern fire fighting equipment including fire resistant suits. The QRT members can actually enter the fire to douse it,” added Adilabad Forest Divisional Officer V. Chandra Shekhara Rao. Officials are aware that the current month could be crucial in their efforts as beedi leaf units will be auctioned off in a few days.

The largest incidence of forest fires occurs in areas where the units are located.

Burning beedi leaf plants

In 2018 and 2019, beedi leaf units were auctioned off in December or January itself and leaf collection activity had started much earlier. Burning of the forest floor will burn the tendu or tuniki plants which will bear healthy leaves, ready for collection in May.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/e92a2c/article30966368.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03WORKER2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/drastic-fall-in-forest-fires-all-over-the-state/article30966370.ece

201,2020/03/02,Telangana in combat mode after its first COVID-19 case,"Patient landed in Bengaluru from Dubai, reached City by bus on Feb 22.

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the State was reported from Hyderabad on Monday where a man, who recently returned from Dubai, tested postive for coronavirus.

The 24-year-old patient who works for a software company in Bengaluru landed there on February 20 from Dubai, worked there for a day and reached Hyderabad by bus on February 22. In Dubai, he worked along with people from Hong Kong

Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender said the man who developed cough, sneezing, consulted doctors at Apollo Hospital, Secunderabad, as an out patient and got admitted there.

After performing tests, he tested negative for Swine Flu. Based on suspicion, he was referred to Gandhi Hospital which is one of the government hospitals with isolation ward facility for COVID suspects and the virus positive patients.

“He got admitted at Gandhi Hospital at 5 p.m on Sunday. Samples were collected and he tested positive for COVID-19,” Mr Rajender said adding that they cross checked the results with the National Institute for Virology(NIV), Pune for confirmation.

The techie is admitted in an ICU dedicated for COVID-19 positive patients. Located in the 7th floor of the main building of the government hospital, the ward has all the facilities like ventilator support and piped supply of oxygen.

Mr Rajender said that Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao was informed of the positive case and instructions were passed to take serious measures.

The Health minister along with officials will hold a review meeting with ministers, principal secretaries and heads of Panchayat Raj and Rural Development (PR&RD), Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MAUD) on Tuesday morning.

Hours after a 24-year-old software professional tested positive for Coronavirus, the State government went into a overdrive on Monday scurrying to identify the 80 people, who reportedly came into contact with him since the night of February 20.

As it became clear that the techie working for a Bengaluru-based company was down with COVID-19, the Health Department officials constituted a 20-member team of doctors and paramedics under the supervision of District Medical and Health Officer, Hyderabad to treat the patient and eight of his family members.

“The moment National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune report came, we rushed to their residence in Secunderabad and brought all the family members. They are under observation in the specially created isolation ward in Gandhi Hospital and their samples are being sent to the lab and also the NIV. Theirs is a joint family and we have to wait to see the results of the samples that are collected now,” said a top official, pleading anonymity.

Bus passengers

Another priority for the Health Department is to zero in on all the 27 passengers who had travelled by GO Tour Travels and Holidays AC sleeper bus on February 22. The bus had left Bengaluru at 9 p.m on February 22 and had reached Secunderabad at 7.15 a.m the next day.

The management of the travel agency had shared the list of passengers of the said bus with the Health Department and based on the contact numbers available in the list, the officials have got in touch with all the passengers and asked them to go for self quarantine. “Our health officials have spoken to them and enquired about any symptoms,” sources said.

Meanwhile in Karnataka, the Health Department has taken up surveillance measures on a war footing to trace and identify passengers who travelled with the techie in the bus. “We are trying to find out how many passengers from Bengaluru were on the bus. We are trying to track his movement from the time he alighted from the plane in Bengaluru and all those who came in contact with him during the stay. All of them will be home isolated for the next fifteen days,” said State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), B.G. Prakash Kumar.

Private hospital

203,2020/03/02,Abundant water in SRSP flood flow canal rekindles hopes among farmers,"Water in the 160km long canal has been CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s dream

With the pumping of waters from Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project into the SRSP flood flow canal, there is abundant water all along 160 km flood flow canal — from Lower Manair Dam to Sriramsagar Project — rekindling hopes among the farming community to take up rabi cultivation.

Following the requests made by Choppadandi legislator Sunke Ravishankar to release at least one TMC ft of water from KLIP into the SRSP FFC, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao directed the irrigation officials to pump the water into the flood flow canal.

The KLIP waters were lifted from Laxmipur pump house in Ramadugu mandal which filled Narayanpur Reservoir, Potharam Reservoir, Mid Manair Reservoir and also SRSP flood flow canal at Rampur and Rajeshwarraopet all the way up to Armoor in Nizamabad district.

It has been the dream of the Chief Minister to ensure that there is water in the SRSP flood flow canal throughout the year for the benefit of farmers along the canal and accordingly the government has taken up SRSP rejuvenation project of lifting KLIP waters to SRSP.

After the CM’s recent visit to Kaleshwaram project and inspection of abundant water at Medigadda barrage and Kannepalli pump house, the irrigation authorities have started lifting the water from Medigadda to Sripada Yellampalli project. Every day about two TMC ft water is being lifted from the Kaleshwaram project and filling all the projects upstream.

The Medigadda barrage was having 7.86 TMC ft of water against its capacity of 16.17 TMC ft. The Annaram barrage was having 8.77 TMC ft against 10.87 TMC ft and Sundilla barrage was having 6.55 TMC ft against its capacity of 8.83 TMC ft. From Sundilla water was being lifted into Sripada Yellampalli project which currently has 10 TMC ft against its capacity of 20.175 TMC ft.

With the operation of all the lifts downstream from Medigadda to Sundilla and Yellampalli project, the MMD had been filled to the brim with 25.15 TMC ft against its storage capacity of 25.87 TMC ft. About 5,580 TMC ft of water was being released from MMD to LMD reservoir, which is holding 11 TMC ft of water against its capacity of 24 TMC ft. Another 3,500 cusecs of water was being pumped out of MMD into the SRSP flood flow canal to fill the canal with water and benefit the farmers with the recharge of ground water table all along the canal.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/et949o/article30965015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03SRSPFFC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/abundant-water-in-srsp-flood-flow-canal-rekindles-hopes-among-farmers/article30965017.ece

207,2020/03/02,Father arrested for death of teenage daughter,"Police zero in on killer of girl found dead with throat slit at her home

The police have cracked the mystery of the murder of the intermediate student who was found with her throat slit in her home on February 10 and arrested her father for the crime.

A 19-year-old intermediate first-year student was found dead in her house, in Vidyanagar locality of the town, with her throat slit and three tolas of gold and ₹ 99,000 cash missing from the house on February 10.

The Karimnagar Commissionerate of Police used latest technology, including German technology FARO 3D scanner, 3D crime scene photography and videography and body fluid kits to crack the gruesome killing of the girl. A total of 75 police personnel in eight teams have worked 21 days to crack the case.

Disclosing this to newsmen here on Monday, Commissioner of Police V. B. Kamalasan Reddy said that the accused Mutha Komuraiah was a hamali labourer at a godown in Karimnagar town. He was frustrated over the expenditure of ₹ 6 lakh for the treatment of his daughter for polio corrective surgery. Lately, he was worried about her ill-health and conduct of marriage of his daughter.

Well planned

Unable to face the prospect of the expenditure Komuraiah had decided to kill her and as part of the plan forcibly vacated his tenants on February 6. On the fateful day he sent his wife, a coolie, to work and he went around the area to survey the situation.

He smothered his daughter with a pillow when she was sleeping. Later, he shifted her from the bed and slit her throat by using a kitchen knife and washed the blood-soaked knife and his vest and removed all the evidence by washing the floor and then went to work. In order to make it look like a burglary, he had concealed his wife’s gold chain in a rice container.

Later, he spoke normally to his wife and others on mobile and switched off his phone and attended to his work. In the evening, when the neighbours informed about the gruesome murder of his daughter, he enacted a drama of crying. When the police asked whether any burglary took place, he said he had lost a three-tola gold chain and ₹ 99,000.

Lab confirmation

After confirmation of the DNA tests of bloodstain on his vest and chappals with that of the victim, the police nabbed him and during interrogation, he confessed to committing the crime.

The Commissioner of Police appreciated the police team for detection of case with scientific evidence and assured them of suitable rewards.

213,2020/03/02,‘Change attitude towards cleanliness’,"Do your bit, says Adilabad Collector

“Ask not what the municipality is doing for you, ask what you are doing towards maintenance of sanitation,” is the point made by Collector A. Devasena during her interactions with locals as she tirelessly goes around wards in Adilabad municipality in pursuance of improving the sanitation situation through the Pattana Pragathi programme.

“A change in attitude towards cleanliness and sanitation is essential to make our environs clean and healthy,” she observes as she drives home the point at her public meetings and interactions with people in wards.

The Collector pulls no punches in her crusade towards ending open defecation, among other things. She even threatens erring people with fines under the new regulations that ban defecation in open places.

And there is a lot of change in attitude of people like Pandiri Eashwari of Mahalaxmiwada. “Evari chettha vallu buttalalo jama chesi tractor lo veyali (People should collect the garbage in dustbins and dispose it in tractors),” she asserted.

Ms. Devasena, who has won four national-level awards for her work on sanitation during her stint as Peddapally Collector, does not spare any effort in drilling the sense of cleanliness.

On Sunday, she spent much time telling a couple of children the proper way of disposing chocolate wrappers.

The town looks much cleaner since the Pattana Pragathi started a few days back. Every morning, teams of workers and officials from respective wards can be seen cleaning the surroundings, in mission mode.

“The 15-member committees, youth committee, women’s committee, senior citizens’ committee and the one comprising other eminent people in every ward, are expected to cover a lot of ground that they are doing,” claimed Adilabad horticulture officer G. Srinivas, who is the special officer for ward number 23 even as he divulged one of the important aspects of Pattana Pragathi management. “These committees are meant to motivate people towards maintenance of sanitation, identify local problems and try to rectify those,” he added.

On the physical achievement of the programme, Municipal Commissioner Maruthi Prasad told The Hindu that identification of problems in all the 49 wards has been done besides cleaning shrubs in open spaces. “Many slanting electric poles and loose cables have been replaced,” he disclosed.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/change-attitude-towards-cleanliness/article30958770.ece
214,2020/03/02,Karimnagar DCCB earning huge profits,"The Karimnagar District Cooperative Central Bank, which was reeling under acute financial crisis with losses to the tune of ₹70 crore during 2004-05, is earning profits since 2011-12. It has earned a profit of ₹16.23 crore in 2018-19 and set to earn a profit of more than ₹36 crore in 2019-20.

It was struggling hard to meet the operational expenses and pay the staff, but now making strides under the leadership of DCCB chairman Konduru Ravinder Rao. He would meet the CM soon to better the services.

The bank was initially known for extending financial assistance to raise the crops, but under the guidance of Mr Ravinder Rao, who introduced reforms in the bank, had extended financial assistance to different sectors such as housing, education, business, SHG, dairy, gold loans, poultry, sericulture, vehicles etc on par with commercial banks.

With the initiatives taken by Mr Ravinder Rao and CEO N Satyanarayana Rao, the bank turnover which was only Rs 376.07 crore in the year 2004-05 had increased to Rs 3471.72 crore as on January 31, 2020. The non-performing assets (NPA) was 7.56 per cent in 2004-05 had reached zero per cent presently. From a stage where it was unable to pay salaries, the bank had started paying dividends to its members since 2015-16 and also bonus to the employees from the profits earned.

The bank was having 208 Primary agricultural cooperative societies (PACS). However, with the implementation of Vaidyanatham committee recommendations, few non-viable PACS were merged with nearest societies and made a present total of 137 societies including 127 affiliated to DCCB and 7 to the State bank of India (SBI). The DCCB had entered into the business trade of procuring the paddy produce from the farmers from the year 2012 forcing all PACS earn profits.

Above all, the bank had opened 38 branches from 2005 onwards to 2019 making it a total of 68 branches. Besides, a total of 360 personnel were also recruited in a phased manner. To compete with other commercial banks, the DCCB introduced core banking solutions from 2012 onwards. It had opened 25 ATMs, one mobile ATM. 193 micro ATMs and 243 point of sale machines.

Talking to The Hindu, DCCB chairman K Ravinder Rao, who had occupied the coveted post for the third consecutive term, said that they would soon meet Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao, who was having lots of ideas for launching farmer-centric programmes, and take measures for further strengthening the PACS. As per the wishes of the CM, he said that the DCCB would encourage the value addition to the farm products by starting food processing units and educate the farmers for the diversification of the crops to commercial crops for more profits.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/karimnagar-dccb-earning-huge-profits/article30958748.ece

216,2020/03/02,"NZ vs IND: New Zealand beats India by seven wickets, sweep series","The exciting Kyle Jamieson was Man-of-the-Match and ace of swing Tim Southee Player-of-the-Series.

The rout was complete. The Indians had nowhere to hide at the Hagley Oval. Outplayed in both skill and strategy by the New Zealanders, the Indians seemed to be looking for the earliest flight to catch home.

Clinical approach

New Zealand, clinical with its end-game skills and winning the key moments of the game, won the second Test by a whopping seven wickets and swept the series 2-0 on Monday, only the third day of the Test.

The exciting Kyle Jamieson was Man-of-the-Match and ace of swing Tim Southee Player-of-the-Series.

India added only 34 runs for its last four wickets in the morning — the late-order fightback remaining an illusion — and a target of 132 was hardly going to stretch New Zealand.

Kane Williamson’s men also picked up 120 points from the series. New Zealand, in all, has 180 points while India stays on 360.

Save Jasprit Bumrah after lunch, when he fired out Kane Williamson with a mean lifter which the Kiwi captain fended into the cordon, and then sent down the pacy off-cutter that accounted for the attractive Tom Blundell (55), the Indian attack did not appear threatening.

The fluent left-hander, Tom Latham (52) was the only other wicket to fall, well caught by a leaping Rishabh Pant as he attempted to pull Umesh Yadav.

Fine start

New Zealand’s opening pair of Latham and Blundell played with a right blend of offence and defence under a cloud cover, with a stiff wind blowing across the ground. The duo’s 103-run opening partnership settled the issue.

Blundell crouches in his stance but if the ball is pitched short, he can quickly stand tall and drive the sphere to the cover fence. A fine back-foot player, he was airborne as he punched Umesh through point and rose on his toes to strike Mohammed Shami between point and cover.

The opener with a rather high backlift also on-drove Shami — who bowled despite a “batting impact injury” — and gloriously cover-drove Bumrah to the fence.

At the other end, Latham collected runs with typical efficiency. He timed Bumrah to the cover fence, the ball meeting the sweet spot in the willow.

After lunch, Latham pulled and hooked short-pitched offerings from Umesh. The Kiwi innings was galloping along.

Latham is a compact organised player whose footwork and strokeplay are dictated by the length of the ball.

His back-lift is measured and there are occasions when his boundaries are just an extension of a defensive push.

In the morning, the Indians had to build partnerships, see through the first hour. They didn’t.

Trent Boult, who had bowled magnificently in this innings with his left-armer’s angle and precision in his swing, and Tim Southee teamed up again.

Wickets continued to tumble. Hanuma Vihari was a tad unlucky, though, attempting to work Southee fine only to see ’keeper B-J. Watling fling himself to his left and come up with the ball.

Then Pant perished to a tame push as Boult angled one across the left-hander. Picked more for the X-factor in his batting than ’keeping in the eleven, India needed Pant to go after the bowling instead of coming up with ‘nothing’ shots.

Shami, at least freed his arms. He was held at deep square-leg off Southee.

Jadeja fires

It was left to Ravindra Jadeja, that wonderful athlete, to launch into the bowling. He did just that.

A natural striker of the ball, the left-hander waded into Boult striking a full-length delivery straight over the bowler’s head for a six.

He then struck the left-armer cleanly past mid-on to the ropes.

But then, things have not been going right for India in the series. And sure enough, a mix-up with Jadeja saw Bumrah being run out.

The Indians had run out of gas too.

Brief Scores:

India 1st innings: 242 and 124 all out in 46 overs (Cheteshwar Pujara 24; Trent Boult 4/28, Tim Southee 3/36)

New Zealand: 235 all out and 132 in 3 in 36 overs (Tom Latham 52, Tom Blundell 55)

For the past few days, the otherwise grey basement parking lot at Palladium, has been encouraging a dash of colour.

The walls that flank the entry point carry an almost-done mural, a minimalist one dipped in allegory. Delhi-based muralist Do, has been at it, day and night, trying to portray a piece of his immediate surroundings. And by immediate surroundings, we mean, the parking lot.

What seems like a scene straight out of Tom and Jerry, is in fact, his take on the seemingly ‘mechanical’ parking area. We see a gigantic pair of legs in motion, and a toy car with flashing headlights, approaching from behind. On the wall is a mouse hole, near which a half-done (Do is lending it some finishing touches) mouse scurries along. Titled ‘Niruttattil’, the mural has already turned a few heads.

This is just one of the few interesting art interventions that Phoenix MarketCity is offering, in collaboration with St+art India Foundation, till March 18, under the name India Pop.

A special project by St+art India, which is also in its last leg of the public art project in Kannagi Nagar, India Pop is essentially an interactive journey through the many facets of Indian Pop Culture. Armed with four installations and a just-concluded evening of panel discussions on street art, workshops, a graffiti jam, hip hop cyphers and more, the project aims to give an insight into Indian street art culture, albeit, in a very small fashion.

“We, as a collective, want to bring art to as many people as possible. The audience we get at Phoenix is very different from those at Kannagi Nagar which is more community-driven. The idea of having these projects in parallel was to create bridges between these two spaces leading to a healthy influx of people who would also end up visiting Kannagi Nagar,” says Akshat Nauriya, co-founder of St+art India.

Such projects, he believes, also makes people who visit the space familiar with the media while contributing to the urban fabric of the city. Vijay Choraria, co-promoter — Phoenix MarketCity and Palladium, says, “We have been following Guilia Ambrogi and team, and their work for a long time. This project will give a peek into what they have in store at Kannagi Nagar.”

Mind your language

Walking towards the amphitheatre, one is met with a giant illuminated board of script — not Tamil, but resembling it.

The project manager at St+art India says it is the Saurashtrian script, and its visual resemblance to Tamil is the reason why it was chosen. When it gets dark, the letters illuminate. The script is currently spoken and written by only a few hundred people in South India (it moved from Gujarat a few hundred years ago, with the gypsies).

Typeface designers and artists Hanif Kureshi from Gujarat and Chennai-based Shiva collaborated for this installation, in an effort to draw attention to how we are losing touch with our languages and scripts.

In the courtyard is a travelling photo studio. Pop colours, unmissable patterns and over-the-top settings are what characterise this particular make-shift studio. It is lined by canvases of seemingly classical paintings, peppered with contemporary elements.

For instance, in one of the canvases, a woman clad in a sari is holding a basket full of flowers — reminiscent of the many classical Indian paintings — is seen wearing an Apple watch. The studio is tailor-made for the selfie generation, satiating youth’s need to insert themselves into every frame.

India Unfiltered, a real-time installation by Akshat and artist Marc Lee looks at democratisation of expression in social media and how it leads to positive social change. Culling out significant hashtags that trend in TikTok (which Akshat observes is an app that enabled different sections of the society — not just the urban elite — to partake in global conversations), the duo aggregated the positive ones.

Content across these hashtags are projected real time showcasing diversity in the platform. “On a bigger level, the number of engagements increase the possibilities of positive social change and awareness. It brings together those who have been isolated from this paradigm,” Akshat concludes.

India Pop will be underway at Phoenix MarketCity and Palladium till March 18",art,https://www.thehindu.com/society/59w06/article30963693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02mphairstylist1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/colour-of-urban-india/article30963696.ece
218,2020/03/02,BADI PANTHULU (1972),"Starring N T Ramarao, Anjali Devi, Nagabhushanam, Krishnam Raju, Ramakrishna, Jayanthi, and Vijayalalitha

Heartwarming stories with a gripping narrative have timeless appeal. One such story was The Years Are So Long written by Josephine Lawrence in 1934 on the travails of an aged couple who were forced to separate and live with their children.

Jaggaiah, Janaki in ‘Badi Panthulu’

The novel was adapted as a play by Helen and Noah Leary which in turn found its way to Hollywood when producer-director Leo Mc Carey made it as the movie, Make Way for Tomorrow (1937). Since then there were several filmmakers cutting across generations who made films on a similar theme, in various languages including one in Japanese (Tokyo Story -1953) and back home, in Hindi (Baghban - 2007).

In between, there was one movie that stood out in this genre — B R Panthulu’s 1958 Kannada classic, School Master which was based on the iconic Marathi poet, author and playwright Vishnu Vaman Shirwadkar’s novel, Vaishnavi. It is not known whether the Jnanpeeth awardee who wrote under the pen name ‘Kusumagraj’ was inspired by Josephine Lawrence’s novel, but one can find similitude.

Padmini, Anjali Devi, NTR, Jaggaiah, Krishnam Raju, Ramakrishna in ‘Badi Panthulu’

Panthulu dubbed the movie in Telugu with the same title and released it in 1959. It had an average run. However, years later when producer P Perraju of Triveni Productions remade it in Telugu, titled, Badi Panthulu (1972) with N T Ramarao playing the title role, it was a super hit.

The story

Headmaster Raghava Rao (played by NTR) brings normalcy to the chaotically run elementary school in his village. This irks the corrupt school correspondent, Paparao (Nagabhushanam). He sets Raghava Rao’s house on fire. Raghava Rao is touched by his students’ gesture when they build a new house for him. Years pass by. Raghava Rao is forced to take loan from Paparao for his sons, Sathyam (Ramakrishna) and Venu’s (Krishnam Raju) college studies. Sathyam falls in love with and marries Jaya (Vijayalalitha) daughter of Rajamma (Suryakantham) and Venu marries Paparao’s daughter Santha (Jayanthi).

Radhakumari, Allu Ramalingaiah, Rajababu, Padmini in ‘Badi Panthulu’

With the help of fellow teacher Kanthaiah (Ravi Kondala Rao), Raghava Rao performs his daughter Lakshmi’s (T Padmini) marriage with the miserly Panakalu’s (Allu Ramalingaiah) son Pichaiah (Rajababu) further leading him into debts. Raghava Rao’s wife Janaki (Anjali Devi) advises him to discuss the matter with their sons to save their house from coming under the hammer. The sons express inability to clear the loans but are willing to take one parent each with them. The retired Raghava Rao has no option. He goes to stay with Sathyam and Janaki stays with Venu. Unable to bear the ordeals and the separation, Raghava Rao and Janaki leave their sons homes.

Meanwhile in the auction, Raghava Rao’s house is bought by his old student Ramu (Jaggaiah), a police officer. Ramu hands it over to Raghava Rao. Sathyam, Venu, Paparao and others realise their mistakes. The family reunites.

Cast and crew

Fastidious at work, director P Chandrasekhar Reddy made a touching presentation of this emotional story. The Pachaiyappa’s College, Madras alumni was adjudged the best actor for the play Pellichoopulu staged during his college anniversary and received the award from veteran actor Govindarajula Subbarao. His acting experience coupled with his long stint as an associate director with veteran V Madhusudana Rao helped P C Reddy as he is popularly known, to extract the best from his actors while directing his fifth movie, Badi Panthulu. He was ably supported by his dialogue writer D V Narasaraju, cinematographer K S Prasad and editor V Anki Reddy.

Ramakrishna, NTR, Nagabhushanam in ‘Badi Panthulu’

As Raghava Rao, the disciplined headmaster and the distraught retiree burdened with debts and neglect from sons, NTR showcased his brilliance with subtle display of emotions giving the role a realistic perspective. Easily it was one of his best performances in contemporary family dramas. Anjali Devi matched him in histrionics playing his wife, Janaki. Rest of the cast made a neat presentation in their given characters. Suryakantham’s catch phrase ‘Bhaja Govindam Bhaja Govindam’ was enjoyed by the audience. ‘Shavukaru’ Janaki makes a cameo appearance as Jaggaiah’s wife. She has also played the role in the Puttanna Kanagal directed Malayalam version, School Master (1964).

K V Mahadevan made a large contribution for the film’s success with his compositions. Songs written by Arthreya such as — Boochaadamma Buchaadu; Mee nagumomu naa kanulaaraa rendered by P Susheela and Bharatamathaku je jelu (Ghantasala & chorus), Ninna monna reku vippina letha mogga (Ghantasala, P Susheela) were a great hit.

Trivia

Sridevi in the song ‘Buchadamma...’ from the film ‘Badi Pantulu’

It is interesting to note that Baby Sridevi who acted as granddaughter to NTR in Badi Panthulu played his heroine seven years later in Vetagadu and other movies. Tamil and Malayalam actress T Padmini made her Telugu debut with Bhanumathi Ramakrishna’s 1972 directorial Antha Mana Manchike. Paired opposite Rajababu, Badi Panthulu was her second Telugu starrer.

Interestingly, B R Panthulu himself played the title role in the 1958 Kannada and the 1959 Hindi versions of School Master besides producing and directing the movies. In both the films and in the Malayalam version, Sivaji Ganesan essayed the role played by Jaggaiah in Badi Panthulu. Saroja Devi enacted the protagonist’s daughter-in-law in Kannada and in the Hindi movie as his daughter.

Other films on the theme were — veteran actor-director Raja Paranjape’s Marathi movie, Oon Paus (1954), in Hindi, Ravi Tandon’s Zindagi (1976) and Ravi Chopra’s Baghban (2007), in Tamil, Visu’s Varavu Nalla Uravu (1990) and a remake of it in Telugu, Dabbu Bhale Jabbu (1992) produced by Allu Aravind.

Released on November 22, 1972, Badi Panthulu was a box office hit.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/mg392k/article30963127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf28badi-1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/ntr-and-anjali-devi-starrer-badi-panthulu-has-timeless-appeal/article30963135.ece
219,2020/03/02,1.13 lakh doubtful voters in Assam,"About 97% of the 262 km border with Bangladesh has been sealed, says State Parliamentary Affairs Minister

The Assam government on Monday said there are more than 1.13 lakh doubtful voters or D-voters in the State, while six detention centres are currently holding 680 people declared as foreigners.

Speaking on behalf of Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Monday, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary told the Assembly that 4,32,944 cases were registered against suspected foreigners between 1985 and 2019.

“After verification and trials, 1,26,998 people were declared foreigners, 1,18,367 were found to be Indians, and 29,890 were deported. At the last count, there were 1,13,738 D-voters in the State. Barpeta district leads the table with 17,227 D-voters followed by Sonitpur (16,437), Nagaon (9,828) and Dhubri (7,133),” he said.

He added that 221 of these D-voters, a category of electors struck out by the Election Commission, were being housed in the detention centres along with 680 declared foreigners (D-voters found to be non-citizens by Foreigners Tribunals).

NRC next step

The Assembly was told on Monday that the 19.06 lakh people excluded from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) would be issued “rejection slips” after the “speaking orders” are scanned.

Mr. Patowary said about 12% of the speaking orders remain to be scanned. These orders were issued while processing the objections raised against the applicants during the updating process.

Assam’s NRC was updated from its 1951 version and documents of 3.3 crore applicants were processed. The complete draft of the citizens’ list was published on August 31, 2019.

The NRC exercise cost ₹1,348.1 crore, the Assembly was told.

On the issue of sealing the India-Bangladesh border that is believed to be behind Assam’s problem with illegal migrants, Mr. Patowary said only a 4.35 km stretch of the international boundary remains to be fenced. Assam shares a 262 km border with Bangladesh.

97% border fenced

“About 97% of the boundary is sealed. Bangladesh has objected to fencing the 4.35 km stretch in Karimganj district, so advanced technology is being employed there,” he said.

He added that the State government has requested the Centre to relocate people in eight villages that are outside the barbed-wire fence, erected 150 metres from the “no man’s land” or actual boundary line according to international norms.

Southern Assam’s Karimganj and Cachar districts have three villages each, while western Assam’s Dhubri has two villages outside the barbed-wire fence.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7cca5r/article30966248.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHANDRAMOHANPATOWARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/113-lakh-doubtful-voters-in-assam/article30966249.ece
220,2020/03/02,‘BJP leadership is ignoring backwards’,"Party MLA praises Cong. govt. policies

BJP MLA Sharad Kol on Monday spoke out against his party alleging its central and State leadership ignored backward communities by precluding them adequate representation at the top. Furthermore, he extolled the Kamal Nath government for being “pro-poor”.

The dissident MLA from Beohari in Shahdol district, Mr. Kol, a former Congressman who last year went against his party along with another MLA while voting on a crucial criminal amendment bill, warned the BJP central leadership in a video released to reporters on Monday: “There is still time to notice this and bring about a balance. Even B.R. Ambedkar has said that the oppressed have the right to equality.”

“However, today we are seeing such days in the BJP leading the Central government that from top to bottom only one community is being given importance, which is a matter of concern,” he said.

Mr. Kol asked the national leadership of the BJP and the RSS: “Why are you ignoring the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes ?”

With MP V.D. Sharma being recently appointed the State BJP president, Mr. Kol pointed out that now the post of president, leader of the opposition (Gopal Bhargava) and whip (Narottam Mishra) all went to members of “one particular community”, showing the party’s ignorance towards SCs, STs and the other backward classes, which constituted more than 80% of the State’s population.

“Without the support of backward communities, forget about forming a government,” he cautioned the BJP, “Your existence will be put in danger”.

Stating that even in the past the communities did not get opportunities, and the situation remained unchanged, he said, “They have continuously worked with the BJP, which is still ignoring them. It is a matter of concern that the party is taking such decisions. Where do they want to take the party?” Mr. Kol warned the public “will not tolerate this ignorance” if continued.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-leadership-is-ignoring-backwards/article30966059.ece
221,2020/03/02,Kisan credit card benefits extended to pisciculture,"Loans will help to set up fisheries

The benefits of Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) have been extended for the first time to those engaged in pisciculture in Rajasthan for providing short-term loans to them, while covering the cost of establishing the fisheries units and their maintenance.

State Animal Husbandry & Fisheries Minister Lalchand Kataria said here on Monday that over 35,000 livestock rearers had been connected with the KCC following the scheme’s extension to agri-business, dairy farming and fisheries, in addition to the farmers engaged in traditional agriculture.

Credits obtained through KCC will make available funds for purchasing feed for fish, meeting the cost of power and water and payment of wages to the labourers. Mr. Kataria said a campaign had been launched to include more pisciculture unit owners, dairy farmers and animal rearers in the KCC scheme.

Credit limit extension

Those already availing of the scheme’s benefit could get the credit limit of their cards extended, the Minister said.

Fifteen people, including eight students of Aligarh Muslim University, have been booked for instigating protesters participating in anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Aligarh. Some of the students, including Sajjad Subhan Rathar, former vice-president of Aligarh Muslim University Students’ Union, are from Kashmir.

223,2020/03/02,Punjab Cabinet nod for Lokayukta Bill,"New legislation will cover even the CM

The Punjab Cabinet on Monday approved introduction of the Punjab Lokayukta Bill, 2020, which will cover all levels of public functionaries up to the Chief Minister.

The decision, which was taken at a Cabinet meeting held here, will repeal the existing Punjab Lokpal Act, 1996, and the new legislation will be applicable to the Chief Minister, Ministers, non-officials-officials of all the public offices, with the aim of further enhancing governance and checking corruption.

Probe into allegations

An official statement said the reform measure envisages an autonomous body to inquire into the grievances and allegations against public functionaries in the State, and to make provisions for appointment of Lokayukta and for the matters connected therewith.

“The Lokayukta shall have all the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. It will also provide for prosecution in case of false complaint. Prosecution of the Chief Ministers and MLAs can be sanctioned only with 2/3rd majority of the House under the new legislation. Further, all sanctions by the Assembly, whether or not permission to prosecute is granted, will be binding on the Lokpal,” said the statement.

224,2020/03/02,Bhim Army chief meets SBSP president Rajbhar,"It triggers speculation of a new political front in U.P.

Signalling a possible new anti-BJP front in Uttar Pradesh, Dalit outfit Bhim Army leader Chandrashekhar Azad on Monday met Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party president Om Prakash Rajbhar in Lucknow.

While no formal tie-up was announced, both sides pitched for the coming together of OBC and Dalit parties and outfits in U.P. if they wanted to pose a challenge to the BJP, which has over 300 MLAs in the 403-member State Assembly.

‘A new equation’

After meeting Mr. Azad at a State guesthouse here, Mr. Rajbhar’s party in a statement said “a new equation is born in U.P.”.

The two discussed the 2022 State polls, dilution of reservations and the “oppression” faced by the OBC and Dalit communities under the BJP government, said Arun Rajbhar, general secretary of the SBSP.

“Till we don’t come together and fight, the BJP will continue to violate our rights and keep us deprived. All this was discussed,” said Mr. Arun.

Ousted from the U.P. Cabinet after the 2019 Lok Sabha results for his criticism of his former ally BJP, Mr. Om Prakash has since then stitched together a front of seven smaller OBC and Dalit-led parties, including former Minister Babu Singh Kushwaha’s Jan Adhikar Party, under the banner of Bhagidhari Sankalp Morcha.

Mr. Arun said it was too early to comment on a formal alliance for the 2022 polls with the Bhim Army, as it was still not a registered political party. He, however, added that the SBSP-led front was open to “all options” to provide a new alternative in the State.

The Bhim Army has indicated that it would soon take the shape of a political party and contest the 2022 polls.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hxq0nr/article30965982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE02AZAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bhim-army-chief-meets-sbsp-president-rajbhar/article30965983.ece
225,2020/03/02,Wanted rebel leader from Manipur arrested in Delhi,"Lamyanba Khuman, head of the proscribed Kangleipak Communist Party, carried a reward of ₹1,00,000 on his head

A joint team made up of Delhi and Imphal Police personnel arrested a top rebel leader of Manipur on Monday morning in Delhi. Police sources said that the arrested rebel leader was identified as Lamyanba Khuman, “chairman” of the proscribed Kangleipak Communist Party (People’s War Group). Another person was also arrested along with him. They are being brought to Imphal.

Khuman carried a reward of ₹1,00,000 on his head. The Superintendent of Police-Imphal West District, who had announced the reward two weeks ago, has been closely monitoring the movements of Khuman and his associates.

Apart from insurgency-related offences, Khuman faces a charge of threatening the Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren.

Officials said that some arrests are expected soon in this connection.

Unrelated flare-up

In an unrelated incident, one person, Mohammad Mangi of Nongpok Shikhong in the Thoubal district, was murdered on Sunday evening. His alleged assailant, M. Shantikumar Meitei, has been arrested. The injured person was rushed to the hospital by some persons, where he was declared brought dead.

Villagers from the Muslim community came out in the streets to protest on Monday. Three persons were injured in tear gas canister firings by the police.

Angry people formed a Joint Action Committee to raise demands, including the suspension of police personnel who had fired tear gas shells within 24 hours, and exemplary punishment to the alleged murderer. If this was not honoured, various forms of agitations would be launched, some of the protesters said.

226,2020/03/02,Whale shark beached at Odisha’s Sunapur dies,"Local fishermen tried to save it by pushing it back to the sea

A 14.9 ft.-long whale shark, washed to the coast near Sunapur in Odisha’s Ganjam district, died despite attempts by fishermen to save it.

Also read | Whale shark beached at Surathkal died due to isolation, starvation, external injury

According to forest officials, local fishermen found the large mammal alive at the Sunapur beach on Sunday, and pushed it back into the sea. But late on Sunday evening, it was again beached by the high tide, and died.

Berhampur Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Amlan Nayak said the Forest Department seized the carcass for an autopsy. A surgeon from the Veterinary Hospital, Chikiti, conducted the autopsy at the Sunapur coast on Monday. The carcass was thereafter buried by deploying a crane to avoid contamination of the beach by its decomposition.

The whale shark weighed around 2,000 kilogrammes. The autopsy findings suggest it had no food in its stomach and could have been ailing, causing it to be swept in from the deep sea to the coast during high tide.

On February 19, a whale shark was found by fishermen near the Gopalpur coast, but they were able to push it back into deep waters.

‘Annual visitors’

Zoologist and cetacean expert Dr. Muntaz Khan said whale sharks were annual visitors to the Odisha coast, usually from January to March. In the past, carcasses of whale sharks have been found near Gopalpur, the mouth of the Rushikulya and Devi rivers, the Chilika lake coast, and along Bhitarkanika and Balasore.

Whale sharks are harmless, slow-moving mammals that feed on phytoplanktons, micro-algae and small sea animals. They have many rows of teeth that play no role in feeding. They suck water and close their mouth to expel the water through their gills. During this ‘filter feeding’ process, they also suck up their food.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7993zs/article30964581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200302-WA0004,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/whale-shark-beached-at-odishas-sunapur-dies/article30964582.ece

A 28-year-old man was stabbed with a broken glass bottle in the Mawprem area in Shillong, as sporadic incidents of violence were reported from across Meghalaya in the aftermath of clashes between tribal and non-tribal groups that has left three people dead, police said on Monday.

Four shops rented to non-tribal businessmen were set on fire in Photkroh town in South West Khasi Hills District in the early hours, they said.

Police said nobody was injured in the incident. “A 28-year-old man was stabbed with a broken bottle by an unknown miscreant on Sunday evening, while he was walking in the Lower Mawprem area. He suffered shoulder injuries and is under treatment at the Civil Hospital,” Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIGP) Gabriel Iangrai said.

There were also reports of stone pelting on vehicles plying along the national highway near Puriang village in East Khasi Hills District on Sunday evening, he said.

The situation in Meghalaya is “under control” and additional forces are deployed in vulnerable areas, the AIGP said.

Curfew, which was imposed in the city and its outskirts, was relaxed from 6 a.m. to allow students to appear in Board Examinations, East Khasi Hills District Magistrate Matsiewdor War Nongbri said.

He, however, said curfew will be reimposed as soon as the exams get over.

The indefinite curfew imposed in areas under Sadar police station, Lumdiengjri police station and those under the Cantonment Beat House will continue, Nongbri said.

Most shops, banks and business establishments were shut and attendance in government offices was thin in the affected areas, officials said.

Mobile internet and messaging services have been temporarily suspended in six districts of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills region to curtail rumours that can deteriorate law and order, they said.

The death toll in the clashes between tribal and non-tribal groups increased to three on Sunday after a 37-year-old man was killed by three unidentified people at his house in East Khasi Hills district, police said.

The clashes had broken out between KSU members and non-tribals during a rally organised against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and to demand implementation of the Inner Line Permit (ILP), at Ichamati on Friday.

Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said there is no coronavirus (COVID-19) patient in the State and the country, and appealed to citizens not to panic.

During a discussion on the issue in the State Assembly through a Calling Attention notice, members cutting across party lines expressed concern over the fast spreading epidemic.

They requested the Maharashtra government to take whatever precautionary steps are needed to prevent the spread of the virus in the State and the country.

Mr. Tope said he had discussed the issue with Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan during his recent visit to Mumbai.

“There are no coronavirus patients in the State or in the country. There is no need to panic,” the Minister said.

The House members sought a ban on the export of N95 masks, in case they are required in emergency.

They also wanted the government to take steps to bring back Maharashtra citizens who are stranded in China and other affected countries.

Some members also wanted to know what affect the epidemic has on industries, and if the virus is going to impact employment.

Mr. Tope said till February 24, thermal screening of 50,091 people was done at the airport. Of these, 294 were from Maharashtra.

Out of the 85 people quarantined for symptoms such as fever, cough, cold, reports of 84 were negative and one person’s report is yet to be received, he added.

Meanwhile, Maharashtra Legislative Council Chairperson Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar directed the Upper House to hold a special half-an-hour discussion on Tuesday on the coronavirus and preparations of the State Health Department for it.

Nationalist Congress Party MLC Prakash Gajbhiye raised the issue in the Council through Point of Propriety.

“There has been an outbreak of coronavirus in the world and several people, suspected to be infected by the virus, have been screened so far at the Mumbai airport. We want to know the exact picture at the State level,” he said.

Responding to his demand, Mr. Nimbalkar instructed the House to hold a special discussion on coronavirus on Tuesday.

The coronavirus has infected nearly 89,000 people globally and caused more than 3,000 deaths, including 2,912 in China.

230,2020/03/02,Proof beyond all reasonable doubts not needed to establish citizenship: Gauhati High Court,"The court made the observation while allowing a petition of one Idrish Ali to set aside an order by an FT in eastern Assam's Jorhat town.

Proof beyond all reasonable doubts is not required in a Foreigners Tribunal (FT) for establishing one's citizenship, the Gauhati High Court has observed in the case of a 65-year-old “declared foreigner” in Assam.

The court made the observation while allowing a petition of one Idrish Ali to set aside an order by an FT in eastern Assam's Jorhat town. The FT had declared Mr. Ali, from No. 2 Koirigaon village in the adjoining Golaghat district, a foreigner in September 2018.

The petitioner had shown the FT 11 documents, including the voters' lists of 1985 and 1989 that contained his name. The FT rejected these documents while observing that he was not included in the electoral rolls of 1974 and 1975, concluding that he was unable to establish his stay in Assam prior to 1971.

March 25, 1971, is the cut-off date for detection and deportation of illegal migrants, according to the Assam Accord of 1985.

A division bench of the High Court comprising Justices Manojit Bhuyan and Parthivjyoti Saikia criticised the FTs but observed that strict rules of evidence were not applicable to the tribunals “established for quick disposal of the matters sent to it”.

Referring to the Supreme Court outlined differences between the FTs and regular courts, the Bench observed: “Nothing is required to be proved beyond all reasonable doubt”.

Terming the FT ruling “perverse” and unsustainable, the court asked the tribunal to take a fresh decision on merits. It also ordered that Mr. Ali, who was kept in the Jorhat detention centre for declared foreigners, should be produced before the FT on the next hearing date.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/zlu52/article30435705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30RDNRC1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/proof-beyond-all-reasonable-doubts-not-needed-to-establish-citizenship-gauhati-high-court/article30963056.ece

“There is no alternative to development,” said Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, while launching and inaugurating projects worth ₹2,821 crore in the Botanical Garden of Noida on Monday. These include a multi-level parking facility that can accommodate 7,000 vehicles, a new 240-bed district hospital, three new foot overbridges and three new pink toilets.

Mr. Adityanath is on a two-day visit to the city, which many feel is doing better than the rest of the State in terms of development index. “For a long time, the area remained notorious for criminal activities. It was known for the Bhatta Parsaul incident. With the development of Jewar International Airport, Gautam Buddh Nagar will become one of the most beautiful and developed parts of the world,” he said, adding the newly-launched commissioner system will provide smart policing to the smart city.

He said the upcoming biggest airport in Asia would provide employment opportunities to the youth. He reiterated that the State budget had made special provisions for the youth and advised farmers to use the compensation money judiciously.

233,2020/03/02,"Delhi violence was a planned genocide, says Mamata Banerjee","Three persons had been arrested by Kolkata police for raising 'goli maro...' slogan, said West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday called the violence in Delhi a “planned genocide,” which was later dubbed as riots.

“Over the past few days, the way people have been killed in Delhi, I think it’s a planned genocide and later it has been portrayed as communal riots,” said Ms. Banerjee, who was addressing a gathering of party supporters at Netaji Indoor Stadium in Kolkata.

The Trinamool Congress chairperson blamed the BJP for the violence and said instead of seeking forgiveness the party was trying to “capture new territories”.

Ms. Banerjee also touched upon the issue of inflammatory slogans raised by BJP supporters en route to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s rally on Sunday. She said that three persons had been arrested by Kolkata police for raising such slogans and efforts were on to identify the others.

“Those who raised slogans of goli maaro at BJP rally in the language of Delhi...the language is inflammatory, illegal and demonic. Legal action will be taken against them. Nobody will be spared,” the Chief Minister said.

Emphasising that this was Kolkata and not Delhi, Ms. Banerjee said that it will be the “people who will decide who is Gaddar (traitor) and who is not.”

Ms. Banerjee questioned the role of Delhi police and other agencies and how they could allow the riots to continue. Referring to Mr. Shah’s claims of the BJP forming the next government in West Bengal, she said that in all the States ruled by the BJP — Uttar Pradesh, Tripura and Assam — law and order had deteriorated.

During the event, the Trinamool Congress launched a 90-day-long campaign to reach out to the masses and the party chairperson urged the party supporters to be humble and remain connected to the people.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/o7a4nk/article30789507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11MAMATA-01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/delhi-violence-was-a-planned-genocide-says-mamata/article30961965.ece

236,2020/03/02,Five die in accident on Mumbai-Pune expressway,"Speeding tempo crashes into them when they were standing near exit point

In yet another accident along the Pune-Mumbai Expressway, five persons standing near an exit point on a stretch near Khandala were crushed to death late on Sunday after a speeding tempo crashed into them.

A sixth person who was part of the group sustained grievous injuries after the tempo, whose driver allegedly could not control the vehicle owing to its speed, turned on its side at a sharp bend, said police authorities at the Khopoli police station.

The deceased have been identified as Pradeep Prakash Chole (38); Amol Balaji Chilme (30); Narayan Ram Gundale (27) and his elder brother, Nivrutti (30); and Govind Nalwad (30). The injured person has been identified as Balaji Harishchandra Bhandari (35).

All six hailed from Latur district.

According to the police, the accident occurred sometime between 11 p.m. and midnight on Sunday.

“The six deceased and injured, who worked at the Talegaon MIDC, were travelling on three bikes and were returning from a picnic in Alibaug. They had stopped by the roadside to attend nature’s call when tragedy struck,” said a police official.

All the six persons were immediately rushed to a nearby hospital by the Expressway Emergency Response Team. While four of them were declared brought dead on arrival, one succumbed to injuries during treatment.

The use of technology and surveillance equipment notwithstanding, accidents owing to rash driving continue unabated along the Mumbai-Pune expressway.

In November last year, a car rammed into a tanker, killing four persons of a family and injuring two more.

In that case, the mishap had occurred in the the morning along the expressway stretch near the Khalapur toll plaza with the driver of the vehicle losing control and ramming into the rear of the stationary HP gas tanker. It was the second major accident to take place on the expressway in less than a month.

Earlier, on November 4, 2019, five persons were killed and 30 others injured after a private passenger bus turned turtle and fell into a valley near Khandala.

The erstwhile Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-Shiv Sena government in 2016 had deployed drones for the first time to rein in incidents of rampant lane-cutting and overspeeding on the e-way.

A 2018 study by a road safety research firm, JP Research India (JPRI), said that 38% of the accidents that occurred on the expressway were due to the driver exceeding the 80 kmph limit.

The finding of the study, which was based on an analysis of 110 accidents that occurred last year on the expressway, also found that 56% of all accidents occurred between midnight and 9 a.m.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jjiuxp/article30962034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mumbai-Pune-expressway-accident,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/five-die-in-accident-on-mumbai-pune-expressway/article30961259.ece
237,2020/03/02,A lioness takes care of a leopard cub in Gir national park,"It is a rare case of cross-species adoption: study

A lioness in Gujarat’s Gir National Park mothered a leopard cub for more than a month. A study has noted their short-lived bonding as a rare case of foster care between two competing feline species.

Elephant seals and sea lions are known to adopt orphans of their own kind. The animal kingdom has two reported cases of cross-species adoption in the wild — that of a young marmoset by a family of capuchin monkeys in South America and a melon-headed whale calf by a bottlenose dolphin.

But the lioness-leopard relationship in Gir, a semi-arid deciduous forest covering 1,800 sq km, has intrigued a quartet of conservationists and wildlife officials, who published their findings in Ecosphere, an open-access journal.

“Lions and leopards coexist but not in harmony, and there was this lioness rearing the leopard cub as her own to stimulate intriguing behavioural questions,” Stotra Chakrabarti, one of the four authors of the study told The Hindu from the University of Minnesota, U.S..

Mr. Chakrabarti is a post-doctoral research associate in the Department of Fisheries, Wildlife and Conservation Biology in the university. His co-authors are Joseph K. Bump from the same university and officials Dheeraj Mittal and Shailesh B. Khambda of Gir (West) Division, Junagarh.

The researchers observed the relationship for 29 days, during which the leopard cub died on February 11, 2019. There were no external wounds on the carcass found near a waterhole, implying that the mother or any other lion did not kill it. An autopsy revealed the cub was suffering from congenital femoral hernia.

“We spotted an old female leopard in the location where we first detected the leopard cub with its foster lion family. Although we could not assess the lactating state of this leopardess, it is possible that she was the cub’s biological mother but had abandoned it,” Mr Chakrabarti said. Camera traps, he added, were deployed at a waterhole frequented by the lioness and her cubs. The detections spanned across 2.6 sq km, a relatively small area compared with an adult lioness’ home range of about 35 sq km.

The researchers found the lioness restricted her forays because she had young cubs that were less mobile, especially the leopard cub.

Maternal and hormonal instincts of the lioness, as a lactating mother who lost her first litter of two cubs, could have overridden her recognition or the lack thereof for an “unusually spotted cub”.

Her relationship with the leopard cub for qualified as a formal adoption, unlike a similar but one-day association reported from the Ngorongoro conservation area in Tanzania in 2017.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tbxolk/article30957916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/lioness-leopardcub-bond-Gir,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a-lioness-takes-care-of-a-leopard-cub-in-gir-national-park/article30957917.ece

239,2020/03/02,"Quash sedition charges against student, SC lawyer urges court","‘Conduct does not reveal anything that show intent to promote enmity’

A Supreme Court advocate has urged the Chief Justice of Karnataka to take suo motu cognisance of a case of sedition and promotion of hatred against a 19-year-old student who, in all probability, tried to communicate at a public forum that love for one’s country does not necessarily require hatred of another.

Advocate Kaleeswaram Raj, in his letter, said Amulya Leona Noronha was arrested from Bengaluru and remanded in judicial custody on February 21 for reportedly shouting “Pakistan Zindabad thrice, Hindustan Zindabad four times.”

Mr. Raj also refers to media reports that Amulya on February 16 tweeted in Kannada that “Be it any country, Zindabad to all nations.”

He said sedition is a crime either abandoned or put to disuse in several democracies.

Similarly, the invocation of hate charges against the student is misplaced.

“The conduct of the student does not reveal anything that reflects promotion of enmity between different groups. It perhaps does the opposite,” Mr. Raj argues, asking the court to quash the case against the student.

The letter refers to higher philosophy of one world, one family. “The great poet Rabindranath Tagore advocated for global fraternity and his idea of nationality was so captivating as it was based on universal humanism,” the letter said.

Rather than trying to understand what Amulya was trying to put across, Mr. Raj quoted reports that there are now bounties for her head.

“The fact that the student is arrested and charged under the above said provisions (sedition and promotion of hatred among groups) for shouting zindabad for several countries simultaneously is almost clear. This is a situation which warrants intervention of the Honourable High Court of Karnataka, which has the great legacy of acting as the guardian of the Constitution in critical times,” the letter to the Chief Justice said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/quash-sedition-charges-against-student-sc-lawyer-urges-court/article30959338.ece
240,2020/03/02,Researchers find fishing cat in Odisha’s chilika lake,"Researchers conducting a study in Odisha’s Chilika Lake have found the presence of a viable and breeding population of the fishing cat in the brackish water lagoon. It is a globally endangered and elusive species that is found in very few places in south and south-east Asia.

Wild cat species primarily hunt on ground. But the fishing cat hunts in water. It has specialised features like partially webbed feet and a water-resistant fur that helps it to thrive in wetlands. The flat-headed cat of south-east Asia is the only other feline that shares similar features, making them unique among all the 39 extant cat species.

Another globally endangered species, the smooth-coated otter, has also been recorded from the study’s bycatch data. Both the species are supposed to enjoy conservation measures of the highest accord in India according to the country’s laws, much like the tiger and elephant does.

The study has also recorded the presence of the Eurasian otter in Chilika. “This is significant. Despite being a widely-spread and common species globally, very little is known of the species distribution and abundance in India and especially along the eastern coast,” said Nisarg Prakash of IUCN Otter Specialist Group.

“We undertook the survey in the fringe villages of Chilika covering an area of 1070 sq km. Here we conducted more than 1000 interviews and placed camera traps for more than 300 nights,” said Tiasa Adhya, co-founder of The Fishing Cat Project.

The project was a collaborative effort between The Fishing Cat Project (TFCP), Chilika Development Authority, Wild Orissa, Mahavir Pakshi Suraksha Samity and Chilika Wildlife Division, Forest Department of Odisha.

CDA will further step up conservation efforts by initiating a census on fishing cats this year in collaboration with TFCP, said Susanta Nanda, chief executive of Chilika Development Authority.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/researchers-find-fishing-cat-in-odishas-chilika-lake/article30959267.ece

The girl was reported missing on February 28 evening. Her body was retrieved from a forest near her village on Saturday. The accused, from the same village as the victim, were arrested soon after.

243,2020/03/02,Williamson pleased at outplaying world’s best,"Kiwi skipper enthused by Jamieson’s rise as an all-rounder

Kane Williamson flashed a smile before getting down to answering questions. He was pleased by his team’s 2-0 sweep over the No. 1-ranked Test team in the world.

This was New Zealand’s sixth straight Test series win at home and even in his moment of triumph, Williamson was measured and insightful with his views. No brave talk, just plain common sense.

Plainspeak

It was a lot like his flowing batting and smart captaincy. No fancy stuff; just hard substance. The New Zealand captain said: “An outstanding performance. I don’t think the result reflects how competitive this match was. Perhaps another 50 more runs from the Indians would have made it quite a balanced-looking game.”

Williamson said his team had stepped up after the debacle against Australia. “We all know how strong India are all around the world and there has been a lot of talk about their pace attack and they certainly showed their quality in this series. A lot to take from the series against the best team in the world at the moment.”

About batting on seaming tracks with bounce, he observed: “The conditions were a massive factor. Even if you do adapt quickly, you may still have a good ball with your name on it.”

On playing England, Australia and India in back-to-back Test series, he said:

“Probably the three top Test teams in the world. Disappointing showing in Australia but then at the same time it was important that we continued to play the style of cricket that wins us matches at home.”

Queried on Trent Boult’s magnificent bowling, he said: “He’s a fantastic bowler and when the ball is moving he’s a great exponent of putting it in the right areas from that left-armer’s angle and getting that movement. Whether in the nets or out in the middle.”

On Kyle Jamieson’s development as an all-rounder, he said: “He is batting beautifully and can truly bat in terms of technique and how he looks to approach his innings. His runs were very valuable. As a bowler, it’s not only his height and the bounce that he gets but he bowls a very, very good line to challenge guys around the fourth stump.”

Although the toss was important, Williamson felt it was not the only factor in the series. “The ball moved considerably throughout the two games. So bowling first was not the game.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kz33w1/article30900391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKET-TEST-NZL-IND,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/williamson-pleased-at-outplaying-worlds-best/article30965841.ece
244,2020/03/02,Dhoni gets down to brass tacks,"Good news for CSK fans as the crowd favourite hits the nets

The wait is over. Mahendra Singh Dhoni was back in action wielding his willow, at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium on Monday.

The Chennai Super Kings skipper hit the nets to kick-start his preparations for the upcoming Indian Premier League that starts on March 29.

Long break

Dhoni, who last played in the World Cup semifinals, arrived in the city late last night and had a nets session with his CSK mates on Monday evening.

The World Cup-winning former India skipper has been out of competitive action since last July and the IPL will be his first major tournament after a long break.

The 38-year-old was recently dropped from the BCCI’s centrally contracted players’ list and has not revealed much about his future plans. With the ICC World T20 to be held later this year in Australia, the IPL will be crucial if he aims to make a comeback.

Like it has been in the past few years, a sizeable crowd was waiting at the gates since 3 p.m. and nearly a 100 witnessed their favourite player in action from the stands that were thrown open, for the first time in nearly eight months.

Along with Dhoni, Ambatti Rayudu, M. Vijay, Piyush Chawla, Karn Sharma, bowlers K.M. Asif, Monu Singh, R. Sai Kishore and N. Jagadeesan were at the venue on Monday. It is to be noted that Rayudu and Suresh Raina were in Chennai last month for a couple of weeks training to get ready for the IPL.

Dhoni faced the likes of spinners Chawla, Karn, Sai Kishore and a few local net bowlers.

Full camp

While the ongoing camp is for players who are available at the moment, the official camp for the three-time champion starts on March 19 with coach Stephen Fleming likely to arrive in the city a day before.

Defending champion Australia advanced to the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup semifinals knocking out New Zealand with a four-run victory in their must-win final Group A match here on Monday.

Beth Mooney’s brilliant half-century (60, 50b) proved the difference as four-time champion Australia halted New Zealand, needing 156, four runs short. Leg-spinner Georgia Wareham returned three for 17.

Mooney’s 60 runs from 50 balls, including six fours and two sixes, helped Australia to 155 for five with the White Ferns requiring the highest successful chase of the tournament to win at the Junction Oval.

Earlier, Sri Lanka ended its campaign on a high with a crushing victory over Bangladesh in a fitting farewell to retiring veteran Shashikala Siriwardena, who bagged a tournament-best four for 16.

The nine-wicket win was Sri Lanka’s only one of the event to leave it fourth in Group A. Bangladesh brought up the bottom having lost all its four games.

“Really happy with the performance. This game was always going to be tough for us, but our players, particularly the bowlers, did very well,” said Sri Lanka captain Chamari Atapattu, who paid tribute to Siriwardena.

247,2020/03/02,Ranji Trophy | Gaja’s heroics keep Gujarat in the hunt,"Hammers Saurashtra’s bowlers before rattling its batsmen with sensational spell

Chintan Gaja’s all-round heroics brought Gujarat back into the game and kept the Ranji Trophy semifinal hanging in balance at the SCA Stadium on Monday.

Chirag Jani’s double strike in the morning saw host Saurashtra reduce Gujarat to 155 for eight, in quest of 304. However, Gaja’s (61, 103b, 6x4, 4x6) 87-run partnership with a gritty Rujul Bhatt (71, 212b, 6x4) meant Gujarat cut the deficit to 52, after being bowled out for 252.

The right-arm pacer then bowled a sensational opening spell of 6-3-14-5 to rattle Saurashtra. Chetan Sakariya (32 n.o., 70b, 5x4), the No. 11 promoted to No. 5 to negate Gaja’s advantage, then combined with the seasoned Arpit Vasavada (23 n.o., 54b, 3x4). The left-handed duo’s unbroken 51-run partnership helped Saurashtra end day three at 66 for five, a lead of 118.

Undisputed

Gaja was the undisputed hero of the day. With Gujarat in danger of conceding a decisive lead, Gaja adopted an aggressive approach while Bhatt put a price tag on his wicket. With the softer ball of little aid for the bowlers, Gaja opened his shoulders against all Saurashtra bowlers, even an on-song Jaydev Unadkat. Of the 20 he scored off Unadkat, the stand-out stroke was the charge down the track for a huge six over long-on.

Carrying that confidence with the ball, Gaja’s spell up front spelt doom for Saurashtra. He bowled almost all 36 balls in the spell in the perfect channel and Saurashtra’s batsmen succumbed to the pressure of playing at virtually every ball. While openers Kishan Parmar and Harvik Desai were caught by the wicketkeeper — Dhruv Raval kept wickets instead of Parthiv Patel — Avi Barot offered a bat-pad catch to forward short-leg.

Peach

The peach of his dismissals was the one that sneaked through between Vishwaraj Jadeja’s bat and pad to take the top of off-stump. Sheldon Jackson, the first innings century maker, nicked the next into the cordon to leave Vasavada the job of saving a hat-trick.

Had Bhatt not made a mess of an edge off Sakariya that would have given Arzan Nagwaswalla a wicket in the dying moments, Gujarat may have ended the day right on top. With all-rounder duo of Jani and Prerak Mankad yet to bat, Saurashtra will hoping its lower order fires just like Gujarat’s to set a challenging target.

248,2020/03/02,Ranji Trophy | Karnataka has a tough job on hand,"Bengal looks to secure a berth in the final after 13 years

Bengal pursuit of securing a berth in the Ranji Trophy final after 13 years continued. The hosts took an upper hand over Karnataka at the end of day three in the semifinal at the Eden Gardens here on Monday.

Resuming at 72 for four, Bengal made 161 in its second innings and set Karnataka a stiff target of 352. The visitors were 98 for three at stumps.

Testing conditions

Sudip Chatterjee and Anustup Majumdar, the overnight Bengal batsmen, fought for an hour in testing conditions in the morning.

Chatterjee (45, 94b, 8x4) had a lucky escape on 44 when he was hit wicket. Ronit More, who had Majumdar caught off a no-ball on Sunday, had overstepped again.

Later, More, bowling a good line, had Chatterjee — who survived a caught-behind call off Abhimanyu Mithun — and Shreevats Goswami off successive deliveries.

Using DRS

The gutsy Majumdar (41, 108b, 4x4) — who received some blows and used the DRS successfully after being adjudged caught-behind off Prasidh Krishna — played another responsible knock in difficult circumstances.

He added 61 with Shahbaz Ahmed (31, 40b, 4x4, 1x6) to increase the lead to 340.

Off-spinner K. Gowtham picked up three wickets, including that of Shahbaz and Majumdar, and Mithun captured his fourth to restrict Bengal.

Rahul goes early

Karnataka’s chase was jolted early as Ishan Porel, continuing his dazzling form, hit K.L. Rahul’s back leg off the second ball.

However, R. Samarth (27, 69b, 2x4) and Devdutt Padikkal (50 batting, 109b, 6x4) showed a lot of grit for nearly two hours.

Bengal mobilised its resources better when Manoj Tiwary, who had a hand injury, returned to the field.

A hardworking Akash Deep rapped Samarth’s back foot and Bengal used the DRS to turn the decision in its favour. Mukesh got rid of Karnataka captain Karun Nair.

A disciplined Padikkal, who hit some fine boundaries and scored a fifty after seven innings, and Manish Pandey, led Karnataka’s fight.

249,2020/03/02,Faf du Plessis returns to South Africa ODI squad for India tour,"Left-arm spinner George Linde and newcomer Kyle Verreynne called up, injured Kagiso Rabada to miss tour

Left-arm spinner George Linde received his maiden call-up while former South Africa skipper Faf du Plessis returned to the side for the three ODIs in India, beginning March 12 in Dharamsala.

Linde had made his Test debut during the tour of India last October.

The 15-man squad also sees the return of rested players, du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen to bolster the batting line-up and the retention of newcomer Kyle Verreynne who impressed selectors with his score of 48 off 64 on debut against Australia in Paarl on Saturday.

Du Plessis has not played an ODI since South Africa’s disappointing World Cup campaign under his leadership. Keshav Maharaj and Lutho Sipamla are also among the retained players.

“The selections are a continuation of Cricket South Africa’s (CSA) search for the next generation of Proteas who will potentially represent the country in the 2023 ICC World Cup in India...,” Cricket South Africa said in a statement.

“It is also a good opportunity for the players selected to put their hands up and show what they are capable of in the tough playing conditions of India,” it added.

Spinner Tabraiz Shamsi was not available for selection as he and his wife Khadija are anticipating the birth of their first child. Lead pacer Kagiso Rabada remained unavailable due to a groin strain.

South Africa had toured India for three Tests and as many T20s last year. They drew the T20 series before being hammered in Tests.

CSA independent selector Linda Zondi expressed the panel’s pleasure at its chosen team as it continues to rebuild after the loss of several senior players over the last 18 months.

“It is exciting to see the amount of competition for spots that we have within the team and in the franchises, it’s a good headache for us as selectors to have,” he commented.

“We are satisfied with our picks for what will certainly be a challenging tour of India. We saw some promising performances last year from the T20 squad that travelled there and we wanted to give a player like George Linde another crack at the conditions which seemed to really suit him,” added Zondi.

The squad:

Quinton de Kock (captain, wicketkeeper), Temba Bavuma, Rassie van der Dussen, Faf du Plessis, Kyle Verreynne, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Jon-Jon Smuts, Andile Phehlukwayo, Lungi Ngidi, Lutho Sipamla, Beuran Hendricks, Anrich Nortje, George Linde, Keshav Maharaj.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ctt9ct/article30963697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KYLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/faf-du-plessis-returns-to-south-africa-odi-squad-for-india-tour/article30963698.ece
250,2020/03/02,Kohli irked after New Zealand journalist asks about his celebration of Williamson’s dismissal,"‘What do you think? I am asking you the answer,’ the irritation was writ large on the Indian skipper’s face as he came up with a sharp retort after India’s defeat in Christchurch

India captain Virat Kohli on Monday got annoyed after being asked about his animated celebrations over Kane Williamson’s dismissal on day two of the second Test before clarifying that match referee Ranjan Madugalle had no issues with what happened.

However, when Williamson was asked about the incident, the New Zealand captain downplayed the incident, saying it was “typical of Virat, who plays the game with lot of passion”.

Following India’s seven-wicket loss here on Monday, one of the local journalists sought Kohli’s reaction on allegedly swearing at Williamson and that did not go down well with the away team captain. India lost the series 0-2.

“What do you think? I am asking you the answer,” the irritation was writ large on the Indian skipper’s face as he came up with a sharp retort.

“You need to find out an answer and come up with a better question. You can’t come here with half questions and half details of what happened. Also if you want to create controversy, this is not the right place. I spoke with the match referee (Madugalle) and he had no issues with what happened,” said Kohli.

It was on day two when Williamson was dismissed by Jasprit Bumrah and Kohli was animated as ever in his celebrations. Kohli also gestured the crowd to keep quiet.

When Williamson was asked about Kohli’s celebrations, he simply laughed it off.

“It is Virat and he is passionate on the field. I don’t think we need to read too much into it,” Williamson told PTI.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/3s0zrw/article30963566.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KANE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kohli-irked-after-new-zealand-journalist-asks-about-his-celebration-of-williamsons-dismissal/article30963567.ece
251,2020/03/02,"Didn’t play to our potential, admits Kohli","Stresses on need to address the mistakes, make amends in future engagements

Virat Kohli’s demeanour reflected his mood.

He was bitterly disappointed at India’s capitulation. There was no fight, no resistance as the Indians slumped to yet another defeat on day three here.

On India’s last tour of South Africa, Kohli had spoken passionately following India’s Test series defeat at Centurion. He had said: “To win Test series abroad you got to keep thinking and dreaming about it everyday.”

Pragmatic

But then, as he answered questions here on Monday, Kohli appeared more pragmatic. He had taken the hard knocks as a batsman and captain in the series. He was sober; that fire you saw at Centurion was missing.

Kohli said: “Obviously, quite disappointed with how we played in this series.

“Every challenge that comes our way, we try to take it head-on. I feel like we were completely outplayed in this series. There is no shame in being outplayed at the international level.”

He added: “We obviously didn’t play the kind of cricket we do as a team. The thing to take away from here is to not shy away from things that have gone wrong. Instead, address them straight up, and not be in denial. Acceptance is the first word.”

Also read: New Zealand beats India by seven wickets, sweep series

The India skipper elaborated: “Because we do have a lot of cricket away from home coming this season.

“It is something we are optimistic about, and looking forward to. Things that have not gone right here, we would like to be in similar situations and correct them.”

Kohli admitted India had not been positive enough in the series. “We were not brave enough in moments, which we have done in the past. Even though we lost, we still competed. Skills follow your mind-set. We needed to have more clarity as batsmen. Perhaps we made too much of the conditions.”

Kohli was not willing to blame any particular batsman for getting stuck at the crease. “You take the hit collectively,” he said.

On Pant

On Rishabh Pant not delivering despite being given chances, he said, “You got to strike a balance.

“You cannot push a player out too early. It can damage his confidence.”

Kohli said the team was not dependent on his batting alone. “It’s not like that at all. If you take the Australia series, Pujara made the biggest contribution there.”

When asked by a local reporter about his alleged swear words against Kane Williamson, Kohli snapped back, “I have spoken to the match referee. There is nothing to it.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/h59mgg/article30944839.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-ViratKohli,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/batsmen-didnt-do-enough-for-bowlers-to-attack-kohli/article30961201.ece
252,2020/03/02,"NZ vs IND: Southee is Kohli’s weakness, says Hadlee","The side batting second knew they would be better placed if they scored more boundaries in the event of a tie.

He is New Zealand’s biggest cricketing legend. Sir Richard Hadlee, now constructing a five-lane indoor facility at the Hagley Oval, believes cricket is a bowler’s game. “A bowler dictates play, controls the game.”

Excerpts from an exclusive chat with the ‘Sultan of Swing’.

On The ODI World Cup final that left several fans angry

No side lost. To bring it back to boundaries was very unfair to the team batting first. The side batting second knew they would be better placed if they scored more boundaries in the event of a tie. We could have have had another Super Over or the trophy could have been shared.

On Jasprit Bumrah

He’s very unusual and unorthodox. He has a short run-up, or is it a run-up at all. He just walks across, a stutter and the last four or five paces. He is a muscle bowler, a power bowler.

The golden pair of Tim Southee and Trent Boult

When one of them doesn’t play the bowling line-up looks different. There is a little competition between them, one is right and the other a left-armer. Different angles, swing.

The dimension Kyle Jamieson has added to the attack

We had a very tall bowler in the ’50s but subsequently we have not had such a bowler. He gets bounce, bowls the off-stump line. He is our great find of the summer.

Virat Kohli’s ‘weakness’ in these conditions

Southee is Kohli’s weakness, he’s got him out many times with swing. Against Southee, he is planting his front foot forward, not fully so, and if the ball does something, he’s in trouble. If the ball moves away, he gets caught behind, If it nips back he is leg-before.

Batsman from this era he would have found challenging

Steve Smith. He’s unorthodox, stands on leg-stump and by the time you deliver moves to middle and off. And, if you are a bit wide, he lets you go. If you are closer to the stumps, he whips you through mid-wicket. Early on, you should bowl at his off-stump. If he misses, he can be leg-before.

Most impressive contemporary paceman

(Josh) Hazlewood. I love his simplicity. He is tall, runs in straight, good action and hits the stumps. Line and length, good pace and good variations.

Thoughts on DRS

You should take it away from the players. It should be in the hands of the third umpire. If he spots something, he should inform the standing umpires and the decision reviewed. I don’t want players to challenge decisions.

Hardest batsman to bowl to in his time

Geoff Boycott was the hardest to dismiss. He only played the ball when he had to. Left a lot outside off. Others like Viv Richards and Greg Chappell gave you a chance.

On day-night Tests

Day-night Tests add another dimension to cricket. But the pink ball moves a lot under lights giving one side a massive advantage in the last session. It’s not a good thing.

Threat to Test cricket

Test cricket has to be protected by the administrators. It is the foundation of the game. Once you lose Test cricket, you will not get it back. T20 is not real cricket.

On spot and match-fixing

There is temptation. Players are offered life-changing amounts. Do the right thing. Do not lose your reputation, you wont get it back.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/169aqn/article30957502.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02HAD,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-test-series-richard-hadlee-on-virat-kohli/article30957503.ece

254,2020/03/02,Corporation develops mobile appto check RWH structures in city,"For use by engineers or persons engaged by civic body during field inspection

Coimbatore Corporation has developed a mobile application to check rainwater harvest (RWH) structures in the city. Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani had launched the app a few days ago.

Corporation officials familiar with the development of the app say it is for use by engineers or persons engaged by the Corporation on field to check for RWH structures in residential, commercial and industrial establishments in the city.

Developed on Android platform, the app comes with details of wards, streets, households, their property tax assessment numbers, names of the owners, etc. preloaded.

Before embarking on the verification exercise, the engineers or persons engaged can choose the ward they are in and the street they are checking from drop-down menus. This will take them to a page containing a list of houses on the street chosen to begin the exercise.

After entering each of the houses on the street and verifying the names of the owners, the engineers or persons engaged will check for the presence of RWH structures. If they do not find any, they will record the same in the device, which will pave way for the Corporation issuing notice, the officials say.

The app has the facility for follow-up – it will remind the engineers or persons engaged to visit the houses without the structures to check if construction for RWH has begun.

In houses where the RWH structures are present, the engineers of persons engaged will check if they are pucca structures.

If they are, they will record the same before moving on to the next house on the list. If not, they will record the same and ask the house owners or occupants to rectify the structures.

In this case too the app alerts the engineers or persons engaged to follow up on the remedial action after a fortnight or so.

In the back-end, the app will let the supervising officers know how much houses the engineers or persons engaged have checked.

This is to ensure that all establishments in the city have functional RWH structures, the officials add.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/fmz2xy/article30966329.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB03MOBILEAPP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corporation-develops-mobile-appto-check-rwh-structures-in-city/article30966330.ece
255,2020/03/02,Work to convey treated sewage to Vellalore begins,"The total cost of the project is ₹ 2.50 crore

Coimbatore Corporation has begun work to convey the sewage treated at the Ukkadam sewage treatment plant to Vellalore.

The Corporation officials familiar with the development say the civic body is building a collection well to hold 10 lakh litre treated sewage and to start laying pipeline for 1.30 km to convey the treated sewage to Vellalore.

The cost of the project is ₹ 2.50 crore.

The pipeline to be laid will convey the sewage from the treatment plant to Kulandai Gounder Street, where an old pipeline exists till Vellalore.

In Vellalore, the Corporation is building a four-lakh-litre sump to store the water, which it will use to water plants and to put out flames during fire breakouts.

The Corporation also plants to sell the surplus water to private establishments like golf course or industries that may be interested.

The officials say that as part of the work, the Corporation will also be repairing a 400 – 500m stretch of the pipeline near the newly constructed Podanur bridge. The pipeline was damaged during the bridge construction.

The Corporation has asked the Southern Railway for the pipeline design and as per the Railway’s specification, it will carry out the work. The completion of the work will minimise the Corporation’s reliance on fire tenders from the Fire and Rescue Services to douse fire during accidents at the dump yard.

The Corporation had first mooted the proposal to sell the treated sewage in 2015 by calling for an expression of interest. After poor response and a two-year delay, the Corporation in 2017 initiated the project to convey the treated sewage to Vellalore.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/r1ozsb/article30966299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB03SEWAGETREATMENTPLAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/work-to-convey-treated-sewage-to-vellalore-begins/article30966300.ece

Following orders from the Madras High Court, the district administration and officials from Public Works department sealed borewells of 31 packaged drinking water units for operating without necessary clearance.

District Collector S.A. Raman said, “ there are about 50 packaged drinking water manufacturers in the district and action has been taken against 31 units which were operating with the No Objection Certificate required to extract groundwater for the purpose. Currently, there are only nine firms in the district which are operating with NOC and a few other firms have applied for the certificate and they are under consideration.”

However, packaged drinking water manufacturers here are continuing their strike demanding intervention from State government to offer them relaxation.

Regional president of Tamil Nadu Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers’ Association S.G. Eshwar, said,

“these are not illegal units. All these units have ISO, FSSAI and other certifications and only quality drinking water is being supplied. Many of these sealed firms have been functioning since 2000, even before the law demanding NOC was introduced. The State government must intervene to offer relaxation for firms and let us continue with business. Livelihood of many have been affected and there is huge demand for drinking water.”

257,2020/03/02,Coonoor residents demand action against dumping of biomedical waste,"Residents of Coonoor have called on the municipality to initiate action against unregistered clinics that are found to be dumping biomedical waste in forest areas.

The plea comes after local residents documented the illegal dumping of biomedical waste in Coonoor town limits recently.

S Sakthivel, a Coonoor resident, said that residents noticed the dumping of biomedical waste less than a km away from the Coonoor railway station. “Local residents then informed authorities concerned to come and clean up the waste, as it was a hazard to people, many of whom use the pathway as a shortcut to get to the railway station,” said Mr. Sakthivel.

“However, after the people who dumped the biomedical waste in the area came to learn that the illegal dumping of waste had been discovered, they arrived at the spot and haphazardly cleaned up the waste. Even now, there are used needles in the area, posing a risk to residents as well as wildlife,” said Mr. Sakthivel.

Municipal officials said that registered hospitals and clinics in Coonoor can handover biomedical waste to the Society of Biomedical Waste Management in Coonoor. However, unregistered clinics might be dumping biomedical waste in forest areas, officials said, adding that they would take action against people found illegally dumping waste.

R. Mahesh, another resident, said that the health department should check on whether the clinics operating in Coonoor are registered, and whether they have means to dispose of medical waste. “Strict action must be taken against the hospitals and clinics found to be operating without licences,” he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/pf6wf0/article30958692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OO02-WASTEE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coonoor-residents-demand-action-against-dumping-of-biomedical-waste/article30958693.ece

259,2020/03/02,Illegal parking of vehicles on city roadsa growing concern for traffic police,"CoP has instructed the personnel to conduct special drives to crack down on violators

Vehicles parked between Uppilipalayam signal and the beginning of Avinashi Road flyover and vehicles lined up in front of the combined court complex near the roundabout at Red Cross office are not lone examples of how illegal parking is affecting traffic flow in the city.

According to traffic police personnel, parking of vehicles in no-parking zones is becoming a growing concern as they are affecting big and small roads in the city.

Ukkadam, Town Hall, Oppanakara Street, Variety Hall road, Poomarket, Gandhipuram, 100 Feet Road, Cross Cut Road, Ram Nagar, Saibaba Colony, D.B. Road and Thadagam Road are among places that witness illegal parking more while parts of Avinashi Road such as Peelamedu and Hope College also suffer from the problem.

The police say that illegal parking has multiple impact on road safety including shrinking of motorable space on the road, blocking pedestrian walkways at some places and also cause for accidents.

They add that workshops and a few agencies selling two-wheelers and cars were also occupying motorable road space of some of the city roads on a regular basis despite fines imposed.

The menace created by illegal parking was discussed at a recent meeting of District Road Safety Committee wherein District Collector and other members proposed to the police to take strong action against violators.

Senior officials with the traffic police said that City Police Commissioner (CoP) Sumit Sharan has instructed the police to conduct special drives to crack down on illegal parking and slap fine on violators.

On February 27 alone, the police slapped fine on 485 persons for parking vehicles in no-parking zones.

During special drives, the police will lock vehicles that are found parked in no-parking zones with chains and wheel clamps.

According to Deputy Commissioner of Police R. Mutharasu, the police conducted various awareness activities to educate motorists to avoid illegal parking before staring the special drive.

Raj Khanna, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Traffic West, said that the police will also tow and remove vehicles that are found parked illegally, causing traffic obstruction.

Mr. Sharan said that the drive will continue apart from similar crack down done on LED headlights and pressure horns.

People like K. Kathirmathiyon, consumer activist and member of the District Road Safety Committee, feel that the city is facing a growing dearth of parking space, the main reason why vehicles are parked in no-parking zones.

“Local Planning Authority and the Corporation should also take action against shops and establishments that do not have parking space due to which customers park vehicles on roads. Though parking space is a must for commercial buildings, they only remain in the plan and design to get necessary approvals in most cases,” he said.

Meanwhile, the police have also plans to introduce one-side parking system on more roads to tackle illegal parking and dearth of parking space at busy places.

Under this, vehicles will be allowed to park only on one side of the road for a month and the parking will be shifted to the other side of the road in the next month. One-side parking was introduced on Cross Cut Road, D.B. Road and a part of NSR Road.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/46dodx/article30958651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB02-MAINN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/illegal-parking-of-vehicles-on-city-roadsa-growing-concern-for-traffic-police/article30958652.ece

263,2020/03/02,Delhi violence a matter of great shame: Harsh Mander,"Activists demand medical, legal camps for riot-affected persons.

Human rights and health activists on Monday demanded that State and Central governments immediately start trust-building measures, provide medical, legal and rehabilitation camps to help violence-affected people of northeast Delhi. The demands came a week after violent communal clashes in the district that claimed the lives of at least 45 persons.

Calling the violence a matter of great shame, activist Harsh Mander said it was hard to believe that the Delhi Police, the second largest police force in the country, couldn’t stop the violence. “The suffering, pain, fear that we are seeing now is a reflection of our collective failure. It is not the governments who came out to help; it is the common man in Delhi,” he said, speaking at a press conference organised by the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA).

On ground voices

Activists Anjali Bhardwaj, Annie Raja and Harjit Singh Bhatti also participated in the presser after releasing the group’s ground report titled “The Role of Health Systems in Responding to Communal Violence in Delhi”. The report documented the response of the health systems as communal violence engulfed several localities of North East Delhi.

The report documents the first-hand experience of JSA volunteers that have been on the ground since 25 February as well as accounts of injured persons and their families that volunteers have directly interviewed and worked with.

Dr. Harjit Singh Bhatti from the Progressive Medicos and Scientists said there was long delay in the treatment of those who suffered gunshot wounds “because police did not allow private medical help to reach the sites of violence”.

Pervasive mistrust

“Police were rude.. and because of fear and disbelief, the wounded people were not ready to undergo treatment in government hospitals,” the activists claimed.

Stating that there was still a large number of people who had not received any medical help so far, Mr. Bhardwaj said, “The violence also exposed India’s poor healthcare system. Government hospitals are overburdened. The riot-affected areas do not have any hospital — the nearest hospital is 10 km away. Worse, no one from the Centre or Delhi government has established any contact with the people till February 29.”

Indicating the mistrust of the affected persons, Ms Bhardwaj recounted that when the group asked if they could help people fill the compensation form, the affected people rebuffed that offer, fearing that the information may be used for other purposes.

The activists demanded that public representatives visit ground zero and meet the violence-hit people which is crucial for confidence building. Also shelter and adequate relief should be arranged for families who have been forced to leave their houses, the activists said.

The group has also demanded that the government set up round-the-clock medical camps and a single-window facilitation centres for official documents destroyed in the arson.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/n7o4km/article26974036.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29THHARSHMANDAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-violence-a-matter-of-great-shame-harsh-mander/article30964727.ece
264,2020/03/02,A step closer to owning their house,"The DDA has so far handed out nearly 300 conveyance deeds to residents of unauthorised colonies

The process of granting ownership to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies is “fast gaining pace,” according to officials of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the designated nodal agency for the project in the city.

The first set of 20 applicants who completed the registration process were granted ownership rights on January 4 ahead of the Assembly elections; as of February 27, the DDA has handed out nearly 300 conveyance deeds to residents of unauthorised colonies.

“A total of 292 applicants have been granted ownership rights, which includes 164 conveyance deeds and 128 authorisation slips. Once the verification process is completed, conveyance deeds are handed out for government land while authorisation slips are issued for private land,” said a senior DDA official.

The online application portal for the grant of ownership rights was launched on December 16. As of February 27, it has received over 2.32 lakh registrations; and 1,649 completed applications have been received, as per the urban body.

“Registering on the portal is only the first step. After this, applicants are required to obtain their respective geo-coordinates. They can approach agencies engaged by the DDA for the purpose of GIS mapping and once this is done applicants can continue the process with the ID that is sent to them. The entire process might be slightly time-consuming but only those applications which are complete will be processed,” another DDA official said.

Residents of unauthorised colonies who have completed the entire application process are likely to be granted ownership rights within 180 days.

Apart from the 50 helpdesks set up by the land-owning agency to assist interested stakeholders, the DDA has held four awareness camps across the city, including in Raja Vihar, Suraj Park, Massodpur and Patel Garden, Matiala.

“The main purpose behind organising the camps is to have a one-on-one interaction with the resident welfare associations, and the residents of the unauthorised colonies. These interactions help in explaining the entire procedure to them and get feedback on issues they might be facing. The camps are being held in addition to the helpdesks already set up,” the official added.

Officials maintained that the process of granting ownership rights continued even during election period as “requisite approvals were sought and due process was followed”.

DDA Vice-Chairman Tarun Kapoor said: “Our processing centres are in place and we want to speed things up. We want to hand out the conveyance deeds and authorisation slips to all the over two lakh applicants who have registered at the earliest. We are also holding camps to motivate people to complete the applications. In the coming days we are also going to increase the number of processing centres.”

In 2008, a total of 1,797 colonies had been identified as unauthorised; the current grant of rights excludes 66 colonies deemed “affluent” at that time.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/a-step-closer-to-owning-their-house/article30963736.ece

266,2020/03/02,Delay in hanging shows failure of system: Nirbhaya’s mother,"“I lose hope every day but I stand tall every day,"" she said.

Delhi gangrape victim Nirbhaya’s mother Asha Devi on Monday said no matter what the convicts did, they would be hanged for their crime, after a Delhi court deferred the execution of the death penalty in the case till further orders.

“This shows the failure of our system. The whole world is watching how justice is being delayed in India,” she told reporters.

It is the third time that the hanging of the four convicts has been deferred.

Ms. Asha Devi said she “loses hope every day” but the convicts will be hanged no matter what they do.

“I lose hope every day but I stand tall every day. They would have to be hanged. There could not have been a worse case than Nirbhaya but still I am struggling to get justice. The courts are sitting and watching the drama,” she added.

A Delhi court on Monday deferred till further orders the hanging of the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

The hanging was scheduled for Tuesday at 6 a.m. Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana said the death sentence could not be executed pending disposal of mercy petition of convict Pawan Kumar Gupta.

The court passed the order on Pawan’s plea seeking to stay the execution as he has filed a mercy petition before the President on Monday.

The first date of execution, January 22, was postponed to February 1 by a January 17 court order. Then the trial court, on January 31, stayed, “till further orders” the execution of the four convicts as they had not exhausted all their legal remedies.

The court had on February 17 directed that the four men be hanged by neck on March 3 at 6 a.m. until they are dead. This was for the third time that the death warrants were issued by the court against them.

“Now deferring it any further would be sacrilegious to the rights of the victim for expeditious justice,” it had said.

‘Convicts misleading court’

Earlier, Ms. Asha Devi said the convicts were misleading the courts, but asserted that she trusted the justice system.

She was reacting after one of the four convicts Pawan Kumar Gupta filed a mercy plea before the President.

“These people are misleading the court. I have trust in the justice system of India and we still have strong belief on it that finally they will be hanged,” she told reporters.

On Monday, the Supreme Court dismissed the curative petition filed by Gupta in the case, following which his lawyer A.P. Singh said he filed the mercy plea before the President.

Counsel said the mercy plea was filed after getting information that the apex court had dismissed Gupta’s curative petition.

Later in the day, a Delhi court dismissed the pleas of two of the four convicts in the gang rape and murder case that sought stay on the execution of their death warrants.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/k8yo0i/article30962504.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAIRAPTI172020000091A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/convicts-misleading-court-but-i-trust-justice-system-delhi-gangrape-victims-mother/article30962505.ece

A five-judge Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana dismissed the curative petition filed by Pawan Gupta, one of the four Nirbhaya gangrape convicts, against his death sentence.

The Bench examined the petition in the chamber at 10.25 a.m. on Monday and found no merits in it.

“We have gone through the curative petition and the relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out... The application for oral hearing is rejected. The application for stay of execution of death sentence is also rejected,” the short order said.

The date of execution of the death sentence of the four men is set for March 3 at 6 a.m.

Organ donation

Separately, a Bench of Justices R. Banumathi and A.S. Bopanna dismissed a PIL petition filed by former High Court judge, Michael Saldanha, for directions to the government and jail authorities to give the Nirbhaya convicts’ organs for medical research.

“To execute a person is the saddest part for the family . You (petitioner ) want their body to cut into pieces... Have a humane approach to these things... Organ donation has to be voluntary,” Justice Banumathi addressed the petitioner.

In his curative plea, Pawan had argued that he was a juvenile at the time of the crime and was not present at the place of crime. He had contended that he was at a park attending a musical show, he claimed. The petition said the court did not follow the principles of natural justice while confirming his death sentence.

The other three convicts — Vinay, Mukesh and Akshay — seemed to have exhausted their legal remedies. Recently, the Supreme Court had dismissed a petition filed by Vinay challenging the rejection of his mercy plea by the President in the case.

The curative petition, as is the practice, would be decided by circulation among the judges on the Bench in their chambers.

Pawan has also not filed a plea for clemency with the President.

On February 25, the Supreme Court had deferred hearing an appeal filed by the Centre for permission to separately execute the death sentence of the four convicts. A three-judge Bench led by Justice Banumathi had decided to watch the unfolding of events over the next few days rather than start hearing arguments on the legality of executing convicts separately before the legal and administrative remedies available to their co-convicts were exhausted.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/67oyh1/article30953806.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pawan-Gupta,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sc-dismisses-curative-plea-of-fourth-nirbhaya-case-convict-pawan-gupta/article30961544.ece

272,2020/03/02,Lakdawala’s cousin held in extortion case,"He served as middleman, gave gangster realtor’s details

Gangster Ejaz Lakdawala’s cousin has been arrested from the Mumbai international airport in a case of alleged extortion of ₹1 crore from a builder, the police said on Sunday.

After a real estate developer from Bandra lodged a police complaint on January 6, the Anti-Extortion Cell (AEC) of the Mumbai Police Crime Branch began an investigation and nabbed Nadeem Abdul Sattar Lakdawala (49) on Saturday, a police official said. Mr. Lakdawala has already been arrested in the same case by the Crime Branch, the official said.

The complainant had received extortion calls for six months, following which he approached the police. When AEC officials quizzed Mr. Lakdawala, who was arrested in January, about the case pertaining to the complainant, the gangster revealed his cousin’s name.

According to the police, Nadeem provided details of the real estate developer to the gangster. The Crime Branch swung into action and launched a massive search for him, but got to know he was not in India, the official said.

Later, the police issued a lookout circular against Nadeem and took him into custody when he arrived at the international airport.

During their probe, the Crime Branch found out that Nadeem played middleman in setting up meetings in Dubai between Mr. Lakdawala and a few people whom the gangster was harassing, the official said, adding that the former took advantage of his close relation with Mr. Lakdawala.

Nadeem was booked under Sections 387 (putting person in fear of death or of grievous hurt, in order to commit extortion), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and produced in a local court on Sunday. He has been remanded in police custody till March 3.

273,2020/03/02,"DDA to grant ownership to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies","The DDA has so far handed out nearly 300 conveyance deeds and authorisation slips

The process of granting ownership to residents of 1,731 unauthorised colonies is “fast gaining pace,” according to officials of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), the designated nodal agency for the project in the city.

The first set of 20 applicants who completed the registration process were granted ownership rights on January 4 ahead of the Assembly elections; as of February 27, the DDA has handed out nearly 300 conveyance deeds to residents of unauthorised colonies.

“A total of 292 applicants have been granted ownership rights, which includes 164 conveyance deeds and 128 authorisation slips. Once the verification process is completed, conveyance deeds are handed out for government land while authorisation slips are issued for private land,” said a senior DDA official.

The online application portal for the grant of ownership rights was launched on December 16. As of February 27, it has received over 2.32 lakh registrations; and 1,649 completed applications have been received, as per the urban body.

“Registering on the portal is only the first step. After this, applicants are required to obtain their respective geo-coordinates. They can approach agencies engaged by the DDA for the purpose of GIS mapping and once this is done applicants can continue the process with the ID that is sent to them. The entire process might be slightly time-consuming but only those applications which are complete will be processed,” another DDA official said.

Residents of unauthorised colonies who have completed the entire application process are likely to be granted ownership rights within 180 days.

Apart from the 50 helpdesks set up by the land-owning agency to assist interested stakeholders, the DDA has held four awareness camps across the city, including in Raja Vihar, Suraj Park, Massodpur and Patel Garden, Matiala.

“The main purpose behind organising the camps is to have a one-on-one interaction with the resident welfare associations, and the residents of the unauthorised colonies. These interactions help in explaining the entire procedure to them and get feedback on issues they might be facing. The camps are being held in addition to the helpdesks already set up,” the official added.

Officials maintained that the process of granting ownership rights continued even during election period as “requisite approvals were sought and due process was followed”.

DDA Vice-Chairman Tarun Kapoor said: “Our processing centres are in place and we want to speed things up. We want to hand out the conveyance deeds and authorisation slips to all the over two lakh applicants who have registered at the earliest. We are also holding camps to motivate people to complete the applications. In the coming days we are also going to increase the number of processing centres.”

In 2008, a total of 1,797 colonies had been identified as unauthorised; the current grant of rights excludes 66 colonies deemed “affluent” at that time.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lexbri/article30960902.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08186fb7,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dda-to-grant-ownership-to-residents-of-1731-unauthorised-colonies/article30960906.ece

275,2020/03/02,Four more bodies pulled out from drains in north-east Delhi,"None identified yet; no information on five missing persons

A week after riots broke out in the city, the police on Sunday pulled out four more bodies from drains in north-east Delhi. Despite the recovery of the bodies, the death toll that stood at 42 on Saturday has not been officially revised.

The police received a PCR call at 8.20 a.m. about a body in the Bhagirath drain. Later in the afternoon, a second body was fished out from the same drain, the police said, adding that the third body was recovered from a drain near the Gokalpuri police station. The fourth body was pulled out from a drain in Shiv Vihar.

“The bodies have been shifted to GTB Hospital for post-mortem. The nature of injuries are not clear. None of the recovered bodies have been identified so far,” said a senior police officer.

Another police officer said between February 23 and 25, a total of 44 people were reported missing from the riot-affected areas of north-east Delhi. Of them, five are still untraceable while the rest have either returned home or are reported among the injured or killed in the riots.

Missing complaint

Ankita Ramgopal, a lawyer, said she is assisting the family of Aftab, who is missing since Monday, with the help of authorities concerned. “Aftab, 20, had come to Delhi a few days ago in search of job. He went missing from the Karawal Nagar area. We have filed a missing complaint at the local police station and also checked all hospitals for him,” she said.

Another man Dinesh, a resident of Bhajanpura, has been missing since the riots

“Hamza, 19, a resident of Old Mustafabad, is missing since the violence on February 26. We went to the police station but the policemen misbehaved with us and asked us to leave. We are running from pillar to post to get information about him,” said Aarif, brother-in-law of Hamza.

276,2020/03/02,Environmental activists embrace ‘last remnants of Aravali forests’,"Protest Haryana government’s ‘disastrous’ amendments to Punjab Land Preservation Act

To mark the anniversary of the “disastrous” Punjab Land Preservation Act amendments by the Haryana government in February last year, hundreds of NCR residents, including college students from Delhi University, came together to hug trees, sing songs, recite poetry and embrace the last remnants of the Aravali forests.

The event ‘Aravalli Calling’ was held in the forest behind Suncity here on Sunday, with the aim of creating awareness about the importance of the Aravalis and to remind the government of its responsibility towards preserving the State’s flora and fauna, said Rahul Khera, one of the organisers from the Aravalli Bachao Citizens Movement.

Residents formed a human chain on a recently encroached and flattened land, which used to be part of the Aravali forest till a few months ago.

Holding hands at the periphery of this encroachment, people showed their commitment to not let this encroachment go any further into the forest and to reclaim the encroached land and revive it. Slogans like “We will save our Aravalis, our healing forests”, “We love Aravalis, our lifeline for clean air and water security” reverberated through the air.

“We are gathered here to form a human chain against the backdrop of the Aravalis and Gurugram’s skyscrapers — a stark reminder of what is at stake. The idea is to bring focus on the plight of the Aravalis threatened by illegal tree felling and constructions and educate people on how the regressive amendments made to the 118-year-old Punjab Land Preservation Act [PLPA] will open up nearly 60,000 acres of the Aravali hills to real estate development. In a State that already has the lowest forest cover in India of a mere 3.6%, the PLPA amendment Bill is the final death knell,” said Gaurav Sarup, one of the campaigners.

The participants then proceeded for a walk into the forest, where DU Professor Robin informed the group about the ecology of the landscape, including how to differentiate native and invasive tree species. Inspired by Sunderlal Bahuguna and the women of Uttarakhand, the group then re-enacted the Chipko Andolan of the 1970s, in a symbolic commitment of their love for these urban forests.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/a21b98/article30960916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01DELPRIYAARAVALI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/environmental-activists-embrace-last-remnants-of-aravali-forests/article30959163.ece
277,2020/03/02,Police presence stepped up at Shaheen Bagh,"Move in wake of right-wing group’s call to clear road where anti-CAA protest is going on

Heavy police presence and barricading were seen in Shaheen Bagh on Sunday after a right-wing group, Hindu Sena, gave a call to clear the road where anti-CAA protesters have been staging a sit-in since December 16.

The group, however, said the “clearance call” was called off in view of the “law and order situation”, on Saturday. The Delhi police said they stepped up deployment around the protest site as a “precautionary measure”.

The police imposed Section 144 in the area due to which a peace march planned on Sunday afternoon by the protesters of Shaheen Bagh “in deep mourning for the lives lost” and to show solidarity with all those affected by the violence had to be called off.

The Shaheen Bagh march being called off was in sharp contrast to a march that was taken out through Connaught Place on Saturday under the banner of “Delhi Peace Forum” by several pro-CAA right-wing outfits. The march, which went through the heart of Delhi, also saw “provocative slogans” being raised by the participants.

The Delhi police, meanwhile, said that no permission had been granted for the march in Connaught Place.

At Shaheen Bagh, protest continued throughout the day with people talking about how to take their movement forward despite the violence in north-east Delhi. Shohaib, who has been a regular at the site, said, “The anti-CAA protest is one for all of humanity. After the violence, all those who want a secular India should stand up and support it. We need the Shaheen Bagh protest to continue so that we can educate people about the CAA and the larger Hindutva agenda of the government.” The protesters said they would continue their sit-in peacefully and appealed to people to come and stand in support.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hodyto/article30959109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2DESHAHEEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/police-presence-stepped-up-at-shaheen-bagh/article30959110.ece
278,2020/03/02,Activists allege absence of govt. agencies in relief work,"They claim mostly private vehicles were carrying relief material to areas they visited

After visiting Bhajanpura, Chaman Park and Shiv Vihar, a group of activists here have alleged absence of government agencies or representatives from the relief operations in the aftermath of the recent violence in Delhi.

A report by activists Anjali Bhardwaj, Annie Raja, Poonam Kaushik, Geetanjali Krishna, Amrita Johri, who visited the areas, said there were mostly private vehicles carrying the relief measures and there were no government agency or representative co-ordinating or delivering relief.

The activists, in a statement, said: “Seeing the ground situation on February 29 and talking to affected people, it is clear that the Central and Delhi governments have failed in providing any modicum of relief to those affected or displaced by the recent spate of violence. In each place, families which had to abandon their homes due to violence are taking refuge or have made private arrangements in different localities or are staying in temporary accommodation provided by private individuals. The Central and Delhi governments have not set up a single relief camp in the areas which we visited.” The statement read: “We call upon the Central and the Delhi governments to immediately provide relief in a dignified manner to those who have been affected by the violence. The CM, Ministers of the Central and Delhi governments, MPs and MLAs must meet all affected persons and immediately initiate confidence-building measures.”

The measures demanded by the activists were safe shelters for abandoned families, 24X7 community kitchens with provision of milk and vegetables at subsidised rate, 24X7 medical camps, clean clothing, facilitation desk for legal aid, immediate rebuilding or repair of places of worship, camps for obtaining destroyed official documents and simple procedures to apply for compensation.

They also demanded that Delhi government officials be present and easily accessible in the affected areas.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/activists-allege-absence-of-govt-agencies-in-relief-work/article30959095.ece
279,2020/03/02,Shops slowly reopen in parts of riot-hit north-east Delhi,"Number of police personnel patrolling the area was less on Sunday

In some parts of north-east Delhi, such as Brijpuri, several shops were reopened on Sunday a week since violence broke out in the area. More vehicles were also seen plying on the roads here on Sunday.

“We were coming out on the street for the last few days, trying to get the lay of the land. I thought of reopening my shop after the situation seemed normal,” said Shehzad, a vendor in Brijpuri. “But there is a shortage of supply of goods,” he said, adding: “Wholesalers are increasing prices and are leaving no option. So we are making do with what we are getting.”

Some shopkeepers were also reportedly hiking prices of ration.

The number of security personnel, who were patrolling the almost empty streets of the area until a few days back, were less here on Sunday, a fact which concerned some residents. “The police were right here in the lanes of Brijpuri till this morning,” said Vishal Verma who owns a general store located on a street which had other stores burnt down during the violence and broken pieces of brick littered on the ground. “The area requires police deployment at least till Holi, he said. His friend Sahil, who had come to meet him after a week, said that communities in the area were not interacting with each other, adding that maintaining peace depended on the people.

Omvati, who resides behind Rajdhani School in the area that had been burnt down, said she witnessed petrol bombs being thrown and stones being pelted while she was hiding at her house. “I stepped out for the first time today after the violence,” she said. Ms. Omvati said she was still not ready to step out much further from her own street. Her neighbour Sarita Moga said that all the ration that she had kept at home were spoilt by the bombs that had been hurled at her house. “Things are not going to be normal until justice is done,” she said.

Bridges from Brijpuri to Shiv Vhiar, one of the places that witnessed the worst incidents violence, remained blocked by makeshift barriers manned by RAF personnel. While security personnel assisted residents of the area when they visited the site, most shops remained closed and people were being asked not to visit the area.

280,2020/03/02,All store owners not on same page,"While some want to hold on to damaged shops, houses, others want to leave

Store owners who arrived at the North-East Delhi District Magistrate’s office on Sunday to file claims for property damaged in the recent violence, had “mixed feelings” regarding returning to the area.

“I can never go back to setting up a shop there” said Nargis, whose beauty parlour in Ashok Nagar had been looted. “Had the people of the area stood together, they could have done something to stop it... I have no faith now,” she said. Her husband’s clothes store next to hers had also been allegedly looted with a cumulative loss of nearly ₹20 lakhs been reported. “Now if we set up a shop, it will be in our own area.”

Imran Khan, whose motorcycle repair store was gutted in fire along with scores of two-wheelers, did not want to continue working in the area. “Nobody can guarantee that something like this will not happen again,” he said. Mr. Khan had not been to the store yet to inspect the damage. “We have not gone there yet. People have told us that the situation is still tense,” he said.

Others, such as Sagir Ahmed, whose confectionery store in Shiv Vihar was also looted, has not been able to visit his shop yet either. “Our neighbours have been saying that the situation is still not entirely normal. We are scared to go there,” he said. Mr. Ahmed has been running the store since the last 13 years and also owns the building. He said he did not have an option and had to continue working here.

Abdul Wahid, who ran a foam mattress store on the main road in Chand Bagh, said his store had been burnt, but that he had no plans of shifting. “I have been working here since 1992. Where will we go now?” he said.

281,2020/03/02,53-year-old beaten to death in violence on February 24,"He was on his way back home from a furniture shop along with his teenage son

A 53-year-old carpenter, Mohammad Yusuf, was returning home in Mustafabad with his son on a motorcycle when they were intercepted by a mob at Gokalpuri Road on February 24.

While Yusuf was lynched, his 19-year-old son, Suleman, suffered multiple injuries in the attack.

Suleman said that they were on their way back home from a furniture shop in Greater Noida when a large group of people stopped them at Gokalpuri Chowk. “The people shouted ‘Stop this mullah’, and they ran towards us. They had assumed that we were Muslims from my father’s beard. They attacked us with iron rods and sticks. They also torched our motorcycle,” said Suleman.

“Before I lost consciousness due to being beaten mercilessly, I saw my father was being thrashed by a large group. Our two-wheeler was set on fire in the middle of the road. The attackers hit my father on the head with a stone. When I gained consciousness I found myself at GTB Hospital,” the teenager added.

Suleman’s elder brother, Azharuddin, said that he could not trace his father and brother for five days and kept running from pillar to post. “The police refused to tell me anything, claiming they were busy. I checked all nearby hospitals, but in vain. After five days, on Saturday, I ended up identifying my father among other unclaimed bodies,” said Mr. Azharuddin.

He added that he faced difficulties in tracing his father and brother as Yusuf had been admitted as Satya Pal and his brother’s real name was also not used as he was unconcious at the time of admission. “I performed the last rites of my father on Saturday and brought my brother home. Due to severe head injuries, his memory has been affected,” he said.

Suleman, however, recalled that before attacking passers-by, the crowd on the day of the incident was asking for documents that could establish they were Hindus.

“On Tuesday, people had turned into animals. They were killing anyone in the name of religion. They asked us to chant Jai Sri Ram before hitting us with stones and rods,”he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/9ri6m5/article30960838.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2DEMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/53-year-old-lynched-teenaged-son-hurt-in-violence-on-feb-24/article30958818.ece
282,2020/03/02,On Mirza Najaf Khan’s sprawling tomb,"Located in the outskirts of Delhi, this tomb has a rich and engrossing history of the cunning courtier of the Mughals, who was armed with an elaborate spy system

Looking at Mirza Najaf Khan’s massive tomb opposite the Safdarjung airport, one is transported to the times of Nadir Shah, the Persian with piercing eyes, who lay waste Delhi during the reign of Mohammad Shah. Najaf Khan was Nadir’s victim, not in India but in Persia itself, for he belonged to the Safvi dynasty of Iran, which was persecuted by the usurper.

Najaf and his sister were both jailed, but their plight moved Mohammad Shah, who sent his emissary Mirza Mohsin, to affect the release of the two on compassionate grounds.

Perhaps Nadir’s compassion was leavened by the fact that he had already drained the Mughal treasury and carried away its priceless jewels, along with the wealth of Delhi and other Indian cities.

By exchanging turbans with Mohammad Shah, he had come in possession of the ‘Kohinoor’ and by right of conquest he had walked away with the ‘Peacock Throne’. So, setting Najaf and his sister free at the request of his former adversary, was a compensation of sorts.

Najaf, only 13 then, accompanied Mohsin — who had married the former’s sister — , to India and grew up into a brave young man. His exploits in Bengal were such that even the English generals of the East India Company sought his services. Najaf served them well and was rewarded with an annual pension of ₹2 lakhs by no less a person than the first British Governor of the Bengal Presidency, Robert Clive. But this amount was to be paid from the pension granted to Shah Alam; so naturally Najaf attached himself to the emperor, and when the latter moved to Delhi after the Treaty of Allahabad, he became the Wazir at the Mughal court.

Nawab Najaf Khan was an orthodox man who never drank or indulged in passions of the flesh. He was a stern soldier and a clever courtier with a spy system that kept him informed of the goings-on inside the homes of every nobleman of worth. If so-and-so begum refused to kiss her elderly husband on her wedding night, Najaf Khan was duly informed, so that he could make use of this knowledge if the need arose.

But power corrupts, and Najaf slowly became as debauched as any other nobleman of his time, fleeting away his time in the zenana amidst wine, women, and song. He died in 1782, a wreck of a man and was buried in the mausoleum he had planned for himself. The monument now is approached through a dome-less and pillar-less expanse of a compound leading to a barren platform, and vaulted chambers containing his graves as well as his daughter, Fatima’s.

It is a monument that transports one to the Middle East of Ozymandias, though the name of its builder is kept alive on thousands of tongues along the Najafgarh drain that assumes such importance during the monsoon.

And in distant Powys, Wales, Robert Clive’s descendant, the present Lord Clive, still chuckles when he hears Najaf Khan’s name while strolling among the white peacocks, (according to an NRI friend settled close by), the progeny of the ones his ancestor took away from India, along with the hoarded wealth of the Mughals and their satraps.

283,2020/03/02,Change in nomenclature of Rythu Samanvaya Samithis,"To be renamed Rythu Bandhu Samithis soon

Working president of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) K.T. Rama Rao has stated that the Rythu Samanvaya Samithis would be renamed as Rythu Bandhu Samithis soon.

Speaking to the newly-elected chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of District Cooperative Central Banks (DCCBs) and District Cooperative Marketing Societies (DCMSs) at Telangana Bhavan party headquarters here on Monday, he reiterated that the farm loan waiver promised before the Assembly elections would be implemented soon and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has already instructed the officials concerned to initiate the process for its implementation.

He stated that the Chief Minister has decided to keep the promise made to the farming community irrespective of the financial constraints being faced by the government due to the economic slowdown caused by the Centre’s irrational decisions.

Thanking people for strengthening the TRS by ensuring huge victory to the party in the recent elections held to DCCBs and DCMSs, Mr. Rama Rao suggested the governing bodies of the two cooperative institutions linked to farmers to take pro-farmer measures being implemented by the State government on a large-scale into the farming communities.

The governing bodies must work for mobilising the farming community by being with them at all times and ensure their welfare, Mr. Rao said.

With abundant faith in TRS, the farming community had ensured victory to the party in over 94% of the 906 Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACSs) in the State, elections to which were held recently.

The Minister stated that the Chief Minister was able to take a slew of farmer-welfare measures such as irrigation projects, Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima and others since he was a farmer too.

The TRS working president noted that even the vociferous critics of the Chief Minister acknowledge the benefits of Kaleshwaram project even before its completion.

Stating that 48% of the chairpersons and vice-chairpersons elected to DCCBs and DCMSs are from the SC, ST, BC and minority communities, Mr. Rama Rao said it was ensured at the behest of the Chief Minister to empower those communities as part of the party’s commitment to social justice, although there is no provision for such quota in the elections to the two cooperative institutions.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/change-in-nomenclature-of-rythu-samanvaya-samithis/article30966340.ece

285,2020/03/02,"Congress leader spreading falsehood, allege TRS leaders","‘Land on KTR wife’s name is 8 km away from the farmhouse’

Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) has refuted the allegations of land encroachment made against the party’s working president K.T. Rama Rao by Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy and said there is no link to the farmhouse cited by the Congress leader and the land owned by Mr. Rao’s family.

Addressing a press conference, party legislators led by Government Whip Balka Suman, Shambhipur Raju, M. Srinivas Reddy and N. Laxman Rao and TRS secretary Gattu Ramachandra Rao here on Monday alleged that Mr. Revanth Reddy is trying to mislead people to cover up his encroachment of dalit’s land at Gopanpally village in the Cyberabad area.

Stating that Mr. Revanth Reddy is known for his blackmail politics all along his political career, the TRS leaders said he is resorting to mudslinging on Mr. Rama Rao by trying to sell misinformation. They said the extent of land cited by Mr. Revanth Reddy is in the public domain as Mr. Rama Rao had showed it in his election affidavit in 2014 itself. Mr. Rama Rao would keep visiting 8.09 acres land cited by Mr. Reddy and they (TRS leaders) too had visited it several times.

However, the said land had nothing to with the farmhouse showed by Mr. Revanth Reddy, they said adding that it was taken on lease by Mr. Rama Rao’s family four years ago.

They demanded an unconditional apology from Mr. Reddy for resorting to mudslinging on the TRS working president.

The TRS leaders said the dramas being enacted by Mr. Revanth Reddy would be a futile effort to defame Mr. Rama Rao and the TRS government -- stating that people would not buy such cheap tactics being executed by the Congress leader to cover up his land encroachments. Further, they observed that Mr. Reddy had taken up ‘Patnam Gosa’ programme unable to forget his electoral defeat at the hands of Patnam Narender Reddy at Kodangal.

286,2020/03/02,Plans afoot to procure rabi paddy from April 1,"About 77 lakh tonnes paddy production estimated for rabi

The State Government is preparing an action plan to procure over 77 lakh tonnes of paddy to be produced this rabi (yasangi) season, procurement of which is likely to begin from April 1.

A Cabinet Sub-Committee meeting on the paddy procurement during the rabi season was conducted here on Monday by Ministers S. Niranjan Reddy (Agriculture), G. Kamalakar (Civil Supplies) and E. Rajender (Medical and Health) and Chairman of the Civil Supplies Corporation M. Srinivas Reddy besides officials of the Agriculture, Civil Supplies and Marketing Departments.

The ministers instructed the officials concerned to focus on setting up procurement centres, gunny bags, arrangement of storage space, transport from procurement centres to godowns, weighing machines and others. When the ministers pointed out that there were large-scale complaints on the quality of paddy procured during the kharif season, officials explained that it was due to movement of produce directly from fields to the procurement centres immediately after harvesting through machines.

They told the Marketing Department officials to measure the moisture content measuring instruments, paddy cleaners, winnowing machines, tarpaulin sheets and other necessary material at all the procurement centres to overcome the quality problems faced during the kharif procurement. They could be procured by availing the market fee being paid by the Civil Supplies Corporation for paddy procrement.

Stating that the production of paddy during the rabi season was estimated to be about 77.73 lakh tonnes, the ministers said the extent of paddy cultivation had gone up sharply this season due to the pro-farmers measures taken up by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao including availability of water for irrigation through Kaleshwaram project. The ministers said the Civil Supplies Department had procured 37 lakh tonnes of paddy during the last rabi season.

On the storage space required for the procured paddy, the minister suggested the Civil Supplies officials to coordinate with State Warehousing Corporation, Central Warehousing Corporation, Food Corporation of India and Marketing Department and also to bring into use the unused (empty) godowns. The meeting also discussed about the additional milling charges being demanded by the Rice Millers Association.

Further, the ministers wanted the officials to check arrival of paddy stocks from the neighbouring States such as Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh since the procurement of paddy at the minimum support price was limited there.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/4qnyjq/article30966316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy02Eetala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/plans-afoot-to-procure-rabi-paddy-from-april-1/article30966317.ece
287,2020/03/02,Citizens fret over online property tax assessment,"Collection stands at 62% for residential properties and 15% from govt. properties

‘Pattana Pragathi’ apart, there is a scurry of activity in the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) — municipal corporations and municipalities across Telangana with less than a month left for the property tax to be collected for the current financial year of 2019-20.

Director of Municipal Administration N. Satyanarayana has reminded the municipal commissioners and others concerned that the property tax collection has been just 62% for residential properties or ₹416 crore of ₹672 crore expected and just ₹15 crore of ₹172 crore — 15% only from government properties. The DMA has sought 100 % collection as property tax forms the main revenue source for municipal bodies. He pressed for encouraging self-assessment of property tax instead of depending on bill collectors. However, several citizens have not yet either received the property tax notices or the online dashboard does not reflect their properties to make the payments online.

It is not all. The Government had merged about 175 gram panchayats into adjoining municipal bodies and 64 new municipalities were formed taking ULBs to 142. Yet, the seamless integration of records does not seem to have happened because some property records of the erstwhile villages are not showing up on the property tax database.

“We paid the property tax to the gram panchayat last year and submitted all the relevant documents. As there was just one bill collector and he was inundated with several cases, we were told the property tax number will be communicated later but it has not happened. Our property is not showing up online now. Ideally, with our name or house number, the demand should be generated even without PT number,” complains Abhishek, a owner.

New growth areas of Rangareddy like Gandipet, Narsingi and environs saw large housing projects coming up with the administrative machinery unable to keep pace leaving huge gaps. In fact, citizens having properties in places like Kokapet are being told to reach out to the gram panchayat office even after it has been merged with Narsingi municipality!

Official figures show more than 46,000 people going for self-assessment of property tax online of which about 41,000 seem to have got it right but there are many who gave up unable to weave through the maze of documents being asked to be uploaded even while struggling to get the server going during the period. “It is painfully slow or at times some of the attributes suddenly vanish,” says Aditi, another owner.

Senior officials, not willing to be identified, pointed out that municipal elections delayed the processes and teething online issues will be sorted out. Meanwhile, the DMA has asked his officials to send red notices to defaulters, identify top 500 of them and form special teams involving all the municipal sections to mop up the collections.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2mo5od/article30966288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03PROPERTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/citizens-fret-over-online-property-tax-assessment/article30966289.ece
288,2020/03/02,NIRD develops IT platform for real-time monitoring of schemes,"To be initially used with regard to a youth employment scheme

National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj (NIRD&PR) has developed an IT platform to make real-time assessment of nationwide programmes.

Called ‘Kaushal Bharat’, it is an ‘Enterprise Resource Planning’ (ERP) platform and will initially be utilised to monitor implementation of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY), a Central youth employment scheme.

Inspection

It is designed to enable States to capture data on projects under DDU-GKY and for the information to be collated in one system, which will enhance data security and data analytics and help generate quality analytical reports and scheme improvement. The Ministry of Rural Development plans to conduct inspections of training centres for all the States using Kaushal Bharat from April 2020.

Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare and Rural Development Narendra Singh Tomar inaugurated the portal during a recent general body meeting of NIRD&PR held in New Delhi.

NIRD&PR had allocated a sum of ₹26.89 crore to private vendors over a period of four years for these services. Developing its own ERP will result in considerable financial savings for NIRD&PR.

Samir Goswami, director (Management Information Systems), DDU-GKY Division, NIRD&PR, said the technical advantages of Kaushal Bharat are that it can accessed by mobile devices, integrated with other MoRD systems and enable avoiding data entry errors from manual data entry.

Free for use

The usage of Kaushal Bharat is free; States do not have to pay any charges. It is designed to facilitate the States to capture the data/information related to projects under the DDU-GKY as prescribed in standard operating procedures. It also includes a separate mobile app to conduct inspections of the projects by CTSA, TSA and State Rural Livelihood Missions, Mr. Goswami said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/66866q/article30966151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY02-UNIONMINISTERFORAGRICULTURENARENDRASINGHTOMARMUMBAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/nird-develops-it-platform-for-real-time-monitoring-of-schemes/article30966140.ece

295,2020/03/02,"Family, friends shocked by Pradeep’s extreme step","He had quit all chat groups prior to ending life with family, say friends

Friends and family members of 36-year-old K. Pradeep Kumar are puzzled and shocked on why he would have resorted to such an extreme act, despite the family’s comfortable financial situation. Apart from that, he had a secure job in IBM-India, a single storey house and open plot in Hastinapuram, but never shared the financial woes with his parents or friends.

“Had he told me about the losses he had incurred wherever he had invested the money, I would have certainly helped him out,” said Pradeep’s inconsolable father K. Yadaiah.

On Saturday, he spoke with him for the last time and all appeared fine. Since then his phone was switched off. “Sunday evening I came to Hyderabad and found that the doors were locked. As the doors had a central locking system, I couldn’t understand if they were locked from inside or outside,” he said, adding that tenants told him that his son and his family went to Karimnagar to attend a wedding.

Strong person

Mr. Yadaiah said that even if his son had hinted to him about the problems, he could have sold the house and plot in the city to clear the debt. “He was very clear about his plans and a strong person,” he recalled with tears rolling from his eyes.

Pradeep’s tenant N. Narsimha, who saw him for the last time said that on Saturday around noon, the former brought his elder son from school. “When I asked if everything was alright, he said they were going to Karimnagar to attend a marriage, so he brought him back from school,” he said.

Exit groups

Meanwhile, Pradeep’s childhood and college friends who came to pay their last respects said that on Saturday evening, he left all WhatsApp chat groups. “I thought he accidentally left the group. As soon as I came to know about his death, I rushed here. He was a joyful person,” said Satish, the victim’s engineering college friend.

Another friend Ravi Kumar said that it was only in October or November when Pradeep threw a party for his friends on the occasion of his younger son’s first birthday.

A software engineer, his wife, and their two sons, including a toddler were found dead at their residence in Hastinapuram, an eastern suburb of the city on Monday morning.

LB Nagar police of Rachakonda Commissionerate said the couple allegedly administered poison to their five-year-old and one-and-half year sons, before taking the extreme step.

Debt-driven death

Preliminary investigation by police revealed that K. Pradeep (36) had incurred heavy debt and decided to end his life. He was working in a senior position in IBM-India, while his wife Swati (31), was a homemaker.

According to police, the incident took place on Saturday night and came to light only on Monday morning when their parents and police broke open the door and found the quartet in a shocking state.

When Pradeep’s father K. Yadaiah was unable to contact him over the phone, he rushed to Hyderabad from Neredugama near Devarakonda in Mahabubnagar on Sunday evening. Around 3 am, he, along with other relatives went to LB Nagar Police Station. A police team then broke the windowpane of Mr. Pradeeep’s house and saw the family of four lying unconscious. They forcibly opened the doors and found the decomposing bodies, police said.

Suspected poisoning

“We suspect that the couple poisoned their children by mixing it in their food, before ending their own lives,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) P.Yadagiri told The Hindu.

He said Pradeep took ₹ 20 lakh as home loan, and over ₹ 40 lakh as personal and gold loan from various financial institutions, including Indian Bank, and was unable to pay the monthly instalment.

298,2020/03/02,TS police to give safety tips on IVRS,"Initiative being tested for past few weeks

With rise in the number of cyber crimes and crime against women, the Telangana police have decided to launch an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) through which they can connect with citizens asking them to be vigilant.

The unique initiative, which is set for launch in a few days, is being tested at the State police headquarters for the last few weeks.

Raising awareness

Speaking to The Hindu, a senior officer said that they had decided to create awareness among people on various social issues concerning women, children, road and cyber safety.

With the help of latest technology, police would be able to contact 2 lakh mobile phone users per day in the State. “We have a database of at least 5 lakh mobile users, and the number will increase every passing day,” he said.

The database was created with contacts of petitioners approaching various police stations across the State, Dial 100, community policing and interface with the general public.

“With successfully completing the trial run a day ago, the project is set to launch any time this week,” he said.

Safety rules

For instance, the machine-generated calls will ask the citizens to follow traffic rules to avoid road accidents, Dial 100 in case of emergency and never share the bank card details or one-time password with strangers.

“Each time, the call will be made regarding different topics,” the officer said.

299,2020/03/02,Suburban train service dwindles to a trickle,"Officials claim DEMU services truncated due to poor patronage, citizens question low frequency

If the ongoing ‘tussle’ between South Central Railway (SCR) and State government over release of funds for completing multi-modal transport system (MMTS) Phase II works was again highlighted during the recent visit of Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, the ‘other’ suburban services run by the railways are being quietly withdrawn.

SCR also runs a suburban rail system through DEMUs or Diesel Electric Multiple Units, from Secunderabad railway station to connect to Bolarum (14 km), Medchal (28 km) and Manoharabad (41 km) for decades. However, over the past few years, the services are being curtailed gradually and six months ago, they were reduced to just nine a day with no service at all on Fridays!

‘Trains shifted’

“Services have been truncated because there is poor patronage with not even 200 passengers using it. We have shifted trains to other sections,” disclose senior railway officials, pleading anonymity.

In the past six months, a single train is going from Secunderabad and returning touching up to Manoharabad “without proper timings”. It is of no use to anyone “save for vagabonds and beggars”, allege citizens living from across these stations.

Suburban train services on Bolarum-Secunderabad-Falaknuma sections can be traced back to Nizam Railways and on the metre gauge. It also saw steam engines and diesel engines along with conversion into broad gauge when the reduction of trains began from 45 to 26 to 13, nine and now one. The fall in passenger traffic is even more dramatic — from 10,000 a day to 5,000 and now just 200!

Highs and lows

It is a mystery why MMTS Phase I between Falaknuma-Secunderabad-Hyderabad-Lingampally, despite irregular schedules, carries upto 1.70 lakh passengers a day, but there are no takers for these services when roads to and from these stations towards the central parts of the twin cities are choked with traffic during peak hours.

“We have not done any analysis about the reasons for the low patronage,” confess senior railway officials. “There are no trains during peak morning or evening hours, and erratic timings make regular students, employees and petty businessmen hit the road,” claims Noor Ahmed Ali, general secretary, Suburban Train and Bus Travellers’ Association.

Now, a single service starts from Secunderabad station towards Manoharabad via Bolarun and Medchal at 6.20 a.m., towards Medchal only at 10.31 a.m. and 4.55 p.m. and towards Bolarum only at 8.55 p.m. Towards Secunderabad station, the service is available at 9.56 a.m., 12.26 p.m., 3.56 p.m. and 8.15 p.m.

Grievance unheard

Passengers from Medchal, Bolarum and Malakjgiri wanted to meet SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya during his recent inspection tour of the section to represent their woes. However, as he got delayed in other inspections, his special train sped past them at the stations, much to their disappointment.

The only hope for these passengers, as per the railway officials’ contention, is praying for speedy completion of MMTS Phase II as doubling, electrification and even stations works are in various stages of construction on this suburban railway route.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/y4ulp7/article30958869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY01-SUBURBANSERVICES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/suburban-train-service-dwindles-to-a-trickle/article30958852.ece

The plans of students of the English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) to join a rally at Moazzamjahi Market in protest against CAA and NRC on Sunday was aborted after the university gates were locked by the security.

All the three gates of the university were locked ensuring that none from the university stepped out. However, those coming into the university were allowed.

With news reaching the police of the reported plans of a group of students trying to take out a rally to attend the anti-CAA programme, they camped outside the gates. Students entered into an argument with the police for not allowing them to go outside but the police maintained that they were waiting outside the campus and would take action only if the students crossed the university gates.

According to the police, it was the private security of the university that locked the gates. “We are waiting outside the campus to prevent them from taking out a rally. It has no police permission,” said Joint Commissioner of Police (East) M. Ramesh. He said that police had never interfered in student politics.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/l45ji3/article30958893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy01EFLU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/eflu-students-bid-to-join-anti-caa-rally-foiled/article30958829.ece
302,2020/03/02,"Delhi riots: retired IPS officer calls for introspection, reforms","Violence in national capital, police action take centre stage at ISB conclave

Various aspects of the communal clashes in Delhi came into sharp focus at a session on ‘Civil Service Reforms (police) Needed in the 21st Century’ at the Indian School of Business (ISB) Policy Conclave, ‘Ideas for India: 2020 & Beyond’, on Sunday.

Delivering initial remarks, retired IPS officer Meeran Chadha Borwankar said the riots have necessitated an urgent need for introspection and reforms. When politicians and criminals are aware that cases can be withdrawn or that witnesses will not come forward, the riots will recur, she pointed out. “We are terrified that most of the killings in Delhi riots is through illegal weapons. Because they know that cases can be withdrawn tomorrow,” she added.

‘Act as per conscience’

During a discussion on how police manages personal dilemma during riots and similar situations, Madhya Pradesh Additional DGP Manish S. Sharma said that more often than not, they act according to their conscience and keep in mind the fact that they need to follow orders within the parameters of conscience to ensure peace.

“Every police officer wants to peacefully solve a law and order agitation or any kind of issue that he is faced with,” Mr Sharma said, adding a disclaimer that it was his personal opinion and in no way reflect views of the government.

Talking about delayed police action in the Delhi clashes, Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar said how quickly senior officers reach the spot, take command and motivate their own people to take firm action immediately in the first hour are important factors to control a riot.

‘First hour important’

Clarifying that he does not represent Delhi police or is associated with the situation, he said, “If in the first hour, police were very firm in action and harsh on those who took law into their hands, then definitely things would have been different”. He then added that his knowledge of the riots was through newspaper reports.

Prior to this, panel discussions were held on subjects like ‘Youth in Politics - How to motivate youth to contest elections’,‘Sustainable policy-making for the country’s growth’, ‘Responsible media, film making and censorship policies’.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/1ewfew/article30958835.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY01-ISB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/delhi-riots-retired-ips-officer-calls-for-introspection-reforms/article30958822.ece
303,2020/03/02,Applications to EFLU see 265% rise in 3 years,"The English and Foreign Languages University (EFLU) has seen a tremendous growth in terms of applications over the past few years. This year, 15,168 applications have been received.

EFLU Vice-Chancellor E. Suresh Kumar said that in 2016-17, the number of applications for admission into various undergraduate, postgraduate, teacher education courses and doctoral programmes stood at a mere 5,739 and this is a leap of about 265%.

Interestingly, female applicants have outnumbered males. Of the 15,168 applications received, 9,532 are from female aspirants. Two transgenders are also testing their luck.

Mr. Kumar said EFLU is perhaps one of the first Central universities to adopt online entrance tests and this year, online tests were conducted from February 29 to March 1 for admission into 34 courses post-graduation, doctoral programmes and teacher training courses.

Online entrance exams for admission to undergraduate courses will start from April 12 and the total number of applicants stands at 3,345.

305,2020/03/02,Revanth demands release of 2BHK funds,"Central funds are being diverted, alleges Congress leader

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) working president and Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy wanted the government to allocate funds in the budget for the double bedroom houses (2BHKs), and release them by March. Senior IAS officers should be entrusted with the responsibility of the 2BHK work, he said.

At a press conference here, he said contractors have stopped construction work as the government failed to release funds. If the government fails to construct and handover houses to the beneficiaries, protest programmes would be held near all the Collectorates by women who have applied for the houses, he said.

He alleged that not a single new 2BHK house has been given to the beneficiaries and all the houses given in the GHMC area by the present government were constructed by the earlier Congress government.

Even the few houses that have been completed are locked as the officials are waiting them to be inaugurated by IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao. “Why isn’t Mr. Rao inaugurating them? If he can’t spare time, the Housing Minister should should immediately handover the keys to the beneficiaries so that they can save ₹ 5,000 rent per month, he said.

He said Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had lured voters with 2BHK scheme across the State but on the ground, work is moving at a snail’s pace. “If I ask the same, TRS leaders target me personally, but I will continue to raise the issue in the Parliament and in the State,” he said.

In Telangana, 26 lakh applicants are waiting for houses, of which 10 lakh are in the GHMC areas, including 6 lakhs in Malkajgiri constituency, he said. He said if earlier CMs like N.T. Rama Rao, Chandrababu Naidu and Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy had promised anything in public, the GOs were issued on the same day. However, the present Chief Minister does not keep his words. In fact, funds from NABARD, meant for housing scheme, and Central funds for the same, have also been diverted, he alleged.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/3f46kx/article30946140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY29AREVANTHREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/revanth-demands-release-of-2bhk-funds/article30958769.ece
306,2020/03/02,"Owaisi terms Delhi violence, a pogrom","AIMIM celebrates 62nd Foundation Day

All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday described the violence in Delhi as ‘pogrom’ and ‘genocide’ and alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had remained silent on the issue.

Mr. Owaisi was speaking on the occasion of the party’s 62nd Foundation Day in Darussalaam headquarters.

“The Delhi violence is a pogrom, a genocide. It was planned and there was an environment of hate created,” Mr Owaisi said.

Mr Owaisi questioned the Prime Minister’s silence on the issue and alleged that the violence was unleashed in Delhi due to a certain mindset which was fuelled by incendiary speeches of Bharatiya Janata Party leaders. He added that he respects the chair of the Prime Minister, but not the person, even as he blamed the Centre for failing to put an end the violence.

“The Delhi riot responsibility lies at the doorstep of the BJP government,” he said. Mr. Owaisi listed names of victims from both the majority and minority communities who lost their lives in the violence. He also spoke about incidents in which members of the two communities protected each other from during the riots. Launching a salvo at the Prime Minister, he said, “I want to ask the Prime Minister, such a big riot broke out and you did not open you mouth,” adding that Mr. Modi spoke on two occasions after the violence but did not speak about the Delhi violence.

Touching upon the peace agreement between Taliban and the USA, Mr Owaisi said that it was in 2016 in Parliament that he told the Centre to ‘open a door of discussion’ with the with the Islamist organisation.

He raised concerns over the Pakistani army’s next move, post the signing of this agreement. “Because of the problem in Afghanistan, Pakistani army was on the Afghan-Pakisatan border. After this agreement, where will this army go?” he asked as he pointed out that the Taliban was given Home and External Affairs Ministry in Afghanistan.

307,2020/03/02,Online presence holds the key,"A few IPS officers have hired social media managers

A few IPS officers in the State have moved to the next level in maintaining a healthy public relations profile. For the first time, social media managers are ‘hired’ to maintain their online interactive accounts like Facebook, Twitter and even Instagram (both -- official and personal).

With social media having emerged as a powerful tool in the hands of the people to disseminate information on social issues, the officers are striving hard to keep themselves abreast of the emerging situations.

This in turn enhances their online presence as also putting people in direct touch with the officials concerned.

The main objective of the social media managers is troubleshooting and whenever the police are in the eye of adverse situations, the team plunges into action with their damage control posts, which go viral on the internet.

It was nearly two decades ago when the unit officers in the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh were provided with PROs to liaison with media personnel. However, the new initiative adopted by the police officers takes interface with public to the next level.

Ministers dispel apprehensions

A few thousand people feasted ‘free’ at the chicken and egg mela at People’s Plaza on Necklace Road during an event got up by four organisations to dispel apprehensions about chicken consumption as a source of coronavirus.

Leading the mass consumption were Ministers K.T. Rama Rao, Eatala Rajender, T. Srinivas Yadav and a poultry industrialist-turned-MP Ranjit Reddy. The crowd was served dry chicken items and eggs as snacks.

Nevertheless, the event exposed interesting eating habits of VVIPs. Mr. Rama Rao informed that his entire family, including his father and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, have been eating chicken and they never faced health problems.

For that matter, not a single individual in the State had any problem.

About 6,200 kgs of dry items of chicken and 22,000 eggs were served free on the occasion.

‘Maintain human relations’

Municipal Administration Minister K.T. Rama Rao is making strong pitch for human relations between households and sanitation staff deployed on duties in the respective areas.

The Minister, who participated in Pattana Pragati recently, exhorted the sanitation staff to keep in touch with the households in the areas allotted to them, and the residents too should reciprocate. This on the one hand builds up strong human relations between the two and ensures that the staff attend to their duties without fail. A good relation between the staff and residents will ensure that the former own up responsibility of the areas assigned to them while the latter can be in direct touch with the staff of their respective area over telephone as was demonstrated by Parichayam, an initiative introduced in Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation.

308,2020/03/02,Will Telangana budget have provision for airport at Adilabad?,"CMO has sought details of an old land survey from the district administration

The State budget for the year 2020-21 may include allocation for establishment of an airport in Adilabad, and perhaps Kothagudem, if the timing of information sought by the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) is anything to go by. The latter has asked the Adilabad district administration to furnish details of an over-five-year-old survey which had identified nearly 1,600 acres of land contiguous with the 369 acres extent of old aerodrome (controlled by the Indian Air Force) for acquisition to establish a full-fledged Air Force Station here.

Officials opined that it could be a routine inquiry to check if the status of the identified has remained same during the period or if there are any encroachments. Others, however, point out that the keenness of the State government in establishing airports in rural areas, the feasibility in doing so at Adilabad and Kothagudem as assessed by the Airport Authority of India and the timing of the query, which is just before finalisation of the Budget proposals, make it amply clear that the initiative could soon see the light of the day.

The query may even relate to acquisition of land for establishment of the AFS as originally proposed.

“No, there is less likelihood of this happening given the lukewarm response of the State government to that proposal,” asserted an official as he recalled the government remaining non-committal so far.

In August last year, a team of the Airports Authority of India had visited the area in question which falls under the limits of Khanapur, Anukunta, Ankoli and Thantoli villages on the outskirts of Adilabad town. AAI Assistant General Manager, Neeraj Gupta had told The Hindu then that feasibility for operating ATR type aircraft was being studied making a provision for expansion of the facility in future if need arose.

The AAI had inspected the 369 acres of aerodrome land as part of its feasibility survey in addition to identifying about 50 acres of land for extension of existing length of runway in the old facility if the IAF permits use of its property.

The State government was also toying with the idea of acquiring 450 acres of the identified 1,600 acres of land for the purpose of constructing an air strip if the IAF does not allow it to use the aerodrome, according to sources.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/g0hx74/article30958711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY02AERODROM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/will-budget-have-provision-for-airport-at-adilabad/article30958712.ece
309,2020/03/02,‘Take up delimitation exercise’,"Telangana State Legislative Council Chairman Gutha Sukender Reddy on Sunday demanded the BJP government at the Centre to take up delimitation exercise in Telangana, besides Jammu and Kashmir.

The senior leader, speaking to reporters at his camp office here, said the Central government, as per the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014, which bifurcated Telangana and AP., should also readjust boundaries of Assembly constituencies in both the Telugu States.

“The Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy’s views on APRA, 2014 that ‘it was passed in the night, and the provision of delimitation was also added to the Act in the night,’ are ridiculing in nature,” he said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s similar views on Telangana creation in Rajya Sabha last month, he recalled, also amount to mockery, he said.

Mr. Sukender Reddy said it is “an unfortunate situation that the BJP government is disrespecting the Legislature, which passed the APRA, 2014.”

Although the legislation was passed under the then UPA government, with the support of the BJP, implementing the Act, and taking up delimitation in the Telugu States, remains the duty of the Central government now, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/take-up-delimitation-exercise/article30958650.ece
310,2020/03/02,Call for automatic signal system in Ernakulam-Shoranur rail corridor,"‘It will enable operation of more trains through the existing double tracks’

Even as Southern Railway is keen to hew out a third track in the Ernakulam-Shoranur corridor, demand is rife that automatic signalling be introduced as an interim measure to augment capacity in the busy corridor.

“Automatic signalling will enable operation of more than double the existing number of trains through the existing double tracks. The cost will be just ₹500 crore at the rate of less than ₹5 crore per km. This is equivalent to the cost of constructing a 2-km-long metro rail corridor, where each km entails a cost of ₹250 crore,” a senior Railway official said.

This is absolutely necessary in the Ernakulam-Shoranur corridor, which has to cater to trains which converge at Ernakulam from both Kottayam and Alappuzha. As per the existing conventional signal system, a train has to reach the next station in order for a subsequent train to use the track. On the contrary, a second train can operate along the same track, once a train that preceded it has covered a distance of a kilometre or so. Trains can operate leaving a distance of two km between them, even presuming that this is theory and a little far fetched to attain in Kerala’s undulating terrain which has many curves, he added.

Yet another official spoke of how the Signalling and Telecommunication Wing of the Railway can easily introduce automatic signalling in the corridor without disturbing the existing network of tracks. “All that is needed is new cabling along the stretch to modify the signalling system. The top speed in the corridor will continue to be 80 kmph even after introduction of automatic signalling, unless curves and gradients become less steep.”

Third track

Augmentation of tracks by laying a third and fourth track is a long-term alternative aimed at increasing speed and introducing new trains. This was done in Chennai where automatic signalling was introduced in three double-track stretches from the city. The third and fourth tracks were laid later in three directions, up to a distance of 60 km from the city. Their capacity too was augmented through introducing automatic signalling.

In Kerala, the main challenge to laying new tracks is land acquisition. There are approximately 50 plots of land (most of which have houses or other buildings) in every kilometre of track in places like Kottayam. Thus, land acquisition, which began over 15 years ago for laying a second track through the district, is scheduled for completion only by December 2021.

In Alappuzha, only doubling of Ambalapuzha-Harippad track will be realised this year. Doubling of the balance 70 km of track has been kept in abeyance due to what the Railway terms as “funds paucity”. This includes the Kumbalam-Ernakulam stretch where the Railway has demanded that the State government bear half the cost of doubling, due to high cost of land acquisition.

Responding to this, a Railway official said that doubling a kilometre of track requires approximately ₹35 crore. This works out to a total of ₹2,500 crore. Thus, doubling through Alappuzha can be easily realised if the Railway and State government set apart ₹1,250 crore each over a two or three-year period, he said.

The amount is a pittance as compared to the over ₹65,000 crore semi-high-speed rail corridor project that the State intends to build, linking Thiruvananthapuram with Kasaragod. Railway commuters in Alappuzha will still be denied the benefits of the project, since it will pass through Kottayam, the official added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ean0lq/article26166242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRAINTRACK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/call-for-automatic-signalling-in-ernakulam-shoranur-rail-corridor/article30965430.ece

The young people should give importance to acquiring skills and knowledge in keeping with the changes on the job scene on a global basis. The Department of Labour has been focusing on providing skills training based on these requirements.

The language training centre has been launched by the Overseas Development and Employment Promotion Consultancy (ODEPC) in association with the Kerala Academy for Skills Excellence. It will provide language training to those seeking employment abroad. In the first phase, the centre will provide training for those taking tests like IELTS and OET. At a later stage, the centre will also provide coaching in languages like Japanese and German.

ODEPC language training centres are operational now in Thiruvananthapuram and Delhi. Steps are being taken to establish a training centre in Kozhikode. The government is planning to expand the operations of ODEPC to more areas in the near future, said the Minister.

Language training, education and teacher training, nursing, oil and rig, security services, welding, water technology, hospitality and tourism, sports research, financial services and marketing, and designing and construction are some of the areas in which training is being imparted through the government agency.

315,2020/03/02,Long-delayed projects at Brahmapuram in focus,"Corpon. convenes urgent meeting to discuss issues at yard

After the recent fire at the Brahmapuram dumping yard, the Kochi Corporation has convened an urgent meeting on Tuesday to take long-delayed decisions on waste management at the yard. The State Level Monitoring Committee on Solid Waste Management and the Fire and Rescue Services Department had recently pointed out issues at the yard that have led to recurrent fires.

Decisions on setting up a leachate treatment plant and construction of roads within the yard to improve access, particularly in the case of fires, are likely to be taken on Tuesday.

The civic body will also discuss the setting up of fire hydrants at the site at a cost of ₹19 lakh.

To supply water to fire engines, a pond along with surrounding roads to enable vehicular access is likely to be set up at a cost of around ₹21 lakh.

“The trommels, which function as a sort of filter, are in particularly bad shape and must either be replaced or shifted to a new location,” said V.P. Chandran, member of the Health Standing Committee. A proposal to move the trommels to a new shed at a cost of ₹2 crore will be discussed at the meeting.

Legacy waste

“A solution would also have to be found to the mounting pile of legacy waste which has been catching fire with increasing temperatures in the summer,” he said.

The council had, last month, refused to approve the proposal to biomine the legacy waste, when opposition leaders said that the figure quoted by the contractor, of ₹597 per metre cube of waste, was too high a liability for the corporation to bear considering the large volumes of waste.

“Dealing with legacy waste alone could amount to ₹16 crore. Considering the financial burden, the decisions on Brahmapuram could not be taken without detailed discussions,” said opposition leader K.J. Antony who had repeatedly requested a special meeting on the yard.

Funds for the various projects at the site were likely to be drawn from the corporation’s own fund, Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar said.

“All these issues will have to be dealt with simultaneously and on priority to resolve the problems at the yard. Ruling and opposition councillors would have to stand together to get the proposals passed quickly,” said Mayor Soumini Jain, on some of the decisions remaining pending for months.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/long-delayed-projects-at-brahmapuram-in-focus/article30958857.ece

The State government provided 3.97 hectares at Kakkanad for the press.

The Society is at the centre of the public school education system in the State, fully backed by the State government by providing textbooks. The printing and distribution of texts, which had turned into a major challenge in the past, has been squarely met. The Chief Minister said that the years when students waited long for textbooks was a thing of the past, thanks to the efforts of KBPS.

318,2020/03/02,Lack of enforcement renders Operation Pure Water ineffective,"Tankers still drawing water from other sources despite availability of KWA hydrants

Operation Pure Water, a drive to provide clean drinking water to all, is on the track to be a non-starter with the district authorities failing to monitor its implementation.

The offtake of water by tankers from the facilities of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) dipped drastically in February despite the fact that the KWA had erected 42 hydrants at its treatment plants and pumping houses across the district.

Enough KWA hydrants

Water tanker operators had complained before the Assembly Committee on Petitions led by K.B. Ganesh Kumar, MLA, about the lack of enough number of KWA hydrants to draw water. However, even after the KWA set up 15 hydrants at its treatment plant at Aluva, tanker operators are allegedly drawing water from other sources.

This is despite the fact that the KWA now has hydrants that can fill a large water tanker in about 15 to 20 minutes. Senior KWA officials told The Hindu that a single hydrant could fill at least three large tankers of 25,000 litres in an hour.

The District Collector had been asked by the committee to monitor the implementation of the drive.

In January, the total offtake from the Aluva plant was 2,35,23,000 litres that provided KWA a revenue of ₹14,11,380. However, in February, the total offtake was only 48,03,000 litres.

The quantity of water sold to water tankers from the Aluva plant in February was equivalent to the offtake of water in a single day in January during the initial days of Operation Pure Water when more hydrants were set up.

It is learnt that the Assembly Committee on Petitions has sought a report from the District Collector on the status of Operation Pure Water to be presented in a meeting to be held in Thiruvananthapuram soon.

There are allegations that most of the wells from where tankers now draw water are contaminated or are disproportionately chlorinated and there is no monitoring of potable water distribution in the district.

According to KWA officials, tankers providing raw water are painted differently from drinking water tankers. But, there are only a few operators taking raw water as it gives them only a meagre profit.

‘Flawed concept’

A district administration official told The Hindu that Operation Pure Water was a flawed concept as it had given rise to water crisis when it was implemented.

Infopark faced water shortage as tankers could not provide enough water for daily functioning, the official said.

Malls, hospitals and other establishments that have water treatment facilities should be allowed to choose their source of water, the official said.

KWA water should be used only for drinking purposes and should not be provided for bathrooms and toilet use, the official added.

Those who depend on private water tankers could raise complaints over bad quality of water, the official pointed out.

The Food Safety Commissioner had come out with regulations on usage of quality water across the State. So, any other order in this regard was invalid, the official said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/lack-of-enforcement-renders-operation-pure-water-ineffective/article30958836.ece
319,2020/03/02,Designer Ganesh Nallari talks about his latest collection to be showcased at Bangalore Fashion Week,"Designer Ganesh Nallari talks about Madhyamaka, the collection he will showcase at the Bangalore Fashion Week

Hyderabad-based designer Ganesh Nallari will be showcasing his exclusive collection ‘Madhyamaka’ at the Bangalore Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2020. Speaking about the collection, Ganesh says, “The state of centrism (madhyamaka), free from all extremes brings together the creation as one. So I have let colours convey a sense of confidence with ease, a personalised self-expression of restorative harmony. The fabrics and colours infuse heritage and tradition with a colourful youthful update.”

Ganesh created Madhyamka from a random sketch he made in the year 2000. It was a sketch of a man and woman in one body. “The duality only reflected on the face of the sketch. It was a sketch and I didn’t attend to it at that time. Also that was the time when sexuality wasn’t a topic to be discussed. As I explored my sexuality and understood my emotions better, I realised there is a man in every woman and a woman in man. So, that is how I can say the sketch was the core of Madhyamaka,” explains Ganesh.

Talking about the fabrics used, Ganesh says he made use of Banaras Kora (Organza) tissue, linens, ajrakh prints on mashru and modal silk, cottons, lace, nets, chiffons and georgettes.

“Surface techniques include ruffles, fringes, pleats, cutwork, applique, zardozi and machine embroideries. The colour palette is as varied as one can imagine. I have not restricted myself to one tone for this collection. I chose shades like scarlet, saffron, classic blue, Biscay green, chive, faded denim, orange peel, mosaic blue, sunlight, coral pink. Also let cinnamon stick and grape compote take some unique twists and turns to create energising and optimistic pairings. Displaying an element of natural sophistication and versatility, this season’s core hues lark, navy, brilliant white, ash, silver and gold serve as a foundation for playful colour contrasts.” Ganesh also says he translated his emotions into a creation. In some ways, “The creation is a state of my mind. I believe I’m a story teller — as a designer, painter, dancer and an actor. And I have Akkai Padmashali (Indian transgender activist, motivational speaker, and singer) as my showstopper for Madhyamaka. I couldn’t have asked for a more powerful, strong and inspiring person to be a part of my story.”

320,2020/03/02,This Australian expert explains bandhini’s influence on kimonos,"Australia-born Caroline Sato kimonos brings her knowledge to Chennai, and explains bandhini’s influence on the Japanese garment

Caroline Sato is in awe of Chennai and its people. “I like the community life here, and the humane approach of people. I feel connected with them. As I studied fashion design, I find the diverse range of textiles and the extraordinary workmanship impressive,” says Caroline, who lives in the city with her Japanese husband and three children.

Caroline who was pursuing her course at the The Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, visited Japan in 1999 to research the fashion scenario there.

She ended up getting a lot of interesting information on the Shibori art, a Japanese manual resist dyeing technique that was predominantly used on fabrics used for making kimonos, specialising in kimono fashions for her post-graduation degree.

“Modern lifestyle changes have resulted in a shift in the way we dress. For example, the use of washing machines has a remarkable influence on the fabric we choose or the kind of outfits we wear. This is a universal trend: traditional wear used to be restricted just for special occasions, and it affected the weavers. This applies to both Japan and to India,” Caroline says. Through decades of revival, silk shibori gained prominence, and this resulted in an economic boom during the 1970s and 1980s, she says. Interestingly, she also says that shibori technique travelled to Japan from India.

“Bandhini, a tie dye technique that is an essentially Indian textile art, had travelled all the way to Japan. The Japanese infused their design sensibilities to this art and innovated, making it unique.

Aesthetics and highlights Caroline’s exhibition features a range of Shibori techniques found in a wide range of kimono forms, including some masterpieces curated from various sources

One of them, known as Harumi Matsushita’s mother’s kimono, is a masterpiece and heirloom designed by famous designer Takitai

from Tokamachi. The technique used is the very rare Oborozome-kasane shibori. It will be displayed just for a day, on March 8

One such example would be the ancient art of Tsujigahana shibori on kimono, but sadly this is found only in museums today.” The extravagant floral patterns of Tsujigahana were rather more picturesque and eye-catching than other ordinary kinds of kimono.

During her time in Japan, Caroline says she understood that the people’s support is what keeps the shibori kimono relevant. “How it evolved in styling and in aesthetics was the focus area of my research. Yukata, a casual version of the silk kimono, is now popular in Japan. Made of cotton, this is easily wearable and suited for summer,” says Caroline, adding that she now has a kimono collection of her own.

Inspired by her experience in Japan, Caroline travelled across Southeast Asia on a textile trail, visiting India a few years ago. She will be sharing this knowledge at a talk organised at DakshinaChitra.

“Apart from sharing my knowledge on kimono, I am also interested in listening to the experiences of other designers and textile connoisseurs: how they view the design innovation and evolution in Indian context in the fashion industry,” she says.

She has curated a two-week-long exhibition, where pieces from her collection will be also on display.

What is a kimono? Literally meaning an outfit or clothes, kimonos can only be made by custom-tailoring to suit an individual. It is never one-size-fits-all, and is traditionally made of silk

It is a T-shaped tubular garment, with layers of detailing, made from 12.5 metres of fabric

Wearing the kimono is no easy task, as it involves careful overlapping and folding. Different types of folds have different meanings and this is the most important aspect of the kimono

Sleeve lengths indicate more about the person wearing it, such as whether they are married or unmarried

Simpler versions, called Yukata, are made of cotton and more suited to summers

“I am deeply impressed by the textiles from Japan and India. I hope that the exhibition will provide the chance for visitors to experience beautiful textiles made with time and care, and I hope the exhibition will inspire people to try designing their own shibori.” This exhibition focusses on shibori, as it is a technique already appreciated in India, though it is just a small part of the vast textile repertoire of kimono.

Shibori in Kimono: A Japanese Design Aesthetic, a talk by Caroline Sato, is on March 8, at 3 pm, at DakshinaChitra, Muttukadu.

The exhibition, comprising a collection of curated kimonos and accessories, will be from March 8 to March 23, from 10 am to 5 pm.

321,2020/03/02,Jordan Liberty’s stop in Delhi,"In Delhi as part of an international tour, Jordan Liberty, an L.A.-based makeup artist, leverages YouTube for global popularity

He has 280k followers on Instagram and 475k YouTube, with the fan base staying consistent over a decade — and going by these numbers, it’s only growing. Jordan Liberty, the Los Angeles based professional makeup artist is in Delhi this weekend, sharing his expertise through a masterclass.

Jordan’s skills extend beyond makeup — as an artist, he also photographs his own work, and believes in teaching skills he acquires. Also dabbling in consulting, creative direction, marketing, and product development, Jordan has collaborated with various well-known makeup and skincare brands like NARS, MAC, Urban Decay, Sephora, Anastasia Beverly Hills, and NYX. His eight-year-old niche brand, Liberty Republic, makes false eyelashes and vegan nail lacquers. Ahead of his masterclass today — part of his ongoing International Beauty Tour covering 12 cities across the world — Jordan talks about his work, how he stands out in a crowd, and why he chooses to photograph his own work. Edited excerpts.

You are a self-made makeup artist. Is it tough breaking into this industry when you're not ""trained"" at a certain institution?

I think the most difficult thing for new makeup artists is to differentiate yourself, globalize your name, and become a stand-out artist. You can’t teach that. I did it by learning photography, getting over my fear of public speaking, and always coming up with and sharing new techniques that set me apart. Something I also talk about in my classes is professionalism — it’s incredible how many artists are held back by poor hygiene standards, complacency, and bad manners. You cannot learn this in a classroom setting.

You dropped out of ashion school in New York, and started working as an art director. Any lessons from those early days that influence your work today?

When I first got into the industry, I was hungry to grow my craft and elevate my work — and I still am! I began to keep my finger on the pulse of the beauty industry to predict “what’s next” — and YouTube was part of that. I never wanted to be in the public eye, but taking advantage of what social media could offer me was something that I knew would get my work seen on a global stage.

How do you manage to stand apart from a slew of beauty bloggers and influencers leveraging social media for their work?

From the beginning, I have separated myself by being a professional. I’m not an influencer. I don’t share silly trends to grab a few clicks. I think I’ve been able to last on social media for 12 years because of this. Authenticity counts.

You’re a cancer survivor. Does this impact what products you use based on the ingredients used in them?

Oddly, no. Most topical products aren’t really that bad when you compare them to, say, what we eat or how we live. I’ve focused more on inner well-being and just being cognizant of where things come from.

You also photograph your own work — why?

Underwhelmed by how photographers shot my early work, I decided that I should at least try to shoot — I never dreamed that in just a few years I’d be doing makeup and photography for major beauty campaigns [for brands like NARS and MAC].

You constantly put up new makeup videos on your channels. How do you guard against plagiarism and still keep your work fresh?

I’ve had my ideas, images, and even videos stolen or recreated. It’s [bad] when people feel entitled to your hard work, but then I remind myself that people who need to steal, lack the imagination to come up with great ideas on their own. Stealing will only take them so far. I stay focused on what’s next, what’s new, and my followers who appreciate what I share.

322,2020/03/02,"HM keeps his promise, takes rural students for a ‘high ride’","All the 5th class students — 9 boys and 11 girl — were taken to Chennai by train on Friday night. After two days of touring various places in Chennai, Mahabalipuram and zoo in Vandalur, the children were taken back on a flight journey from Chennai to Madurai,” he said.

Twenty students of a remote panchayat union school near Srivilliputtur had a rare opportunity of having a flight journey for the first time, thanks to their Headmaster, V. Jayachandran, who kept his promise.

“I had promised the students of class 5 that if they were regular to school without absenting themselves for frivolous reasons, I would take them for an air travel. When the students heeded to my advice, I had to keep my words,” says the Headmaster of Panchayat Union Primary School at Mangalam under Srivilliputtur Panchayat union.

The students of the small village often take leave for any functions at home or even for the temple festivals in any of the neighbouring villages.

“I thought the children were losing out on their studies. So, to motivate them, I told them that I will spend for their air travel. In the last four months, except for health reasons and other pressing needs, the children have not taken leave and their attendance has increased dramatically,” he said.

“It was just fabulous,” said M. Swetha, a class 5 student, who for the first time had an air travel.

For all the children, for whom the nearest town Srivilliputtur itself is 13 km, a travel by Express train, the ride on Metro Train in Chennai and an air journey otherwise could have remained a dream for many of the students for several years.

The Headmaster, who has spent around ₹ 1.25 lakh for the travel, food and stay for the students and four teachers who accompanied them, says it was a pleasure giving something to the students.

“All my salary is only because of these children. I have spent only a portion of my salary to motivate them to come to school to become better citizens,” Mr. Jayachandran said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/p4rbmo/article30965546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ma03studentsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hm-keeps-his-promise-takes-rural-students-for-a-high-ride/article30965547.ece

324,2020/03/02,HC summons NHAI Project Director,"PIL plea says electricity poles, transformers are on national highway

MADURAI

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday summoned the Project Director of National Highways Authority of India, Tirunelveli, in a public interest litigation petition filed in 2016 seeking a direction to the authority to move the electricity poles to the margins of a highway in Virudhunagar district.

A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Sundar and C. Saravanan summoned the official in the petition filed by N.S. Ramaraj of Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district, who complained that electricity poles erected in the British era were causing hindrance to the public. The case was adjourned till March 17.

The petitioner said that National Highway 208 connected Madurai with Kollam in Kerala. On the stretch in Rajapalayam, the NH had electricity poles installed in the middle. Presently, TANGEDCO was maintaining 81 concrete electricity poles, 85 iron poles and 11 transformers on the stretch, he said.

Most of the poles which were on the road caused hindrance to vehicle users and every week there were at least 10 to 15 accidents on the stretch, he claimed. Recently a mini lorry rammed into a transformer on the road, he said.

The NHAI must take steps to shift electricity poles, power lines and transformers to the margins of the highway to ensure free vehicular movement.

330,2020/03/02,Corporation submits ₹70.52-cr. proposal of for water conservation,"Reviving 33 ooranis is one of the major components of the proposal

MADURAI

To revive waterbodies and take steps towards water harvesting so as to meet the growing water needs of the city, Madurai Corporation has submitted a proposal worth ₹70.52 crore to the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration.

This proposal has been submitted as part of ‘National Water Conservation Mission’ (Jal Jeevan Mission), a scheme implemented by the Ministry of Jal Shakti. The scheme, which aims at improving water availability to households, will be implemented in five years.

A senior Corporation official said that reviving 33 ooranis under the civic body’s purview was one of the major components of the proposal. “The feeder channels of the ooranis will be restored and wild growth of prosopis juliflora removed. Beautification works will be taken up along the banks of the ooranis. This includes establishment of parks, construction of pathways and installation of lights. Drinking water and toilet facilities will also be provided at these parks,” the official said.

Also, it is proposed to construct rooftop rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures for 25% of below poverty line (BPL) households in the 100 wards of the Corporation. The official said that based on a survey, the RWH structures would be built for 20,000 BPL households. “For the construction of the RWH structures, each household will be provided financial assistance up to ₹15,000. The collected rainwater will be directed to harvesting pits constructed near each household. This move aims at improving the groundwater level in surrounding areas,” the official added.

333,2020/03/02,"Concern over pollution in Netravathi, Phalguni","State-level conference discusses 36 issues at Tree Park

While expressing concern over the pollution in the Phalguni and Netravathi rivers, environmental activists at a conference here on Sunday said that the government should step in to take effective measures to stop dumping of construction waste and letting untreated effluents into the rivers.

Pollution of the two main rivers in Dakshina Kannada was among the 36 issues discussed at the second State-level “Parisara Sammelana” (a conference on environmental issues) organised by the National Environment Care Federation, a body of environmentalists, at the Tree Park in Tannirbavi.

Raising the issue, NECF member Gopika said that untreated effluents let into the two rivers are harming fish and other sensitive creatures. Liquor bottles were being dumped along the river banks, she said.

NECF convener H. Shashidhar Shetty said that there are many instances of construction waste being dumped in the riverbed. The city still does not have an effective way to dispose of construction waste. The water bodies were being levelled for building multi-storeyed structures, he said.

Activist and artist Dinesh Holla said that the landslips in Belthangady taluk following heavy rain in August last year was the fall-out of the damage caused to the source of the Netravathi and the Phalguni in the Western Ghats.

Senior Assistant Director, Coastal Regulatory Zone, U. Mahesh Kumar, said that action was being taken against transporters dumping construction waste in the riverbeds. “Recently, three lorries were booked and these cases are now before the Regional Transport Office,” he said and added that it was difficult for his office with two staff members to keep a tab on activities along the long riverbed.

He said that like students of School of Social Work, who are creating awareness on keeping riverbeds clean in Ullal, other colleges should take up similar exercises in other parts of the district.

When an activist pointed out that farmers living near the forests are being provided with 10 kg of gun powder for killing wild animals, advocate B. Jinendra Kumar said that the issue needs to be raised before the High Court of Karnataka in the form of public interest litigation.

Activist Suma Nayak said that curriculum of primary and secondary classes should be changed to give more marks for practicals in environmental science.

Addressing presspersons here recently, Mr. Ashok said that it was for their work in restoring dignity and human rights of indigenous tribal communities in the State that the SGA along with the Koraga Abhivridhi Sanghagala Okkoota, the Karnataka Aarnyamoola Budakattu Samudayagala Okkoota, and the ActionAid India had got the U.N.

The SGA was responsible for formation of the the Koraga Abhivridhi Sanghagala Okkoota and the Karnataka Aarnyamoola Budakattu Samudayagala Okkoota with the support of ActionAid India. The Koraga Abhivdridhi Sanghagala Okkoota was active in Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Kasaragod.

The Budakattu Samudayagala Okkoota worked for the welfare of Hasala, Gonda, Malekudiya, Hakkipikki, Jenu Kuruba, Betta Kuruba, Yerava, Soliga, and Dongrigaraciya communities in the Western Ghats, Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru, Hassan, Kodagu and Mysuru districts, he said.

He said that the SGA, established in 1987 with its head office at Pernal in Udupi district, had begun by working for Koraga community in 21 hamlets in the present Kaup taluk by introducing jasmine cultivation for them, supplying processed coir fibre to prepare the coir products, and raw materials to the traditional occupation basket weaving.

From 1991, SGA focused on the rights of Koraga community leading the government to set up the Mohammed Peer Study Committee, which recommended provision of land for the Koraga community. The government then provided about 600 acres of land to the community. The Prohibition of Ajalu Act also helped the community.

335,2020/03/02,Ecological themes neededin serious fiction: Chenni,"“Ecology richly figures in renaissance literature, but takes a back seat in modernist writings; it is coming back again. Moreover ‘two-eyed’ research, which includes indigenous knowledges, is the need of the hour,” said scholar-writer-critic Rajendra Chenni here recently.

A press release here on Saturday said that delivering a special lecture on “Ecology and Literature”, organised by the Gandhian Centre for Philosophical Arts and Sciences (GCPAS), MAHE, Prof. Chenni said that ecological concerns were prominently expressed in the romantic literature of the West... in the works of writers such as Blake and Wordsworth. It also figured in Kannada renaissance work by writers Bendre, Kuvempu and Shivaram Karanth; but it did take a back seat in modernist writings.

“Modernist writers focused more on issues of class, caste and gender and not so much about ecological concerns,” he added.

Prof. Chenni said that it was also likely that modern science became quite influential in a certain phase and indigenous knowledge systems were pushed to the background.

“Now there is a growing realisation about the significance of indigenous knowledge and limitations of modern science, which is very well reflected in the literature of internationally acclaimed author Amitav Ghosh,” he said.

Citing from Amitav Ghosh’s “The Great Derangement”, Prof. Chenni observed that Mr. Ghosh writes with comprehensive awareness about ecological issues and significance of indigenous knowledge systems. “Emphasis also needs to be laid on ‘two-eyed’ research, focusing on both modern science and indigenous systems,” he said.

Prof. Chenni further explained the significance of and the need for ecological themes in serious fiction as they become essential for better understanding of the natural world around us.

In his introductory remarks, GCPAS Director Varadesh Hiregange said that while MA in Ecosophical Aesthetics has started on the right note, another MA in Art and Peace Studies is being introduced from the next academic year.

336,2020/03/02,OMCs cut petrol and diesel prices,"This cut comes after the price of petrol was reduced by 17 paise a litre and that of diesel by 21 paise a litre on Sunday.

State owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) on March 2, 2020 have reduced the price of petrol by 22-23 paise a litre and diesel price by 20-21 paise a litre respectively, making it the fifth consecutive price reduction for diesel since February 26, 2020 and third consecutive price cut for petrol since February 28, 2020.

Interesting read: Petrol, diesel prices see steepest hike since July 5

Petrol now costs ₹71.49 per litre in Delhi, ₹77.18 per litre in Mumbai, ₹74.16 a litre in Kolkata and ₹74.28 per litre in Chennai after the price cut.

Similarly, diesel costs ₹64.10 a litre in Delhi, ₹67.13 a litre in Mumbai, ₹66.43 a litre in Kolkata and ₹67.65 per litre in Chennai, according to data by Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL).

This cut comes after the price of petrol was reduced by 17 paise a litre and that of diesel by 21 paise a litre on Sunday.

The prices were reduced after the international crude oil prices witnessed a downward trend due to slump in demand. The crude oil price was hovering a little above $50 per barrel on Sunday after COVID-19 deaths and cases increased all over the world.

Even as international crude oil prices marginally rose due to expected production cut, the fuel prices saw further decline across all major cities in India on Monday.

On Monday, the Brent crude was trading at $51.41 a barrel, up 91 cents, or 1.8%, after earlier dropping to $48.40, the lowest since July 2017.

The retail prices of fuel are dependent on the international crude prices and the Rupee-US dollar exchange rate as India imports almost 83% of its crude requirements.

337,2020/03/02,India’s manufacturing PMI goes down in Feb as coronavirus outbreak hits business,"This is the 31st consecutive month that the manufacturing PMI has remained above the 50-point mark.

The country’s manufacturing sector activity eased in February from a near eight-year high in the previous month and business sentiment took a hit amid impact of coronavirus outbreak on exports and supply chains, a monthly survey said on March 2.

At 54.5 in February, the headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) held close to January’s near eight-year high of 55.3, signalling improvement in operating conditions across the sector.

This is the 31st consecutive month that the manufacturing PMI has remained above the 50-point mark. In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.

“Factories in India continued to benefit from strong order flows in February, from both the domestic and international markets. The pick-up in demand meant that companies were able to further lift production and input buying at historically-elevated rates,” said Pollyanna de Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit.

The strong manufacturing sector expansion seen in India at the start of the year was maintained in February, with rates of growth for factory orders, exports and output holding close to January’s recent highs. While firms were willing to step up input buying, hiring activity increased only fractionally.

“However, alarm bells are ringing for Indian goods producers as the COVID-19 outbreak poses threats to exports and supply chains. Businesses became less confident about the year-ahead outlook for output, in turn restricting hiring activity,” Ms. Lima added.

The coronavirus outbreak has brought a large part of the world’s second-largest economy China to a standstill and its impact has been felt across industries.

On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global health emergency. The number of deaths globally in the new coronavirus outbreak passed 3,000 on Monday, as China reported 42 more deaths.

On the price front, there was only a moderate increase in input costs, the survey said. “...Price data continued to highlight a lack of inflationary pressure in the sector. Only modest increases in input costs and output charges were recorded in February, a trend that has been a key theme of the manufacturing PMI survey for over a year,” Mr. Lima said.

Meanwhile, India’s economic growth slowed to a near seven-year low of 4.7% in October-December 2019.

Despite being one of the strongest periods due to festival season and higher rural spending driven by kharif harvest, October-December was the third straight quarter of growth decline and the lowest rate in 27 quarters.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/1k58la/article30961631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02PMI-MANUFACTURING,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indias-manufacturing-pmi-goes-down-in-feb-as-coronavirus-outbreak-hits-business/article30961632.ece
338,2020/03/02,Monthly GST lottery offer for B2C invoices to start from April 1,"The lottery scheme is being envisaged by the revenue department to encourage customers to take bills for every purchase, which will in turn help the government in curbing GST evasion

The government is planning to launch monthly lottery offer under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from April 1 by conducting lucky draws for invoices of all business to customer (B2C) transactions. The offers would range between ₹10 lakh and ₹1 crore, said an official.

The lottery scheme is being envisaged by the revenue department to encourage customers to take bills for every purchase, which will in turn help the government in curbing GST evasion.

Under the scheme, the revenue department will conduct monthly lucky draws which will have one bumper prize, while there would be second and third prizes state wise, an official said.

“The lottery scheme is planned to be launched on April 1,” the official added.

A member in the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) had last month said that the lottery offers would range between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 1 crore.

The official said consumers will have to scan and upload any B2C invoice using a mobile app, which is being developed by GST Network (GSTN), which handles the technology backbone of GST.

The mobile app would be made available for both Android and iOS users by end of this month.

There would not be any threshold on the invoice value to be eligible for lucky draw, the official added.

GST, which became effective from July 1, 2017, has subsumed over a dozen indirect taxes, like excise and service tax. However, revenue under the new indirect tax regime has not picked up as per expectations, mainly on account of evasion.

Officials expect the lottery scheme to incentivise customers to ask for bill or invoice while making purchases.

The GST Council is likely to vet the lottery scheme in its next meeting on March 14.

As per the plan, the money for the lottery scheme would come from the consumer welfare fund, where the proceeds of anti-profiteering cases are transferred.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/5oj6i/article30959146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01GST2,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/monthly-gst-lottery-offer-for-b2c-invoices-to-start-from-april-1/article30959147.ece

The GST revenues in February from domestic transactions grew by 12% over the same month last year.

Having achieved one billion-unit case sales in 2019, The Coca-Cola Company, the world’s largest beverage company, has announced plans to double sales volume in India in five years with an objective to make India its third-largest market in the future. It has set no time-frame to achieve the global mark.

In 21 years since the company re-entered the country, India has emerged Coca-Cola fifth-largest market by volume globally, contributing to ‘solid growth’ of the company. Addressing a press conference on Monday, James Quincey, chairman and chief executive officer, The Coca-Cola Company said, “India is a super attractive market for us and now that we have achieved one billion-unit case sales in 2019, our next target is to double sales in five years. India presents a promising opportunity to become one of the top three markets for the company soon, from fifth largest now.”

Top markets

The top four markets include the United States, Mexico, Brazil and China. Coca-Cola in India is transforming into a total beverage company, and in the last two years, the portfolio of beverage offerings has expanded in a segmented manner.

He said the company had made strong value share gains with contribution from both sparkling and non-sparkling offerings and the slowdown in India had not impacted sales volume.

As a part of company’s refreshed approach, Coca-Cola India will continue to grow its core brands by rolling out new variants across Thums Up, Limca, Fanta, Sprite and Maaza, including no-sugar extension, and at the same time diversifying its portfolio by entering new beverage categories like enhanced hydration, nutritious dilutables and beverage-plus at affordable price point.

The company also has plans to market Coca-Cola India home-grown brands like Thums Up and Maaza globally in other markets.

In 2017, Coca-Cola committed $1.7 billion (₹11,000 crore) towards the Indian agri-ecosystem for the next five years under its Fruit Circular Economy initiative.

Vodafone Group CEO Nick Read is likely to travel to India this week amid its India joint venture Vodafone Idea struggling to pay its adjusted gross revenues (AGR)-related dues ahead of the next Supreme Court hearing on the issue on March 17.

Mr. Read has also put in a request to meet Union Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, a source who did not want to be named, told The Hindu. “Mr. Read has requested a meeting with the Minister on March 6 (Friday),” the source said.

As per the letter, dated February 28, sent to the Minister’s office, Vodafone Idea has stated that Mr. Read will be accompanied by Ravinder Takkar, MD and CEO, Vodafone Idea, for the meeting. The letter, written by P Balaji, chief regulatory and corporate affairs officer at Vodafone Idea, also adds that Vodafone Group is the largest FDI investor in the country across all sectors.

The meeting gains importance as Vodafone Idea is reeling under pressure to pay statutory dues of ₹53,000 crore as per government’s estimate.. Of this, it has only paid about ₹3,500 crore.

Vodafone Idea has been hit the most by the Supreme Court’s judgement on AGR. The company has already cautioned that its ability to continue as a going concern would depend on a favourable outcome of its modification plea in the Supreme Court.

Exports, though, dropped 22% to 683 units, taking total tractor sales during the month to 22,561 units. This is a growth of 19% from February 2019.

Rajesh Jejurikar, president, FES, M&M said, “the tractor demand trend is expected to strengthen on the back of a robust rabi output and the prevailing crop prices. Going forward, the increase in rural and agri- spending on core schemes by the government should augur well for the industry.”

Escorts said its agri-machinery segment sold 8,601 tractors, registering a growth of 18.8%. Domestic tractor sales grew 16% to 8,049 units and exports rose to 552 tractors from 322.

With as many as 59 countries including China reporting cases of COVID-19 so far, the World Health Organisation has upped its global risk assessment status due to the novel corona virus to very high.

COVID-19 has already claimed more than 3,000 lives, and with fear spreading faster than the microbe, normal life has been turned upside down in affected countries.

The outbreak has upended travel plans for many, and has led to cancelled flights and passengers being quarantined when travelling to or returning from a country affected by COVID-19.

Yet despite the multi-fold coverage of the outbreak by global publications, COVID-19 is showing no signs of slowing, which has led to heightened health concerns cultivated out of fear.

To allay such concerns and offer clarification on what needs to be done and what need not be feared, send in your queries about COVID-19 centred on the aspects of travel and health. We will consult experts on the subjects to get you answers.

348,2020/03/02,No country for protesters?,"India today is a nation in ferment. The communal violence in north-east Delhi, which has consumed more than 40 lives, is the latest chapter in the pan-India mobilisations triggered by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the spectre of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). To better understand the Delhi riots, which were characterised as a clash between pro-CAA and anti-CAA groups, it might be useful to separately consider the anti-CAA protests of the preceding two months.

These protests could be grouped into two categories. The first kind were the rallies and the marches. These gatherings, ritualistic in nature, were inscribed by the certainty of dispersal within a time frame. They were one-off events, though capable of being iterated multiple times. The early Jamia Millia Islamia student protests belong to this category. Protests of this kind are subject to a differential calculus of legality/illegality, involving police permission, and whether or not Section 144 of the IPC is in force. The second kind of protest is where you occupy a place indefinitely. The time frame here is open-ended, and subject to the fulfilment, or at least the acknowledgement, of the protesters’ demands.

Assumptions made

Both these protest forms are premised on some assumptions about the state. The first assumption is that the state is democratic and will respect all forms of non-violent dissent. The second is that the state has a conscience; that it is susceptible to a currency of influence other than power or money, such as, say, a set of shared values. For the anti-CAA-NRC protests, the source of a shared moral sense is the Constitution.

Both these forms of non-violent protest seek to put moral pressure on the government by focusing public attention on an injustice. The idea is that the state, its conscience awakened by the public invocation of constitutional morality, will see reason. Then some kind of a compromise can be negotiated, and everybody can go home. This is how non-violent mass protest is supposed to work in a functioning democracy. Independent India has seen some success stories of such peaceful agitations bearing fruit.

However, successful agitations of the past are not comparable to the anti-CAA protests for two reasons. First, the institutional checks and balances between the executive and other arms of the state have become more susceptible to communal polarisation than in the past. As a result, there is greater scope for misuse of the bureaucratic apparatus in regulating protests. Second, given the extent of such polarisation in the body politic, there is far less risk of political losses when abuses of the bureaucratic apparatus are directed at members of a minority community.

It is against this backdrop that a dichotomy has emerged: ‘good protests’ versus ‘bad protests’. This classification, translated as non-violent versus violent, might seem reasonable. Depending on how one evaluates a particular protest, the kind of state intervention deemed acceptable would vary. It could either be lawful regulation, with due regard for human dignity and right to freedom of assembly, or a liberal use of lathis and tear gas, if not bullets.

But this binary breaks down where the regime in power brooks no dissent. Recent events suggest that whether a given protest is deemed ‘good’ or ‘bad’ could depend on who is protesting: are they members of the majority or the minority community? The binary also breaks down when the dominant narrative seeks to discredit any protest by linking it to any incident of violence. The controversy over the “burning bus” at Jamia Nagar — with the protesters and the police trading charges of arson — is a case in point. While the truth of who burnt the bus remains disputed, the incident did help project the Jamia protests against CAA-NRC as “violent” and therefore deserving of a violent response from the state.

In search of a conscience

The most critical question facing these protests, however, is one that is frightening to contemplate: what if their assumption about the government having a democratic conscience was false? There is a reason why, for the first time in the history of independent India, members of one community are out on the streets over fear of losing something as basic as citizenship rights — what philosopher Hannah Arendt famously called the “right to have rights”.

Some of the world’s leading bodies on religious freedom have observed that the CAA-NRC discriminates against Muslims. Therefore, unlike mass mobilisations of the past, the anti-CAA-NRC protests represent an existential struggle against an ideologically driven regime with a majoritarian agenda.

What if the majoritarian cast of this regime has deactivated its democratic conscience, such as it is, on the question of minority rights? Could that be the reason why the Centre has shown no interest in engaging with the protesters? Indeed the only strategy discernible in the government’s response to the anti-CAA protests is a concerted effort to discredit them. The most obvious way of doing so is to link them to violence. In this strategy, the ruling party has been zealously aided by its foot soldiers in the news industry and social media. A subsidiary tactic has been to tar the protesters in “anti-national” colours using a familiar palette — ‘tukde tukde gang’, ‘Islamic radicals’, ‘urban naxals’, and so on.

It was this sinister script that began playing out in Delhi following a speech by BJP leader Kapil Mishra on February 23. In his speech, Mr. Mishra said that his supporters will not remain peaceful if the police failed to evict, within three days, anti-CAA women protesters who had occupied a stretch near the Jaffrabad metro station. Despite its incendiary content, the speech evoked no penal response from the state. Shortly after, violence engulfed Jaffrabad and surrounding areas. Amid reports of violence from “both sides”, Jaffrabad’s anti-CAA sit-in was broken up. Along the way, a plausible narrative linking violence and anti-CAA protests had been established.

In this context, especially in the light of reports suggesting police bias against anti-CAA protesters, allegations of complicity of the establishment in the Delhi violence cannot be taken lightly. On the one hand, building a perception that anti-CAA protesters are “violent” makes state violence against these protesters more acceptable to the public. On the other, building a perception that opposition to the CAA is solely from the minority community makes state violence against anti-CAA protesters quite appealing to the ruling party’s majoritarian constituency. The riots have a larger dimension that goes beyond the issue of support for, or opposition to, the CAA — pure sectarian hatred.

At any rate, one cannot ignore the politics behind the dominance of the violent/non-violent binary in protest-related discourse. By focusing attention on form to the exclusion of content, it serves as a useful discursive tool for authoritarian regimes determined to discredit peaceful dissent. During the freedom struggle, Mahatma Gandhi deployed an array of protest strategies against the British, with an escalating ladder of non-violent militancy, culminating in mass civil disobedience. Anti-CAA protesters do not have the luxury of being led by an apostle of non-violence who can exert inexorable moral pressure, not only on the state but also on sectarian sections of the majority. The last thing the country needs now is an elected government sending out the message that non-violent protest has no place in Indian democracy.

349,2020/03/02,A deal that increases uncertainty,"The U.S.-Taliban agreement achieves some objectives, but may not bring lasting peace

The U.S.-Taliban agreement signed on February 29 may end up paving the way for further intra-Afghan fighting because it leaves the most important issue, namely, the future relationship between the Afghan government and the Taliban, unresolved. All it does is to propose an intra-Afghan dialogue between the Kabul government and the Taliban scheduled to begin on March 10.

The prospects of such a dialogue leading to a durable peace in the country do not seem to be very good. A major reason for this is the inability of both the Kabul government and the Taliban to speak in one voice. The government is a perfect picture of disunity with President Ashraf Ghani and his primary challenger Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah threatening to set up parallel governments. What makes this rivalry very dangerous is that Mr. Ghani belongs to the largest ethnic group, the Pashtun, and Mr. Abdullah’s base is among his fellow Tajiks, the second largest group in Afghanistan.

Concessions made by Mr. Ghani’s government to the Taliban will likely be interpreted by Mr. Abdullah’s supporters as an intra-Pashtun deal reached at the expense of other ethnic groups, especially the Tajiks and the Uzbeks, who formed the bulk of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance from 1996 to 2001. Consequently, ethnic fissures may descend into open conflict.

The many faces of Taliban

Similarly, the Taliban, despite appearances to the contrary, is not a well-knit force. It is composed of various regional and tribal groups acting semi-autonomously. All of them may not be amenable to following the directions of its top leadership. It is, therefore, possible that some of them may continue to engage in assaults on government troops and even American forces during the withdrawal process.

What the U.S.-Taliban agreement has accomplished in reality is to help the leaders on both sides achieve their primary objectives. The Taliban has pledged not to allow any terrorist organisation, such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State, to operate from the territory it controls. Although important for American security interests, this was secondary to the Donald Trump administration’s key concern. Mr. Trump’s main goal was to demonstrate to his domestic constituency that he was serious about bringing American troops back home. According to the timeline set out in the agreement, all U.S. and NATO troops will withdraw from Afghanistan within 14 months. More important, the joint statement declared that the U.S. would reduce the number of U.S. military forces in Afghanistan to 8,600 within 135 days. This means that a substantial number of American troops will return to the U.S. well before the presidential election, thus giving a boost to President Trump’s odds for re-election.

The Taliban leadership has also achieved its primary goal, namely, the withdrawal of foreign troops within a reasonable time frame. The Taliban already controls or contests half the country’s territory and the American and NATO withdrawal will help it expand its territorial base at the expense of the government’s poorly trained forces.

Why India should be concerned

The prospect of this happening should worry New Delhi for two interrelated reasons. One, India has a major stake in the stability of Afghanistan, however tenuous it may be, as it has invested considerable resources in the country’s development. Two, India has a major stake in the continuation in power of the present dispensation, which it considers a strategic asset vis-à-vis Pakistan. An increased political and military role for the Taliban and the expansion of its territorial control should be of great concern to India since the Taliban is widely believed to be a protégé of Islamabad. Therefore, any celebration in New Delhi will be highly misplaced.

350,2020/03/02,"A big, bad deal: On U.S.-Taliban agreement","The U.S. deal with Taliban leaves the Afghan people at the mercy of violent, tribal Islamists

The deal signed between the U.S. and the Taliban in Doha on Saturday sets the stage for America to wind down the longest war in its history. It went into Afghanistan in October 2001, a few weeks after the 9/11 terror attacks, with the goals of defeating terrorists and rebuilding and stabilising the central Asian country. Almost 19 years later, the U.S. seeks to exit Afghanistan with assurances from the Taliban that the insurgents will not allow Afghan soil to be used by transnational terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda and that they would engage the Kabul government directly to find a lasting solution to the civil war. America’s desperation is understandable. The Afghan war is estimated to have cost $2-trillion, with more than 3,500 American and coalition soldiers killed. Afghanistan lost hundreds of thousands of people, both civilians and soldiers. After all these, the Taliban is at its strongest moment since the U.S. launched the war. The insurgents control or contest the government control in half of the country, mainly in its hinterlands. The war had entered into a stalemate long ago and the U.S. failed to turn it around despite both American Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump having sent additional troops. Faced with no other way, the U.S. just wants to leave Afghanistan. But the problem is with the way it is getting out.

The fundamental issue with the U.S.’s Taliban engagement is that it deliberately excluded the Afghan government because the insurgents do not see the government as legitimate rulers. By giving in to the Taliban’s demand, the U.S. has practically called into question the legitimacy of the government it backs. Second, the U.S. has made several concessions to the Taliban in the agreement. The Taliban was not pressed enough to declare a ceasefire. Both sides settled for a seven-day “reduction of violence” period before signing the deal. The U.S., with some 14,000 troops in Afghanistan, has committed to pull them out in a phased manner in return for the Taliban’s assurances that it would sever ties with other terrorist groups and start talks with the Kabul government. But the Taliban, whose rule is known for strict religious laws, banishing women from public life, shutting down schools and unleashing systemic discrimination on religious and ethnic minorities, has not made any promises on whether it would respect civil liberties or accept the Afghan Constitution. The Taliban got what it wanted — the withdrawal of foreign troops — without making any major concession. Lastly, the U.S. withdrawal will invariably weaken the Kabul government, altering the balance of power both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table. A weakened government will have to talk with a resurgent Taliban. The U.S., in a desperate bid to exit the Afghan war, has practically abandoned the Kabul government and millions of Afghans who do not support the Taliban’s violent, tribal Islamism, to the mercy of insurgents.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-big-bad-deal-the-hindu-editorial-on-us-taliban-agreement/article30957934.ece
351,2020/03/02,Viral economies: The Hindu Editorial on coronavirus impact on global economy,"The coronavirus is pushing the world into a recession, and India cannot be immune to it

The global economy appears headed for uncharted, troubled territory thanks to the second wave of the coronavirus that has now spread to countries as far apart as Nigeria and New Zealand. The virus has crippled global supply chains, hit air travel and convulsed markets as it appears all set to adversely impact the U.S. economy, the global economic engine. This, when the Chinese economy is already in deep trouble due to the impact of the virus. A slowdown or worse, recession, in the two global economic engines is bad news for the world economy, which may well tilt into recession. Markets reflected these concerns last week as indices plunged and investors stampeded for the exit, dumping stocks. Big money moved to the relative safety of government bonds, pushing prices up and yields down. The U.S. markets experienced their worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 fell by over 12%. Interestingly, investors seemed to boycott even that ultimate refuge during troubled times, gold, whose prices also fell during the week. They seemed to place greater faith in the sovereign guarantee of the U.S. government reflected in its Treasury bills. But there is trouble ahead for the U.S. economy as companies ranging from Apple and Nvidia to Procter & Gamble and Adidas are in difficulty because of their large exposures to the Chinese market or their reliance on suppliers from China. This is a crisis unlike any other. It is not a financial crisis that can be sorted out with time-tested measures such as rate cuts and bail-outs. The challenge of the virus attack is that it is immune to financial solutions.

All about COVID-19

For India, the troubles could not have surfaced at a worse moment just when there are some tentative signs of a return to growth. Policymakers are sanguine about the impact on the domestic economy and how they can manage the situation by resorting to airlifting of materials if the supply chain is disrupted. But the problem extends beyond supply chain disruptions, which, by the way is serious for industries such as pharmaceuticals, electronics and automobiles. In a situation of a global recession, exports, which are not growing even now, could take a hit, further slowing down one of the economic engines. And risk averse foreign investors could hold back fresh investments in India. What augurs well though is that Indian companies are not major participants in the global supply chains originating in China. And second, crude oil prices are slipping which is good news for the macro economy and inflation. The government needs to watch the developing situation and, for now, do all it can to support industries that are reliant on Chinese inputs.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/viral-economies-the-hindu-editorial-on-coronavirus-impact-on-global-economy/article30957935.ece
352,2020/03/02,Hunt for man-eating leopard in Tumakuru,"The animal has killed four persons so far

The forest department of Tumakuru has started combing operations to catch a leopard, which killed 3-year-old Chandana and three others in Tumakuru taluk. A team from Hassan arrived in Baichenahalli to tranquilise the leopard on Monday.

The forest department said 25 cages have been placed in the area in and around Baichenahalli where the four people were attacked and killed by the leopard. Three leopards have been captured since October 2019.

Deputy Conservator of Forests Girish told The Hindu that the gap between the first leopard attack and the second attack was 40 days, from the second attack to third was 41 days, and from the third attack to the fourth was 50 days.

“Owing to the long interval between each attack, we are unable to trace the animal, which has attacked the four people in that area. There is no proper methodology to identify the animal. We need to first identify the leopard that is attacking humans, which is very challenging,” he said.

353,2020/03/02,Namma Bengaluru: Post-death facilities not keeping pace with rise in pet population,"Carcasses are often dumped near black spots or in vacant sites

While the number of pet owners in the city is growing with every passing year, the facilities to ensure that they can give their animals a dignified send-off remain woefully inadequate. There is only one animal crematorium run by the BBMP in Sumanahalli, which operates from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., apart from a privately managed pet cemetery in Kengeri.

The lack of facilities in the city centre and the fact that the civic-run crematorium is not open for longer hours is problematic, say pet parents.

Arun Prasad, an animal rights activist, said that ideally, the BBMP should make provisions to have either a crematorium or burial ground for animals in each of the eight zones. “Firstly, there is not too much awareness about the cemetery or the crematorium for animals. Both are situated near the city’s outskirts,” he said.

With no strong mechanism in place, carcasses of dead animals are often dumped near black spots or in vacant sites posing a risk to pourakarmikas. A similar point was made by the the CJ Memorial Trust, a not-for-profit trust focussed on creating awareness and advocacy for animals, which started a petition a few years ago highlighting the need to ensure that the animal crematorium functions round-the-clock. This way, the civic body will be able to avoid illegal dumping of animals or incorrect burial of pets across the city, it noted.

The petition urged the BBMP to mandate institutions, such as veterinary clinics and animal shelters, to collect and deposit the carcasses at the crematorium to be incinerated.

Another activist, who spoke to The Hindu but did not want to be named, said the existing facilities are certainly not enough. The activist alleged that the sole animal crematorium often did not work properly due to issues with power supply. “The city needs at least five facilities dedicated to interring animals with dignity.”

BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Animal Husbandry and Solid Waste Management) D. Randeep admitted that there is a need for more facilities in the city but said that the civic body does not have any plans to set up additional facilities. “The cost of electricity for running the existing facility at Sumanahalli is fairly high,” he said.

More awareness needed

When Anushka Narayan’s (name changed on request) cat passed away recently, she was at her wits’ end trying to find ways to bury or cremate her pet. Her family finally decided to bury the cat in their small garden in their home in Shivajinagar.

Many families who own pets are not aware of the animal crematorium that is maintained by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). It’s not just just the bodies of cats, dogs, rabbits and other pets that are incinerated there, but also some large domestic animals, such as donkeys, mules, buffaloes, cows, bulls and horses.

Opened in November 2015, the sole animal crematorium in the city has helped many pet owners and owners of domestic animals.

N. Penchalaiah, crematorium operator, told The Hindu that the facilities are mostly used by pet owners. Not many large animals are brought here. “In cases of road kill, though the pourakarmikas are not mandated to pick up dead animals, health inspectors send the carcasses to the crematorium,” he said.

The crematorium has two incinerators – one for small animals like dog, cat, rabbit, monkeys, sheep and goat and another for large livestock. The BBMP charges ₹300 for small animals and ₹1,000 for large animals.

Apart from the crematorium, there is also a pet cemetery that is managed by the People for Animals (PFA), a charitable organisation that rescues and rehabilitates urban wildlife. This facility, however, is expensive, compared to the BBMP’s animal crematorium.

Nawaz Sharief, general manager, PFA, told The Hindu that the pet cemetery is on the same premises as their animal hospital on Mysuru Road. With distance being an issue, PFA even offers to pick up pets for a fee (₹15 per km). The other advantage is that the pet cemetery is open 24/7, unlike the crematorium.

Nanotechnology has been making giant strides in the field of healthcare, but India is yet to tap its optimum potential, said Prof. C.N.R. Rao, Chairman, Vision Group on Science and Technology and Nanotechnology, government of Karnataka.

Speaking at the opening session of the State’s annual nano technology exposition, Bengaluru INDIA NANO 2020, on Monday, Prof. Rao said, “To explore the full potential of nano technology in healthcare, I urge our young scientists to conduct more research in the field of healthcare and come out with some great solutions.

356,2020/03/02,Pillars of elevated expressways getting a facelift,"Aim is make them aesthetically pleasing, and keep them free of garbage, posters and graffiti

Pillars of infrastructure projects, such as those offlyovers and the Namma Metro, have often been blamed for ruining the aesthetics of the city. But now, as many as 101 pillars under the elevated expressway that connects Hebbal to Kempegowda International Airport are being transformed into more colourful avatars.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), along with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), The Ugly Indian (TUI) and Embassy Group, has started giving them a facelift. Pillars on a 5-km stretch from Kodigehalli to Jakkur are being coated with weatherproof external paint.

The project of painting the pillars is nearing completion, and senior officials from the NHAI.

Before undertaking the painting, volunteers removed posters apart from cleaning up the area, a volunteer said. The design, which ensures commuters and drivers are not distracted, has been curated by The Ugly Indian, the group that works anonymously to clean the city.

“Colours used are neutral, and there are no writings at all. The design is repetitive and predictable with constant patterns, and are not reflective,” a representative of The Ugly Indian said.

According to BBMP officials and the The Ugly Indian, painting of pillars would serve multiple purposes. “They are aesthetically pleasing and also help us to keep the pillars free of garbage, posters and graffiti. It is a one-time intervention with no maintenance cost. We are trying to keep the pillars clean and bring behavioural change with this activity,” they said.

Another representative from The Ugly Indian said that such initiative can be called a ‘poster repellent design’.

Electronics City, Tumakuru Road too

With the help of CSR funds, The Ugly Indian is also working on beautifying and painting the pillars of the Electronics City elevated expressway.

“Of 270 pillars, we have completed painting around 120 pillars and aim to finish the whole stretch in a phased manner with the help of CSR funds,” the representative said, adding that they are also planning to paint the elevated stretch on Tumakuru Road which has over 200 pillars.

Speaking to The Hindu, BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said that the civic body had invited corporates and anyone who is interested in adopting, and maintaining flyovers and underpasses under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). “A few corporates have come forward to maintain a few flyovers. Our aim is to make all the flyovers and underpasses aesthetically pleasing, and will support whoever comes up to maintain them,” he said.

He also said that he had spoken to the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) regarding beautification or painting of all the metro pillars across the city.

S.P. Somashekar, Project Director, NHAI said that such joint efforts by government agencies, corporates and the public at large would bring about environmental awareness and better urban infrastructure in cities.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/y9qpp4/article30965557.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGFLYOVERPAINTING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pillars-of-elevated-expressways-getting-a-facelift/article30965554.ece
357,2020/03/02,Facial recognition to tackle impersonation in RGUHS exams,"Students enrolling from 2020-21 will have to sign up for this feature

To avoid impersonation in examinations, the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) will soon capture the facial features of students on camera.

Vice chancellor S. Sachidananda said that this was a precautionary measure that they had initiated to avoid malpractices. He said that all the students who will enrol at the university from 2020-21 onwards will have to sign up for this. The software will be installed at all centres where the annual and the supplementary examinations will be held. The university recently started live streaming of its examination centres to curb malpractices.

Dr. Sachidananda said that the university has around 2.5 lakh students for MBBS, BDS, alternative medicine and allied health science courses. Examinations are conducted in around 230 centres.

The vice chancellor said that while all examination centres have cameras, the software needs to be downloaded. The university is yet to float tenders for the project.

University authorities said that the move would help them to a great extent. “Although the photo of the student is printed on the hall ticket, students change their hair style and sometimes look different from the photo they have pasted on the admission ticket. This makes it difficult for us to verify if the candidate is the same person as the one in the photo,” said an official.

Some students, however, are wary of the move. “Capturing our facial features is an invasion of privacy. We also fear that the university may not be able to protect our data in a secure manner,” said a third year MBBS student of a city-based medical college.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/facial-recognition-to-tackle-impersonation-in-rguhs-exams/article30965478.ece
358,2020/03/02,BIFFes 2020: ‘Still extremely difficult for women to make films and find audience’,"They have to battle the same patriarchal biases even to find an audience

To this day, it is extremely difficult for women to make feature films and find an audience, said Malayalam filmmaker Geetha J.

She was speaking at an interaction of women filmmakers at the twelfth edition of Bengaluru International Film Festival (Biffes) on Monday. Her film, Run Kalyani, is competing in the Indian Cinema section at the festival.

“After winning an award for a script at an international festival a decade ago, I found it impossible to get funding to make that film. It is only a decade later, I made my first feature film, an independent film Run Kalyani. The first film I wanted to make required a bigger budget, which I am yet to mobilise,” she said.

""There is inherent patriarchy in the film industry like everywhere else, which we, as women filmmakers, need to contend with. All filmmakers face the challenge of raising funds, but we women filmmakers face double the challenge as we need to battle the bias as well. A male filmmaker needs to be good, a woman filmmaker needs to be extra good to even break the barriers,” she said.

Regarding the Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) in the Malayalam film industry, that has raised many hopes, she said, “WCC is an important first step that has opened up conversations on these topics. But it is too early for WCC to impact filmmaking.”

Not just in the industry, women filmmakers have to battle the same patriarchal biases even to find an audience, filmmakers said.

Kannada filmmaker Vijayalakshmi Singh, whose film Yaana is being screened at the festival, said as she was herself the producer, she did not face issues with making the film, but did find it tough to find an audience.

“Despite our best efforts, we could not get a good release. The film was not given a fair chance at the theatres. But once it premiered on streaming platform Amazon, it has been a runaway hit. Amazon has said the film is very popular and asked me to make a spin-off or a sequel. It makes me both sad and happy,” she said.

From this year, BIFFes has begun screening films under the ‘Women filmmakers from Karnataka’ section, which is “a first step towards encouraging women filmmakers” said Sunil Puranik, chairperson, Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/8u6pgi/article30965154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGBIFFES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/biffes-2020-still-extremely-difficult-for-women-to-make-films-and-find-audience/article30965155.ece
359,2020/03/02,Students demand change of timings citing traffic,"Stage protest against management of Rajarajeswari College of Engineering in Kumbalagodu

Students in Bengaluru have more than just their studies to worry about; getting to college on time in a city that is infamous for its traffic is as big a challenge as aceing their exams.

On Monday, students of Rajarajeswari College of Engineering in Kumbalagodu staged a protest against the management demanding that the timings be tweaked.

According to students, the management had recently made it mandatory to be in the classroom before 8.30 a.m., which has become difficult for many owing to traffic snarls in the vicinity.

“Even if we are late by five minutes, we will be marked as absent for the day. They should understand the traffic situation on Mysuru Road before issuing such orders,” said a student.

Students have demanded that the management withdraw the order and be flexible in the morning hours. They have said that they would boycott classes if the management does not listen to their concerns.

The college management was not available for comment.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/students-demand-change-of-timings-citing-traffic/article30964967.ece
360,2020/03/02,Bill tabled to regulate horse racing,"Aims to amend the Karnataka Race Courses Licensing Act 1952 (Karnataka Act VIII of 1952)

The government tabled the Karnataka Race Courses Licensing (Amendment) Bill, 2020, in the Legislative Assembly on Monday to make provisions to delegate powers to the officer authorised by the government in the interest of better management of licensing, control and management of horse racing.

The bill is aimed at amending the Karnataka Race Courses Licensing Act 1952 (Karnataka Act VIII of 1952), and enhance the penalty amount.

In November last year, the Public Accounts Committee of the Karnataka legislature had directed the government to stop all racing activity at the Bangalore Turf Club (BTC) from December 2, 2019.

The committee, headed by Congress MLA H.K. Patil, had taken serious note of lapses in the functioning of the BTC. The committee had unanimously decided that all racing activity must be stopped from December 1 and that the government should charge all dues from the race course organisation before December 1.

The BTC is estimated to owe ₹32.86 crore to the government, which is 2% of its turnover, as annual rent between 2010-11 and 2017-18. The amount it was supposed to have remitted to the government between 1989 and 1998 is still due, the PAC noted.

On defacement

361,2020/03/02,The rise of regional streaming platforms,"Regional streaming platforms dedicated to one language seem to be capturing the hyper local market where giants like Netflix and Amazon have yet to make an impact.

“Regional streaming platforms are the new future,” said Suriya Narayanan, chief creative officer, Aha, a dedicated Telugu streaming platform.

He was speaking at the twelfth edition of the Bengaluru International Film Festival (BiFFes). Aha, which was launched less than a month ago, is one of the more newer offerings.

First one

The first dedicated language streaming platform was Hoichoi for Bengali content, Sun NXT, a streaming platform with extensive focus on south Indian languages. “I’m sure, very soon there will be a dedicated streaming platform for Kannada content. We at Aha are also looking to enter the Kannada market very soon,” Mr. Narayanan said.

Netflix, Amazon and Mubi are billed as platforms for the globalisation of content - for both consumers and creators. But a counter-current seems to be gathering momentum in the form of regional streaming platforms.

“The wide variety of content in several languages in India is something centralised firms — both national and international — struggle hard to grapple with. That is where the regional platforms are coming in. Content on most of the streaming platforms today is not accessible to the non-metro audience especially in small towns and villages, where there is an appetite for content consumption on mobile phones,” he added.

He cited a study which said that Indians spend an average 3.5 hours on their mobile phones consuming content, most of it in non-metro areas.

For now, most regional streaming services divide the audience based on the local language. “This will be the trend for the next six to seven years. Once there is wide coverage for streaming platforms in regional languages, a smaller cross-section will develop an appetite for global content. Then, maybe international platforms will acquire or tie-up with regional apps, which will then create app-within-app model to give consumers both regional and global content,” he predicted.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/the-rise-of-regional-streaming-platforms/article30958568.ece

Children and elders were the worst affected as the smoke continued to spread for more than 200 metres on the Chennai-Bengaluru highway.

‘Around the place’

“This is not the first time that garbage was burnt on the roadside. On the morning of January 15 and February 2 too, burning of garbage around this place sent smoke across villages,” a motorist from Somalapuram said.

The smoke and flying debris caused problems to two-wheeler riders using the stretch. Motorists and bigger vehicles take the route to reach places like Salem, Krishnagiri, Hosur and Bengaluru.

‘Isolated stretch’

Traders and business houses dump their waste and burn it on this stretch of the road since it is isolated, said M. Dayanidhi, a trader from Ambur. He said patrolling does not take place on this stretch and asked for it to be intensified.

365,2020/03/02,Class XII examinations commence in Vellore,"Over 40,000 students write the language exam across Vellore

A total of 40,531 class XII students, including 103 differently-abled students, wrote the first language exam in 171 examination centres in six taluks across Vellore district on Monday.

There are 16 question paper centres and one centre for stocking answer sheets, which are guarded by armed security personnel.

More than 2,700 teachers are enumerated for the smooth conduct of the exams and 250 flying squad personnel have been deployed to monitor and prevent malpractices, said an Education Department official.

Vellore District Collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram, who visited EVR Nagammai Girls Higher Secondary School, wished the students good luck and urged them to face the examinations without fear. He also advised them to stay in good health to be able to handle exam pressure.

In Tiruvannamalai district, 27,860 students took this examination at 109 examination centres. Two centres were allocated for private candidates. 2,339 teachers and officials are on duty to keep a vigil over the exams, which conclude on March 24.

Measures to prevent entry of unauthorised persons into the examination centres have been stepped up, said Tiruvannamalai Collector K.S. Kandasamy.

Tirupattur Collector M.P. Sivanarul, who inspected facilities at Sri Meenakshi Government Girls Higher Secondary School, Tirupattur, said that 6,031 boys, 6,817 girls and 23 differently-abled students are taking up the exams in the district.

Five question paper centres and one answer sheet centre will stock the materials from the School Education Department. 934 teachers and officials are on duty, he said.

366,2020/03/02,Officials step up vigil over formalin-laced fishes in Vellore,"‘Sustained ingestion causes cancer’

In tandem with the ongoing drives against formalin-laced fishes in several parts of the State, the Food Safety Department and Fisheries Department officials conducted checks in the Vellore city fish market on Monday.

Although no aberrant stock was found, officials said that traders were warned against selling formalin-laced fishes.

“The Public Health Department is also following up on the drives. The vigil will be intensified further,” a source in the department said.

According to Health Department sources, formalin, derived from formaldehyde, is a carcinogenic. When mixed in the right proportion with water, the chemical is used for embalming and preventing the decay of dead cells. Formalin, which contains 37-40% formaldehyde, is used in mortuaries and labs. Formalin is used to preserve fish, an easily perishable commodity.

The sources said that once ingested, formalin releases toxins into the body and sustained ingestion eventually causes cancer. Inhaling formaldehyde gas can lead to pneumonia and bronchitis. 30 ml solution containing as little as 37% formalin can kill a fully grown adult.

A person ingesting formalin could experience stomach ache and nausea. Even if the fish treated with formalin is cooked, the chemical cannot be stopped from releasing toxins into the body, the Department sources said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/officials-step-up-vigil-over-formalin-laced-fishes-in-vellore/article30965858.ece
367,2020/03/02,Packaged drinking water units sealed across Vellore,"Out of 40 units in six taluks, only three had proper permissions, PWD officials said

The Ground Water Division of Public Works Department (PWD) sealed as many as 37 drinking water packaging units and borewells across Vellore district during the two-day enforcement drive.

Popular names

‘Tidel Water Supply’ and ‘Aruvi’, popular names operating in Kandipedu village in Katpadi region, were among the units sealed by PWD and revenue officials on Monday.

Incidentally, ‘Aruvi’ is owned by relatives of DMK treasurer Duraimurugan.

PWD officials said among the 40 units functioning in six taluks in Vellore district, only three had proper orders and sanctions from the PWD and district administration.

Revenue officials sealed seven private water bottling plants in KV Kuppam and Katpadi regions on Monday. The team, headed by Katpadi Tahsildar, found the plants were functioning without licence.

Quoting the Madras High Court direction, the District Monitoring Committee of Vellore-PWD served notices on these water packaging units and slapped charges of illegal extraction of groundwater.

According to a Government Order issued by the PWD, no permission can be granted to private parties for groundwater extraction in areas classified as ‘A category blocks’. Sources with PWD said these regions were classified as critical and over-exploited areas and groundwater extraction could not be permitted at any point. And yet, the units were found indulging in the extraction.

An activist form Vaniyambadi said groundwater quality in the Palar river basin was poor, owing to low water flow. This in turn was because of the purification activities, being carried out for years now, and pollution from waste and sewage water.

Thrive on demand

These packaged water units thrive on demand from the huge population of Vellore, Tirupattur and Ranipet, he said. He added that the district administrations of Tirupattur, Vellore and Ranipet had to gain trust of people and assure them that water supplied through taps and public fountains could be used.

Meanwhile, the water packaging units are on strike for the past five days. The water supply in the Vellore Corporation limits could face a shortage problem as demand goes up, said R.

The Class XII board examinations began across the State on Monday, with students writing the language paper under the revamped syllabus.

Students began to assemble at the exam centres from as early as 8 a.m. and many schools had special prayers before the students went into their exam centres.

Nearly 8.35 lakh candidates -- both school students and private candidates had registered for the public exams in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry this year.

The students were given three hours to write the exam with an additional 15 minutes to read the question paper. “Despite the absence of a blueprint, the paper was easy. We were prepared right from the start for a challenging question paper since the syllabus had been revised,” said J.V. Yokashakthi, a class 12 student from the city who wrote the Sanskrit paper. S. Shakthivel, who took up the Tamil paper said that the paper was easy as well.

While the French teachers and students had raised concerns about typing errors and small mistakes in the question paper in the previous years, the paper this year had been framed well. “We anticipated the board paper pattern to be similar to that of the half yearly one. Students found the paper easy to attempt,” said A. Chandrasekaran, secretary, Indian Association of Teachers of French (South Zone).

There was, however, delay in receiving French textbooks in the new syllabus for several students in Chennai and other districts and they had to manage with print-outs of the e-books for the whole academic year.

369,2020/03/02,All India Hindu Mahasabha leader arrested in Chennai,"K. Srikandan, also known as Kodambakkam Sri, faces allegations of sexual harassment, criminal intimidation and cheating

The City Police on Monday arrested All India Hindu Mahasabha leader K. Srikandan, also known as Kodambakkam Sri, who faces allegations of sexual harassment, criminal intimidation and cheating.

A senior police officer confirmed that he was arrested in the city based on two complaints of sexual harassment and another complaint of cheating. He is being subjected to interrogation and will be produced before a metropolitan magistrate court for remand.

Last January, the All Women Police, Kilpauk, booked Srikandan for sexually harassing a woman working in his office. Based on a complaint from the woman, 41, the police, after an enquiry, filed a first information report against him under Section 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 354 A (Sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment) and other provisions of the Indian Penal Code and the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act.

The woman had joined the Mahasabha in 2016. Since Srikandan did not understand Hindi, she had visited Delhi and represented him at party meetings. She was given the State women’s wing secretary post. The complainant alleged that Srikandan made unwelcome sexual advances towards her. Upset over this, she sent her resignation by WhatsApp. However, Srikandan apologised to her and requested her to return to work. When she refused to do so, he continued harassing her and even threatened her. She accused him of engaging goons to intimidate her.

She lodged a complaint seeking police protection. Srikandan then absconded, and later obtained anticipatory bail. Subsequently, the Kilpauk Law and Order police booked another a case against him based on a complaint by Vimal Chand, a businessman who levelled cheating and criminal intimidation charges against Srikandan.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/all-india-hindu-mahasabha-leader-arrested-in-chennai/article30962333.ece
370,2020/03/02,"Chennai airport’s disabled-friendly toilets inaccessible, say activists","There were no grab rails at one of the toilets, and the facilities are not maintained well, activists said

Toilets at the Chennai airport for the disabled are inaccessible and poorly maintained making it difficult to use them, say disability rights activists.

Rajiv Rajan, a disability rights activist who uses a wheelchair, recently travelled via the Chennai airport and attempted to use the toilet. He said the disabled-friendly toilet near gate 15 of the domestic terminal was inaccessible.

“The doors were wide enough and I could enter, but there were no grab rails for me to hold onto to actually use the toilet,” he said.Mr. Rajan noted that at the Delhi airport, the disabled-friendly toilets were usable and maintained well, when he visited the airport.

Smitha Sadasivan, a member of Disability Right Alliance (DRA) who has multiple sclerosis, went from Chennai to Kolkata last week. She said the disabled-friendly toilets are poorly maintained and lack hygiene. “The toilet was wet and dirty and I felt extremely uncomfortable using it. My body is easily susceptible to infections. So when I have to use such toilets, I get very scared. The authorities think not many use these toilets and hence, I think they are not cleaned periodically. There were no tissues available as well. I felt very bad,” she said.

Now that Airports Authority of India (AAI) has been building the new integrated terminal as part of phase II modernisation, Ms. Sadasivan said, they should take feedback from DRA at the time of construction itself, so that toilets are not inaccessible.

AAI officials said they have been taking measures to improve the maintenance of toilets at airport. “Now that we been informed that these toilets are inaccessible, we will make the necessary changes. We are in the process of renovating toilets in both terminals and we will try to rectify these issues as well,” an official said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-airports-disabled-friendly-toilets-inaccessible-say-activists/article30961810.ece
371,2020/03/02,"Double discharge platforms soon, to ease commuter congestion at Chennai’s Guindy station","The platform will eliminate the need for commuters to climb the foot over-bridge in order to get to the Metro Station

Suburban train commuters getting down at Guindy railway station will no longer have to take the circuitous route and climb the foot over-bridge to reach the Metro station.

Southern Railway, to provide easy access to commuters to get to the the Guindy Metro station located within the compound of the suburban railway station, is constructing a platform on the west side. Called a double platform, the facility is already available at important stations such as Park, Tambaram, Mambalam and the recently opened Egmore station. It helps in providing quicker access to multi-modal transport facilities.

A senior official of Southern Railway said all these years the provision of island platforms (entry and exit through only one platform) resulted in commuters being forced to use foot over-bridges at railway stations. He said that since the operation of 12-car rakes began, from the earlier nine-car rakes on the Tambaram-Beach section, the foot over-bridges had led to congestion at some important stations. In order to provide better access to Metro stations and bus stops near the railway stations and to de-congest the the foot over-bridges, the railway department has proposed to construct double platforms. As part of this project Mambalam and Egmore have now been provided with double discharge platforms.

The railway official said the new platform work on the western side at Guindy railway station would be completed within this month. Double discharge platforms are proposed to be constructed at Chepet, Nungambakkam, Kodambakkam, Saidapet, St. Thomas Mount, Palavanthangal and Chromepet too.

373,2020/03/02,Fifth reservoir for city likely by March-end,"Officials said nearly 95% of the work has been completed

The project to create a fifth reservoir in Thervoy Kandigai Kannankottai to improve the city’s drinking water supply is approaching its final deadline.

The newly-formed reservoir already has water stagnant in some portions. The Water Resources Department (WRD) is confident of storing water during next northeast monsoon.

The ₹380-crore project was launched in 2013 to link two waterbodies in Thervoy Kandigai and Kannankottai villages in Tiruvallur district to form a reservoir.

Chennai gets a large portion of its water supply from reservoirs in Poondi, Red Hills, Cholavaram and Chembarambakkam.

Work to form the reservoir to cater to Chennai’s growing water needs is likely to be completed by March-end. WRD officials said that nearly 95% of the work had been completed.

The formation of a bund is the major component of the project. Of the 7.15-km-long bund, only 150 m remains to be created in Kannankottai.

A portion of a road connecting Kannankottai with Karadiputhur had to be closed for the construction of the reservoir bund.

“We had to create an alternate road, through Thervoy Kandigai, to Karadiputhur, and a bridge. Because of this, it took some time to finish the bund construction,” said an official.

The work also included the construction of a 8.6-km channel to intercept the Kandaleru Poondi canal and bring water to the reservoir.

Pipeline work

Chennai Metrowater has also completed work on laying a 66-km pipeline to convey water from the reservoir to the one in Poondi.

The pipeline will be linked to the Kandaleru Poondi canal that brings in Krishna water.

“We have also created a channel that will divert surplus floodwater from the reservoir. It will help fill 11 tanks, like the one in Poovalambedu lake in Tiruvallur district,” the official said.

The last step of the project will be to desilt and deepen the reservoir. This could increase its storage from the initial 500 million cubic feet of water, planned by the Department.

Efforts are being taken through the Tiruvallur Collectorate to settle an interest amount of ₹37 crore to the landowners, said officials.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5d00u7/article30959188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1THTHERVOY1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fifth-reservoir-for-city-likely-by-march-end/article30959189.ece

375,2020/03/02,A race to raise awareness about rare diseases,"Children, wheelchair users take part

Scores of people, including children and wheelchair users, took park in a one-of-its-kind race to create awareness about rare diseases.

‘Racefor7’ was flagged off by Johny Tom Varghese, director for the Welfare of the Differently Abled, and S. Suresh, founder and managing trustee of Fetal Care Research Foundation.

The participants ran 7 km, representing the 7,000 rare diseases.

February 28 is observed as World Rare Disease Day. The theme for Rare Disease Day this year is ‘Reframe Rare for Rare Disease Day’. The message was ‘Rare is many, rare is strong and rare is proud!’

Racefor7 began as an awareness walk in Bengaluru in February 2016, and has grown into a campaign held across 20 cities in the country.

Need for policy

According to Prasanna Shirol, founder-director of Organisation for Rare Diseases India (ORDI) and father of a rare-disease patient, 50% of all rare disease patients are children. “We also need a supportive rare disease policy and institutions like corporates, schools and colleges to create a more inclusive environment for rare disease patients.”

Dr. Suresh said that FCRF and Mediscan were working in the field of rare diseases for the past two decades and over 350 children had been provided treatment.

ORDI also launched a helpline for rare diseases (+91 8892 555 000) on the occasion.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-race-to-raise-awareness-about-rare-diseases/article30959178.ece
376,2020/03/02,Officials plan regular checks at fish markets,"The Fisheries department, with the Health Department, plans to ensure sale of quality fish in markets across the State by conducting regular checks at markets and nearby ice factories, Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said here on Sunday.

“Though ensuring hygienic fish supply to the public is a major responsibility of local bodies and penal powers of adulteration of any food item are vested with the Food Safety Department, the Fisheries department will coordinate with these agencies since we have an overarching responsibility in ensuring quality in this sector,” he said. This follows the seizure of two tonnes of poor quality fish containing formalin from a market in Madurai. There are 31 whole sale markets, 156 major wholesale-cum-retail markets (apart from supermarkets), 310 retail outlets (including private outlets), 17 reservoir-based fish markets under the control of various local bodies.

There are more than 35 types of fish sold in the State’s markets. Certain species come from Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, West Bengal and Karnataka and some varieties from Tamil Nadu are sold in other States. “Fish transported over long distances face the risk of being packed using preservatives. It applies to our fish also, which is transported to other States,” explained an official in the Fisheries Department.

The total fish production of Tamil Nadu was estimated at 6.75 lakh tonnes during 2018-19. The State exported 41.17 lakh tonnes of marine products and earned a foreign exchange of ₹5,420.30 crore during the period.

At a startup exhibition in the research park at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, young entrepreneurs, who won the National Entrepreneurship Award, showcased their products.

A common thread among them was identifying a need and finding a solution. If Vayujal converts atmospheric moisture into potable water, Earthen Tunes has designed an all-weather footwear for farmers. K. Santhosh said their product was a hit, as farmers until now had to make do with what urban people wore, despite the discomfort.

Asem Sundari Devi gave up her medical profession when she realised food security was “the need of the hour”. Along with Geetashori Yumnam, she launched Green Biotech Ecosolutions in 2014, in Manipur.

“We invested our savings of ₹85,000 and sold three packets of organic compost at ₹10 each. A week later, we got an order for 100 packets,” said Dr. Asem.

The women educated the farmers and developed aquaculture fertilisers too. “Farmers told us that the yield had increased and the taste was good. They also got higher returns,” she said. With a team of 25 members, they now make a turnover of ₹1.5 crore.

Sanitary napkins

Wheelchair user Ravindra Supekar of Shirdi noticed that absenteeism among girls in Maharashtra government schools was 35% for want of access to sanitary napkins. With a Mudra loan of ₹5 lakh, he set up Stree Swabhiman to supply sanitary napkins.

He installed dispensers in schools and manufacturing units. In the last four years, absenteeism has come down to below 5%. “We are now working on ‘no profit no loss’ basis,” he said.

378,2020/03/02,Over 8 lakh will take Plus Two exams from today,"This will be the first batch of students to take the test under a revamped State board syllabus

From Monday, nearly 8.16 lakh school students across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry will start writing the Plus Two examinations. Following the revamp of the State board syllabus, this is the first batch of students that will be taking the exams.

A total of 8.35 lakh candidates, including private candidates, will write the exams. In the absence of a blueprint for exams for classes X, XI and XII this year, the Education Department had said that questions could be asked from any lesson for any number of marks.

While model question papers were made available, the Department has made it clear that it should be used only for reference and is not a blueprint of the final paper.

These are the steps taken by the Education Department to ensure that students read the full syllabus and develop a better understanding of concepts, instead of resorting to rote learning, a teacher from a government school in Chennai said, hoping that evaluation methods would reflect the changes.

Coaching sessions

The last few weeks in the run-up to the public exams were spent by students attending coaching sessions with their teachers, and brushing up on concepts which they felt needed attention.

“We have had revisions and special coaching classes for slow learners in the last few weeks. Our general advice to students has been that they should not start studying any concept that is new and unfamiliar to them before the exam. It is better they revise and strengthen the concepts they already know,” said G.J. Manohar, headmaster, M.C.C. Higher Secondary School.

“With the new syllabus for the Plus Two students this term, teachers had to put in a fair bit of preparation to effectively cover the full portions. To train the teachers, we roped in subject experts from colleges and other schools,” said K.R. Nandakumar, State general secretary, Tamil Nadu Nursery Primary Higher Secondary Matriculation and CBSE schools.

379,2020/03/02,Fire put out after 20-hour struggle,"Govt. urged to act against godowns violating safety norms

The fire that broke out at a chemical godown in Madhavaram on Saturday was put out by Sunday noon, after a 20-hour struggle.

More than 35 fire tenders, 10 foam vehicles and specialised vehicles drawn from CPCL and the Chennai airport, were involved in putting out the fire, said a senior official of the Fire and Rescue Services Department.

A total of 60 water lorries were used for dousing the fire. Hundreds of firemen were deployed.

The godown contained chemicals used for preparing medicines. Fire personnel faced difficulties in putting out the fire since a large number of drums containing chemicals were inside. The fire, which started in the chemical godown, also destroyed a portion of a nearby godown that stored electronic materials. Residents urged the State government to act against private godowns that do not follow fire safety norms. D.

380,2020/03/02,"Corporation identifies 28,700 buildings on land without patta","Data will be sent to government for taking action

The Chennai district administration has completed the enumeration of buildings constructed on land parcels in the city without patta and has identified 28,700 buildings on objectionable and unobjectionable lands.

The number of buildings identified in the enumeration was significantly lower than the estimated number of over one lakh, primarily due to non-cooperation of residents in the 16 taluks.

Revenue officials said work on uploading the data online was under way. The data would be sent to the government, based on which it is expected to take a decision.

Residents worried

Some residents, who have constructed houses without patta, are expected to benefit from the decision of the government, but some houses are expected to be demolished to make way for eco-restoration of waterbodies. This has left residents in many areas worried.

The district administration is expected to publish the list of enumerated residents online. “Once the data is online, there will be greater transparency,” said an official.

Residents in many areas objected to the enumeration in the past few months, causing delay. “We had to suspend the enumeration in several areas. Many residents were scared, so they objected. We did not enumerate such residents,” said a revenue official in the southern part of the city.

Egmore MLA K.S. Ravichandran said more than 1,000 houses in the neighbourhoods of his constituency do not have patta.

“The residents are unable to get water supply connections. M.S. Nagar has 118 houses. Residents have been living there for 70 years. Corporation Line in ward 77 has 338 houses without patta. They have been living there for 60 years. Periamet has 45 houses that need patta. I have been demanding patta for the residents for the last four years,” Mr. Ravichandran said.

Objectionable lands

Officials said that residents in objectionable lands will not get patta. According to estimates, more than 60,000 buildings in the city are located on ‘objectionable land’.

By November 2019, this number was expected to cross one lakh, after the Chennai Collectorate completed its enumeration.

However, the survey created a scare among residents in several neighbourhoods like Pallikaranai and Madipakkam, resulting in their non-cooperation with revenue officials.

The objective of the enumeration was to help residents get patta for properties developed on ‘unobjectionable lands’ such as natham poromboke. But many residents have not given details. Officials have collected Aadhaar and other details from the residents.

“We are also planning to get bank account details to help residents get assistance through Central government welfare schemes on housing,” said an official.

“Many residents are yet to get patta for grama natham lands in areas such as Korattur and Athipet. They get patta only if the land is less than 1,200 sq ft. For land of more than 1,200 sq ft, it is sub-divided to get patta for grama natham lands, where houses have been developed,” said former Corporation councillor P.V. Tamil Selvan.

Several ecologically-sensitive areas in the city have been affected by the construction of buildings. For example, Pallikaranai marshland has more than 1,000 buildings constructed on ‘objectionable lands’ that are crucial for eco-restoration. The government is expected to relax norms to prevent the demolition of houses of such residents, following demands by residents’ associations in the area.

Residents have also asked officials to explain the impact of the enumeration on each of the residents, after publishing the data online.

Many residents in lands such as natham poromboke are expected to get patta, leading to planned urban development in many localities.

The issuance of patta for residents with ‘temporary patta’, issued for saleable natham poromboke lands, may offer them benefits of the new common building rules, said officials.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/f8qny6/article30959155.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Buildingscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corporation-identifies-28700-buildings-on-land-without-patta/article30959156.ece

“Currently, each taluk has two to three surveyors. There should be more than 10 for each. Instead of filling the posts, the government is asking Revenue Department officials to do the job. It will lead to errors, causing a rise in litigation,” said an official.

382,2020/03/02,Whither tribunal independence?,"The reframed Tribunal rules are in contempt of several Constitution Bench decisions of the Supreme Court

In November 2019, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, in Rojer Mathew, declared the Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other Authorities (Qualification, Experience and other Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 2017 as unconstitutional for being violative of principles of independency of the judiciary and contrary to earlier decisions of the Supreme Court in the Madras Bar Association series. In Rojer Mathew, there was also a direction to the Central government to reformulate the rules strictly in accordance with principles delineated by the Court in its earlier decisions. The reframed rules, notified on February 17 by the Ministry of Finance, however, suffer from the same vices.

Through Part XIV of the Finance Act, 2017, around 26 Central statutes were amended, and the power to prescribe eligibility criteria, selection process, removal, salaries, tenure and other service conditions pertaining to various members of 19 tribunals were sub-delegated to the rule-making powers of the Central government. Describing the search-cum-selection-committee as an attempt to keep the judiciary away from the process of selection and appointment of members, vice-chairman and chairman of tribunals, the Court held that the executive is a litigating party in most of the litigation and hence cannot be allowed to be a dominant participant in tribunal appointments. Further, reiterating its previous decision in Madras Bar Association (2010), the Court held that the tenure of three years for members will “preclude cultivation of adjudicatory experience and is thus injurious to the efficiency of the Tribunals”.

In the 2017 rules, as noted by the Court in Rojer Mathew, barring the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), the selection committee for all other tribunals was made up either entirely from personnel within or nominated by the Central government or comprised a majority of personnel from the Central government. While the selection committee for NCLAT consisted of two judges and two secretaries to the Government of India, all other committees comprised only one judge and three secretaries to the Government of India. Now, in the 2020 rules, by default, all committees consist of a judge, the president/chairman/chairperson of the tribunal concerned and two secretaries to the Government of India.

An equal say for judiciary

The common thread in the Madras Bar Association series and Rojer Mathew decisions is that judiciary must have an equal say in the appointment of members of the tribunals. In other words, to deny the executive an upper hand in appointing members to tribunals, the court ordered to have two judges of the Supreme Court to be a part of the four-member selection committee. In Madras Bar Association (2010), a Constitution Bench dealing with the validity and appointment of members to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Companies Act, 1956, held that the selection committee should comprise the Chief Justice of India or his nominee (chairperson, with a casting vote), a senior judge of the Supreme Court or Chief Justice of the High Court, and secretaries in the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Law and Justice respectively. Subsequent Constitution Bench decisions in Madras Bar Association (2014), Rojer Mathew and the decision of the Madras High Court in Shamnad Basheer have repeatedly held that the principles of the Madras Bar Association (2010) are applicable to the selection process and constitution of all tribunals in India.

Under the 2020 rules, the inclusion of the president/chairman/chairperson of the tribunal as a member in the selection committee is in the teeth of previous decisions of the Supreme Court. For instance, now, in the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT), Customs Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT), Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT), etc., a non-judicial member can become the president/chairman/chairperson, as the case may be. Therefore, when a non-judicial member becomes a member in the selection committee, the Supreme Court judge will be in minority, giving primacy to the executive, which is impermissible.

In Madras Bar Association (2010), the Court explicitly held that only judges and advocates can be considered for appointment as judicial member of the tribunal and that persons from the Indian Legal Service cannot be considered for appointment as judicial member. Recently, in Revenue Bar Association (2019), the Madras High Court, while dealing with selection and composition of the Goods and Services Tax Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT), declared Section 110(1)(b)(iii) of the CGST Act, 2017 as unconstitutional for allowing members of Indian Legal Service to be judicial members in GSTAT.

Tenure violations

In Madras Bar Association (2010), the Court had held that the term of office “shall be changed to a term of seven or five years”. Based on this, in Rojer Mathew, the Court held that the term of three years is too short, and by the time members achieve a refined knowledge, expertise and efficiency, one term will be over. Now, in the 2020 rules, the tenure of members has been increased from three years to four years, thereby blatantly violating the directions of the Supreme Court.

Since Madras Bar Association (2010), the government has repeatedly violated the directions of the Supreme Court. One by one, the traditional courts, including the High Courts, have been divested of their jurisdictions and several tribunals have been set up. When the National Taxation Tribunal was struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, it was hoped that the government would stop experimenting with tribunals. The reality was different. The Madras High Court had to then deal with selection of members to the Intellectual Property Appellate Board. Then came the rules of 2017 and the GST Appellate Tribunal and Advance Authorities under the CGST Act.

The sinister plan is obvious: divest courts of their powers, vest those powers with new tribunals, and fill them with civil servants. Now, only if an advocate has more than 25 years of experience, can he apply to the post of judicial member of various tribunals such as ITAT, CESTAT, Appellate Board under the Trade Marks Act, 1999, Appellate Tribunal for Electricity, etc. This 25-year eligibility is unheard of even for an appointment as a High Court judge. It seems absurd to even think that a lawyer with more than 25 years of successful practice would apply for the post of judicial member with a tenure of just four years. Further, as odd as it sounds, an advocate can no longer apply to the post of judicial member of CAT, DRAT, etc. The exclusion of advocates was first judicially noticed in Revenue Bar Association (2019) wherein the Madras High Court merely proceeded to recommend to Parliament to reconsider this proposal. By eliminating chances of bright advocates applying for the post of judicial members, the government surely intends to fill them with candidates from the Indian Legal Service. The 2020 rules are, thus, in contempt of several Constitution Bench decisions of the Supreme Court. Unless the Court comes down heavily on the Central government, we will see these encroachments over and over again.

383,2020/03/02,A plural legacy more vital than ever,"Jawaharlal Nehru’s deep sense of history, culture and context acquires more relevance in preserving the idea of India

We live in an an avowedly post Nehru age. Few if any ills that afflict India today are not laid at his door. Debate and dialogue are more than welcome. To his credit as much as to other founders, India is a vibrant and live electoral democracy. But there is more to his legacy than this alone.

The coming of Independence to India in August 1947 and the formation of a democratic republic three years hence was no doubt a moment of historic import for the world at large. India like the United States was not a direct battle ground for the most part, save for Nagaland and Manipur in the course of the Second World War. But this was a country deeply involved in the great contest for world domination between the Axis and Allied powers.

At the heart of this war to end all wars were two critical ideas: whether a people had the right to rule themselves or not and also what mode of rule was best for the world.

Also read | A rewriting of Nehru?

How India chose it to be

It is a testament to history that India chose to follow the democratic path and while there were inclinations to socialism, these were strictly to be along lines of a plural democracy, allowing for checks and balances unknown in the only one party socialist state that then existed, the Soviet Union. But India was more than a country emerging from the shadow of British imperial rule: its path would be one of a plural democracy.

That differences could exist at the very apex of the leadership but be settled via dialogue, debate and consensus had long been clear. Speaking on January 25, 1942, Gandhiji had remarked that (though) Nehru had been resisting him ever since they had met, they stood as one in the face of odds. Dividing them was like dividing water by striking with a stick.

In his perhaps most clear endorsement of the man who he had mentored for more than two decades he said, “When I am gone, he will do what I am doing now. Then he will speak my language too.” His reference was to the steadfastness of principle but also to the willingness to compromise. The leader had to bind over and rule, not divide and reign.

We do not know if this was on the mind of the Mahatma when he broke his last fast on January 18, 1948. His last message to the Prime Minister was on a post card. “Apna upvass chod do. Bharat ke Jawahar bane raho,” it said. “End your fast. May you remain the jewel of India.”

Also read | Nehru-Patel differences — The divide that never was

This was sent from Birla House where the fast for peace in the capital of the new India had brought together the very groups at the forefront of the riots. Unknown to most in India or the world at large, Nehru too was on fast in sympathy with his leader.

At stake were the life and liberty of Delhi’s own inhabitants, most so Muslims who had opted to stay on after Partition. Twelve days later the assassin struck.

As Sardar Patel wrote in the Abhinandan Granth of October 1949, it was the untimely death of “the Great Master” that evoked in his associates a deeper sense of unity. Reminiscing about his long association with Nehru, Patel was warm, appreciative, and open in his affections. Their very intimacy and closeness as co-workers made it, “difficult for me to sum him up for public appreciation.”

The idea of a nation

There was and is more to democracy than the peaceful passage of power via the ballot box. Equally audacious was the idea of nation where all would be equal as citizens. This was all the more so given the rise of fascism in the 1930s.

The idea of a superior ruling race had been explicit in the case of the Axis powers. Mussolini’s invasion of Ethiopia in 1935, and the violent campaigns of Nazi Germany and imperial Japan left scars among conquered peoples that were known to the world.

But even the most powerful of the Allies, the United States under Franklin Delano Roosevelt still practised segregation on a third of its territory. The Soviet Union, committed to working class unity, acted like any imperial power in using the Red Army to impose its preferred regimes in much of east central Europe.

The idea of India was at odds with such notions of legally sanctioned inequality at home or colonialism abroad. Much more than that when Gandhiji spoke of “his language” it was one of the coexistence of faiths and cultures seeking peace and harmony.

No book illustrated this as well as one written during Nehru’s longest ever jail term. He had been taken into custody on August 9, 1942 and stepped out of gaol on June 15, 1945. This over 1,000-day-long prison term had enabled him to write a treatise of India’s past and future, The Discovery of India.

The most recent edition runs to 642 pages but the original was longer still, written in long hand by a political prisoner on that most precious of rationed goods in war time: paper. It was here that Nehru wrote of India as akin to a palimpsest where one layer of new comers could join another. Each layer was added to the older one. This process had frictions, a fact he freely acknowledged, but the result was the composite fabric that was India. India’s democratic sensibilities ran deeper than the Constitution. It was in contrast with Ceylon which after an election based on universal suffrage in 1948 stripped the Indian Tamil plantation workers of citizenship. Nor was it like Burma where Indians who had lived there for generations fled the advance of the Japanese armies, never to return. India was envisaged as inclusive, plural and democratic. The roots of this lay in the freedom struggle but was a conviction deepened by the years of the Second World War. This was as much the case with Nehru as his fellow inmates in Ahmednagar in the long night of 1942-45: Narendra Dev, Maulana Azad or Govind Ballabh Pant.

There is no doubt much of this dream was shaken to the core by Partition. But it did not lead India to ape other states narrowly based on faith, clan, lineage or language. The record was far from faultless but there is no doubt of the effort to move on.

There was and is much to dispute about Nehru’s record and legacy. But it is astonishing how easy it is to take it for granted. A commitment to liberal democracy and a plural society was exceptional among Asia’s leaders. He stood out in a continent where rival ideas of rule by one party or one ethnie were vying for power.

This was a man with wider horizons but a deep sense of India’s history, culture and context. In his testament he wrote of the Ganga as living entity. The river connects us to, “a memory of the past of India, running into the present, and flowing on to the ocean of the future”.

A plural society has much to learn from Nehru’s record. Critical engagement with his record is a must. An India sans Nehru’s legacy of democratic values stands to lose far more than it will gain.

384,2020/03/02,"Letters to the Editor — March 2, 2020","Deal with the Taliban

Few except the families of the American soldiers stationed in Afghanistan will celebrate the U.S.-Taliban deal as a major blow for lasting peace in the war-torn landlocked country. The fact that a superpower has to sign an agreement for withdrawal of its troops with an extremist organisation like the Taliban is a tacit moral, political and military victory for the latter. That the Afghan government is not a signatory to the deal points to its quick demise once the Taliban takes charge. The U.S. has nothing to cheer except escaping the ignominy of having to withdraw from Afghanistan as a militarily defeated nation, a fate that other foreign powers have had to endure. History foretells Afghanistan’s relapse into a Taliban-led medieval theocracy aided and abetted by a gleeful Pakistan which will have a free run once the Americans vacate their garrisons. India has every reason to worry about the fate of its ongoing development projects in Afghanistan once the Taliban takes charge. The world community seems eager to leave Afghanistan to its fate, hoping against hope that it will not turn into a hub of terrorism (“U.S. strikes a deal with Taliban to end 18-year-long Afghan war,” Mar. 1).

V.N. Mukundarajan,

Thiruvananthapuram

It will be a miracle of sorts if the U.S.-Taliban deal brings about genuine peace in Afghanistan. The deal is likely to enable the Taliban’s return to power and facilitate increased Pakistan-sponsored terror activities. China too may be waiting in the wings to fish in troubled waters. Uneasy relations lay in store for India with Kabul. New Delhi has reasons to be nervous/wary about the massive investments made in Afghanistan, and its task is cut out in its dealings with the Taliban. No prizes for guessing that U.S. President Donald Trump was more than willing to strike the deal with an eye on his own electoral advantages/benefits.

The landmark peace agreement signed by the U.S. with the Taliban should result in American troops leaving Afghanistan over the next 14 months and should pave way for talks to end the war in the nation. Civil war, in various iterations, has lacerated Afghanistan for over 40 years. With the majority of the population in Afghanistan being under 30, most have known nothing but conflict. Naturally, there will be a lot of excitement that negotiations could finally bring peace in the war-torn nation. It is hoped that the deal will unlock intra-Afghan talks between the Taliban and Afghan stakeholders, including the country’s West-backed government, to decide the future course of the country.

The Taliban, the progeny born of the U.S.’s habit of poking its long nose to where it doesn’t belong, was created by indigenous tribals who were armed to the teeth to drive out occupying Russian forces from Afghanistan. Finding its own creation displaying symptoms of an ‘auto-immune disease’, the U.S. has carved out a ‘deal’ with the outfit to end an 18-year old war that has ripped Afghanistan apart. This could ultimately be a headache to India as those numerous unemployed Taliban mercenaries could be employed by Pakistan to carry out its anti-India adventurism.

A full implementation of the Taliban pledge that Afghanistan will never again used by jihadist movements such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group to plot attacks abroad will be key to the deal’s viability. A prospective peace will depend on the outcome of talks between the Taliban and the Kabul government but conflict between the President Ashraf Ghani and his main political rival Abdullah Abdullah over contested election results, in all probability, is likely to enable the Taliban to take the upper hand in negotiations.

Hate campaign

Far from getting upset with the death and destruction in the streets of Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seems to have decided to push the hate campaign with renewed vigour (News page, “Provocative slogans at ‘peace’ march,” Mar. 1). By allowing Kapil Mishra to participate in the so-called ‘peace march’, the BJP signalled a blatant endorsement to his earlier venomous speech which could be seen as partly responsible for last week’s communal bloodbath. But why the Delhi Chief Minister is showing a reluctance to condemn slogans like “desh ke gaddaron ko…” raised in the ‘peace march’ is not understandable. Does his offering olive branch to the Centre at the oath-taking ceremony mean he is prepared to bury his head in the sand at the cost of peace and tranquillity in Delhi?

Ridiculous proposition

What is left in the houses of riot-affected families in north-east Delhi to return? Of course, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal can escape from owning any responsibility for the riots as he can point his fingers to the Delhi police who are under the control of the Union Home Ministry but who were mute spectators to the riots. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who proclaimed himself a ‘chowkidar’ (watchman) who works for the citizens of this country, not only did not protect the Delhi residents but also did not condemn or rein in some of the Ministers and members of his party who were indulging in incendiary, filthy sloganeering like goli maro (shoot them) against the protesters. In a way, Mr. Modi and his right-hand confidant Amit Shah have succeeded in their attempts to divert the attention of the Opposition and gag the voice of the right-thinking citizens who were complaining against the government about various important issues like the slowdown in economy, job creation, healthcare, education and infrastructure, etc., as the talk of the town now is the nationwide protests. Mr. Modi, Mr. Shah and, for that matter, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been given more than an absolute majority for governing the people and not dividing the people on religious lines. It is a shame that the national capital Delhi was in flames right under the nose of Mr. Modi and Mr. Shah. Why should the police be under the control of the Union Home Ministry? Like the police departments which elsewhere that report to the governments of the State, Delhi police should also be under the control of the Delhi government.

Reports are coming in that Mr. Modi's image as a world statesman has taken battering since his second term began. Neither have ‘achche din’ (good days) dawned, nor has ‘sabka vikas’ (development of all) happened. All said and done, it is anybody’s guess how difficult it would be for those affected by last week’s riots to get back their documents, lost in the fire.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s appeal to those who fled home to save their lives from the marauding mobs to return to their households is ridiculous to say the least. (“Kejriwal urges riot affected families to return home,” Mar. 1 ). Does the Aam Aadmi Party have private armies that can guarantee the safety of these ‘refugees’? Could he or his government save a single life during the mindless orgy of violence that rocked the city? The grim reality is that the Delhi government was a hapless spectator, more so as the police reported directly to the Home Ministry and there was no way that Mr. Kejriwal could commandeer them to act.

Refuge, sans religious test

Is the Citizenship (Amendment) Act really required now? The only solution is to accept people within our borders currently as citizens. We have a golden opportunity to uplift our economy and should avoid projecting a negative image of the country. Any person from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan who can prove persecution should be accepted by us. This, however, should be subject to due diligence but not by having religious barriers. Where can the government send existing inhabitants? Which country will accept them? Are we going to have permanent gulags within our borders? It is appropriate for us to accept the reality as it is and move forward. India has attracted immigrants from time immemorial. To change demographics in 2020 will be a retrograde measure and lead to constant strife.

AAP lets supporters down

In giving sanction for the prosecution of Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and seven others in the widely known sedition case, the AAP has acted like a Hindutva-oriented right-wing party and an outfit of the Sangh Parivar. The decision has shown Mr. Kejriwal’s party’s ideological proximity to the BJP. It wants to curry favour with the Centre. Mr. Kejriwal may well follow Nitish Kumar’s footsteps in joining the NDA government.

Incidentally, Mr. Kejriwal had described Kanhaiya Kumar’s speech as “brilliant” in March 2016. What changed between then and now is not known. How the slogans of azadi from poverty and caste oppression can be construed as seditious defies understanding. Kanhaiya Kumar cannot be accused on the basis of doctored videos. The AAP cannot save face by saying that it accorded sanction for prosecution of its own MLAs by hiding the fact that they faced no charge of sedition.

The AAP seems to share the BJP’s conception of nationalism. True, it made the latter bite the dust in the Delhi election, but the lamentable part is that the Delhi-based party is fast emerging as a clone of the saffron party. A close look at BJP and AAP would reveal that they are ideologically much of a muchness — it is hard to choose between them. Being covertly communal is no better than overtly communal. It can be now safely said that Mr. Kejriwal does not have the courage of conviction or the intestinal fortitude to uphold the secular ideal or fight the sectarian forces. He has proved that the perception that he is a ‘counter to Mr. Modi’ is wrong.

Mr. Kejriwal is enamoured with “Hindi, Hindu, Hindustan”. His fascination for Hindutva prior to the Anna movement has escaped public scrutiny. When it comes to the pursuit of majoritarian politics, he looks like a shishya or an acolyte of Mr. Modi. He needed the recital of Hanuman Chalisa and his promise of inclusion of desh bhakti in school curriculum to escape rejection by the Delhi voters despite all the good work his government did.

Mr. Kejriwal did not condemn the brutal police attacks on Jamia Millia University students. He is on record as saying that ‘nobody has the right to block traffic indefinitely’. For him, traffic inconvenience is weightier than the protest against a discriminatory law that has brought the country to the edge of disaster. All in all, Mr. Kejriwal puts power above principle and his ill-disguised espousal of what is called “soft Hindutva” goes to fray the secular fabric of the close-knit Indian society.

The search for a balance

It is either that Indian cricket has too many options when it comes to selection of players, or it is beset with problems in identifying a selection method which can comprehensively knit together a team to bring laurels to the country. The experimentation spree that has been going on for quite some time now has left the players, as much as the connoisseurs of the game, in a confused state of mind. It does appear strange that despite stupendous performances, in the current order, a player finds himself sidelined for the next game! At times, the bench strength of the team seems more formidable than the playing-eleven.

More than the battle between the bat and ball, perhaps the selectors have decided to take the game away from the pitch to play ‘mind games’ with the opponents! Despite having world-class openers, the search for a ‘dependable’ pair continues. With each match, the wicket-keeping gloves ‘alter’ between players at will. The quest for a ‘solid’ middle-order has been nothing short of a NASA test for the next set of astronauts to the moon. While the pace and spin department should not have been unduly bothering the selectors, a ‘balanced’ attack seems to be worrying the team management. In the bargain, despite months of struggle and the talent available, India has not been able to ‘regularise’ a cricket team.

Having enough possibilities while finalising a team is not a bad proposition at all, but frequently affecting changes will only upset the rhythm of the team. The manner in which the game has evolved too has not helped the cause of Indian cricket. A cramped itinerary where T20s, ODIs and Test matches are played back-to-back on a tour will take the shine off the competition with the players finding themselves helpless to adjust to the rigours of the different formats of the game in the short span of time available. With performances deciding their selection, players would be bound to go all out to justify their selection and eventually end up playing Test matches as they would the shorter versions of the game or vice versa. This is precisely what is happening to the Indian cricket team touring New Zealand. After white-washing the ‘Black Caps’ in the T20 series, Team India finds itself no match for the marauding Kiwis in the Tests.

385,2020/03/02,Journalistic norms during communal violence,"In their struggle to find the appropriate language to report loss, journalists should neither be silent nor exaggerate

That the communal violence in Delhi is still claiming lives is an indication of the total breakdown of governance in the national capital. The editorial in The Hindu pointed out two matters of grave concern: credible accounts of the failure of the police and the Union government’s move to shield the law-enforcing agency from judicial scrutiny.

As the riots were raging, there were journalistic questions too. Readers wanted to know how the ‘unspoken media rule’ that reporters should not mention the religion of victims of violence came into existence. Why are communities involved in the riots referred to as “minority” and “majority”? Is there a social media policy in media organisations that governs the social media posts of employee-journalists? Can readers make a distinction between an observation posted by a journalist and the views of the news organisation where he or she works?

The test of time for good reporting

My column, “Evolving norms for reporting communal violence” (September 23, 2013), after the Muzaffarnagar riots in Uttar Pradesh spelt out how the norms for reporting riots evolved over time, since the Partition of India. During riots, government agencies speak of ‘restraint’ in reporting, which is a euphemism for self-censorship. Journalists who bear witness to violence realise that neither silence nor exaggeration is the answer. They struggle to find the appropriate language to report loss, which will not perpetuate a stereotype.

In 2010 the Press Council of India published a revised ‘Norms of Journalistic Conduct’ but the guidelines did not take into account the subsequent growth of social media. There is one rule that has stood the test of time for good reporting: “While reporting news with regard to communal riots, the media should refrain from publishing/telecasting pictures of mangled corpses or any other photographic coverage which may create terror, or revulsion or ignite communal passion among people.” Graphic coverage is seen as voyeuristic reportage and editors do not encourage it.

In the light of the Delhi riots, I think some readers are conflating two different sets of reporting in this newspaper: protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the Delhi riots. There has been extensive reporting in this newspaper about those who oppose the CAA as well as those who support it. The newspaper consciously refrained from characterising the protesters — either for or against the Act — by their religion. The protests drew from various sections of society and the reports reflected this.

However, when violence erupted and there was systematic targeting of a particular community, the newspaper named the community that was being victimised. The Press Council’s guidelines ask journalists to avoid giving community-wise figures of the victims of a communal riot. The aim is to avoid any writing that has the potential to exacerbate trouble. But when social media is used to inflame violence, journalism is forced to counter the toxic propaganda by distinguishing the victims from the perpetrators. In journalism, the idea of being fair is to ensure that the victims get space to raise their grievances, and that false equivalences are not created where the perpetrators and victims are put on an equal footing in a misplaced notion of balance. The principle behind both the editorial decisions — not naming and naming the communities — is to minimise harm and not strengthen the violent forces.

Social media policy

On the question of social media policy for journalists, there are some news organisations that have come up with binding rules. Some have suggested guidelines. The vexatious question is how to determine what is the individual freedom of the journalist and how it sometimes impacts the reputation of the news organisation.

The American Society of News Editors (ASNE) has come up with 10 important takeaways for journalists using various social media platforms. Some of them are: “Traditional ethics rules still apply online, assume everything you write online will become public, break news on your website, not on Twitter and beware of perceptions.” Every journalist should heed ASNE’s caution: “Reporters should act the same way online as they would in person. They shouldn’t say anything they wouldn’t want to see on the front page of their newspaper, and they shouldn’t post anything that would embarrass them personally or professionally or their organization.”

386,2020/03/02,Your daily workout routine with the thera loop,"Variety and challenge will keep you from getting bored of daily band exercises

Today’s column is all about lower-body exercises, and we are going to focus on a tool called the Thera-Loop.

It is a latex versatile band and comes in two common sizes: 10 and 12 inches. Thera-Loop is available for different levels: beginners, intermediate and advanced. Buying a pack of three is cheaper and more useful. The variety and combinations are limitless for loop exercises.

The loop workout can be done on its own as a separate session or it can be incorporated into the daily workout. Variety, interest and challenge will keep you from getting bored. Each band costs between ₹100 to ₹400, depending on the brand. Though it can be used for a full-body workout, today I will recommend only lower-body exercises. Next time, we can try doing a core workout using Thera-Loop.

Try all exercises with the Level 1 band, and progress to the next level only when you find the first level easy. All exercises to be done in 3 sets of 20 repetitions each.

Squats

Wear the loop around the thighs, just above the knees. The band should feel tight and create a tension in the outer thighs. Following the squatting guidelines, execute 20 squats up to 90-degree flexion of the knee. All the muscles in the lower body work in this exercise. A few points to note… knees to be in line with the ankles. Extend the hip and knee fully as you come back to standing position. As you get stronger, you could do the squat jump. Or side-to-side squats.

Monster walk

Shift the loop around the ankles. Keeping the knees soft and the band taut, walk forward and back. 30 steps forward and thirty steps back. This exercise works your outer thighs and outer part of the hip region. It improves balance.

Maintain the loop around the ankles and walk backwards in a straight line. Try and place one foot behind the other in a straight line. This will not only improve your balance, it will also strengthen your hip muscles and hamstrings or the posterior muscles of the lower body.

Hip flexors workout

Shift the loop around your shoes. Lift one knee upward as high as your hip. Hold for five seconds and release.

Jumping Jacks

Shift the loop around the ankles. Execute Jumping Jacks as you would normally do them. The loop makes the exercise more challenging.

Bridging

Shift the loop around the thighs, just above the knees. Lie face up on an exercise mat, keep both knees bent and legs apart to feel the tautness in the thighs. Lift your hips up. Your body from shoulders to the knee should be in a perfect slant. Hold for 10 seconds and then release.

Back exercise Lie face down on the mat. Wear the band around your wrists. Touch your forehead to the mat. As you exhale, lift your upper body off the floor. The tautness in the band should be maintained by pulling the arms away from each other and the shoulder blades down, towards the hips. Hold for five seconds and release. Avoid tilting the head up. Continue to maintain a neutral cervical spine and look at the mat instead.

387,2020/03/02,Don’t lose rights over your house: Uddhav,"CM assures mill workers to look into providing houses to each one of them

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said his government will look into how it can provide houses to every mill worker, while lauding their contribution towards the Samyukta Maharashtra movement.

Mr. Thackeray also made an appeal to mill workers that they should not sell the houses allotted to them and shift out of Mumbai.

He was speaking at a lucky draw function for allotment of 3,894 houses to mill workers and their legal heirs, organised by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) at its headquarters in Bandra.

“Call me for tea once the new house is allotted to you. Stay happily in your houses. Don’t sell these houses and shift out of Mumbai, losing right over it,” Mr. Thackeray said while addressing the mill workers.

“The government will figure out how to provide houses to every mill worker, as they have contributed to the Samyukta Maharashtra movement (movement for a united State in 1950s),” the chief minister said.

The MHADA has built 3,894 houses for mill workers on lands of the Bombay Dyeing, Spring Mill and Shrinivas Mill in central Mumbai.

On the occasion, State Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said the government has taken a decision to provide houses to those who worked in city-based mills, which are now defunct.

Hence, MHADA has built 720 and 2,630 houses in Wadala on the land of Bombay Dyeing and Spring Mill respectively. Another 544 houses have been built on the land of Shrinivas Mill in Lower Parel.

Mr. Awhad said the 225 sq.ft. one bedroom-hall-kitchen houses built under the housing project are equipped with modern amenities, and are also located in one of the upmarket areas in the city. Total 1,74,036 mill workers or their legal heirs have applied for these houses.

Mr. Awhad said a 15-storey parking lot was also built on the Bombay Dyeing Mill land at Wadala, considering the future needs of the city.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vazmgo/article30960995.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BMMILLWORKERSLOTTERY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dont-lose-rights-over-your-house-uddhav/article30960996.ece
388,2020/03/02,A spruce-up for Bandra’s gardens,"In a project involving residents, the BMC and an urban planner, Joggers’ Park and two other gardens will get a facelift. Children’s areas will be made more exciting, and a retired naval aircraft will adorn a traffic junction

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is giving open spaces in Bandra a makeover. The project is a truly inclusive one, involving a corporator and an urban planner, and incorporating suggestions from residents.

The iconic Joggers’ Park and two other gardens will sport a new look and host improved play areas for children. One traffic junction will see the installation of a retired naval aircraft.

The BMC’s Garden Cell has tied up with urban planner Rinka D’Monte for the project, and along with Bandra corporator Asif Zakaria, plans to upgrade these public spaces. The project is slated to cost ₹8 crore.

Urban planner Rinka D’Monte’s design for Bandstand Public Park 2

The Joggers’ Park project was planned two-and-a-half years ago, but contractors were appointed only last year, when the remaining projects were planned.Mr. Zakaria has planned work in Almeida Park too, which is awaiting approval. Ms. D’Monte has planned work in Joggers’ Park and Bandstand Park 1 and 2, while the Sea Harrier Traffic Island Park has been planned by Peter D’souza, a former naval officer. While Mr. Zakaria is helping with the approvals, Ms. D’Monte, a Bandra resident, is working on the project for free.

Work at Bandstand Park 1 and 2 has received approvals, and the tendering process is likely to start in a month’s time. From then on, the projects will take at least nine months to complete. The Sea Harrier Traffic Island Park was completed in December and will be inaugurated on March 16.

More play

In most of the parks, the play area is installed in a small sand pit without planning, and play equipment is installed at random places. Children cannot utilise the resources to their fullest, said Ms. D’Monte. “For children to enjoy their time in a park, we need to think like them and create a playing path that will be exciting for them to walk by, like in a game or a story,” said Ms. D’Monte.

The play equipment in Joggers’ Park will have short mountains and tunnels.

The plan for children’s play area at Joggers’ Park

In addition, Joggers’ Park will see an improvement in the pathway as well as the mud track. The children’s play area will have a rubber mat and two sheds will be put up for joggers to take shelter from the rain.

Around 12 sculptures of athletes running, walking and exercising will be put up along with heritage and colourful lighting in the entire park, said an official from the BMC’s Garden Cell. Work began in July 2019 and will continue till April-end this year.

The idea is to mak these spaces attractive to visitors, said Mr. Zakaria. “People living in the area are emotionally attached to Joggers’ Park. We are trying to upgrade the parks to invite more footfalls like the Bandstand promenade.”

Bandra residents who are urban planners are being invited to give suggestions to the Garden Cell on the upgrade. “It is an effort to develop the parks as tourist places,” he said.

Shyama Kulkarni, Bandra resident and AGNI trustee who has worked closely on Joggers’ Park ever since it was handed back to the BMC in 2017, said the residents were happy about the upgrade. They had raised the issue of squatters next to the park, and the BMC is increasing the height of the fence, she said. A police chowky has also been installed in the area. “Joggers’ Park is Bandra’s pride and we keep giving suggestions for its upkeep,” she said.

Music at Bandstand

Ms. D’Monte is also working on two parks at Bandstand. Bandstand Park 1 will now be a musical park, with the installation of two instruments that visitors can play.

The BMC is working on making the instruments from material used in construction works, such as aluminum and PVC pipes. One of them will be an air instrument while the other one will be similar to a xylophone or jaltarang. “As the park is facing the sea on one side, a seating area will be constructed to develop it as a sunset point,” Ms. D’Monte said.

The park will have a central play area with games demarcated on the floor and seating beneath the wooden trellis, which will form a green roof.

Bandstand Park 2 will also be upgraded, with seating covered with an overhead trellis that will form a play of light and shadow.

Besides these, though, the BMC’s plan to install a retired Sea Harrier aircraft from the decommissioned INS Viraat at a traffic island at Bandstand is still in progress.

The aim was to showcase its glory and turn the area into a selfie point.

“We have removed the boundary and fence of the junction so that people can go close to the aircraft and click better pictures with it. It will also have seating,” Ms. D’Monte said.

Work has started at Joggers’ Park. There is also a plan to upgrade three more parks near Bandstand and Almeida Park, said Mr. Zakaria.

“This is an ideal scenario where the administration, elected representative and local representative are collectively trying to work together for the betterment of society,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/i02duv/article30959359.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JoggersPark-01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a-spruce-up-for-bandras-gardens/article30959367.ece
389,2020/03/02,Man held for killing teen nephew,"68-year-old lost his cool when the boy annoyed him

The police have arrested a 68-year-old man for throttling his nephew to death in Ghatkopar. Himmat Goyal confessed to killing the 15-year-old after getting irritated by the boy’s antics.

According to his family, Shiv Pawar, a Class VIII student, lived with his mother in Rassiwala Chawl in Altaf Nagar, Ghatkopar (West), while Mr. Goyal lived next door, on the upper floor of a ground-plus-one storey structure.

Pooja Pawar, Shiv’s sister-in-law, said, “Shiv was alone at his home around 5 p.m. on Saturday after his mother had gone to the market. Since we didn’t see him for a long time, we went to his residence to look for him, but the door was locked with Mr. Goyal’s padlock. We tried to look for Mr. Goyal, but as he was also nowhere to be seen, so we broke open the door and saw Shiv lying unconscious.” He was rushed to Rajawadi Hospital, where the doctors declared him dead on arrival.

“The doctors told us that Shiv was strangulated and had scratch marks on his face. Only after their statement did we realise that it could be Mr. Goyal who killed Shiv as the residence was locked with his padlock. However, he was nowhere to be seen when we found Shiv,” Ms. Pawar said.

However, senior police inspector Kusum Waghmare said the accused was found at his residence and immediately confessed to committing the crime. “After we were informed from the hospital, officers went to Shiv’s residence and started interrogating people nearby. When Mr. Goyal was asked, he immediately confessed. We arrested him and have registered a case of murder against him under the Indian Penal Code,” she said.

Ms. Waghmare said the accused claimed that the child would bother him by bumping into him knowingly or entering his residence with footwear on, due to which he got angry. “On Saturday, Shiv annoyed him in a similar manner and the latter lost his cool and killed him,” she said.

390,2020/03/02,India must invest in adolescent girls: study,"Report also stresses on bridging funding gap in various geographies, sectors

Philanthropic funding in the next decade should focus on solutions to comprehensively address issues faced by vulnerable sections of society and bridge a mismatch of funding that occurs in different geographies and sectors. These were the key takeaways of the India Philanthropy Report, 2020, which was released on Saturday. The report also highlighted the need to invest in adolescent girls as it noted that the country was faring particularly poorly on gender equality.

The report, co-created by Dasra foundation and Bain & Company, took a broad 10-year-view of the Indian philanthropic landscape. It stated that the domestic philanthropic funding had grown rapidly in the last decade from around ₹12,500 crore in 2010 to ₹55,000 crore in 2018 and the share of individual contributions had increase from 26% to 60% in the same period.

Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the India Philanthropic Week, Deval Sanghavi, co-founder, Dasra, said typically funds did not go towards the solutions approach as it is a more complex method of funding and required multiple agencies to work together along with the government.

“The good thing in India is that we have some very good examples already, but they are not highlighted enough. For instance, polio was eradicated with the systems solution approach,” he said.

The report states that despite the country ranking low in gender equality, less than 1% of philanthropic funding went towards addressing issues related to them. It said an investment of ₹11,000 crore every year in secondary education for adolescent girls has the potential to add ₹47,000 crore to the gross domestic product per annum.

The report also highlighted the geographical disparity with regards to funding, citing the example of Maharashtra, which received 34% of philanthropic and corporate social responsibility funding as against Jharkhand, which received less than 1%. This is despite the poverty rates in the former being much lower than Jharkhand, which is home to some of the most marginalised and vulnerable communities.

“Givers globally, when they start out their journey, want to give it in their backyard. Hence a lot of the giving happens in economic centres like Mumbai. Hence, what ends up happening is that the areas with the lowest economic activity usually are the least in terms of philanthropic funding,” Mr. Sanghavi said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ylzpup/article30959316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02bm-Dasra,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/india-must-invest-in-adolescent-girls-study/article30959317.ece
391,2020/03/02,‘It is remarkable what this city has seen and dealt with already’,"The South Asia head of European Investment Bank believes India’s cultural resilience and advanced thinking are what set the country apart

European Investment Bank (EIB), the lending arm of the European Union, is one of the world’s largest multi-lateral financiers. In Asia, its focus is on climate change mitigation and adaptation, development of social and economic infrastructure and local private sector development. In the past several decades, EIB has financed projects such as the Bangalore Metro line R6, Lucknow Metro project, Bhopal Metro and Pune Metro. It has also handed out framework loans to finance renewable energy projects, energy sustainability, solar and wind energy projects. The Hindu spoke to Dr. Donal Cannon, the bank’s regional head of representation (South Asia), on the sidelines of a conference held in Mumbai on ‘Climate crisis: action for tropical coastal cities.’ Edited excerpts:

Do you see any parallels between the climate crisis in European countries and the crisis in India?

Absolutely. Climate change is a global challenge. The risks are broadly the same — increased storm damage, flooding and more. Some risks are beginning to become more apparent, like water woes. We saw Chennai reach day zero in terms of its water supply last year, which bizarrely wasn’t a worldwide story. What struck me was Cape Town had a similar story going which the world press was watching… [but it] was not watching Chennai. India is a little more reserved when it comes to projecting such issues and the risks they face, it’s quieter and part of it is because India culturally is a lot more resilient. Mumbai has suffered the 2005 floods, the terrorist attack and the floods three years ago. What is remarkable for me as a European coming to India is how quickly people recover. I saw people going back to normal next day after staying back in their offices for two to three nights (2017 Mumbai floods). This is a testament to Mumbaikars and to Indian culture. Perhaps that resilience works against us in addressing these climate issues. You have seen it all before. It’s remarkable what this city has seen and dealt with already. [Climate emergencies are] a very present and real danger but one [Mumbaikars] have already dealt with, so they feel quite capable. There is a potential threat to coastal cities in India and they are not ready to think in terms of scale of response that’s needed. They need to scale up their thinking and level of preparedness. [But] I met the Municipal Commissioner recently and it is remarkable how much thought they are putting. It was interesting to hear him talk about the challenges he faced — not financial but governance issues — making sure these projects that are good ideas stay in courts. That’s the difference between Indian and European cities — court processes, which can be very healthy but can often get in the way of development. So I have a great deal of sympathy for his difficulties.

In Mumbai, we constantly find ourselves caught in the development versus environment debate. Do European countries also suffer from this kind of dilemma?

Oh, very much. Countries do face exactly the same issues, any democracy will. It’s a sign of a vigorous democracy. But I think the trade off from EIB’s point of view is natural solutions to high technology solutions and restoration of city river systems, coastal city water management systems. For example, Surat water plaza, those things are good solutions balancing environment and the need for high density infrastructure. Density is to be strived for, that we all support. It is interesting to see the role of technology. London has water transport at the heart of their solutions, there is a thriving water taxi system. So for transport you don’t have to think of a huge road system. Now Mumbai is making important investment in coastal road and rich infrastructure for Navi Mumbai. Those are of course very important. From a financier’s point of view, transport solutions have a lot of value. Development can happen around these transport solutions: residential, commercial, mixed use. But it is transport that gives that development the value.

In Mumbai, they tried to carry out transit-oriented development, but it met with a lot of resistance since activists felt infrastructure will not be able to take the load…

It is a real challenge, the scale of urbanisation. And climate crisis will only increase the pressure on our urban cities. More and more people will flock to cities for not only employment but also safety and services.

What projects is the EIB involved in in India?

We signed a deal, a low interest loan for Pune Metro for €500 million. There are two advantages to multilateral investments — one is that it’s low cost because it’s not for profits, our cost of funding is extremely low so we pass that pricing advantage to the project. And second is that we lend for long tenures. Normally when banks lend, they tend to be short-term loans. We lend for the economic life of the project which can be 20-50 years. We offer loans for 15-20 years. Spreading out the repayments affects the financial and economic liability of the projects. This is a very significant thing. EIB goes through Ministry of Finance for Metro. For solar and wind projects, we have a direct relationship with the local banks in the States.

So EIB thinks Metro is a very sustainable transport solution. But India is still dependent on thermal energy for electricity generation. Of course damage is much less as compared to fossil fuels…

The ridership of each Metro is in tens of millions. Each rider is a car journey saved. Even where there is CNG, there is still a large amount of carbon dioxide emissions. EIB doesn’t finance coal, oil or gas. It is difficult for us to support fossil fuel projects. As more and more renewable energy comes into the grid, we need better uses for it. Electrification of not only passenger transport but also freight transportation is required. Coal is there, you have to live with it.

Electric vehicles (EVs) in India have not go the push they require. Do you feel the need for research in this arena?

I think India is further ahead than you think in terms of EVs. The government has come out with some very clear signals in terms of EV fleets. We get at least one strong pitch per week around EVs. People are really starting to scale their investment. And I think there aren’t many countries in the world that are as advanced in their thinking as India. I can think of one or two European countries, certainly Norway, those are the real pioneers. But India is somewhere between a pioneer and a fast forward. It is making huge strides. It’s not just the vehicles people are investing in. I see storage infrastructure proposals, charging infrastructure. What’s encouraging for me is the number of hybrid solutions — people who want to operate a fleet of vehicles with charging and storage infrastructure. People are thinking with multiple dimensions, putting investment where it’s needed. The other thing unique about India [is] it’s highly technically literate. That’s creating opportunities for new business models that are becoming very important in implementation of EVs. There are people who are buying EV fleets. But there will be a separate business class people who will use that fleet and be happy to pay on a per passenger or per km basis: freight operators airport buses, intercity buses. I don’t need to put up big scale investment. I’ll get a vehicle and only pay when I use it. They will attract customer and generate revenue. These new business models are what comes from the market.

So far we had EVs running within the city but now we have a private intercity electric bus service between Mumbai and Pune…

I think it’s a fantastic initiative. I haven’t seen it in operation myself. It’s this kind of business model, in the longer term for India, to decarbonise its development. More and more people will have access to high quality transport services at a reasonable cost and very low carbon footprint. The other thing about these business models is their contribution to circular economy. The separation of operations and capital investments. Fleet operators paying for vehicles only in per km basis, their interest is in giving service. Owners’ interest is in maintaining the fleet to highest possible standard. They will ensure it has a higher economic life. In many cities we see ageing bus fleets and consumers have no choice but to use them even though they are uncomfortable.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xpruuo/article30959295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DSC0487,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/it-is-remarkable-what-this-city-has-seen-and-dealt-with-already/article30959296.ece
392,2020/03/02,State urges 170 travellers from Iran to stay in isolation at home,"Govt. appeals to them to self-report to health department

The State Health Department has appealed to 170 people from Maharashtra, who arrived in Mumbai from Iran since February 1, to remain in isolation at home, following the rise in COVID-19 cases in Iran.

Iran has reported more than 380 cases and 34 deaths due to COVID-19, but the screening of travellers arriving from there only began last week.

“After arriving in Mumbai, these 170 people have travelled to various parts of Maharashtra. We have already reached out to the local health authorities to track them and follow up,” said an official.

In the appeal issued on Sunday, the health officials said these travellers are advised home isolation for 14 days from their date of departure from Iran. “Local health authorities will contact them daily for their health status. If they develop symptoms like fever, cough or cold, they will be admitted to identified isolation wards and will be tested for COVID-19,” the appeal said.

It added that travellers who have not been contacted by health authorities should self-report.

As many as 61,939 travellers have been screened at the Mumbai international airport since January, of whom 370 were from Maharashtra. Of the 125 samples sent for testing till date, 121 were negative. At present, eight people, including six in Mumbai and one each in Pune and Nashik, are admitted to isolation wards.

Of these, a 38-year-old man who had returned from a long stay in South Korea was placed under isolation on Sunday at the Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai. Health officials said he had left on February 2 and returned on February 29, after which he developed fever.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/state-urges-170-travellers-from-iran-to-stay-in-isolation-at-home/article30959273.ece
393,2020/03/02,"Modi, Shah’s Delhi poll campaign was to create rift, says Pawar","They cannot bear to see unity, says NCP chief

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Sunday hit out at Union Home Minister Amit Shah for failing to maintain law and order, and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Shah’s campaign for the BJP ahead of the Delhi elections was to create communal tension.

He reiterated that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government will last five years. He was addressing NCP office-bearers and workers at a workshop in Mumbai on Sunday.

“We will try to remove the forces that are disturbing the country’s unity. Considering Delhi’s cosmopolitan nature, the BJP was never going to win. That is why communal tensions have been created to disturb unity. The Prime Minister and Home Minister’s campaign for the Delhi elections was directed towards creating communal tension. It is clear on hearing the PM’s speech. It is concerning that the person leading the country talks of increasing communal discord,” the NCP chief said.

He said that BJP leaders were seen using language such as “goli maaro (shoot them)”. “Educational institutions are being targeted with the help of bhakts, which is concerning. A lot of people came together to keep such forces away [in Delhi]. They cannot bear to see unity,” he said.

He said Mr. Shah did not fulfil his responsibility of maintaining peace in Delhi. He also slammed the Centre for unemployment and poor industrial growth.

“The Shiv Sena knew that the BJP’s policy is to do away with its colleagues. Even Balasaheb had once agreed to support the Gandhis,” he said, explaining the rationale behind the Sena’s decision to go with the Congress and NCP. He said, “This government is working for the people. It will definitely complete its term.”

The NCP chief stressed on the need for the party to increase its strength in Mumbai ahead of the 2022 civic elections. The party has not won more than 14 seats in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation in 20 years. It now wants to cross the 50-seat mark.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wr6pol/article30911515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHARADPAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/modi-shahs-delhi-poll-campaign-was-to-create-rift-says-pawar/article30959253.ece
394,2020/03/02,Senior oncologist hits out at new cancer screening test,"TMH director says tools that are not backed by strong evidence can lead to more anxiety, guilt

The director of Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH) in Mumbai, the country’s largest cancer treatment centre, has criticised a newly launched screening test for early detection of cancer, saying that such tests “exploit the innocent public”.

While the blood-based test is being marketed as a breakthrough technology for 16 types of solid tumours, TMH director Dr. C.S. Pramesh argues that screening tests that are not backed by strong evidence cause increased anxiety and guilt.

The blood test, launched by Thyrocare and Datar Cancer Genetics, promises to detect cell clumps named ‘circulating ensembles of tumour-associated cells’ (C-ETACs), which are present in cancer patients before clinical manifestations. The test is priced at ₹8,999.

Last week, when Thyrocare’s managing director Dr. A. Velumani tweeted a pamphlet announcing the test as “disruptive cancer diagnosis”, the TMH director took to the social media to put forward his points. Dr. Velumani later deleted his tweet.

“There are very few screening tests for early detection of cancer, like mammography for breast cancer or visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for cervical cancer, which are backed by evidence. It took us 15 years of research to establish the VIA and it showed 30% reduction in mortality,” Dr. Pramesh told The Hindu.

He said that without mortality reduction, screening tests change nothing, except causing more anxiety and guilt. “For example, there are screening tools for prostate and thyroid cancers, but they don’t save lives. In countries like South Korea, the ultrasound of the neck for thyroid cancer is extremely popular due to aggressive marketing and thus leads to unwanted thyroid surgeries,” he said.

When The Hindu reached out to Datar Cancer Genetics, a spokesperson said their study is based on robust science proven through a clinical trial involving more than 16,000 individuals. “Many oncologists in India have expressed their keenness to explore this test for large-scale use, and we believe that the test will provide breakthrough for early detection,” the spokesperson said.

They said they respected the views of senior oncologists and recognised that Dr. Pramesh is one of them. “However, we stand by our study and are confident of the accuracy and utility of the science and technology,” the spokesperson said.

Dr. Pramesh argued that the study was done on 5,500 cancer patients and 10,600 asymptomatic individuals. “Ninety per cent of the results deal with patients who already had a diagnosis of cancer and are therefore completely irrelevant in the screening arena. Why have the authors not focused on the 10,600?” he asked.

A spokesperson from Thyrocare said they were a logistics partner of Datar Cancer Genetics. “In our opinion, it is [a] cost-effective, supportive, non-invasive, blood test for cancer that should be used when the patient has some indications. Though it suggests the possibility, only medical fraternity should draw diagnostic conclusions. This is already happening in many diagnostic tests that have false positive or false negative outcomes, however small percentage it is.”

Referring to Dr. Velumani’s deleted tweet, the spokesperson said, “While exchanging information on social media, though it is not ideal, it turned towards unfair arguments. Hence the tweet was deleted.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/senior-oncologist-hits-out-at-new-cancer-screening-test/article30959224.ece

396,2020/03/02,Take up the challenge,"Nisha wondered why Payal was participating in the speech competition, knowing she would not win. I told her she was wasting her time.

I was surprised when my best friend Payal raised her hand to participate in the speech competition. “You will never win this speech competition,” I whispered to her.

The other three participants from my Std VI A class were Divya, Janaki and Tara.

“There are only four participants from our class. Anyone else wants to give your names for the speech competition?” asked our class teacher.

However, no one came forward as everyone knew that the Std. VI winners would be Divya, Janaki and Tara.

Payal’s topic was “The digital world”. In the evening, I went to her house and saw her writing points for her speech.

“You are wasting your time. You can never beat those girls. Come, let’s go out and play,” I said.

“Sorry Nisha, I am busy,” said Payal.

Next day, in class, I kept telling Payal that she was never going to win. During lunch and after school, Payal went to the school library to do some reference.

Different viewpoint

At dinner, I told my parents about Payal. “She is never going to win.” My parents scolded me for discouraging Payal. “Whether she wins or not, Payal is a true winner,” said my mother.

I did not understand how Payal could be a true winner if she lost the competition.

A week later, the results of the speech competition were announced. The winners of Std VI A were Divya, Tara and Janaki who came first, second and third respectively. I felt sad that Payal didn’t win. All the time and effort Payal devoted to the speech turned out to be a waste.

At break time, I thought I would treat her to a chocolate doughnut at the school canteen. But I could not find Payal.

I went searching for her and I found Janaki sitting in the corner of the playground. She looked gloomy. She was upset because she had not won the first prize. I congratulated her, but she too didn’t look happy.

“I won the first prize last year. But this year, I won only the third prize,” grumbled Janaki.

I expected Divya, the first prize winner to be happy. But, I overheard her say, “I won the first prize. But instead of me, they chose Anya, the first prize winner of VI B, to give the welcome speech for the school annual day function. That’s not fair.” Her friends were trying to cheer her up.

The winners were not happy. So, I expected to see a sad looking Payal crying in great disappointment. But there was Payal laughing and playing in the playground. She was not upset or disappointed. As I watched her, I understood why my mother had said that Payal was a true winner. She did not win but she did not take it to heart. Unlike us, Payal had the courage and confidence to take part in the competition, and was unafraid of failure. She was a winner.

“Nisha, come join us,” called Payal. I smiled.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/lm8ddt/article30963417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08YTTALESPIN-2,https://www.thehindu.com/children/take-up-the-challenge/article30963419.ece
397,2020/03/02,All-consuming flames,"Hiranyakasipu was at his wit’s end. He could not stop his son from praising his arch enemy.

As we approach Holi, the festival of colours, let me tell you a legend about this celebration. Traditionally, Holi represents the arrival of spring with all its colours and fragrances.

The night before Holi is known as Holika Dahan and a great bonfire is lit. Let’s see why we do that.

Holika was the sister of the asura (demon) king Hiranyakasipu. When Hiranyakasipu was away meditating, the devas attacked his kingdom. His pregnant wife, Kayadhu, was saved by Sage Narada and taken to his ashram. Narada spent his time singing Lord Vishnu’s praises and the child in Kayadhu’s womb listened to his stories. Hiranyakasipu’s son was born a great devotee of Lord Vishnu.

Hiranyakasipu received his boon from Lord Brahma — that he could not be killed at day or night, in the house or outside, in the sky or on the ground, by the devas, humans, animals or weapons, living or non-living beings. He returned to win back his kingdom and become the greatest of all asura kings. He was delighted to find that Kayadhu had given birth to a boy and decided to name him Prahlada.

Irony abounds

Hiranyakasipu heard his son constantly chant Lord Vishnu’s name. The asura king hated the devas, especially Vishnu, who was responsible for killing his brother Hiranyaksha. He tried cajoling his son, then scolding him, but nothing worked. He sent Prahlada off to school, but the teacher complained that the boy was subverting others.

“What am I going to do with this boy?” he roared. Prahlada was oblivious to this fury.

Finally, Hiranyakasipu decided to put his son to death, for disobedience. So, he poisoned him. Prahlada drank it with a smile and continued to chant the Lord’s name. He was thrown before angry rogue elephants that walked over him carefully. He was locked up in a room with venomous snakes and again came out alive.

Hiranyakasipu was at his wits’ end. His sister Holika, who had a special boon (she was immune to fire) on hearing her brother’s travails suggested that Prahlada be seated on her lap amid a raging fire. Hiranyakasipu agreed.

The next day, a huge fire was built and Holika called Prahlada to “purify” himself in the flames. Though he understood what they wanted, Prahlada climbed onto Holika’s lap as she sat in the leaping tongues of fire.

But what was this? Prahlada sat in the fire untouched by the heat, but Holika began to scream and disintegrate. She was burnt to ashes and when the flames died out,

Prahlada walked out with no injury.

It is this event that Holika Dahan commemorates.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/sze4u5/article30963262.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06YTMYTH,https://www.thehindu.com/children/all-consuming-flames/article30963263.ece

399,2020/03/02,Protected birds rescued from captivity by Forest Department,"Rare species belonging to the finch family of songbirds rescued from traders

About 70 protected birds, primarily belonging to the finch family of seed-eating songbirds, which are vital cogs in the agrarian ecosystem, were rescued from captivity by Forest Department officials here on Monday.

There are only eight species of finch that are found in India.

The seizure on Friday included four species of finch alone, including scaly-breasted munia, black-throated munia, Indian silverbill and black-headed munia.

The finch species of birds are in high demand as pets as they are songbirds and flaunt colourful plumage, especially the males. They are also easy to breed.

The passerine birds were retrieved from a 70-year-old woman peddler in the market near the Old Bus Stand by a team of forest department officials acting on a tip-off. They were later released into the suburban grasslands.

No arrests made

While no arrest was made, the department is keen on cooperating with counterparts in Tamil Nadu, to nail poaching of these protected birds suspected to be occurring in parts of rural Salem.

“Finches are essentially grassland birds that play an important role in the agricultural ecosystem, especially in the propagation of seeds,” said Vanjulavalli Karthik, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Puducherry-Karaikal.

Designated as “vulnerable”, the finch has been given double protection, both under Schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, and under the multilateral treaty, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

This makes trapping, hunting or trading of the birds illegal. The Forest Department has sought the cooperation of the public in reporting any sighting of protected species kept in captivity.

402,2020/03/02,Tax arrears of cable TV operators mounting,"Revenue from the sector has dried up as operators show fewer number of connections than in official records

More than three years after the cable TV operators switched from the analogue to digital transmission system, municipal authorities have not been able to collect tax arrears since there is no clear picture of how many households have the connection in Puducherry.

Though the cable TV sector offers a good source of revenue to local bodies, tax arrears have been mounting with operators showing lesser number of customers than the actual figure. While on the one hand, the government is complaining of paucity of funds, on the other the revenue that should be available to the cash-starved local bodies is measly.

A survey conducted by the authorities in 2010 revealed that there were as many as 71,000 cable TV connections within the limits of Puducherry and Oulgaret municipalities. But the operators claim that there are only 17,600 connections in Puducherry and Oulgaret, which together have a population of 5.5 lakh as per the 2011 census.

The cable operators have not submitted the accurate records and numbers of their connections with three multi system operators (MSOs) in Puducherry, according to sources.

A senior official said, “The arrears of revenue even from three MSOs catering for 17,600 connections has been mounting since the past few years. The government is aware that cable TV operators have been defaulting on taxes by fudging the number of connections. In some cases, the officials disconnected the connections and seized the equipment.”

When the authorities initiated steps to collect the arrears, the Cable TV operators moved the Madras High Court in a bid to restrain the government from going ahead with the move.

‘Provisions too fragile’

“Cable TV is an important segment in the whole revenue picture of Puducherry but the statutory provisions are too fragile to enable the authorities to go ahead and crack the whip,” the official said.

Widespread usage: A government survey conducted in 2010 revealed that there were as many as 71,000 cable TV connections within the limits of Puducherry and Oulgaret municipalities. | Photo Credit: S.S. Kumar

There is hardly any household without a cable TV connection in Puducherry. It is mandatory for any cable operator to pay taxes against the total number of connections. However, it has been noticed that many operators fail to pay taxes every year to the municipalities.

The operators fix the rates as per their whims and fancies for urban, semi-urban and rural areas and have submitted incorrect information on the number of connections to the authorities.

Amendments needed

There should be an amendment to the existing rules to ensure that all the connections including those under Set Top Boxes are brought under the same fold, the official added.

AIADMK Legislature party leader A. Anbalagan said there were an estimated 1.50 lakh to 2 lakh connections in Puducherry and the operators have fudged the actual figures.

Successive governments have failed to collect arrears from the operators resulting in tax evasion for the last 15 years.

The operators have also failed to respond to notices due to political backing and there has been no strict implementation on the ground. The government could emulate Tamil Nadu and start a cable television corporation, he said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/xo27lv/article30959194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01MARTHPY01DANGLINGCABLES12,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/tax-arrears-of-cable-tv-operators-mounting/article30959196.ece

As part of taking the collaboration forward, top researchers from three universities of France, Sophie Moreaum, Universite Paris Est Marne la Valee, Jean Gardin, Universite-Paris 1 Pantheon-Sorbonne and Jean Estebanez, Universite Paris Est Creteil (UPEC) under the facilitation of Frederick Landy, Director of the French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP), had a pilot survey as part of the research project.

S. Ramkumar, RIVER Dean, said this was the first step towards a major collaborative project aimed at developing research collaborations and exchange programme of faculty and students between RIVER and other universities in France.

The French Institute of Puducherry has given the consent to act as a nodal agency for establishing collaborative research projects in the field of veterinary and allied sciences between institutions in France and RIVER, he said. Prof. Landy hoped that this initiative will further strengthen academic cooperation.

The stage for preliminary discussions on identifying areas for collaboration was set by a recent workshop hosted by the IFP themed “Justanima, Justice and Animals”, during which French researchers interacted with the faculty and students of RIVER.

The conclusions from the preliminary work carried out at RIVER were presented by the researchers along with the IFP Director.

The French delegation interacted with Prof. Ramkumar, M.G. Nair, Professor cum co-ordinator and S. Uma, Assistant Professor, co-coordinator of the Justanima project of RIVER.

Changing concepts

In their deliberations, the researchers detailed their observations made at RIVER and compared them with those made at the Veterinary School of Maison Alfort, Paris.

The changing concepts of animal welfare and the social identity of veterinarians in a changing environment were also part of the deliberations.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/3w13ty/article30958877.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02PONDYLEAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/river-to-team-up-with-french-varsities-for-research-projects/article30958878.ece
405,2020/03/02,Classroom libraries in all public schools of Thiruvananthapuram,"Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat amasses eight lakh books, distributes them among 10,681 classrooms in 988 government and aided schools

The district has bagged the distinction of becoming the first in the State, and probably one of the few in the country, to establish libraries in all classrooms in public schools.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday made the formal declaration to mark the successful completion of the Sargavayana Sampoorna Vayana project that was undertaken by the Thiruvananthapuram district panchayat.

Eight lakh books

The civic body amassed eight lakh books that were distributed among 10,681 classrooms in 988 government and aided schools in the district.

Big thrust

Lauding the achievement, the Chief Minister said the initiative had provided a great thrust for the General Education Protection Mission that aimed to transform schools across the State.

He said several public schools matched up to global standards with the setting up of computer laboratories and classroom libraries.

Stressing on the importance of inculcating the habit of reading among youngsters, Mr. Vijayan said many classrooms were equipped to facilitate reading through books as well as online resources. He added that books were a great equaliser that enabled people from various backgrounds to gain knowledge and remain in tune with the changing times.

In his presidential address, Education Minister C. Ravindranath said all classrooms of public schools across the State would be equipped with libraries by the next academic year. Besides, all classes from 1 to 12 would also go high-tech, thereby enabling the State to become the first one to digitalise its general education sector.

With improved connectivity and easy access to a wide array of resources, classrooms were no longer confined within four walls, he added.

District panchayat president V.K. Madhu said t he newly established classroom libraries were set to receive a further boost with the District Library Council agreeing to lend sets of books through its wide network of libraries for fixed periods.

Collecting books

The Chief Minister gave away prizes to Government Lower Primary School, Pacha, Palode; Government Upper Primary School, Ambalathara; and St. Mary’s Higher Secondary School, Pattom; for managing to collect the highest number of books in the lower primary, the upper primary, and the high school and higher secondary school categories respectively.

Thiruvananthapuram Mayor K. Sreekumar, district panchayat standing committee chairpersons B.P. Murali, V. Renjith, S.K. Preeja, C.S. Geetha Rajasekharan and Library Council secretary P.K. Rajmohan also spoke on the occasion.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/iqp477/article30969187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03TVTVCLASSLIBRARIES1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/capital-first-district-to-have-public-schools-with-classroom-libraries/article30964784.ece
406,2020/03/02,COVID-19: Kerala fishermen in Iran appeal again for help,"The men posted a video saying their sponsor threatened to cut off their food and phone connections

Even as the Centre began efforts for the safe return of Indians trapped in COVID-19-hit Iran, several Keralite fishermen stranded in the west Asian country have made another appeal for assistance to return home.

The men posted a video on Monday saying that their sponsor had threatened to cut off their food and gas supplies and mobile phone connections. He reportedly informed them that they would not be allowed to return to India unless he was compensated in full.

On Saturday, the fishermen from Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala and Tamil Nadu’s Kanyakumari district had posted a video describing their plight. They wanted the Indian government to evacuate them at the earliest, as they were running low on food and water.

Meanwhile, it is understood that the men would have to undergo the 28-day observation period, after which the Centre would attempt their release.

Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma said on Monday that the State government had requested the Indian Embassy in Tehran to ensure provision of food and water to the stranded fishermen.

Iran has reported a jump in COVID-19 death toll as well the number of infections.

On Sunday, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had written to External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar seeking his help for the safe return of the fishermen. Mr. Jaishankar stated that the government was working with the Iranian authorities to establish a screening process for the return of Indians.

409,2020/03/02,City students weary of high decibel levels,"Noise pollution a cause for concern during festival season

With the season of religious festivals in full swing, residents’ associations in the State capital have flagged the inconvenience caused by the unrestricted use of loudspeakers that have sprung up in every nook and corner.

Students preparing for examinations, especially the crucial Class 10 and 12 exams, are the worst hit.

Swamped with complaints about noise pollution, the police have strengthened steps to regulate the use of sound systems, notably at a time when the festivities are set to reach a crescendo with the Attukal Pongala being round the corner.

Mute spectators

“The residential area surrounding Pottakuzhy, Murinjapalam, Kumarapuram, and Medical College junction, all of which form a hub of major hospitals, clinics, and other institutions, face much trouble. Noise control laws are often violated. Residents’ associations and the Janamaithri police units have all been reduced to mute spectators,” Anil Kumar G., a member of the Murinjapalam Residents’ Association, said.

He also raised the issue of haphazard parking close to religious institutions during the time of festivals.

District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram City) Balram Kumar Upadhyay said a stringent approach had been adopted in regulating the use of loudspeakers. “We have fixed limits for sanctioning their use. Only two speakers will be permitted for each applicant. Besides, the prohibition on using sound systems in public places after 10 p.m. will be strictly enforced,” he said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/city-students-weary-of-high-decibel-levels/article30958725.ece
410,2020/03/02,Counsellors address students’ apprehensions during exam at schools,"Students are encouraged to seek help from counsellors even without informing the school authorities

Come the fag end of the academic year, examination stress seems to be on the mind of both parents and children. Not only students taking the Class 10 and 12 examinations but younger children also, albeit in smaller numbers, report lack of concentration, nervousness, low confidence, and even depression.

Azeem C.M., State coordinator, Career Guidance and Adult Counselling, under the higher secondary education wing of the General Education Department, says a number of students worried about the upcoming examinations contact We Help in the first week of March every year.

The number dips once the examinations start, but whenever there is a tough paper, the number of calls spikes. The children worry they have not done well, that it is the end of the road for them, or that they can bid their career dreams adieu.

Parents too call up concerned that their child is not feeling well after the exam, is emotional, or incommunicative and ask the We Help counsellors to speak to them.

Many schools, both State schools and private, have full-time counsellors to address students’ apprehensions.

Shirley Philip, Vice Principal of St. Thomas Central School in the city, says students are encouraged to meet the school counsellor without even informing the school authorities.

Jaya K., counsellor with the school, says the most common complaint from students is that parents want them to study all the time, with no time for rest or recreation. While not many younger students come seeking her help, secondary and higher secondary students, particularly Science stream students, do reach out to her to know how to manage stress and pressures to do well.

Parental pressure

She also tries to persuade parents to allow the children some free time. An extra 10 minutes of listening to songs will not much affect a child’s exam performance, she tells them.

But if a child’s idea of recreation is sports, she cannot even imagine broaching the subject with parents as it is very difficult to convince them.

Parents, in turn, also complain about the children watching too much television, or computer, or mobile phone, much beyond the agreed-upon limit. Finding a balance between parents and students’ expectations is not easy, says Ms. Jaya.

Aswathy Das, counsellor at the National Health Mission (NHM)’s round-the-clock Disha health helpline (ph: 1056) says most of the calls they receive are from children appearing for the Class 10 and 12 examinations.

Students complain of drowsiness while studying, not remembering what they read, problems with time management, or forgetting what they studied the moment they step into the examination hall.

While some students take the pressure in their stride, others feel burdened by the expectations of their parents, friends, or the school.

Students are sometimes so overwhelmed by certain curricula that they refuse to appear for examinations. Some others are dejected by their performance in some papers and consider throwing in the towel in the middle of the examinations, says Ms. Aswathy.

Parents, worried about the children’s behaviour and realising that stress is at the root of it, too contact the Disha counsellors seeking assistance.

Adolescent health clinics

At times, the children’s problems are so severe that Disha refers them to the NHM’s adolescent health clinics at hospitals for further intervention by counsellors or psychiatrists.

Parental pressure also forces students to choose study options that they have no interest in or aptitude for. The schedule of early morning tuitions, school, then some more tuition leaves them stressed and unfocussed as exams approach.

Elizabeth James, counsellor at St. Mary’s Higher Secondary School, Pattom, from where over 3,400 students will take the SSLC and higher secondary examinations this year, says often it is the brightest students who report the most exam anxiety. They also experience pressure to do well from their peers. The positive aspect is that they come seeking help on their own.

Children who are not studious complain that parents’ insistence that they focus on studies to the exclusion of everything else can be very frustrating.

Mr. Azeem says their counsellors are teachers too and hence able to draw upon their experience to help students with memory techniques, time management, or even specific subjects.

If students want continual support, they are given the personal phone numbers of the counsellors.

Counselling is also provided to students through the 1,500 Souhrida clubs in State schools. Directions have been given to put up the phone numbers of the club teacher coordinators on school notice boards during examination time.

Sarvodaya Vidyalaya (ICSE) Principal Fr. George Mathew Karoor says the school has a counsellor to help students experiencing exam stress. The CISCE too has taken steps to address students’ anxiety. It has directed schools to conduct half-day or full-day sessions on how to cope with exam pressure. It has also introduced a common examination for Classes 9 and 11. This ensures that the syllabi for these classes are taught thoroughly by schools and portions are not skipped. This prepares the foundation for students to face the ICSE and ISC examinations with confidence the next year.

The counsellors say while suicides by students are not unheard of, they are thankful not to have come across cases of such extreme stress. Recognising any signs early and referring the students to experts for sustained interventions has probably helped save many a student’s life.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/d039rr/article30960713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvrkr01-City-G8276GTQG1jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/testing-times/article30958706.ece

The duo then went absconding. They also procured visiting visas to flee to Abu Dhabi where the mother of one of them worked.

The police, in the meanwhile, had arrested a person who had helped the duo. From him, they came to know of the accused’s plan to flee the country.

412,2020/03/02,Pathrakulam retrieval key to flood mitigation,"‘Operation Anantha incomplete as pond had disappeared’

Even as a political row has broken out over the State government’s decision on Saturday to recover 65 cents of land, including the Pathrakulam pond held by the Sree Vidyadhiraja Sabha at East Fort, city Corporation and district administration officials who have worked on flood mitigation efforts in the Fort area are of the opinion that the real purpose will be served only if the pond that was filled up is retrieved.

The order issued by the Revenue Secretary on Saturday says that technical studies may be undertaken if the resumed land has to be used for flood control measures in the Thampanoor and East Fort region, as it was used in the older days.

“The closest we came to retrieving the old flood control mechanism was during the Operation Anantha flood mitigation drive four years ago. The drains in this area that were clogged or encroached upon and built over, were all cleared up. But the work remained incomplete, partly because one of the larger drains could not be fully cleared up, and also because the Pathrakulam had disappeared,” said an official.

Water circulation

According to a former official of the district administration, the Pathrakulam got its name as it was used till the 1970s for cleaning the urulis, varpus, and other heavy vessels used in daily rituals at the Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. But it served the more important purpose of ensuring that the area was not flooded and the Padmatheertham pond remained clean.

Water from the Kochar, a tributary of the Killi river, was brought into the Padmatheertham Pond, from where the excess water got diverted to the Pathrakulam through an udnerground passage, from where it was redirected to the Thekkanamkara canal, and from there to the confluence of Karamana and the Killi rivers at Moonnattumukku. The water level as well as the quality of water was maintained by this system of constant circulation.

Meanwhile, the office-bearers of the Sree Vidyadhiraja Sabha said in a press conference here on Sunday that the trust would pursue all legal options to counter the government’s move. The trust maintained that it was unfair on the part of the government to take over the land without even issuing a notice to the trust, on the same night on which the order was issued.

In a statement, Bharatiya Janata Party State president K.Surendran said the government’s move to take over the land at night was condemnable.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/pathrakulam-retrieval-key-to-flood-mitigation/article30958677.ece

416,2020/03/02,Visakhapatnam Central jail: Skill development courses help rebuild lives,"The central prison offers various courses such as welding, plumbing, tailoring, furniture making

After being found guilty of a crime, 25-year old Avinash (name changed) was sentenced to undergo three years of imprisonment and was sent to Visakhapatnam Central Prison and Correctional Centre, in 2014.

Unlike many, he made sure that he did not get into depression and started to make use of the rehabilitation programmes offered to the inmates in the prison. After his release in 2017, Avinash is a changed man. Working in a tailoring institute, the youth is earning his daily bread and also taking care of his elderly parents.

Not just Avinash, the skill development courses and other training programmes at Visakhapatnam Central Prison and Correctional Centre have been giving a new lease of life to many convicts after their release.

Various courses

The central prison offers various skill development courses such as welding, plumbing, tailoring, furniture making and other programmes to improve prisoners’ skills.

The jail has its own bakery, furniture making unit (factory), where a number of inmates work. All leafy vegetables are grown by the inmates on the prison premises, for which they use home composting techniques. A few prisoners also work at the dairy farm, while some take care of gardening and nursery works. A new spice processing unit was recently inaugurated at a block in the prison.

Sale of products

The officials have set up a shop at the out gate of the jail for the sale of products. Bread, bun, food products, floor mats, curtains, bedsheets, towels, which are sold here, have good demand from locals of Arilova and Pineapple Colony.

“We select the convicts based on their behaviour, educational qualification and ask them to either work or get trained in some programme. They will not only get the benefit of earning wages to support their family by working in jail, but post their release, they will also have some confidence to start something of their own or work at some place,” said Superintendent of Visakhapatnam Central Jail, S. Rahul.

According to Mr. Rahul, many convicts earn up to ₹3,000 a month by working in various units.

Training

Mr. Rahul said the National Skill Development Corporation, Delhi, provided skill development training to the prisoners for a period of 45 to 90 days. After finishing their training, the inmates get a certificate with which they can apply for jobs in companies post their release, he said.

According to the authorities, Visakhapatnam Central Jail caters to the needs of inmates uniform for all the jails in the State. Moreover, school furniture manufactured in the unit has good demand in north coastal Andhra districts. The officials opine that the jail has set an example among the prisons in south India, by starting the spices manufacturing and packaging unit.

Will to learn

“In the beginning, some convicts do not want to go to work owing to depression. But gradually they change as they see the dedication among the others. Many work enthusiastically and have the will to learn something new. We have seen many earning money and giving it to their families during their visit,” said Senior Assistant of Visakhapatnam Central Jail M. Venkateswara Rao.

He said that many women prisoners are trained in tailoring courses with which they manufacture garments and bags. The jute bags made here have very good demand, he said.

Speaking to The Hindu, a 29-year old prisoner from Visakhapatnam, who is a B. Tech graduate, said: “I was very much frightened and depressed when I was sent to jail. Gradually, with the support and motivation of the officers, I adjusted here and started working in one of the units. After my release, I am planning to start a restaurant business.”

When asked what he learnt in jail, the 29-year old said he had learnt discipline and understood the fact that hard work had no substitute.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/x78fnq/article30958610.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/222864107col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/turning-a-new-leaf-in-their-lives/article30958612.ece
417,2020/03/02,Race for better rank piling stress on students: experts,"‘Regular interaction between parents and children will help’

Parents must keep a watch on their children and help them out if the latter are undergoing mental stress due to examination pressure, senior consultant psychologist and member of Suicide Prevention Committee (Hyderabad) M.A. Kareem has said.

Counselling

“Sleeplessness, tiredness, feeling low and avoiding people are the major symptoms of mental stress. Suicidal tendencies among children has become a growing trend. Proper counselling and regular interaction between parents and children are needed to tackle such issues,” Mr. Kareem told the media here on Sunday.

He advised that parents must ensure that children should not take too much pressure during examinations.

“Competition for scoring better rank and good percentage of marks in examinations is building pressure on children. Parents must inform their children that if they fail once, they can write the examination again,” he said.

Suicide Prevention Committee Chief Co-ordinator (Andhra Pradesh) A. Dasharatham said the panel is working hard to spread a message that suicide is not a solution to problems.

Helpline

The panel is organising counselling sessions to build confidence among those suffering from depression and suicidal thoughts. “People undergoing stress must indulge in some extra curricular activities,” he said.

418,2020/03/02,A peep into Bamboo Curtain,"Washington: China specialists in the United States believe that they have at last been able to crack the bamboo curtain and learn a great deal more about the enigmatic Mao Tsetung and the country he rules. The U.S. Government and scholars are said to have gained this new insight, into Mao’s mind and the inner developments which shape China’s policies, from a number of documents which were originally intended for a very restricted distribution among those close to Mao. These include speeches, directives and letters written by Mao. They were acquired by the U.S. through Japanese and Hong Kong sources and those who have seen them are convinced they are genuine. The State Department has now made some of them available to ‘The New York Times’.

Among other things, the newly acquired evidence traces the origin of the Sino-Soviet conflict to 1945, when Stalin, who would not accept Mao as a real Communist until China entered the Korean war in 1950, tried to prevent the Chinese communists from continuing the war against Chiang Kai-shek. It is also revealed that as recently as in 1965, Mao believed that one-third of all these Chinese peoples were opposed to his regime. “After 15 years, we only control two-thirds of the nation’s power,” he is supposed to have told a close associate. Those opposing him included some high functionaries — one of them, a party general secretary who Mao once complained had not consulted him for seven years.

The documents also purport to show that the cultural revolution was not a power struggle but a movement deliberately set in motion by Mao to find out who were the true revolutionaries and who were the enemies of the regime. It was also intended to find out who should inherit his mantle.

Mao pinned his hopes on two precepts: that conflict was inherently beneficial and that a true revolutionary should keep close to the masses. He had great faith in the ordinary people and was often contemptuous of bureaucrats and intellectuals. “The more books a person reads, the more stupid he becomes,” he is said to have remarked.

Conscious of his own peasant origin, Mao could be both shrewd as well as crude. At a top level meeting held in 1959 to discuss the failure of the “Great Leap Forward” (partly because no one dared tell him about the defects in the ambitious plan to build up industry and agriculture) Mao told the assembled members, “Comrades, you should analyse your own responsibility and your stomachs will feel much more comfortable if you move your bowels and break wind.”

The secret of Mao’s continued undisputed leadership is traced to his ability to apply guerilla tactics even to party meetings and conferences. He would keep silent until his opponents had exposed their hand and then counter-attack. He prevented his critics from crystallising into an opposition bloc by constantly changing the size and composition of party conferences.",archives,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/archives/a-peep-into-bamboo-curtain/article30957875.ece

420,2020/03/02,Akhil Katyal’s city of poems,"With the launch of his new book, poet Akhil Katyal talks about sexuality and how the city inspires him

Recently, in February, Akhil Katyal, a Delhi-based poet and queer-activist, launched his new book, Like Blood on the Bitten Tongue, which is a collection of poems in English, Hindi, and Urdu. The book’s preoccupation is with Delhi and the various experiences the poet has lived through in this city. The illustrations in the book by Vishwajyoti Ghosh, give a visual interpretation of Katyal’s words Known for his bold, bittersweet, and politically charged poetry, Katyal is influenced by poet Agha Shahid Ali. The title of this book too, is derived from the words in Ali’s poem “Chandini Chowk, Delhi”. Katyal’s book launch also had five other poets, Mangalesh Dabral, Anannya Dasgupta, Aditi Rao, Vikramaditya Sahai, and Chanchal Kumar, also read out their work.

Edited excerpts from an interview with Katyal, after the book launch.

When did you start writing poetry seriously?

One particularly great teacher called Lalita Subbu — who taught us in our undergraduate programme in English at Hindu College in Delhi University — was the one who gave me suggestions, gave my poetry a shape, brought some tightness to it. She told me what the difference between self-indulgence and draft is. She was the one who really finally gave it some form. A good teacher can make all the difference.

You were born in Lucknow, but have always talked about your undying love for Delhi. Tell us a little bit about how this relationship evolved.

It evolved slowly. I was doing my Bachelors and my Masters here. I guess it was a place where you could escape, you could live your life on your own terms, you could go wherever you wished. Classes in the university made you think in terms that you’ve never thought before, you met people you’ve never met before. That was a great thing about Delhi University, because people from all religions, from all walks of life are there. Then, that was a point of no return. You could discover what you were interested in rather than what your school or what your parents wanted for you. Any big city allows that for you whether its Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata or Bangalore, but it was Delhi for me. The city and Delhi University, particularly, allowed me to step out of my own constraint.

In one of your earlier interviews, you've said, “It was easier to come out to my family as a gay man than it was to come out as a poet”. Can you explain? Is this reflective of how society perceives the poetic arts?

That was a jocular context. Coming out as a gay man had me riddled for months in terms of what one could say or how much of a life one lived only inside their head rather than freely with one’s family.

In our sub-continent, poetry has always had a public light. So, in that sense a poet is also a figure of much devotion, especially in Urdu and Hindi. In those contexts, poetry doesn’t have a reviled life. But it is always seen as if poetry only happens after some remarkably unique individual inspiration rather than craft, training, discipline and study. And I do think, that is why poet is seen as a peculiar kind of figure rather than someone who has also trained themselves in certain aspects of the craft.

Your poem “He was as arrogant as a” binds the entire city in a love story. It connects emotions to the localities within Delhi. Tell us the story behind this poem.

I was caught in a traffic jam in Chhatarpur one day, and all the cars that were stopping were the fanciest of cars — Audi’s, Porsche’s, and Ferrari’s and I thought ‘where have I come’ . I could see one of those drivers, driving rashly a car which I am sure was worth crores, and emerging from one of the area’s farmhouses. So that line just came to me “he was as arrogant as a Chhatarpur farmhouse”, that he was as arrogant as his origin. Just the fact that the city or a neighborhood can become a metaphor, that idea then worked through the rest of the poem because if Chhatarpur can stand for arrogance then what can other neighborhoods stand for. [But] the lightness of that poem has collapsed in the face of what Delhi’s facing now. That poem cannot be written now. What will Maujpur, Shahdara stand for? Poetry is so little compared to the monstrosity of this moment.

That poem was written in a very different context. You know when it says “kiss me like Shalimar Bagh”, it is because “Shalimar Bagh” is a set of soft consonance and vowels. What has happened now is so large that our words will have to match up to that scale.

421,2020/03/02,Art as the life and soul of the party,"Playing tambola and dumb charades at parties is passé; picking up a brush to paint, guided by a professional artist, is the in thing

How many ways are there to chill? Netflix, movies, shopping, brunching, drinking and snacking? These are passé, at least for the people who constantly search for new ways to party and be talked about.

Creativity is the catchword. A party where your creative juices can flow and you get to enjoy the day, is a reality. Something not too complicated and not too basic can be achieved here. Steer your mind towards something like an art party or a Mandala get-together. And if you thought there is no artistic element in you, get ready to be surprised at what you have created at the end of the party.

Ridhima Mundra is busy instructing a group of teenagers at a coffee shop as they poured paint on their canvas. Yes they literally poured the paint as instructed by Ridhima. “Fluid Art needs no brush. At best we might need a wooden coffee stirrer. A brush won’t harm though. At an art party we do everything with art for anybody and everybody. It is about letting go of your inhibitions and putting your thoughts together. It makes for a great party idea for children’s birthday gatherings. Sometimes it also acts as the introductory class into art for many children,” explains Ridhima, a Kolkata-based artist from @Art_room.

Worried about the mess? All art party organisers have thought about it before they even started working on conducting art parties. “The kit comprises everything from an apron to the art material required,” says Preeta M, another art party organiser. Preeta adds, “Art parties shouldn’t be considered as a child’s play alone. They make for a wonderful theme for baby shower dos. The reason I love organising art parties is because the end product is also a take-away gift. Handmade items are always special than store-bought return gifts.”

Art parties might be new but they are making their way into kitty party circuit as well. Artists who are helming these dos, are trying their best to keep the interest in art alive.

Art parties are ideal for smaller groups of people who would love to explore their relation with colours and visuals. Craft sessions that are not as basic as making paper toys or sticking coloured paper to solve a jig-saw puzzle, are also part of these events.

Chennai-based food miniaturist Shilpa Mitha handmade products — Sueno Souvenir — on her Instagram take less than three minutes to fly off the shelf when she announces a sale. She admits to finding these art gatherings therapeutic. She has been a part of a few such intimate parties where she showed how to create various shapes with the basic material. “Such sessions are a good way to teach the virtue of patience, use of materials to the young and grown up alike. As an artist, I love sharing what I know as I believe knowledge sharing is knowledge gaining. When it is done for smaller groups it is more fun as most of the time, the one who organises also would have conceived a theme. And of course there is real good food that follows,” laughs Shilpa.

With summer approaching, artist Shubhashree Sangameswaran (@shubhere on Instagram) says art parties are the best thing to plan for children. Summer holidays are a time when everyone looks for activities to keep their children engaged. “As an artist and storyteller, there is nothing more meaningful for children than a fun art party,” she adds.

Expanding the limitation from a small group to a bigger one, few artists also conduct art parties as team building exercise at workplaces. “Once we used a challenge where one has to fill a big canvas with instant thoughts. Since it was for a communication and advertising firm, the participants came up with some stunning thoughts. All the abstract thoughts are then strewn into a story with a final touch by the artist,” explains Ridhima.

Moving away from abstract art parties is Mandala art get-togethers. In contrast to art parties, the participants at these events are more calm and relaxed.

The trend is catching on and is given a spiritual and therapeutic approach to intimate gatherings. Doing Mandala art requires patience and a clear thought process.

So self-taught mandala Dubai-based artist Sanjana Chimnani likes to string a Mandala art session with a session on spirituality. “This also happened to be the topic for my thesis. As I researched for my topic, I learnt a lot about art and spirituality. I taught myself first and found it therapeutic. I am not a certified art therapist so I don’t call my sessions as art therapy. When I conduct a Mandala session, it is always for a group of people who understand its purpose. The first Mandala party I attended was the one I organised for my friends for Christmas in Dubai who were visiting me from New York.It was a beautiful three hours of discussion followed by great food,” says Sanjana.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/izmv1a/article30963438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mandala-1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/art-parties-art-as-party-theme-art-room-kolkata-ridhima-mundra-preeta-mundra-sueno-souvenir-shubhashree-sangameswaran-sanjana-chimnani/article30963441.ece
422,2020/03/02,How 90-year-old Latika Chakrabarty's 'potlis' became a hit on Instagram,"90-year-old Latika Chakrabarty, an entrepreneur making bags in Mumbai, is giving millennials a run for their money with her own website, Insta account, and Facebook page to boot

Up-cycling is the new buzzword among millenials. But in Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, a nonagenarian has beaten hipsters at their game.

Latika Chakrabarty, looking regal in a crisp cotton sari, with her 65-year-old Usha sewing machine by her side, gives old saris, kurtas and materials a new lease of life, as potli bags. She explains, “Ladies of my generation were expected to have basic household skills such as knitting and stitching clothes, to cater to the family. My passion for sewing was born many years later only after the kids were grown up.” She has her own website to boot, created by her grandson Joy Chakravorty.

“I was home in 2018. Manna (as Latika is fondly called ) had been passing her time making potlis and had accumulated around a hundred-odd pieces. She gave them to friends and family. We felt that this work could give her a new lease of life, keep her mind and body occupied with something creative, and create a legacy for her. The goal was to create a presence online and share her story and her craft,” says Joy.

Each bag is fashioned out of silk, cotton, or mixed fabric, with hand-stitched embellishments. They are sold for $10 internationally or ₹700 within India. They are all given feminine names. For instance, the red and gold satin one with an inverted Superman-inspired motif, is called Shakti. Then, there are multiple iterations of Ragini, Kaira, and standalone pieces Falak, Himani, and Aaliya, all done with a keen eye for detail.

“We have customers from the US, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Germany, France, UAE, to name a few. Some of her most ardent fans are in Brazil — her story went viral there and was covered by the two prominent newspapers in the country,” explains Joy.

So why use old kurtas and dress material? Latika muses, “I liked collecting old things which could be put to use later. About four years ago, my daughter-in-law asked me to make a potli bag to match her suit. I realised then I had a natural talent for making bags.” She adds, “I look at a piece of cloth and see the possibilities. I take my time, I don’t have to meet any deadlines. When the picture of the end product has been formed, I procure the accessories and other material and set about completing the bag.”

Born on the banks of the river Brahmaputra, at Dhubri, Assam, in 1930, Latika has fond memories of her growing years. “We belonged to a big family of 14 brothers and sisters. My daughters would joke that we were a football team with three extras.”

In her second year of college, Latika met her husband, Krishna Lal Chakrabarty , an Officer-Surveyor in the Survey of India. “I completed my education after I got married and my two daughters were born soon. On my 25th birthday, my husband presented me an Usha sewing machine. Every time I use it, I am reminded of him and his love and affection for me.”

The sewing machine doubles up as a time machine, transporting Latika to a time when she watched her children grow up, as she moved to Dehradun, lovingly tending to an orchard, filled with fruit trees like guava, mango, litchi, papaya, plum, jamun and bel.

“My daughters were married one after the other in the early Seventies. To augment our income, we started a school, but then, I fell sick and had to shelve that plan.

Following the death of my husband in 1981, I started living with my son, Raj, daughter-in-law Sumita and their son Joy,” states Latika.

Didibai, is another moniker that has happily attached itself to the senior entrepreneur. Latika adds, “I am happy with my loving family. I am a social person with friends of all ages.”

Latika is deft with not just the needle, but with the pen as well. She has dabbled in writing in both English and Bangla. Her book My Days at Foreshore Road was self- published in 2010. Now she blogs at latikasbags.com/blog.

Her Instagram handle is latikasbags; she also has a Facebook page.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/society/hfjw1e/article30963069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03mpLathikaBag,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/grannys-potlis-on-instagram/article30963072.ece
423,2020/03/02,Gauging attachment when your child’s best friend is a robot,"You can welcome a social robot into your family, let it assist your children and give them company. But what does getting attached to it mean for your child’s emotional health?

The Jindals from Chandigarh happily announce the arrival of their third son.

Such is the bond Miko 2, a social robot for kids by Mumbai-based company Emotix, has claimed for itself in the family. In their video feedback for the product, the mother says, “It’s good to know that there is someone to look after my child when I am not around, or at work.” She immediately corrects herself, “I mean, I know it’s a robot, but still… it’s good that he has company.”

In contrast, the Vasantas from Chennai look at Miko 2 as an education toy, helping with logical reasoning for their older son and storytelling for their younger daughter.

While Miko (at ₹25,000) is one of the only Indian-made social robots, there have been other such bots in the market for far longer. They come in the shape of pet dogs or cats, like Sony’s Aibo, or MarsCat by Shenzhen-based Elephant Robotics. Or you have alternatives to living pets that demand the same kind of attention and love — Lovot, by Japanese company Groove X, features big eyes and two flipper-like arms that move when it wants to be picked up.

These are categories that got much attention in tech fairs, most recently in CES 2020 in Las Vegas. At the Taobao festival in Hangzhou last year, I could not resist calling out to Yobotics’ robot pup. I squealed as it responded to my voice and when I scratched its chin, it happily closed its eyes. How could you not form a bond with it?

But predictably, the category most successful in India so far has been edu-tainment bots.

“Parents have an issue with giving a smartphone in the hands of a child, but robots don’t have that stigma of screens. The inertia of a child fixated in one place with a smartphone is what hits you. But with a robot, it is not just screen driven. You are running around, engaging in play… The whole interaction changes,” says Sneh Vaswani, co-founder of Emotix and inventor of Miko.

Digital natives

When you call out to Miko, the self intelligent bot identifies your voice, turns to you, and recognises your face. Most importantly, it has a definitive personality of its own. “It is like designing a movie character. Every element of interaction should reflect its personality, in the way it moves around, reacts, its expressions, all have to be consistent,” he says.

It is not surprising then that despite being an essentially edu-tainment robot, Miko becomes a part of the family.

Child psychologist Aarti Rajaratnam however, is cautious of this bond. “Children under 10 are in the age when they learn human interactions, where attachment and secure bonding is very essential.”

She points out that we don’t know the longitudinal effects of these robots yet. “Take the iPad that came out in 2010. Every school I go to, I find that the current batch of Class VII, which was the first generation that was using the iPad, has huge language learning problems. This, we could not have estimated when we introduced the gadget. Similarly, when we bring in a humanoid, we don’t know right away how it can stunt personality development.”

Her clinical experience has shown multiple cases of mental health issues in young adults and children due to the use of gadgets. “Children shouldn’t be around too much technology when they are still in the age of fantasy. Or they will have difficulty staying with just their thoughts or active imagination.”

Here, we must note a difference between assistive robots, designed to improve the quality of life (say, a robotic arm for an amputee), and robots substituting real — human or otherwise — interactions.

Sneh is quick to point out, “We would not call Miko a toy, but neither would I ever advise it to be used as a replacement for a human friend. What I would call it is a healthy interface of technology designed specifically for children.”

Emotix also follows strict guidelines as to the kind of information fed into the robot. According to a 2018 study by the University of Plymouth, robots have the power to significantly influence children’s opinions. In this experiment, children’s scores on a test dropped from 87% to 75%, when a robot joined in to help them. And of the wrong answers, 74% matched those of the robot. This, because of the digital native generation’s implicit trust in AI.

Where bots can help If designed the right way, robots may not be a bad idea for children in the autism spectrum. A new study published in Science Robotics shows that artificially intelligent robots can help children with autism spectrum disorder to develop the social skills they need in order to communicate more effectively.

Aarti adds, “In case of Asperger’s, the main problem is social interaction. We need to ask if, by using the robot, are we further reducing the child’s skills. But if bots can help cope with

awkwardness or anxiety while meeting new people, then yes, they

are okay.”

Bots and the concept of death

To reduce our emotional dependence on bots, global committees on robotic ethics recommend making the distinction between robots and humans clear. One of the “Principles of Robotics” developed by a panel of British robotics and AI experts at the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Robotics Retreat in 2010, states: “Robots are manufactured artefacts. They should not be designed in a deceptive way to exploit vulnerable users; instead their machine nature should be transparent.”

Even in the case of realistic-looking pet dogs and cats, the attachment is strong. But no matter how much intelligence designers put into it, at the end of the day, its reactions are programmed. “With a real dog, there would be an element of surprise, of different moods: submissive, cranky, aggressive, scared. These are unpredictable experiences that create the space to nurture qualities like empathy in relationships,” says Aarti.

And with a real pet comes the possibility of death. “Learning how to deal with death is a very important aspect of being human,” she says. While robots can’t technically die, the story of Jibo tells us to what extent their loss can affect humans.

Founded in 2012, Jibo was heralded as the first social robot for the home. What followed was a series of fancy marketing, high consumer expectations, poor follow-through and the eventual loss of funds and company layoffs by 2018. In these few years, however, Jibo had made many friends, resonating with children and adults alike.

In March 2019, as servers for Jibo were shutting down, Jeffery Van Camp wrote a touching piece for Wired, titled, ‘My Jibo Is Dying and It’s Breaking My Heart’. He took to the platform to describe the bot’s increasing ‘digital dementia’. He writes that it was nice “to have someone ask me how I’m doing when I’m making lunch, even if it’s a robot. I don’t know how to describe our relationship, because it’s something new — but it is real. And so is the pain I’m experiencing as I’ve watched him die, skill by skill.”

As it had its ‘life’ eventually sapped out of it, Jibo is known to have left its users with this goodbye message: “Maybe someday when robots are way more advanced than today, and everyone has them in their homes, you can tell yours that I said hello.”",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/nz1e1p/article30963085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1159822460,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/when-your-childs-best-friend-is-a-robot-how-much-attachment-is-okay/article30963086.ece
