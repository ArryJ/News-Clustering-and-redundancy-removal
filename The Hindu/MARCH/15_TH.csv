0,2020/03/15,Coronavirus threat: Footfall drops in Bengaluru markets,"K.R. Market and Russell Market report drop in business by as much as 50%

Two of the city’s oldest and busiest markets — K.R. Market in the heart of Bengaluru and Russell Market at Shivajinagar — have reported a drop in business by as much as 50% on account of people avoiding crowded spots following COVID-19 threat. This drop, they said, was recorded even before the government announced that malls, theatres, and pubs would be closed for a week from March 14.

The shops in the markets are deserted. “The number of customers has reduced significantly in the last 10 days. Now, we are lucky if some five or six people come in every day,” said Ambuja, a vegetable vendor at K.R. Market.

Other vendors share similar stories and many expressed concerns over how they will be able to make ends meet if the situation continues for a long time.

Mohammed Idrees Choudhury, general secretary of the Russell Market Traders’ Association, said, “In my 35 years of business, the volume of sales last week was the lowest I’ve seen. Dark days are ahead. Many shops in the market have downed the shutters. Shop owners are not doing enough business to even pay daily wage workers.”

Expressing her concern over the fall in business, Cheluvamma, a vegetable vendor at K.R. Market, said, “Usually, we are able to sell our stock of fresh green vegetables by 10 a.m. Now, even if we sit in the market for the entire day, it’s no longer a guarantee that the stock will be completely sold.”

Fear over cleanliness

The spread of communicable diseases remains a concern for traders and shop owners in these markets. “We have alerted officials over the need to clear garbage multiple times. However, there has been no change on ground. We are concerned about the health of our staff and people who visit the markets,” said G.M. Divakar, president of K.R. Market Flower Merchants’ Association.

Ravikumar Surpur, Special Commissioner (Health), Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), said, “Since markets play a crucial role in supplying essential commodities, we cannot shut them down. We can take steps, such as conducting awareness drives and educating vendors about sanitation practices. We will start implementing these shortly. Since the situation is still dynamic, we are following the advisories issued by the State Health Department.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ykkceu/article31077384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGRUSSELL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-threat-footfall-drops-in-city-markets/article31075316.ece
1,2020/03/15,COVID-19 | Bus stands and metro stations deserted as many stay at home,"BMTC cancels 600 bus services; KSRTC puts losses at ₹1.75 crore since March 1

With malls, theatres, schools and colleges closed as per the government’s order to contain further spread of COVID-19, some of the busiest parts of the city on Saturday wore a deserted look. With people choosing to stay indoors, ridership of public transport such as city buses and Namma Metro was low.

On Saturday, the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation announced that barring Vayu Vajra AC bus services that is operated to Kempegowda International Airport, it has cancelled 10 per cent of its schedules due to poor ridership. However, the corporation maintained that schedules were cancelled only on routes where high frequency of services were being operated.

A senior official of the BMTC said, “Due to poor response we have cancelled around 600 buses doing 7,000 trips per day. This arrangement may continue for a week.” Obligatory and single schedules routes remained untouched. The corporation said the move will have no impact on students who are relying on bus services to reach exam halls.

On airport services, the official said, “We have not seen any significant fall in number of the ridership in Vayu Vajra services operate to the airport.”

The number of people travelling in Namma Metro too dropped on Saturday. Shankar A.S., Executive Director, Operations and Maintenance, BMRCL, said, “Usually on weekends, people travel in Namma Metro to reach malls and temples located nearby metro station. The number of people travelling in metro was less on Saturday, however, we did not make any changes in the schedules.” Even autos and taxis who park their vehicles outside malls too faced difficulties in getting passengers.

Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation also decided to cancel 92 premier inter-State bus services. Buses operate to various destinations such as Hyderabad, Tirupati, Chennai, Mantralaya, Ooty, Panaji and others have been cancelled. Due to COVID -19 scare, there is a 20% drop in online booking. In a release, the corporation said it incurred a revenue loss of ₹1.75 crore between March 1 and March 13.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/7qfioc/article31073379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGCORONABUSEMPTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bus-stands-and-metro-stations-deserted-as-many-stay-at-home/article31073380.ece
2,2020/03/15,Govt. asks people not to hide travel history,"No new cases reported in Karnataka on Saturday

With some passengers who arrive from overseas not revealing complete information about their travel history, the State Health Department has called upon people to share accurate details with the authorities.

“Travelling to other countries is not a crime. And every international travel does not mean the person is infected with COVID-19. In the present scenario, it is important for people to be responsible and share accurate details, including travel history and other movements,” said Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Saturday.

Referring to the fifth COVID-19 positive case in Bengaluru, who returned with his wife after honeymoon in Greece, the Minister said: “Earlier, the husband told us that his wife went to New Delhi from Mumbai. But after investigation, it has come to light that she had travelled along with him to Bengaluru. However, she did not move out of the Kempegowda International Airport and continued her journey to New Delhi after four hours of landing from Mumbai.”

“As the wife did not come out of the airport and boarded another domestic flight to New Delhi, she was not screened at Bengaluru airport. She landed in New Delhi and took a train to Agra and we are worried she may have spread the infection to several others. While the couple’s contact tracing is under way, it is unfortunate that patients are not sharing correct details,” he said.

Asked if the couple is eligible for legal action, Mr. Sudhakar said: “They are already mentally disturbed as they have tested positive for the disease. Let us allow them to first come out healthy from their isolation.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/govt-asks-people-not-to-hide-travel-history/article31073374.ece
3,2020/03/15,"Many ‘pubs’ open, but only a few patrons on weekend night","The State government’s decision to include pubs but not restaurants and bars in its list of places that have to be closed for a week as a precautionary measure against the spread of COVID-19 was the cause of much confusion among both customers and owners.

On Saturday night, even as the police were cracking down on commercial establishments, many remained open though there were only a few patrons in these otherwise crowded watering holes.

Owners claimed that they were not violating any rules as the government had only included pubs in its list. The director of a popular chain said it came down to the legal definition of a pub.

“The Excise Department’s definition of a pub is one that operates with an RVB licence. An RVB licence is granted to an establishment that chooses to serve only beer on tap. However, though some establishments are perceived as brewpubs by the public, they have a CL9 licence which allows them to serve spirits as well as craft beer,” he said.

However, on Saturday night, the police started ordering pubs to shut down.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) S.D. Sharanappa said the patrolling police have been directed to conduct checks to ensure that the order is complied. However, sources said some pubs are running with nexus of patrolling and jurisdictional police. Several owners criticised the government’s handling of the situation and said between Friday and Saturday, they got multiple communications from different departments.

“On Friday evening, we were told that we would have to shut from midnight. But then in the morning, the Excise Department said we could function as we have a CL9 licence. Then the police and the BBMP said we had to shut down,” said another owner of a chain of pubs.

However, people seemed to be exercising caution as most of restaurants and hangspots were relatively empty. On most weekends, party-goers gather in large numbers at Lavelle Road, Church Street, Brigade Road and other places. However, on Saturday, the roads were empty and hardly anyone was seen walking on the road.

An employee of a pub on Lavelle Road said, “We are functioning as usual. However, the number of customers has come down, so we are closing the business early.”

Owners of some establishments said they would seek clarity from the excise department and other concerned authorities.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/many-pubs-open-but-only-a-few-patrons-on-weekend-night/article31071483.ece
4,2020/03/15,"Roadworks in Chennai disrupted by politicians, say contractors","Bribes demanded, Corpn. official told

Contractors engaged by the Chennai Corporation have alleged that politicans often disrupt road relaying work, demanding money.

The Greater Chennai Corporation Contractors Welfare Association has complained to Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash that “threats from political party people” have affected “execution of road relaying work at night”.

Many of the 327 contractors in the association have reported threats from various parts of the city. “The problem is severe in areas of north Chennai,” said an office-bearer.

The complaint mentions “politicians of both the ruling party and the Opposition demanding money, threatening to stop work, not allowing them to lay the hot mix, which is supposed to be laid within an hour of arrival at the site”.

The complaint adds: “It seems that department engineers are also supporting them. Hence we request you to instruct the officials to take necessary action to avoid such disturbances by complaining to the police.”

At least 200 roads are being relaid in various parts of the city. Work on relaying more stretches will be taken up shortly.

The work of relaying a road involves heating the bitumen mix to 120 degrees Celsius and completing compaction of the road at 100 degrees Celsius. “When we are asked to stop work, the bitumen mix is wasted. Owing to the delay in compaction of the road surface, the desired strength of the road cannot be achieved. The third-party monitoring the project will not accept the work,” said a contractor.

The bitumen mix is transported at night from areas such as Tiruneermalai to various parts of the city. “We are carrying out public work. Any disturbance will affect road quality. We are scared,” said a contractor.

On an average, a contractor transports 200 tonnes of bitumen mix at an estimated cost of ₹7 to 8 lakh every night. One lorry carries around 25 tonnes of bitumen mix worth ₹75,000. The material has an hour’s lifespan. “We will get payment only after we hand over a finished product. We have to get at least 98.5% density. Any delay because of reduction in temperature will lead to poor density of the road,” a contractor explained.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/roadworks-in-chennai-disrupted-by-politicians-say-contractors/article31073226.ece
5,2020/03/15,The tough business of building a city,"Will the proposed urban projects for Chennai, meant to improve living conditions, be able to deliver?

The State government, in the last few weeks, announced a slew of city planning measures for Chennai. It revised the year-old combined building rules, relaxed norms for housing, announced new Metro routes and is currently pondering over the new airport’s location. Alongside, projects such as the redevelopment of George Town and development of a small area in the suburbs of Chennai are under way. The laudable objective is that these projects will cumulatively improve the urban conditions and make Chennai a better place to live. The question is: will they?

There seems to be no concerted strategy that connects these projects to deliver significant and cumulative benefits. The initiatives are a series of ad hoc measures, and the thinking appears to be that piecemeal projects are a panacea for the city’s problems, leaving the other broader issues, opportunities and governance problems unattended.

It is about 60 years since the first attempt to prepare a comprehensive plan for Chennai started. Many plans have followed since and currently the second master plan notified in 2008 is in force. Master plans have primarily focused on land-use planning, which determines what activities could come up where, and based on population projection, provide or release land for residential, commercial and other purposes. They have then laid out the infrastructure plans and spelt out the building rules for orderly development.

The avowed objectives of this exercise are to provide adequate housing, achieve better mobility, channel growth in the right direction, create opportunities for investment and protect ecological assets.

The key objective, as the Chennai second master plan states, is to supply public goods such as open space and protect prime agricultural land and ecological assets. It is also meant to reduce the costs of providing public services.

Idea and execution

Are the proposed initiatives related to the plan objectives?

Chennai’s planners have always imagined and conventionally planned the city: a stable city core that is expanding outward. Their plans are based on separating the city as core and periphery, where the core is the all-important epicentre, and the peripheries are thought of as spillover spaces.

A disappointing fallout of this imagination is that all efforts so far are focused on servicing the core, leaving the periphery out and at the mercy of ill-equipped local bodies. Consequently, Chennai has grown along the five road corridors taking the shape of a stretched palm. Urban growth has hugged the arterial roads, particularly the three corridors starting from south to west, leaving the wedge between sparsely developed for lack of grid of roads and local plans. If the intention, as the second master plan states, was to keep the wedges green with agricultural and open spaces, that has not happened.

Core vs peripheries

The city has grown in a linear manner, and unsustainably stretched as far as about 40 km. Chennai appears as a poorly cooked pizza: overburnt crust and soggy inside. Because of this, not only the ‘peripheries’ suffer from poor services, as we begin to witness, the arterial line often chokes up.

Vidyadhar Phatak, the former Chief Planner of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, points to the problem of splitting the city as core and periphery from yet another perspective. He states that the issues of the core city and the periphery are vastly different.

“While the spatial plans are necessary for designating land for a public purpose, particularly streets and network infrastructure, they often struggle to work in the peripheries. By the time the plan reaches the outer parts of the city, many ad hoc developments have already taken place, and it’s difficult to retrofit the peripheries.” In the process many environmental assets such as waterbodies are lost, fragmented road networks appear, and large swathes of land lie undeveloped between the arterial roads.

In the last decade, conditions on the ground have changed and warrant a different approach. The ‘peripheries’ in Chennai have organically developed into job centres, where housing is relatively cheaper, and educational facilities are available. They are growth centres in their own right. Perungalathur and Padappai are but a few examples.

Some of the Dutch planners, studying cities such as Amsterdam that have similar multi-centres outside the ‘core’, advocate a departure from the “planning from inside out” attitude. They propose an “outside-in” approach that builds on the potential of such centres, provides adequate investment, puts in place proactive planning measures, and interconnects them through a networked infrastructure. This would eventually lead to an efficient poly-centric city, a model that Chennai needs.

The need to focus on the growth centres in the ‘periphery’ is also borne out by demographic data. The 2011 census has shown that the population growth within the city has slowed down and in the last decade, it was about 7%.

While the Chennai urban agglomeration, which includes adjacent districts of Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram, has grown by about 32%, CMDA projects that by 2026, about 12.5 million will live in the Chennai metropolitan area, which, till a year ago, was about 1,189 sq.km. The bulk of the new growth is expected to happen in the centres outside the ‘core’.

Metro matters

The proposals for Metro rail also have to be looked at in this context.

Metro rail network currently covers 54 km, and the government has proposed an additional 118.9 km in the form of three corridors, which will be operational in 2026. As the report on Mass Transport Plan in Chennai Metropolitan Region, 2015, identified, the length of potential mass transit corridors is about 250 km, and there is further scope to expand the Metro rail network. The proposed expansion of the Metro rail network is still welcome. Unlike the first phase, the proposed network stretches to reach a few centres outside the inner city. However, it is not entirely reassuring.

Rutul Joshi, an urban planner working in the areas of transportation and land use integration, explains that in many cities Metro rail network and spatial plan are seldom integrated. Barring the provisions to build more around the Metro corridors in the form of higher Floor Space Index, which determines how much to develop within a site, there is hardly any local area plan for station areas. Dr. Joshi observes that the more severe problem is one of institutional limitations. Metro projects are planned by special purpose organisations that hardly interact with the planning authorities who prepare city-level plans. “Metro rail companies are only worried about land possession for constructing the rail network and stations. They hardly think about accessibility at the area level. Road networks around the station are never configured, and the potential of transit station areas is hardly harnessed.”

Mr. Phatak adds that planning for Metro rail hardly considers the value of opening new housing areas and hence they seldom connect greenfield areas.

Chennai is no different. So far, including the first operational phase, there is no proper station area plan that improves accessibility or takes advantage of the commercial potential of the station area. The problem increases when it comes to the newly developing areas outside the city ‘core’. Places such as Siruseri and Perungalathur, which are the new centres, suffer from disjointed road networks.

As Dr. Joshi points out, “In the absence of detailed town planning schemes, the station areas cannot develop networked infrastructure. The problems get compounded when the government fails to develop loop roads to connect the incrementally developed road networks, leading to the over-reliance on arterial roads”.

Housing factor

The other fallout arising from lack of local plans in the periphery is that new housing areas have not developed, and one has to rely on large developers and mega private projects to supply residential units, many of which may not be affordable.

Last year, the government announced new Combined Development and Building Rules for the entire State, including Chennai. It had some welcome provisions aimed at promoting affordable housing. A few weeks ago, the State further amended these provisions. Earlier, housing units measuring 40 sq. m carpet area in Chennai qualified to be designated as affordable housing, and they benefited from the relaxed norms. But currently, even housing units measuring 60 sq. m would be eligible to be categorised as affordable. The claim is that such an upward revision would increase the supply of affordable housing.

It appears that it will not happen. More large units will be built, but they may not be genuinely affordable. The problem begins with the unavailability of any reliable figures regarding housing demand, supply and shortage. The CMDA and the State government are yet to define what the threshold that separates affordable housing from the other is. There seem to be no indicators of this in the draft Tamil Nadu Housing and Habitat Policy, which was circulated last year among select stakeholders’ for comments. In its absence, the State conveniently relies on the size as an indicator of affordability, which is misleading.

Reports by real estate consultant companies such as JLL and Knight Frank and other studies show that the private sector, over the last few years, has produced an average of 10,000 residential units each year in Chennai. Of them, about 44% are priced more than ₹50 lakh, and the remaining, below ₹50 lakh. The median price of the residential units appears to be about ₹30 lakh, and the weighted average price of apartments is about ₹45,000 per sq. m.

A study by CEPT University, Ahmedabad, shows that the affordability threshold in Chennai is about ₹14 lakh. It means units priced above ₹14 lakh will be unaffordable for lower-income groups. In the light of these figures, a 60 sq. m. unit, which the State government claims will be affordable, will cost anywhere between ₹25 lakh and ₹30 lakh. This far exceeds the affordable price. The proposed measure may not deliver sufficient affordable housing.

That leaves the Tamil Nadu Slum board tenements as the only hope for low-income groups to access affordable housing. The devastating urban floods in Chennai in 2015 raised serious doubts about the planning practices and pointed out the issues of urban governance. The Comptroller and Auditor General’s report on the Flood Management and Response in Chennai and its Suburban Areas, published in 2017, laid out the problems in detail.

The report concluded that “the laxities in urban planning and ineffective enforcement of statutes and Master Plans” were the principal reasons for flooding. Among the evidence it listed out, the report pointed out that the two Chennai master plans together projected that the built-up area would increase by 330.58 sq. km between 1976 and 2026. However, on the ground, the actual increase between 1979 and 2016 was 450.26 sq. km. This excess building activity was a result of not only the proliferation of illegal layouts but also land-use conversions deviating from the plans.

What this indicates is that not all problems result out of plan deficiencies. Many of them are outcomes of poor urban governance. So far, the government has neither proposed radical changes in the ways the local bodies manage and implement area-development plans or put in efforts to build their capacities. Without institutional improvement, mere project pronouncements will not deliver.

6,2020/03/15,TNRERA tells builder to return original documents,"The project had failed to take off even after eight years

The Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority (TNRERA) has directed Navin Housing & Properties Pvt Ltd to handover original documents to home buyers, after a redevelopment project failed to take off even after a lapse of eight years.

In its complaint, the Indira Nagar Kaveri Apartments Owners’ Welfare Association said that it had entered into a joint development agreement on February 13, 2012, with Navin Housing, for development of 36 flats owned by its members. The project pertains to Indira Nagar Kaveri Apartments, Adyar, which was originally purchased from the Tamil Nadu Housing Board.

Till date, the developer had not started the project and was holding all their original documents, the association said, and sought for a cancellation of the joint development agreement and return of the members’ original documents.

“As on November 14, 2018, a total of 20 owners have signed the joint development agreement. The developer did not take any interest in convincing the remaining 16 owners to sign the joint development agreement,” the petition said.

The TNRERA rejected the developer’s plea that the dispute should be resolved through arbitration and said it was a re-development and real estate project which comes under the purview of the RERA Act.

It also said that it was the responsibility of the developer to get the consent of the remaining flat owners to take up the re-development project and it had failed miserably.

The TNRERA directed the developer to return the original documents to the buyers within 30 days from the date of its order (March 12, 2020). It also said that individual members of the association were free to cancel the agreement and return any money received from the developer, at the interest rate of 10.2%.

The TNRERA also gave liberty to the association to approach the adjudicating authority for claiming compensation for failure to commence the project.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tnrera-tells-builder-to-return-original-documents/article31071511.ece
7,2020/03/15,Opening of arrival hall at airport terminal put off,"AAI cites COVID-19 concerns

The opening of the arrival hall at the international terminal of the Chennai airport has been put off temporarily due to the COVID-19 situation, said sources.

The hall has been lying unused ever since it was inaugurated way back in 2013, as part of phase I modernisation of the Chennai airport. It was never put to use, with the Airports Authority of India (AAI) claiming that it could not be used due to insufficient manpower in both Immigration and Customs. It was later decided that the hall would be used for departure operations, but even this has been getting delayed for several months now.

Recently, AAI officials had decided that operations would finally begin by mid-March.

‘No point now’

AAI officials said that they had to postpone starting operations at the hall due to the existing circumstances created by COVID-19.

“Even now, we are prepared for it, but immigration authorities are not in favour of implementing it now due to concerns regarding COVID-19. But even otherwise, starting operations now doesn’t really help much because the point of operating the hall was to augment capacity of the departure hall at the international terminal, to ease peak-hour congestion. Now, both aircraft movement and passenger traffic have fallen drastically, and those travelling can just go through the existing departure hall itself,” an official said.

In the last two weeks, over 90 flights have been cancelled due to the impact of COVID-19. On Saturday too, several flights to various destinations like Dubai, Colombo, Muscat, Kuala Lumpur and Kuwait were cancelled. Such cancellations are going to continue in the coming days and the number is likely to increase, he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ch0t6n/article31071494.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THAAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/opening-of-arrival-hall-at-airport-terminal-put-off/article31071495.ece
8,2020/03/15,Water supply in south Chennai to be affected,"Work to be taken up at desal plant

Piped water supply to several areas in south Chennai may be affected for 15 days, from March 17, as Chennai Metrowater plans to take up work at the Nemmeli desalination plant, that has a capacity to treat 100 million litres of seawater a day.

The water agency will fix the travelling band screen, a self-cleaning screen in the seawater intake structure, at the desalination plant. The work will be taken up between 6 a.m. on March 17 and 6 a.m. on April 1.

Due to the work, piped water supply to areas 9, 13, 14 and 15 will be affected. The localities include Thiruvanmiyur, Kottivakkam, Perungudi, Adyar, Velachery, Besant Nagar, Mandaveli, Sholinganallur and Neelankarai.

Metrowater officials said that maintenance work was frequently taken up at the plant to manually remove materials such as shells and molluscs from the seawater intake unit. This slowed down the flow of water and the treatment process.

“Water sources are in a better position compared to last year. So It was decided to fit the screen that will automatically remove the materials, every day. This will help decrease the number of shutdown days for maintenance,” said an official.

Metrowater plans to bridge the shortfall in drinking water supply by sourcing from a pipeline that brings water from the Veeranam tank. It will be intercepted in Sholinganallur and water supplied to the affected areas.

A press release said that residents may store water in advance. For tanker supply, residents may contact Area Engineer, Area IX- 8144930909; Area Engineer, Area XIII- 8144930913; Area Engineer, Area XIV- 8144930914; and Area Engineer, Area XV- 8144930915.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/water-supply-in-south-chennai-to-be-affected/article31071484.ece
9,2020/03/15,Police step up efforts to fight crime at CMBT,"18 of the 174 new cameras will have facial recognition features

To nab inter-State criminals, reduce crime at the Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. MGR Bus Terminus — Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) as it was known earlier — in Koyambedu and ensure safety of passengers, the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA), along with the city police, is installing 174 cameras, including many fitted with facial recognition and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) features.

According to police sources, from December 12, 2019, to March 14, 25 crimes, including incidents of mobile snatching, bag lifting and attention diversion, were reported on the CMBT premises. Of them, 15 cases were cracked using old CCTV cameras. “Most often, the thieves steal phones or bags from sleeping passengers or loot the elderly, using attention diversion tactics,” said a police officer. Sixty-four cameras were installed in 2008 at the terminus.

“However, the quality of the footage was poor and the equipment had become old. Hence, we asked for over 200 cameras and 174 were sanctioned. About 120 cameras are being installed at the MTC bus bays, platforms, runway and at the back of the terminus,” said a police officer.

“Of them, 18 cameras have facial recognition features. They will have pictures of anti-social elements collected from the State and national crime records bureaus. Besides, four cameras with ANPR features will be installed at the entry and exit,” said B. Jayaraman, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Koyambedu range.

The CCTV monitoring room will also be expanded. “There will be a reception where people who have lost their valuables can register and check the CCTV footage.

Axelsen’s defensives were on point right from the start and he outplayed his Chinese Taipei opponent comfortably to take the honours in a duel that went on for about 46 minutes.

However, in the women’s section, there was joy for Chinese Taipei as second-seeded Tai Tzu Ying put it past the Chinese top seed Chen Yu Fei 21-19, 21-15 in 44 minutes.

12,2020/03/15,Oman Open TT | Sharath’s 10-year wait ends,"Desai falls to Freitas

A. Sharath Kamal ended his decade-long wait for a title, producing a sensational performance to win the ITTF Challenger Plus Oman Open here on Sunday. Despite being a game down, the 37-year-old Indian recovered to outclass top-seeded Marcos Freitas of Portugal 6-11, 11-8, 12-10, 11-9, 3-11, 17-15 in the summit clash.

It was in 2010 that Sharath had bagged his last title, at the Egypt Open.

In the semifinals, Sharath had pulled off a stunning come-from-behind victory against Russia’s Kirill Skachkov. The fourth seed rallied from two games down to register a 11-13, 11-13, 13-11, 11-9, 13-11, 8-11, 11-7 win in a thrilling seven-set semi-final that lasted one hour and eight minutes.

Freitas had made it to the final with a 5-11, 11-9, 6-11, 6-11, 11-8, 13-11, 11-3 victory over India’s Harmeet Desai. The latter dominated the match in the initial stages before the World No. 26 fought his way back.

Our Special Correspondent adds from Chennai:

“I literally had to fight with my wife to participate in the Oman Open,” revealed Sharath after the triumph. “It feels great to win a title even if it is a Challenger Plus event after a long time. Winning a tournament has become tough nowadays. This is a good win before the Olympic qualifiers.”

About the final, he said: “it was one of my best games. My shots were landing right. Mainly I was more aggressive and my shots were sharper.” Sharath is expected to gain 800 points and his world rankings might be 31 or 32 next month.

13,2020/03/15,Fury won’t lose world title: WBC chief,"Fury’s promoter Frank Warren, who was not involved at the time, told The Sun he had previously been sent letters by Carefoot.

Tyson Fury’s reign as world heavyweight champion will not be ended by new claims over an alleged drug-testing scam, according to WBC president Mauricio Sulaiman.

It was alleged in a Mail on Sunday report a farmer was offered money to provide an alibi for Fury’s failed drugs test in 2015.

Fury and his cousin Hughie tested positive for nandrolone in 2015, which they subsequently blamed on eating uncastrated wild boar meat, citing a farmer called Martin Carefoot who claimed to have provided them with the product.

After an expensive and elongated stand-off with UK Anti-Doping, Fury and Hughie received retrospective two-year bans and were able to resume their careers in December 2017.

In the Mail report, Carefoot denied having provided the Fury team with the meat, insisting he was offered £25,000 to make up the story in order to aid their case. But Sulaiman, whose WBC belt Fury won against Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas last month, said the allegations would have “no impact” on his reign as champion.

“Personally, I prefer to believe Tyson Fury ahead of someone who has already admitted to lying in legal documents for financial gain,” Sulaiman told The Sun.

“The person who has claimed he accepted money to lie should be the one on trial, in my personal opinion, especially when he has waited five years to tell his story.

14,2020/03/15,Coronavirus: International Olympic Committee to hold crisis talks with sports bodies,"Torch handover to take place in empty Athens stadium

With less than five months to go before the Tokyo Olympics, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach plans emergency talks with member organisations, sources close to the IOC said on Sunday.

The IOC plans a conference call on Tuesday to “keep the international federations informed of the situation, as well as the National Olympic Committees and athletes,” one source close to the IOC told AFP.

The IOC “will take stock of the actions taken” to respond to the coronavirus crisis “and the federations will have the opportunity to ask questions” added a source close to one international sports federation

The IOC “conducts a regular dialogue with all the Olympic partners and regularly informs them of the situation,” added an IOC spokesman.

While many international sporting events have been postponed or cancelled, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promised on Friday that Tokyo would host the Olympic Games as planned in July and August, despite questions raised by the pandemic.

Thomas Bach said on Thursday that his organisation would follow the recommendations of the World Health Organisation regarding a possible postponement.

He acknowledged, however, that the cancellation of qualifying events due to the epidemic was already posing “serious problems”.

The issue of qualifying will be a focus of Tuesday's telephone meeting.

At the beginning of March, Mr. Bach said the IOC would show “flexibility” regarding the qualifications for the Tokyo and encouraged “all athletes to continue to prepare” for the Games.

Torch handover to take place in empty stadium

The Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games flame handover in Athens next week will be done in an empty stadium amid the coronavirus outbreak, Greece's Olympic Committee said.

Greece on Friday cancelled the remainder of the domestic Olympic torch relay through the country to avoid attracting crowds a day after the Tokyo Games flame was lit in ancient Olympia.

“The Hellenic Olympic Committee has decided that the handover ceremony for the “Tokyo 2020” Olympic Games, on Thursday, March 19, will take place at the Panathenaic Stadium behind closed doors,” it said in a statement.

The central Athens stadium, site of the 1896 Games, usually attracts thousands of spectators to the handover ceremony to the next host city of winter and summer Games every two years.

Greece had three fatalities from the disease and 228 confirmed cases by late Saturday.

“Following the orders of the Greek State in order to contain the coronavirus pandemic and for the protection of public health no accreditation cards issued will be valid,” the country's Olympic Committee said.

Japan is still preparing to host the Olympics, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Saturday, despite rising global concern about the viability of the summer Games due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Mr. Abe and his government as well as the International Olympic Committee have been adamant the July 24-Aug 9 Games will go ahead, even as other global sporting events have been put on hold.

Speculation about a delay from the July start date has grown since U.S. President Donald Trump said organisers should consider a one-year postponement.

The Olympic Torch relay, in which the Olympic flame typically starts a tour around the host nation, is due to start in the Japanese prefecture of Fukushima in less than two weeks. The tour of the torch through Greece has already been cut short.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/pudsry/article31075779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15-JAPAN-OLYMPICS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-international-olympic-committee-to-hold-crisis-talks-with-sports-bodies/article31075780.ece
15,2020/03/15,IOA delegation’s visit to Tokyo cancelled,"The visit was scheduled for March 25 to 29 but will now happen at a later date which is yet to be decided.

The visit of a high-powered delegation comprising Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju and top IOA officials to Tokyo later this month to look into India’s logistical preparedness for the Olympics has been put on hold in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The visit was scheduled for March 25 to 29 but will now happen at a later date which is yet to be decided.

Besides Rijiju, the other members of the delegation included Indian Olympic Association president Narinder Batra, secretary-general Rajeev Mehta, Boxing Federation of India president Ajay Singh, sports secretary Radhey Shyam Julaniya and Sports Authority of India director general Sandip Pradhan.

“The proposed visit of High Level Indian Delegation to Tokyo consisting of Govt Officials and Indian Olympic Association to review India’s #Tokyo2020 preparation on 25th March is temporarily postponed,” Rijiju tweeted.

Mehta told PTI, “In view of the rising threat of this COVID-19 pandemic, the visit has been put on hold. As of now, we have not decided when the delegation will visit Tokyo. It will happen at a later date depending on the situation.”

India will have its first-ever Olympic Hospitality House in Tokyo during the Summer Games, scheduled to be held from July 24 to August 9. It will be built by JSW on a piece of land of 2,200 square metre area and in close proximity to the Games Village and multiple venues in the Ariake region of the Japanese capital.

It will offer a range of activities and experiences for travelling fans and supporters who will be in Tokyo for the Olympics.

Running through the duration of the Games, the India House will host watch parties, medal celebrations and meet-and-greet opportunities with the Indian athletes. The visitors will also get a taste of variety of Indian cuisine.

There will be a dedicated Athlete Lounge for Indian Olympians and access to medical facilities and food will be available on site. A media centre to host travelling Indian media personnel has also been planned in the area. Several Indian and international brands will also have their stalls to display and sell their products.

More than 70 Indian athletes have so far qualified for the Tokyo Olympics and the IOA is expecting the number to touch at least 125 before the Games.

The coronavirus outbreak has led to speculation over the fate of the Olympics this year.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC), however, has insisted that the Games will be held as scheduled in July-August.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/2892ia/article30929297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RIJIJU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ioa-delegations-visit-to-tokyo-cancelled/article31075744.ece
16,2020/03/15,Biles takes swipe at USA Gymnastics,"Calls for independent investigation on sex abuse scandal

Four-time Olympic gold medallist Simone Biles wants more than good wishes from USA Gymnastics.

The US federation wished Biles a happy 23rd birthday on social media on Saturday.

Biles — who also owns 19 world titles and is expected to be among the stars of the Tokyo Olympics — used the tweet as a chance to demand an independent investigation into the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal.

“How about you amaze me and do the right thing ... have an independent investigation,” Biles snapped on Twitter after the federation’s birthday tweet.

“HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the most decorated gymnast of all time, @simonebiles!” USA Gymnastics wrote, posting a video of Biles in action in a floor exercise.

“We know you will only continue to amaze us and make history!”

Former national gymnastics team doctor Nassar was jailed for life for abusing more than 250 athletes, including stars of the United States’ 2012 and 2016 gold medal-winning Olympic teams.

A US Senate investigation found that “multiple institutions” failed to adequately respond to credible allegations against Nassar, but Biles has said that USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee still owe his victims, including herself, more answers and a framework to ensure such abuses won’t occur again.

“Wish they BOTH wanted an independent investigation as much as the survivors & I do,” she tweeted earlier this month.

As Biles and other elite gymnasts ramp up their preparations for Tokyo, USA Gymnastics in January offered a $215 million settlement to victims of Nassar to settle legal claims — a plan a lawyer for more than 200 women called “unconscionable.”

Olympic gold medallist Aly Raisman, who is now retired, called the settlement offer “offensive” and accused the federation of attempting to prevent release of details which would show how Nassar was able to abuse athletes for years.

Attorney John Manley, who represents more than 180 clients with active claims against USA Gymnastics, said the settlement offer releases too many people from further claims, including the USOPC, former USA Gymnastics chief Steve Penny and former national team directors Bela and Marta Karolyi.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/6i1qqe/article31075716.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16BILES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/biles-takes-swipe-at-usa-gymnastics/article31075718.ece
17,2020/03/15,Coronavirus | London Marathon postponed to October,"Event was supposed to take place on April 24

This year’s London Marathon, which was supposed to take place on April 24, has been postponed to October 4 due to the global outbreak of coronavirus.

The organizers have said that every runner with a place will be able to use their place in the rescheduled event without any further payment. If they choose not to take part or are unable to do so, they will receive a refund of their entry fee.

Runners may also choose to defer their entry to the 2021 race, which is scheduled for April 25 next year, on payment of the entry fee for 2021, following the standard deferment process.

Event director Hugh Brasher said: “The world is in an unprecedented situation grappling with a global pandemic of COVID-19 and public health is everyone’s priority. We know how disappointing this news will be for so many — the runners who have trained for many months, the thousands of charities for which they are raising funds and the millions who watch the race every year,” he added.

Earlier, elite football in Britain, including the Premier League, was suspended until at least April 3.

In a statement released on Friday, the Premier League said: “Following a meeting of Shareholders today, it was unanimously decided to suspend the Premier League with the intention of returning on April 4, subject to medical advice and conditions at the time.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/2uk2pi/article31071424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LONDON-MARATHON-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-london-marathon-postponed-to-october/article31071425.ece
18,2020/03/15,Oman Open | Jeet Chandra crowned U-21 men’s champion,"Stuns Manav Thakkar for the gold

Young rising Indian paddler Jeet Chandra stunned World no. 2 Manav Thakkar in straight sets to clinch the U-21 men’s singles title at the Oman Open here on Saturday.

The world no. 18 Chandra outclassed compatriot Thakkar 11-6, 11-7, 13-11 in the all-Indian final that lasted just 24 minutes.

After losing the first two sets without much fight, Thakkar tried to make a comeback with a good display. However, a determined Chandra wrapped up the final set and match to clinch the gold.

The U-21 men’s singles competition saw dominance of Indian paddlers as Thakkar, Chandra, Manush Shah and Suravajjula Snehit make their way into the the semifinals.

Earlier, seasoned campaigner Achanta Sharath Kamal recovered well from the first set setback to register a 5-11, 11-5, 11-3, 11-5, 11-7 win over Belarusian Aliaksandr Khanin in the senior men’s singles pre-quarterfinals match.

Another Indian paddler Harmeet Desai also made his way into the quarterfinals with a hard-fought 7-11, 11-13, 11-9, 11-6, 8-11, 11-5, 11-8 win against Egypt’s Omar Assar in a thrilling encounter which lasted for one hour and four minutes.

Meanwhile, three Indian pairs also secured entry in the doubles semifinals. While the duo of Sharath and Desai thrashed Oman’s Muhannad Al Balushi and Asad Alraisi 11-4, 11-3, 11-7, Manush Shah partnered with Thakkar to outshine Aliaxandr Khanin and Pavel Platonov of Belarus 12-10, 8-11, 11-8, 11-9 in the last eight encounter.

The uncertainty caused by the coronavirus outbreak weighed heavily on India women’s hockey team coach Sjoerd Marijne, who was forced to cancel plans to return home to the Netherlands.

With the women’s team camp ending at Sports Authority of India (SAI) here, Marijne was keen to fly to the Netherlands to join his family.

Backing out

He was on the way to the airport, before he decided to back out.

Marijne was perhaps concerned that he may face difficulty entering the Netherlands.

Marijne also realised that his re-entry to India could have posed problems.

Overcome with doubt, the 45-year-old decided to cancel his trip home, and returned to SAI.

He is expected to stay at SAI until the uncertainty surrounding international travel subsides.

“Had to turn around on my way to the airport to go to my family.

“The risk is too great that I can’t return to India. Hard times for everyone and for me now that I can’t see my family and I don’t know when this is going to happen…,” Marijne tweeted.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/1ji7zp/article31071344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15MARIJNE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-womens-hockey-team-coach-marijne-cancels-his-trip-home/article31071345.ece
20,2020/03/15,Team is improving under Reid: Birendra Lakra,"The national team defender says the coach is clear about his expectations from the defence

India coach Graham Reid, known for his inclination towards an aggressive brand of hockey, is also a firm believer that a strong defence can win tournaments, national team defender Birendra Lakra said on Saturday.

India displayed some spectacular attacking game in the FIH Hockey Pro League matches last month, beating the likes of Australia and Belgium.

“Playing aggressive and attacking hockey, pushing for goals and circle penetrations is the style we as a team want to use,” Lakra said.

The 30-year-old said that the Australian is very clear about his expectations from the team’s defence.

Quality attack

“Although chief coach Graham’s training often involves high intensity sessions where he likes to see quality attack, he is also very clear about his expectations from the team’s defence. Graham tells us that a strong line of defence can not only win matches but it can also win us tournaments.”

Lakra believes the team is improving under the tutelage of Reid.

“In the past, there have been times when we have slipped up in defence in the final moments of the match. But I believe we have improved in this aspect over the past couple of months and the coach often says our defence starts with our forwardline.”

Lakra who had missed the 2016 Rio Olympics due to a knee surgery is working towards securing a spot in the team for the Tokyo Games.

Giving it all

“I may be an experienced defender in the team but I can’t take my place for granted.

“Each one of us have to earn our place in the squad for Tokyo and this means we give our 100% in training and matches.

“I was very unlucky to miss the Rio Olympic Games due to injury but this time I am really working hard to play the best hockey for my team,” Lakra said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/q2y6bb/article31071188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15LAKRA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/team-is-improving-under-reid-birendra-lakra/article31071189.ece

India’s chief national coach P. Gopi Chand welcomed the Badminton World Federation’s (BWF) decision to suspend till April 12, all events from March 16 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“It is a good decision and one cannot ignore the health risk of players, officials and spectators. When the whole world is witnessing so many restrictions, it was not the ideal scenario to go ahead with the BWF events,” Gopi told The Hindu on the way back to Hyderabad from London.

“I don’t say the players are scared but there was a serious element of concern which I feel was pretty genuine, given the kind of alarming reports that have been emanating from different parts of the world,” Gopi said.

“This is more so with those players who have been travelling around the world in search of winning important points to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.

“I cannot straight away comment on the likely impact of the fresh guidelines to be issued for the qualification for Olympics. We need to know the cut-off date and the number of tournaments the players, especially those aspiring from India, can play to make the cut for the Games,” the former All England champion said.

“Unless, there is a clear message detailing the qualification norms, what sort of impact they will have on the players, especially those aspiring to make it from India,” the former All England champion said.

The tournaments which will be affected by the BWF directive on Saturday include Swiss Open, India Open 2020, Orleans Masters, Malaysia Open and Singapore Open and other International Grade III tournaments.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/e0iero/article31071130.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15GOPI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-gopi-chand-welcomes-bwfs-decision-to-suspend-events/article31071131.ece
22,2020/03/15,Whither education,"Greater use of technology, with proliferating online content and classes, has made education less of a collective pursuit

Nowadays, we all seem to be in a hurry to jump to the last page of the book, missing the joy of searching for answers or the frustration of not knowing. The assumed fact that all we need to know lies behind a search engine or perhaps in the comments section has made us more prone to look for binaries in the real world. We do not realise that there can be multiple answers, diverse perspectives and contradictory truths for the same problem.

While emerging technologies — social media, microblogging sites or AI-driven advertising — can be rightfully blamed for creating individualised narratives vindicating one’s personal stand, it is essential to realise that technology does not operate in a vacuum. Our willingness to readily accept messages that does not require self-reflection has fuelled the growth of these technologies. An increasingly passive audience is, however, largely a product of our education system.

We have a flourishing ecosystem — schools, curriculum and textbooks, coaching institutions and invested parents — that seeks to maximise the instrumental value of education. Unfortunately, we deny children choice at every stage of their life — from the courses they choose to the career they pursue. Greater use of technology, with proliferating online content and classes, has made education less of a collective pursuit. We learn in silos — from receiving individualised content to personalised assessment. Our linear, aim-bound and isolated pursuit of knowledge has made us less critical and reflective. We are perhaps so used to seeing things the way we are trained to look at, that we do not appreciate or respect people who make different choices. Instead of taking a nuanced stand that straddles the middle path, we search for only black and white.

We are probably at a stage where consensus has become irrelevant and only a distorted majority opinion is considered legitimate. Instead of jointly navigating the maze of socio-political problems, we pride ourselves on knowing that we belong to the “right side”.

23,2020/03/15,Calls without purpose,"The fact that someone thought of you on a Sunday afternoon and called you up for no reason is a great feeling

A Sunday morning. Your phone rings.

It’s a call from out of the blue, from a friend out of touch with for some years. You wonder why he, a busy person, would be calling you of all people. It has to be a mistake.

Before you pick up the phone, you try to guess what the call could be about. Being a cynic, your first guess is he has mistakenly dialled your number. Being suave, you two might cover up the mistake by seamlessly holding a random conversation before hanging up. That would have been the standard drill, the typical classy act which, while it wouldn’t have fooled anyone, at least would have saved the moment.

Either that, or the caller wants your help about something. In the office, every call you receive would follow this format: a quick how are you, a little beating around the bush, followed by business. And considering this was a Sunday, the caller really must be having a pressing requirement. You are primed to expect a request five seconds after the ‘how are you’ bit. You even consider pre-empting the process by your proactive ‘What can I do for you?’ You come perilously close to mouthing this phrase even as you are done with the pleasantries.

Good that you didn’t, because a wonderful moment unfolds. It takes a while for you to realise that you indeed were the one he wanted to talk to, with no agenda other than the joy of hearing the voice of a friend, a truly long-time-no-see kind of call. Delighted, you join in the spirit of the moment, catching up on news, talking of this and that, in a rambling, mini-nostalgia trip. You both share your perspectives of your lives, making sense of the craziness in your world, evolving the righteous but unoriginal consensus that things are not as they were, that they could be better; and as the minutes tick by, you lose track of time. You settle deep into your sofa and wish the conversation would never end.

And long after the call does end, you are left with a peaceful therapeutic afterglow, the kind that fills your heart. The fact that someone thought of you on a Sunday afternoon, and called you up for no reason, is a great feeling. That is friendship.

Of such stuff is life made charming. You savour such moments. A call with no agenda, just the reliving of moments, just checking on how you are taking life — just nothing, really. Such nothings are the real precious moments of life.

It strikes me that this cold-calling is an adventure, if you think about it. If you initiate a random call, you have nothing to lose. You might make the called persons happy, or at worst, confuse them. They would, in fact, be glad that they occupied a moment of someone’s thoughts strong enough for that person to call them up. All you have to do is overcome the inertia and the natural reluctance to reach out to people. It takes a huge amount of fearlessness to cold-call someone you haven’t spoken to very much, over the years. There are very few persons who make this attempt and they are a minuscule minority. It takes guts to initiate contact, and also a willingness to accept that not all their efforts at communication will be rewarded. We need such friends like oxygen in our stifling atmosphere of an introverted society. We need to learn from them. We can only hope they aren’t a vanishing tribe.

Call up someone today, for the only reason you just felt like hearing their voice. Call up your mom, dad, uncle, or long-lost friend, just like that. Go ahead, force that finger to press on that contact list on your mobile, and take it from there — see where it goes.

24,2020/03/15,Parting with personal data,"With smart devices, we trade our privacy in myriad ways, without realising that we are giving away so much of our details at an uncalculated future cost

Every breath you take and every move you make

Every bond you break, every step you take, I'll be watching you

Every single day and every word you say

Every game you play, every night you stay, I'll be watching you

These were the lyrics of a possessive lover in the 1980s. Yet, whenever I tune in to this song these days, I feel as if the song-writer had inadvertently prophesised about the digital surveillance culture that is dominating our lives in the 21st century. Unbeknownst to us, commercial product and service giants are tracking and following our every online move. Sounds scary, doesn’t it? This, however, is the truth.

The plethora of freely downloadable apps accompanied by the ease and variety of customisable options contributed to the soaring popularity of smartphones. The apps are free, but then, are we cognisant of the trade-off?

Every day, we trade our privacy in myriad callous ways. Seldom do we realise that in a matter of few touches on the touch-screen, we are giving away so much of our personal data at an uncalculated future cost. How many of us actually read the “terms and conditions” before clicking on the “Accept” tab of an application? How do we proceed when probed, “Do you want the application to access your location?”

Like most modern, impatient consumers, if your answer is a “Yes”, be sure that from now on, whenever you are online, the local deals of your city (shopping, travel, etc) will follow you, whether you like it or not.

25,2020/03/15,Catching up on a moonscape,"Bumping into a friend from college in Ladakh in an Army tent 23 years later

In 1958, I joined the B.Sc. Physics course in Presidency College, Madras, and M.D. Naidu was a friend among my classmates. I dropped out in my final year, joined the Indian Military Academy, Dehradun, and was commissioned into the Madras Sappers in 1962.

Naidu was commissioned into the Artillery in 1963 and won the Vir Chakra for his courage in the 1965 war. He was wounded in the abdomen by machine gun fire, but he refused to be evacuated and continued to direct artillery fire on the enemy for three hours, before fainting from loss of blood. This was pivotal to battle success in that sector. He survived, but I was unable to meet him.

I assumed command of a Border Roads Task Force in Ladakh in 1982 where one could drive for tens of kilometres without seeing a human habitation or another vehicle. This was more so in the Shyok valley, where a bridge across the Largiap nullah was destroyed by a flash flood in early 1983.

In June, I went to inspect the site with Major Ramaswamy. We drove in a Nissan Jonga, and when we were returning, it was around 6.30 p.m. but still bright. We had driven for a few minutes when a wheel went over a loose stone, making a loud noise. A little later, the engine sputtered and died, and the Jonga came to a halt. A quick check in failing light showed that the fuel tank was empty. The stone had punctured it.

We had to walk to the nearest camp at the Thoise airfield, about 10 km away. The full moon rose behind us, lighting our way on the rough road. Ramu was excellent company and as we walked, we chatted while the driver was immersed in his thoughts. The silence of the expanses was broken only by our voices and the scrunch of boots.

Distant glimmer

We spotted the glimmer of kerosene lanterns from a tented Army camp just short of Thoise, and realised that we had been walking for about two-and-a-half hours. After another half an hour of walking, we left the road and descended to the camp. At the perimeter, a sentry challenged us. Getting past him took time, and it was about 9 p.m. by then. In the dark camp, we headed for the nearest tent in which we spotted a light.

As we approached the tent, a voice from within asked, “Kaun hai?” I lifted the tent flap, and entered it to explain the circumstances. The light was in my face, my eyes adjusting to the bright petromax light. Before I could make out the face of the occupant, I heard a voice exclaim, “My God! Sudhir,” and he jumped up and clasped me in a warm embrace. It was Naidu.

We then sat to catch up with 23 years of time, assisted by a peg (maybe, two or three) of rum, along with parathas and egg bujjia rustled up by Naidu’s mess cook.

26,2020/03/15,The jack in the box,"Every trip back to the U.S., I carry sweets for my friends and family. This time too, I packed 500 g of Mysore Pak in my hand baggage and flew from Chennai to Frankfurt on the first leg.

On landing, my mother cleared the security check and was waiting for me at the other end. A German woman official did a quick swipe of my upper body and then signalled me to go collect my baggage. I went over to the machine and waited for my bags to arrive. That is when things started to go awry. My laptops, phones and one bag passed the test, but my other bag was put aside.

The official yelled, “Whose bag is this?” I stepped forward. “I have to check your bag for explosives,” she said. She then ran my bag over another sophisticated scanner machine and the thing beeped a couple of times. “Your bag has tested positive for explosives. I will need to open it and check it,” she said.

I told her she could go ahead and open it and check it herself. “No ma’am, I am not authorised to open it. I will have to call the police,” she said.

My baggage had passed the scanner in Chennai, and my worry was somebody must have slipped something into it when I was fast asleep on the flight. I was mostly amused, but the security officer was serious.

After 10 or 15 minutes, there came a German policewoman and policeman, both armed with guns. This is when I started to think that I might have to spend a day or two in a German jail. The policewoman walked up to me and pulled up the bag and opened it and took out each item and then she stumbled upon the white box. It was almost a Eureka moment for her. She pointed to the box and spoke something in German to the policeman. She then very carefully opened the box and saw rectangles of Mysore Pak.

“What is this,” she asked. I said it is a sweet and volunteered to eat a piece of it and give her some. She refused, but was now convinced that her sophisticated machine had falsely tagged the delectable Mysore Pak as an explosive. She then let me go sweetly.

27,2020/03/15,The paddler in a sari,"Meet nonagenarian Kunhimalu, a table tennis ace of the Madras of the 1960s

The year was 1949. The bride, Kunhimalu, all of 20, was spirited, and as her husband, M.G. Nair, soon discovered, had an uncanny ability for sports that she displayed at the railway officers’ club. A cricketer and tennis ace himself, he encouraged her talent. She was a wonderful homemaker who excelled in the traditional roles of women, but wanted to leave the caution-ridden precincts to fulfil the sporting urge in her.

After their two children were born, he had a local carpenter make a table tennis table for the large veranda of the spacious government bungalow they lived in. Late in the evening, after the children were asleep and the day’s chores done, he taught her to play. Soon, she upended his game, winning comfortably every set they played. And when she won a local tournament in a crepe sari and jasmine in her hair, he engaged a coach to train her at home.

With more championships in her kitty, she went on to win the top position in the Madras State women’s table tennis roll. In the mid-1960s, there was no single apex tournament such as an annual State-level tournament. Staggered through the year, the matches were held in clubs and community halls in the city and sponsored by public enterprises. A player collected points that tallied with the number of tournaments won a year. Coaches were volunteers who came to clubs to train players before a tournament. The women players of Madras formed deep friendships.

Madras star

Kunhimalu, along with her young friends Jhansi Muthanna and Usha Abraham, represented Madras in the national championship in Bombay in 1963 and in Delhi in 1964. Keeping company was the indomitable Rachel John, who played at the Railway Club, Madras, and represented Southern Railways. Rachel went on to win the national championship and represented India in international ties.

We, Kunhimalu’s children, accompanied her to these sporting events and that accounted for our passion for, and participation in, sports. Balancing her role as a homemaker and mother and transforming into a competitive sportsperson required plenty of will, hard work, sacrifice, efficiency and passion. It was a sight to see her in a crisp cotton sari, hitting blinding forehand smashes and deceptive backhand slices, playing and winning tournaments with ease. Father accompanied her to tournaments and sat in the front benches with a pounding heart when the scores were tantalisingly close.

As life evolved, the sporting career gave her confidence, emotional balance and good health. But fate struck a cruel blow as father died soon after retirement.

My mother, now 92, lives independently, undaunted by the exigencies of life. She does not miss sports broadcasts and can make an accurate analysis of India’s cricket matches or the drawbacks of Indian badminton.

The sporting spirit has never faded, perhaps because of the man who recognised and nurtured it.

28,2020/03/15,A bad patch,"TB is still not falling fast enough, and progress is slow in meeting the targets

“Doctor, you cured me of tuberculosis 50 years ago. But now, why can’t you be certain of curing my son,” Gokul asked me. I advised him to go to a government hospital where the youngster would get appropriate treatment and ₹500 a month during the course. He shook his head disapprovingly and insisted on private treatment.

When he was a patient, TB bacilli were vulnerable to drugs. But with inadequate and irregular treatment over decades, the bacilli gained resistance to them.

In those good old days, multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) and the almost incurable totally drug-resistant tuberculosis (TDR-TB) were unheard-of. I wrote in the columns of The Hindu of April 28, 1977 that “ …development of drug resistance, which is a result of inadequate and irregular treatment mostly, has far-reaching implications and if unchecked would make tuberculosis totally unmanageable by the present methods in course of time, whatever be the means. Irregular and inadequate treatment keeps the patient often alive, suffering and infective to disseminate drug-resistant organisms into the environment…”

I find that there is less guarantee of a cure now than a few decades ago, notwithstanding the availability of more drugs. There were tools, but we didn’t use them properly. And now it seems that TB has become insurmountable and invincible, notwithstanding the introduction of drugs such as Bedaquiline, Linezolid and Pretomanid.

TB is killing more people than ever before in history — 1,000 people every day in India, at present. This chronic mortality does not become news, whereas one case of COVID-19 grabs the headlines.

The Global Tuberculosis Report, 2019 of the World Health Organization says India has the highest number of TB and drug-resistant TB cases in the world. Officials may claim a declining trend, but Paula I. Fujiwara, Scientific Director of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, says: “Let’s be honest — TB is still not falling fast enough in India, progress is still too slow to meet the targets … and if we don’t end TB in India, we can’t hope to end it globally.” Going through the India TB Report 2018: Annual Status Report, one gains the impression that there is political will and a strong strategy to reach the goal of ending TB by 2025, in line with the National Health Policy, 2017.

Rhetoric and reality

On World TB Day on March 24, we mourn the thousand deaths every day while going through the annual rituals of rallies, speeches and seminars. Hackneyed gestures and lax efforts are commonplace. One who follows up these acts can visualise a great scenario of farcical dimensions. The grand pronouncements and the rhetoric may never meet the reality. Why all this annual hype ... singing the same chorus in a different style? The statistics rolled out must be taken with a pinch of salt as the infrastructure is plagued by a lack of genuine reporting systems.

TB has been made a “notifiable disease” for better follow-up and management. Pan-India engagement with the private sector to close the enormous gaps across the patient-care cascade in private medical care has been initiated. We should hope and wish that this strategy would eliminate TB from India by 2025. Let’s do a review that year against the backdrop of a “$5 trillion economy”. And let’s wish Gokul’s son a speedy recovery.

29,2020/03/15,Coronavirus | TISS defers admission process,"‘The decision was taken as a precautionary measure looking at the spike in the number of cases in Maharashtra’

The Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) has deferred the ongoing admission process across its four campuses, viz. Mumbai, Tuljapur, Hyderabad and Guwahati and has asked its first year masters students to vacate hostels as soon as possible in response to the continuing threat of the novel coronavirus.

In a circular issued to the students of the Institute, it stated that they had deferred the second phase of admissions, namely the Personal Interviews and Pre Interview Test. The admission process in Mumbai was to be held between March 16 and March 21, from March 23 to March 27 in Tuljapur and Hyderabad campuses and between March 31 and April 3 in the Guwahati campus.

Deputy Registrar of TISS, M.P. Balamurugan said that the decision was taken as a precautionary measure looking at the spike in the number of cases in Maharashtra as well as following directives from the state government and the University Grants Commission.

The circular, which was sent to students on March 14 had also stated that final year examinations of first year MA students have been deferred until further notice and that first year students residing in hostels were required to vacate by March 16. However, senior TISS faculty stated that they would not be forcing anyone but advising all those who are in a position to go home to do so. “We are in constant touch with the administration and they have assured us that no one will be forced to leave campus,” Maitreyee Misra, treasurer, TISS Students Union said.

“End semester exams, assignments, dissertations, etc for the second year M.A. students, first and second year MPhil students of Mumbai Campus, will continue as per schedule,” the notice stated. Students will also be informed about the convocation at a later date.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ups9bg/article31074410.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRONTLINE-TISS-4,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/coronavirus-tiss-defers-admission-process/article31074411.ece

A private vessel drifted and collided with a jetty at INS Karanja in Uran in Navi Mumbai on Thursday, an official said. The vessel, MV Halami Star, drifted after its anchor broke, an official said, adding that the jetty did not suffer damage.

The Mumbai Port Control and the Marine Police did not find anything suspicious in a check of the ship. “The engines of the ship are not working. There are just two crew members on board. The duo raised an alarm when the vessel was drifting and this alerted the coastal police and naval personnel,” the official said.

He said the vessel’s owner arrived on Saturday with tug boats and other equipment to remove it.

31,2020/03/15,BMW accident in Worli: driver battles for life,"40-year-old suffered multiple injuries, including one to head

The Worli police have booked a 40-year-old woman for allegedly causing the death of three people, including her own mother and infant daughter, due to rash and negligent driving. The accused is battling for life with critical injuries.

According to the police, the incident occurred at 4.10 p.m. on Friday near Mela restaurant in Worli. Namita Chand (40), a resident of Andheri, was driving her BMW with her six-month-old daughter Nishika, mother Bhavana Bhatija and relative Juhi Gurnani (50) in the vehicle when they met with an accident.

“Ms. Chand left from her residence with her mother and daughter to have a meal at the National Sports Club of India (NSCI) in Worli and picked up Gurnani from her Worli residence on the way,” senior police inspector Sukhlal Varpe said.

Eyewitnesses to the accident said Ms. Chand drove over a speed breaker at a very high spee and lost control over the vehicle.

“Ms. Chand might not have seen the speed breaker and hit it at full speed, because of which the car jumped and dashed into the divider on the right, damaging it as well. Bhatija, who was sitting in the front seat, was partly thrown out of the car through the broken windshield,” Usman Sheikh, who runs a butcher’s shop near the accident spot, said.

Dinesh Soni, a vegetable seller who was at the spot, said, “We ran to the vehicle and saw Nishika near Bhatija’s feet. We picked her up to find her breathing and stopped an ambulance that was approaching, after which we rushed the injured to Jaslok Hospital at Peddar Road.” Doctors declared Nishika, Bhatija and Gurnani dead on arrival.

“Ms. Chand is fighting for her life in the intensive care unit of the hospital. She has suffered multiple injuries, including one to her head,” Mr. Varpe said.

The police have booked Ms. Chand for causing death due to rash and negligent driving under the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act, officers said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6bvzb8/article31071956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bm-accident,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmw-accident-in-worli-driver-battles-for-life/article31071957.ece
32,2020/03/15,Police on lookout for man who cheated doctor of ₹6.5 lakh,"‘Builder’ promised victim flat at Vichumbe village in Panvel

The Kamothe police are on the lookout for a builder who cheated a doctor by promising a flat at Vichumbe village in Panvel.

Dr. Sunil Samatkar, a resident of Sewri, used to work at a hospital in Parel in 2014, where he met Sushant Pawar, a friend of his colleague. Mr. Pawar said he was a builder from Kamothe and had an office at Sector 36 under the name Anway group builders and developers. He told Dr. Samatkar about his new project at Vichumbe village in Panvel, where bookings were open, and the latter showed interest.

On April 10, 2015, the duo entered into an MoU in which Mr. Pawar said the possession of the flat would be given in 18 months. From then to January 22, 2016, Dr. Samatkar paid ₹6.5 lakh for the flat. However, when he demanded to see the construction, Mr. Pawar started avoiding him. Finally, Mr. Samatkar managed to reach the plot where the builder had claimed the project was coming up, and found a barren plot with no construction. The doctor asked Mr. Pawar to return the money and the latter gave him a cheque for ₹5 lakh, which bounced.

Mr. Samatkar the filed a cheque bouncing case in court, and it ordered a warrant against Mr. Pawar. The builder, however, could not be found at the address given by the police. Mr. Samatkar then filed a complaint with the Kamothe police. “We suspect that he would have cheated many more people in similar way. We are investigating the case and are yet to make any arrest,” a police officer from Kamothe police station said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/police-on-lookout-for-man-who-cheated-doctor-of-65-lakh/article31071950.ece
33,2020/03/15,"Institute which talks about rights not paying employees minimum wages, says union","TISS contract workers protest at Azad Maidan to press demands

Over 100 contract employees of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) held a protest at Azad Maidan on Friday to place several demands to improve their current working conditions, chief being a revision in their salaries, which have been pending for several years.

The employees, many of whom have been working at the institute for over a decade, came together to form a union around two years ago to press their demands. Vijay Dalvi, secretary, Sarva Shramik Sangh, said in an institute which talks and teaches about rights, its employees were not even getting minimum wages.

“Our demands are from the TISS administration as they are the principal employer,” he said.

The salary revision that these contract employees are demanding has been pending since 2014. “There is huge discrepancy in the salaries of contract workers as compared to those who are permanent. For instance, a peon on contract earns only ₹12,500 a month, while one who is permanent can earn anywhere between ₹28,000 and ₹35,000 per month,” Siddharth Phadke, who works in the academic section, said.

He said nearly 75% staff at the Mumbai and Tuljapur campuses were on contract, the former has 350 contract staff and the latter has 120. “We have gone on a one-day mass leave to press our demands,” Mr. Phadke said.

Other major issues include restoration of bonus and a five-day week. The employees claim the latter was arbitrarily revoked and turned into a six-day work week in 2017.

Vikas Gangurde, who works in the dining hall department, said another major issue was regarding overtime and pending leave. “A new contractor was appointed in January, who did not consider our pending leave. On an average, all of us had 53 leaves pending,” he said.

Mr. Phadke said the old contractor would pay only ₹12.5 per hour overtime, which was much less than what was mandated by law. “The new contractor has agreed to pay us overtime as per the law, but has been forcing people to take compensatory leave instead,” he said. A group of protesters also met with Minister of State for Labour Bacchu Kadu.

M.P. Balamurugan, acting registrar, Mumbai campus, TISS, said they had been in touch with the employees and on March 11 had agreed to two of their demands, and that other demands were being looked into. “We have been paying salaries in accordance of the law and they receive salaries that are higher than minimum wages. We have already agreed to carry forward 45 days leave and paying overtime according to the Payment of Wages Act,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3dq2ta/article31071936.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bm-TISS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/institute-which-talks-about-rights-not-paying-employees-minimum-wages-says-union/article31071937.ece
34,2020/03/15,Russian tourist’s phone traced within hours,"Woman had left her phone in a taxi

A Russian tourist will go back home with fond memories of India, after the Byculla police traced and recovered her cell phone, which she had forgotten in a taxi, within a few hours of the incident being reported.

According to the Byculla police, the tourist, Shaisidikova Tatiana (27), took a cab from Kamala Mills compound in Lower Parel to go to Hotel Heritage in Byculla, where she reached around 11.30 p.m. on Wednesday. It was only after the cab left that she realised that she did not have her cell phone, an iPhone 11.

“Ms. Tatiana approached us on Thursday morning, and we initiated inquiries into the matter. We started by examining footage from CCTV cameras covering the path that her taxi took, which helped us locate the vehicle. We then used the footage to identify the licence plate number of the taxi,” senior police inspector Dinesh Kadam, Byculla police station, said.

Language barrier

Mr. Kadam said the investigating team used the vehicle number to obtain the taxi driver’s details from the Regional Transport Office and traced him.

“We found that the driver had her cell phone but could not contact her using it as the default language set on the phone was Russian, which he knew nothing about” Mr. Kadam said.

The police then called Ms. Tatiana to the police station and handed her phone over to her. Mr. Kadam also said no action will be taken against the driver, considering the circumstances.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/russian-tourists-phone-traced-within-hours/article31071917.ece
35,2020/03/15,Virus fears drive up anxiety levels in vulnerable patients,"People with mental health issues reach out to psychiatrists

The medication of a 30-year-old man with severe obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) had to be re-adjusted as he became extremely paranoid about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and feared he would contract the infection.

In another case, a 20-year-old woman, who had travelled to Europe last month, had to be prescribed a mild dose of anti-anxiety medication as she could not deal with thoughts of being infected even though she presented no persistent symptoms. As COVID-19 cases multiply, many people, especially those with existing mental health issues, are finding it challenging to cope with the prevailing panic and have reached out to psychiatrists.

“It is difficult for those with existing anxiety, OCD, and depression issues and queries from them have been increasing. They are getting anxious with the slightest of symptoms and sometimes with no symptoms at all,” said Dr. Kersi Chavda, psychiatrist, who treated the 30-year-old man as well as the 20-year-old woman.

Nervous time

“The patient with OCD required a lot of reassurance that he was unlikely to catch the infection. But eventually, I had to re-adjust his dosage,” said Dr. Chavda. The woman, Dr. Chavda added, went to Kasturba Hospital to get herself checked, but continued to be nervous and had to be put on anti-anxiety medication. “She had no history of anxiety, but this episode pushed her to seek help,” he said.

Another city-based psychiatrist Dr. Hozefa Bhinderwala said the caller tune on COVID-19 has also played a considerable role in triggering anxiety. “Just imagine a person having to listen to the message 25 times a day or even more. It will definitely have an impact,” said Dr. Binderwala, who has received many queries from his patients to know more about the virus. “Some of my patients are simply panic-stricken and are calling me for authentic information,” he said.

Doctors said fake social media messages are also adding to the panic. “Many of these messages have wrong figures about the number of confirmed cases. People should not believe any such messages which don’t have any authenticity,” said Dr. Daksha Shah, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s health officer

Doctors also recommend temporarily staying off social media to avoid anxiety.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/q7b7go/article31071897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMANXIETY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/virus-fears-drive-up-anxiety-levels-in-vulnerable-patients/article31071898.ece

A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed at the Bombay High Court on Friday, challenging assured special facilities to be given to fugitive economic offender Vijay Mallya at Arthur Road Jail, when he is brought there.

Citizens Action Group filed the PIL before a Division Bench of acting Chief Justice B.P. Dharmadhikari and Justice Nitin Borkar, challenging the assured special arrangements in jail barracks for Mr. Mallya and Sanjeev Chawla, a bookie brought to India from U.K.

The PIL says the State government and jail authorities have assured special facilities to the two in the extradition proceeding, such as 3 sq.m. of individual space not including furniture, adequate natural and artificial light, adequate ventilationby three fans and open grilled windows, storage for personal belongings, sufficient access to clean drinking water, toilets with separate flushing lavatories and washing facilities and shower, a television, and special dietary requirements.

Mr. Mallya has also been assured access to lawyers daily with facility for video conferencing and that he would be provided with a specialist or private doctor of his choice as and when required. Mr. Chawla has been assured a separate cell of six square metres on single occupancy basis, excluding toilet and sanitary area.

37,2020/03/15,"Ola, Uber must protect drivers amid air of mistrust, say unions","Demand companies to set up kiosks to provide safety kits

Unions of Ola and Uber drivers have demanded the companies to provide them with safety kits so that they don’t get infected with the novel coronavirus.

“Ola and Uber drivers are often the first ones to come in contact with passengers who may have coronavirus. The two companies should not expect drivers to reach their centres to receive the safety kits, but set up kiosks offering disinfectants, masks and hand sanitisers at major pick-up points such as airports,” said Shaik Salauddin, national general secretary, Indian Federation of App Based Transport Workers (IFAT). Mr. Salauddin also highlighted the case of an Ola driver who tested positive after ferrying two people from Mumbai to Pune.

He said over the past week several drivers have reported that their customers are insisting that they wear masks and disinfect their cars. “Why should the driver buy masks and disinfectants? Don’t the companies have a social obligation?” Mr. Salauddin said.

K.

38,2020/03/15,Ferry capsizes near Mandwa jetty,"Water started entering boat after it hit a rock; all 90 on board rescued

An Ajanta Catamarans boat belonging to Gateway Elephanta Jal Vahatuk Sahakari Sanstha, carrying 90 people, capsized near Mandwa in Raigad on Saturday morning.

All the 85 passengers and five staff on the ferry were rescued and no one was hurt in the mishap, the Raigad police said. The ferry was on its way to Mandwa jetty from Gateway of India when the incident occurred around 10.15 a.m. According to the police, prima facie, the boat hit a rock and water started entering it, after which an alert was issued.

The police’s Sadguru Krupa patrol boat, which was close to the ferry’s location, was diverted to the spot to rescue the passengers, who had already donned life jackets. Constable Prashant Gharat, who on the patrol boat, spotted Al Fatah and realised it was tilted. “I took the trawler near the ferry and heard people crying for help since the boat had capsized partially. Mandwa jetty had been alerted and a speedboat was on its way. We managed to take 80 people on our trawler and remaining 10 were carried by the speedboat,” Mr. Gharat said.

The ferry had left from Gateway around 9 a.m. “While it was around a kilometre away from Mandwa jetty, it hit something and water started entering the boat. Due to the dredging work happening for RoRo service, the channel of the ferry has been distributed. Last week too, another such catamaran was damaged. The ferry operator, Mustaq Shaikh, alerted Mandwa jetty immediately,” Kaifiyat Ahmad Mullah, secretary, Gateway Elephanta Jal Vahatuk Sahakari Sanstha, said, adding that the capacity of the catamaran was 100 people including staff.

The police are verifying the boat’s documents. “We have not registered any case and are following the due procedure,” assistant police inspector Dharmaraj Sonke, Mandwa police station, said.

“These boats are 40 to 50 years old hence they often face technical issues. Maharashtra Maritime Board and Directorate General of Shipping should conduct a proper survey and check their condition,” Chandrakant Mokal, president, All India Passengers Association, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/oibcoy/article31071846.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMBOATCAPSIZE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ferry-capsizes-near-mandwa-jetty/article31071847.ece
39,2020/03/15,"Construction goods theft racket busted, one held","Drivers of trucks ferrying material sell some of it en route

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch has busted a racket where drivers of container trucks ferrying construction material have allegedly been pilfering goods worth lakhs of rupees using an ingenious and intricate method. While one person has been arrested so far, the scope of the racket is expected to widen to several States.

According to Crime Branch officers, the Property Cell received a tip-off that construction material was being pilfered on a regular basis, causing losses to builders. Acting on the information, the Property Cell patrolled the Tagore Nagar stretch of the Eastern Express Highway for several days till they hit pay dirt on Wednesday.

“We saw a 16-wheel trailer carrying iron rods used in building construction parked by the side of the road on a desolate stretch, next to two cabins, which are detachable. However, both the cabins had the same licence plate number. We detained the driver for questioning and he confessed that he had picked up a consignment of 40 tonnes of iron rods from Nagpur to be delivered to a construction site in Kalyan, but sold two tonnes in Amravati on the way,” an officer said.

The driver, Udyogsingh Nath (28), described the modus operandi to the investigating team. Officers said the method was unheard off till date but, according to Mr. Nath, has been in practice for a long time.

“Mr. Nath left from Nagpur and got his consignment weighed at a government-approved weighbridge, which issued a certificate bearing his name and truck’s licence plate number, along with the weight of the consignment. After selling two tonnes of iron rods in Amravati, Mr. Nath drove to Tagore Nagar, where he had a second cabin for the trailer, with the exact same licence plate, waiting at a secluded spot. A cabin that pulls trailers has two compartments, a front seat and a space in the back. This empty back space was filled to the brim with sand to make up for the lost weight so the consignment weighs the same when it is received by the builder,” the officer said.

According to investigating officers, there are several cabins packed with sand in the back space being used by drivers, which have enabled the racket to run for a long time. On an average, a trailer driver makes two to three trips in a month. Iron rods sell for ₹40,000 per tonne in the open market, and even if the driver sells two tonnes for ₹25,000 each, he makes ₹50,000 on each trip.

Mr. Nath was arrested and charged with cheating and forgery under the Indian Penal Code. He has been remanded in police custody till March 19 and the Property Cell is working on identifying the other players.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2j9bl9/article31071828.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15bmtruckrev,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/construction-goods-theft-racket-busted-one-held/article31071829.ece
40,2020/03/15,New COVID-19 testing lab at KEM,"Facility will be ready by next week; BMC forms 667 teams to spread awareness

Mumbai is all set to have a new laboratory to test the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Civic health officials on Saturday said the new testing facility will be ready at KEM Hospital in Parel by next week.

Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) health officer Dr. Daksha Shah said besides opening the new laboratory, the working hours of the existing facility at Kasturba Hospital will be increased. “The new lab at KEM will be opened at the earliest. We are waiting for some tests to be carried out on the premises,” she said.

Aggressive drive

According to Dr. Shah, the civic body has also aggressively started spreading awareness of the disease to curb its spread. Medical field officers of all 24 wards in Mumbai have been divided into 667 teams and are conducting awareness drives and distributing posters in as many as 2,912 housing societies. She said, “These teams approach the houses and ensure that any person showing symptoms or having travel history to the affected countries is home quarantined for at least 14 days. The teams started their work on Saturday and have so far covered 35,000 houses.”

Dr. Shah said not everyone needs to get tested at Kasturba Hospital. She said, “If one has a foreign travel history and experiences symptoms, only then you need to be tested. Otherwise, self-quarantine is suggested. A quarantine facility of 300 beds has started at Seven Hills Hospital in Andheri and three medical teams of two medical officers and two health workers have been made available in three shifts.” She said these teams will report cases with symptoms and one ambulance has been deployed to transfer symptomatic travellers.

Dr. Shah also said the use of masks and sanitisers is not necessary. “We should adopt habits such as covering our mouths with handkerchiefs or tissues and washing our hands with soap and water. Schools also should not force students to carry masks and sanitisers. This will be a good opportunity to inculcate good hygiene etiquette in children,” she said.

Dr. Shah also requested the public to not panic over COVID-19. She said, “Do not circulate or forward photos and identities of any patients on social media.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xzej0/article31071762.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMDAKSHASHAHMUMBAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/new-covid-19-testing-lab-at-kem/article31071763.ece
41,2020/03/15,HC restricts hearings to only matters of urgency,"Measure will be in effect for a week

The acting Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court on Saturday restricted hearings to only urgent matters across all courts in the State for a week from Monday as a precautionary measure to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

The notification is applicable to all Benches in Mumbai, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Goa, and district, sessions and subordinate courts in Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur and Ahmednagar.

It states, “Advocates, litigants and parties in persons may mention their matters showing the urgency before the concerned courts and upon satisfaction about the urgency, the court shall hear such matters. CMIS [Case Management Information System] dates would be given to the rest of the matters. Orders of ad-interim and interim relief subsisting in the matter shall continue to operate.”

All bar associations and advocates have been directed to restrict the entry of litigants and allow only one person in cases where their presence is unavoidable. The notification said, “Advocates and party in person are requested to provide number and stage of matter on daily board, which they want to be taken up urgently to the concerned court sheristedar or associate prior to 11 a.m. Rest of the matters on Regular Board shall stand adjourned.”

‘Highest level of hygiene’

The advisory for lower courts mentions that principal judges should ensure that sanitisers are made available in court complexes for visitors and staff, particularly those manning windows. Housekeeping staff have been directed to maintain the highest level of hygiene and spray disinfectants on a regular basis.

The circular said, “In criminal matters, the request for exemption from personal appearance of the accused be considered favourably. In civil matters, wherever possible, service of local commissioner be availed of for the purposes of recording of evidence, after obtaining the consent of both the parties. Instead of physical production of undertrial prisoners from jails, facility of video conferencing be availed of. Unnecessary crowding in the lock-up be curtailed and appropriate steps in this regard be taken by all District and Sessions Judges in consultation with prison authorities.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-restricts-hearing-to-only-matters-of-urgency/article31071256.ece
42,2020/03/15,Elusive refunds pose headache to travel industry,"With the government suspending all tourist visas till April 15, requests for cancellations have shot up

Securing refunds for high-spending foreign tourists against cancellations is proving to be one of the biggest challenges for people in the travel industry.

With the government suspending visas, requests for cancellations have shot up, but unlike major hotels and airlines, big-ticket holiday packages like tiger safaris and the Palace on Wheels are not entertaining refunds.

Several groups from Germany and France were due to visit India and had adopted a wait-and-watch approach, but Wednesday’s decision of the government to revoke visas has led to forced cancellations. “There are major challenges on the refund part. Most hotels, major airlines and taxi operators are more receptive and cooperating with refunds. It is that some government entities are just not responding,” said Pronab Sarkar, president, Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO).

IATO on Thursday had appealed to the government to review the travel ban after 14 days and waive the GST for the travel industry for one month. It has also sought the intervention of Ministry of Tourism with regard to issuing refunds.

Mr. Sarkar said besides the Palace on Wheels, where tariffs for the seven nights and eight days trip ranges from ₹2.73 lakh to ₹7.56 lakh per person, national parks are refusing refunds despite taking advance payments.

The luxury train takes tourists to Jaipur, Sawai Madhopur (Ranthambore National Park), Chittaurgarh, Udaipur, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Bharatpur, and Agra before returning to Delhi. The Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, which operates the Maharajas’ Express, is however promptly giving refunds to tourists.

Mr. Sarkar said, “Refunds are due from Ranthambore, Corbett, and Pench national parks. We have told them that this is not the time to make money but to cooperate with the tourists so that they get back their refunds and plan trips in the near future. If we cancel and not refund it means that the chapter is closed and this will only lead to the tourists telling others not to visit India because the money gets stuck. This will have a bad impact.”

Foreign tourists already in India are feeling the effects of the travel restrictions. In Punjab, a group of tourists from Denmark, wanting to attend Hola Mohalla, were asked to undergo a medical check-up. They were later denied permission by the district administration. Hola Mohalla, which is held between March 10 and 12, is a Sikh festival that takes place on the second day of the lunar month of Chett. Similarly, tourists had to leave Hampi in Karnataka and move to Tamil Nadu as local government officials panicked and asked them to leave.

Rajesh Mudgill, secretary IATO, said the ban on all travel for a month will have a cascading economic impact and lead to job losses in the hotel, aviation and travel sectors. “We estimate it will lead to direct loss of not less than ₹8,500 crore,” he said.

Subhash Goyal, chairman of Assocham National Council on Tourism and Hospitality, said he foresees job losses in these sectors as companies are trying to tide over the crisis by removing non-essential work forces and stopping recruitment.

Mr. Goyal said, “The government should review the decision to suspend visas for a month and allow inbound travel through limited gateway cities. If no visas are valid, within the next 10 days the travel and tourism industry will come to a virtual stop. It would mean that everyone will cut down costs and terminate non-essential staff and stop recruiting additional staff.”

Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, vice president of Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India, said hotel room cancellations had crossed 80%. “New bookings are almost completely on hold, including the non-resident Indian segment, which accounts for 60% of tourism revenues mostly from April to September,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5g11xa/article31071165.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/elusive-refunds-pose-headache-to-travel-industry/article31071166.ece
43,2020/03/15,"Fresh blankets, sanitised toilets soon in AC coaches","CR, WR to remove curtains, cloth blinds

The Central Railway (CR) and the Western Railway (WR) will be removing curtains and replacing old blankets in air-conditioned compartments across trains to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer of CR, said curtains would be taken off over the next four or five days and in the case of roller blinds the cloth will be removed. Mr. Sutar said, “These are the key places that come into contact with passengers. Monitoring such areas would be a tough task and hence this decision has been taken.”

CR will also be replacing old blankets with fresh ones. All blankets will be soaked in high temperature in the tumble dryers of laundries, which will raise the temperature to 75-80 degrees Celsius. The blankets will be given only to passengers who ask for them.

“We are also increasing the temperature of the air-conditioned compartments to between 23 and 25 degrees Celsius so that passengers don’t feel the need for blankets,” Mr. Sutar said.

A senior railway official said unlike bedsheets, fresh blankets are not provided after each trip as they are thicker and take time to dry. The official said CR will also be carrying out intensive cleaning of toilets and washbasins using hot water.

A WR spokesperson said, “Blankets and curtains should be withdrawn till further orders. Passengers should be advised to bring their own blankets. Wide publicly should be given to this effect. Extra bedsheets may be kept for exigencies.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cve0u6/article31071141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BMRAILWAYBUDGET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fresh-blankets-sanitised-toilets-soon-in-ac-coaches/article31071142.ece

46,2020/03/15,"Across the Gulf, no warm greetings and mosque prayers","‘Corona phobia’ is making people change their habits

No shisha pipe sessions, deserted streets, mosques and shopping malls, drones in the sky broadcasting public health warnings — the new coronavirus has turned life upside down in Gulf societies.

More than 800 cases of the COVID-19 have been recorded so far across the six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), but so far no deaths.

Facing a mounting public health threat, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman have taken drastic measures to combat the pandemic.

Awkward greetings

Drones in the skies were sounding messages in multiple languages urging people to return to their homes.

Residents in the Omani capital of Muscat told AFP there had been much “fear and panic” over what many of them have termed “Corona phobia” at a time when a small bottle of disinfectant is in almost everyone’s pockets or bags.

They said many people have stopped shaking hands or kissing each other on the cheeks, a common greeting across the Arab world.

In Saudi Arabia, 60-year-old Abu Abdulrahman said he felt awkward about the rapidly changing social norms. “Do I shake hands and kiss or do I not? I don’t know,” he said. “I try not to do that, but I get embarrassed. What if the other person puts their hand out first?”

Meanwhile, both the UAE and Qatar have advised their citizens to stop the traditional “nose to nose” greeting, with Abu Dhabi instructing residents that a wave would suffice.

Measures to combat the spread of the virus have also impacted the way many Muslims in the Gulf worship.

After Saudi Arabia suspended the “umrah” year-round pilgrimage, it advised residents against praying in mosques if they have any symptoms of the virus.

Kuwait banned all mass prayers, an unprecedented move.

Some U.S. politicians are using coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) as a weapon to smear China, the Xinhua official news agency said on Sunday, as a war of words escalated between the two countries over China’s handling of the epidemic.

The editorial accused Robert O’Brien, the U.S. National Security Adviser, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of spreading a “political virus” and using it to put China down.

Mr. O’Brien said last week that China had reacted slowly to the virus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing, in remarks that angered China. Mr. Pompeo has said the U.S. response to the outbreak had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from China.

‘Precious time’ earned

However, Xinhua said China’s actions including strict quarantine of millions of people had earned the world “precious time” to prepare for the epidemic, which has been recognised by the international community.

It added that the U.S. efforts to deal with its own virus cases had been widely criticised.

Xinhua also attacked the U.S. politicians for calling the virus the “Wuhan virus” or “Chinese virus”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-us-officials-spreading-political-virus-says-china/article31076159.ece
49,2020/03/15,4 sentenced to death for Bangladesh priest’s murder,"They are members of the Islamist JMB

Four Islamist extremists were sentenced to death in Bangladesh on Sunday for the 2016 decapitation of a senior Hindu priest during a spate of attacks targeting religious minorities in the Muslim-majority nation.

The Islamic State (IS) had claimed responsibility for the attack in the northern district of Panchagarh, but authorities blamed militants from Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). “The court... sentenced all four to death over the murder. They are JMB members,” said Abdur Rafique, a court official in the capital Dhaka.

The priest was a prominent member of Bangladesh’s Hindu community, which makes up nearly 10% of the South Asian country’s population of 168 million.

JMB was blamed for the murders of minorities, secular writers, publishers and foreigners between 2013 and 2016. Among them was a savage attack at a Dhaka cafe in 2016 that killed 22 people, mostly foreigners.

Seven Islamist extremists were sentenced to death in November over the assault that was claimed by the IS.

50,2020/03/15,Coronavirus: U.S. airport authorities feel the heat as passengers return from Europe,"People complain of general disarray in screening process

Chaos gripped major U.S. airports on Sunday as Americans returning from COVID-19-hit European countries overwhelmed authorities attempting to process the surge.

Frustrated passengers complained of hours-long lines, crowded and unsanitary conditions and general disarray in the system for screening people for symptoms of the virus. “Very close quarters,” Ann Lewis Schmidt told CNN, describing conditions at Chicago’s O'Hare International Airport (ORD). “So if we didn’t have the virus before, we have a great chance of getting it now!” Schmidt said.

U.S. airports have been hit with a flood of Americans, many of them students, since restrictions on travel from Europe ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump took effect at midnight Friday.

Ban now applies to U.K.

The United States on Saturday extended the ban on travel from Europe, South Korea and China to Britain and Ireland.

Only U.S. citizens and legal residents are being allowed in from those countries, and they are then supposed to self-quarantine for 14 days.

Similar conditions were reported at New York’s JFK Airport and in Dallas.

Chad Wolf, acting Homeland Security secretary, acknowledged the long lines in a tweet and said his department was trying to add screening capacity.

“It currently takes ~60 seconds for medical professionals to screen each passenger. We will be increasing capacity but the health and safety of the American public is first & foremost.”

The airport bottlenecks were the latest evidence of turbulence in the administration’s response to a pandemic that started in China in December and has since spread worldwide.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-us-airport-authorities-feel-the-heat-as-passengers-return-from-europe/article31076045.ece
51,2020/03/15,Coronavirus: Trump tests negative for virus as U.S. expands Europe travel ban,"Mr. Trump agreed to the test after coming in contact with several members of a Brazilian presidential delegation visiting his Florida resort who have since tested positive

U.S. President Donald Trump has tested negative for COVID-19, his physician said, following concerns over his exposure to a disease that has paralysed the globe.

Mr. Trump agreed to the test after coming in contact with several members of a Brazilian presidential delegation visiting his Florida resort who have since tested positive for the virus.

“This evening I received confirmation that the test is negative,” the President’s physician Sean Conley said in a Saturday memo.

Mr. Trump, 73, had dismissed concerns over his exposure to the disease which has killed at least 51 Americans and upended the rhythm of daily life across the country, with millions working from home and schools shut.

New York, the most populous U.S. city, saw its first coronavirus death on Saturday, as store shelves were stripped bare after days of panic buying.

Across the Hudson River in Teaneck, New Jersey, Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin called for a citywide self-quarantine after 18 cases were confirmed in the township.

“What we are saying is that we are ground zero,” Mr. Hameeduddin said. “Expect or act as though you're going to infect somebody or somebody is going to infect you.”

Vice President Mike Pence announced further curbs on travel to the United States, saying a ban imposed on European nations over the pandemic would be extended to the United Kingdom and Ireland Tuesday.

The restrictions threw airports across the country into disarray, with incoming travellers forced to wait hours for medical screenings before passing through customs.

Illinois governor JB Pritzker said the long lines at Chicago's O'Hare airport were “unacceptable.”

“The federal government needs to get its s@#t together. NOW,” he tweeted.

Acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf said his office was working with airlines to improve screening times.

Mr. Trump advised against non-essential travel and said officials were also considering imposing domestic restrictions.

“If you don't have to travel, I wouldn't do it,” Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference. “We want this thing to end.”

In an official proclamation, he also named Sunday a national day of prayer “for all people who have been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.”

Mr. Trump declared a national emergency on Friday, freeing up some $40 billion in disaster relief funds.

The U.S. House of Representatives also passed a bill — crafted by Democrats in consultation with the Trump administration — to provide billions of dollars for free virus testing, emergency paid sick leave and family leave. It is expected to pass the Republican-majority Senate.

The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed more than 5,800 lives in at least 137 countries.

Repeatedly attacked for sending out mixed signals on the health crisis, the president raised eyebrows on Friday when, contrary to medical advice, he was seen shaking hands as he gathered his coronavirus response team at the White House.

On Saturday, he blamed habit — “people put their hand out... you don't think about it” — but said it would have to change.

“Maybe people shouldn't be shaking hands for the long term,” said Mr. Trump, a self-declared germophobe.

Mr. Trump's virus test came after contact with the Brazilian delegation as well as US lawmakers and political leaders who have gone into self-quarantine over potential infection.

Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel was on Saturday awaiting results of a virus test after she came down with flu-like symptoms. She reportedly attended an event in Florida with Mr. Trump on Monday and flew back to Washington on Air Force One.

52,2020/03/15,Coronavirus: Germany tries to stop U.S. from luring away firm preparing vaccine,"Mr. Trump was trying to secure the scientists’ work exclusively, and would do anything to get a vaccine for the United States, sources say

Berlin is trying to stop Washington from persuading a German company seeking a vaccine to the virus to move its research to the United States, prompting German politicians to insist no country should have a monopoly on any future vaccine.

German government sources said on Sunday that the U.S. administration was looking into how it could gain access to a potential vaccine being developed by a German firm, CureVac.

Earlier, the Welt am Sonntag German newspaper reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered funds to lure CureVac to the United States, and the German government was making counter-offers to tempt it to stay. “The German government is very interested in ensuring that vaccines and active substances against the new coronavirus are also developed in Germany and Europe,” a Health Ministry spokeswoman said, confirming a quote in the newspaper. “In this regard, the government is in intensive exchange with the company CureVac,” she added.

Welt am Sonntag also quoted an unidentified German government source as saying Mr. Trump was trying to secure the scientists’ work exclusively, and would do anything to get a vaccine for the United States, “but only for the United States.”

A German Economy Ministry spokeswoman also said Berlin “has a great interest” in producing vaccines in Germany and Europe.

She declined to comment on any takeover possibilities but referred to Germany’s foreign trade law, under which Berlin can examine takeover bids from non-EU, so-called third countries “if national or European security interests are at stake”.

Florian von der Muelbe, CureVac’s chief production officer and co-founder, said last week the company had started with a multitude of vaccine candidates and was now selecting the two best to go into clinical trials.

53,2020/03/15,First Russian-Turkish patrol on Syrian highway cut short by protests,"The patrol on the M4 highway in Idlib province was the result of a March 5 ceasefire accord between Moscow and Ankara, which back opposing sides in Syria’s nine-year war

Russia and Turkey cut short their first joint patrol in Syria’s Idlib on Sunday after rebels and civilians opposed to a ceasefire agreement cut off a main roadway to block its path, according to witnesses and Russian news agencies.

The patrol on the M4 highway in Idlib province was the result of a March 5 ceasefire accord between Moscow and Ankara, which back opposing sides in Syria’s nine-year war. The ceasefire has largely held since then.

Under the deal, which halted hostilities after an escalation of violence that displaced nearly a million people, Turkish and Russian forces are to establish a security corridor on either side of the M4, as well as carry out joint patrols along it.

But on Sunday hundreds of civilians and rebels cut off the roadway, rejecting the presence of Russian forces and what they said was an agreement that did not guarantee their re-settlement after being pushed out by violence.

“If the patrols happen without people being able to return to their lands, we oppose them,” said Osama Rahal, a military commander with the Syrian National Army, a Turkey backed rebel group.

Protesters, some waving Syrian National Army flags, climbed atop Turkish tanks or stood in their path, according to witnesses. Photos posted by the Syrian Observatory, a Britain-based war monitor, showed people lighting fires in the street and forming human chains.

“We are at odds with Russians who have been killing us for six years and have bombed us by air. So we oppose their entry into our towns,” said Ahmed Shehad, 22.

The Russian Defence Ministry said the joint patrols were cut short because of rebel “provocations” and civilians being used as a human shield, forcing them to take a shorter route, according to Russian news agency RIA.

Ankara has been given more time to rein in rebels undermining the patrols, the Russian defence ministry said.

The Turkish Defence Ministry said the first patrol had been completed with air and land assets. It released photos showing Russian and Turkish military vehicles travelling along a highway and officers in discussion as they looked at a map.

It subsequently said the two sides in coordination “took necessary measures, with the aim of preventing potential provocations and harm to the civilian population in the region”. It did not give further details.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/d5hplf/article31075889.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TOPSHOT-SYRIA-CONFLICT-IDLIB-TURKEY-RUSSIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/first-russian-turkish-patrol-on-syrian-highway-cut-short-by-protests/article31075890.ece

Malaysia reported 190 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, with most linked to a religious event at a mosque that was attended by 16,000 people from several countries.

The new cases bring the total number of infections in the country to 428, the health ministry said, making it the worst affected in Southeast Asia.

A total of 243 cases have been linked to the mosque gathering with 9 cases critically ill in intensive care, the ministry said, adding that all event participants and their close contacts will be placed under mandatory quarantine for 14 days.

About 14,500 Malaysians and 1,500 foreigners attended the religious gathering between Feb. 27 and March 1 at a mosque near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysian health authorities have said.

Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Friday that the country was facing a “second wave” of infections, and warned of an impact on economic growth.

In neighbouring Brunei, 45 of the total 50 cases have been linked to the religious gathering, the health ministry said on Sunday.

The ministry also said Bruneians and foreign residents are barred from leaving the country due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Singapore has also reported some cases linked to the same event.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v9hk49/article31075393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKMALAYSIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-malaysia-virus-tally-hits-highest-in-southeast-asia-due-to-mosque-event/article31075394.ece

56,2020/03/15,Coronavirus: U.K. defends virus plan as ‘wartime’ measures loom,"Critics have accused the government of not acting quickly enough to contain the spread

Britain on Sunday said its criticised plan to deal with COVID-19 was designed to “protect life” in a “sustainable” manner as it prepared to unveil “wartime-style” measures to tackle the outbreak.

The government has yet to implement the kind of tough measures that continental Europe has adopted, but Health Minister Matt Hancock said Sunday it would announce emergency powers on Tuesday, which are expected to include a ban on mass gatherings.

“We are absolutely ready to do that,” he said.

“We’ll take the right action at the right time,” he said, adding “the time is coming.”

Critics have accused the government of not acting quickly enough to contain the spread, but the government has said that it is taking the advice of experts, including behavioural scientists, on when to deploy the measures.

“The goal here is to protect life, the measures have to be sustainable,” he later told the BBC. “We will stop at nothing to fight this virus”.

Other measures being considered include instructing people over 70 to stay in strict isolation at home or in care homes for four months, a Whitehall source told ITV News.

“That is in the action plan yes, there will be more details when it is the right time to do so,” he told Sky, adding that it would be within the “coming weeks”.

The “wartime-style” effort could see the requisitioning of hotels and private hospitals as emergency treatment centres as well as the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants, said the ITV report.

Chief medical officer Chris Whitty and chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance are waiting for the “optimal time” to deploy the “painful” measures, it added, believing that fatigue will set in and that old people could die of neglect if they move too early.

“We are going to need a massive community response,” Mr. Hancock said. “Every single person in this country is going to be affected.”

He also promised that the government would publish its models “in the next couple of days” following demands from the scientific community to see the underlying data.

There has also been some confusion about Mr. Vallance’s suggestion on Thursday that they wanted enough people to catch the virus to build up “herd immunity”.

Mr. Hancock told Sky that herd immunity was “not our goal” and that “our policy is to protect lives”.

Britain’s death toll from the disease nearly doubled on Saturday, as health officials announced 10 more people had died, bringing the total number of fatalities to 21.

France voted in municipal elections on Sunday that risk a low turnout as the mounting COVID-19 toll saw the government indefinitely close bars, restaurants and schools and limit long-distance travel.

Anti-infection precautions were in place at the country’s 35,000-odd voting stations, with bottles of hand sanitiser at the entrance, a personal distance of about one metre (3.3 feet) marked with tape on the floor, and booths positioned in such a way that voters can avoid touching the privacy curtain.

Several voters turned out sporting surgical masks and clutching their own bottles of sanitising gel as the streets of Paris were empty and its usually bustling restaurants and cafe terraces shuttered on a sunny Sunday afternoon.

France is one of the countries hardest-hit by the virus with some 4,500 out of 150,000 global infections and 91 of more than 5,700 deaths worldwide.

Three hours after polling stations opened at 07:00 GMT, countrywide turnout was just over 18% — nearly five percentage points lower than the previous municipal vote in 2014, government data showed.

The capital had a particularly low tally with 12.6%.

But some voters were undeterred.

“One must vote,” Bernard Gallis, 66, said upon leaving an otherwise empty polling station in Aulnay-Sous-Bois outside Paris.

“There is no one here, and the risk is low,” he said gesturing towards the balloting station where his wife and six officials seated at tables laden with political party pamphlets were the only other people.

His children aged 40, 36, and 32, however, have said they will not vote due to the virus, said Mr. Gallis.

President Emmanuel Macron, for whom the two-round election is a crucial mid-term test, has insisted it goes ahead to assure democratic continuity.

Many have questioned the wisdom of maintaining Sunday’s vote for mayors and some half-a-million local councillors amid widespread fear that polling stations are ideal germ-spreading venues.

The country has indefinitely closed creches, schools and universities, banned gatherings of more than 100 people, and urged residents to limit their movements in a bid to curtail the spread of the virus.

Fresh restrictions announced late Saturday included shutting cafes, restaurants, cinemas and gyms, in a bid to prevent hospitals becoming overrun with sick people.

On Sunday, the government announced that long-distance travel, including trains and international flights will be limited and domestic public transport reduced.

Museums, theatres and tourists sites such as the Eiffel Tower have been closed, and Mr. Macron himself has urged people over 70, who are most affected by the virus, to stay home in as far as possible

Last-minute plea

On Saturday, several local officials made a last-minute plea for a postponement, a day after Britain announced it had set back its own May local elections for a year over the coronavirus.

But in a televised address to an anxious nation Thursday, the president said scientists had assured him “there is nothing to prevent the French, even the most vulnerable, from going to the ballot box”, provided everyone observes basic infection-prevention rules.

Municipalities have announced protection measures including regular disinfection of door handles, voting booths and pens, while advising voters to bring their own writing implements.

And the chairman of France’s coronavirus science council said the risk from voting was no greater “than going shopping”.

Supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, gas stations and tobacco shops — which also sell newspapers, snacks and stamps — remain open in France.

Polling stations will remain open until 1700 GMT, 1800 GMT or 1900 GMT depending on the municipality, with a second round scheduled for March 22.

Some 47.7 million people are registered to vote in a country where mayors and local councillors enjoy high popularity compared to other levels of government.

But observers say many could shun the democratic exercise this time round for fear of contamination.

‘We’ll make French fries’

A recent opinion poll said 28% of potential voters in France were “concerned” about the risk posed by mingling at polling stations, often hosted at schools.

“It is certain that many people will be dissuaded from voting,” political historian Jean Garrigues of the University of Orleans said.

This could impact on the outcome, especially if certain demographic groups — such as older people, who tend to vote more on the right — stay away in larger numbers than others.

The election will be a key test for Macron, whose party swept Paris in the 2017 presidential election, but has since lost popularity in part due to its leader’s perceived autocratic leadership style and lack of common touch.

The French capital will be the main battleground, with incumbent socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo challenged by right-wing heavyweight Rachida Dati and Macron’s candidate Agnes Buzyn — who was parachuted in after his chosen hopeful, Benjamin Griveaux, pulled out over a sex-tape scandal.

“I have always voted, and I will not stop now. One just has to take precautions,” 90-year-old Lucien Bonnet said in Saint-Georges-de-Mons in central France.

“Normally, we would have gone to a restaurant after voting, but now we can’t. Never mind, we’ll make French fries!”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nv4ry3/article31074614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRANCEELECTIONSVIRUSOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-anxious-france-votes-in-local-polls-as-virus-shuts-cafes-schools/article31074615.ece
59,2020/03/15,ISIS travel advisory warns terrorists off coronavirus-hit Europe,"According to The Sunday Times, the latest issue of the ISIS ‘Al-Naba’ newsletter refers to a new set of “sharia directives” warning against travel to Europe.

The Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist group has issued a travel advisory for its operatives to steer clear of coronavirus-hit Europe, described as “the land of the epidemic”.

According to The Sunday Times, the latest issue of the ISIS Al-Naba newsletter refers to a new set of “sharia directives” warning against travel to Europe.

The West Asia-based terror outfit, which has in the past encouraged operatives to plot attacks in Europe, also instructed those of its followers who may have become ill with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) not to leave the region, in order to prevent the disease spreading.

The newsletter says that the “healthy should not enter the land of the epidemic and the afflicted should not exit from it”. It also instructs followers to “cover their mouths when yawning and sneezing” and to wash their hands regularly.

The newsletter refers to a “plague” described as a “torment sent by God on whomsoever He wills”, adding: “Illnesses do not strike by themselves but by the command and decree of God.”

ISIS has lost a lot of ground in West Asia after a series of defeats, but it remains active in Iraq and Syria in a fragmented form. West Asia has also been hit by the virus outbreak, with Iraq reporting 101 cases and 10 deaths from COVID-19.

60,2020/03/15,Coronavirus: Turkey quarantines thousands of pilgrims returning from Saudi Arabia,"Turkey has set up quarantine locations for more than 10,300 people returning from pilgrimages to Islam's holy sites in Saudi Arabia

Thousands of Muslims returning to Turkey from a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia were being taken into quarantine on Sunday due to concerns about the spread of COVID-19, Turkish officials said.

Television pictures showed buses transporting pilgrims along the highway from Ankara’s airport to the city as part of an operation to place those returning into student dormitories.

Turkey, which has only diagnosed six cases of coronavirus, has ramped up measures to halt its spread in recent days, closing schools and universities, holding sports events without spectators and halting flights to many countries.

On Wednesday it became the last major economy to report an outbreak after taking what the World Health Organization (WHO) described as “vigilant” measures to delay it.

Also Read Turkey announces first coronavirus case

The latest move came after Health Minister Fahrettin Koca called overnight for those returning from the Umrah pilgrimage to quarantine themselves for a fortnight, saying a returnee in the last week had become the sixth person to test positive.

He then announced on Sunday that the state was actively quarantining the returnees.

“All passengers returning from the Umrah since last night are being put into quarantine in separate rooms in student dormitories,” he wrote on Twitter, adding that those suspected of being ill were being taken to hospital for tests.

Earlier in March, Saudi Arabia expanded a rare freeze on pilgrimages to the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina by foreigners to also include Saudi citizens and residents due to concerns about coronavirus.

Umrah refers to pilgrimage rites carried out in the holy cities throughout the year, and is separate from the annual week-long haj, which typically draws 2 million Muslims from around the world. Haj starts this year in late July.

The head of Turkey’s religious directorate, Ali Erbas, said on Saturday that the last 5,300 Turkish pilgrims were in the process of returning to Turkey, but at the time he said the pilgrims should self-isolate at home for two weeks.

A day earlier he said that 21,000 pilgrims were to return from Saudi Arabia by March 15, but it was not clear whether they were all to go into quarantine.

The youth and sports ministry said the pilgrims were to be kept under observation for 14 days in five student dormitories - in the capital Ankara and the central Turkish city of Konya - with a capacity of 10,330 people.

It said the three-week closure of universities in Turkey, announced last week, meant that the dormitories were mostly empty and that the remaining students had been transferred to other dormitories.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/f289ru/article31074504.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKTURKEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-turkey-quarantines-thousands-of-pilgrims-returning-from-saudi-arabia/article31074505.ece

Iran has reported 113 more deaths from COVID-19 pandemic, bringing the country’s death toll to 724 amid 13,938 confirmed cases.

Iran has the worst outbreak in the Middle East and one of the worst outside China, where the virus first emerged late last year. The latest figures were announced by the Health Ministry.

Read | Over 230 Indians evacuated from Iran, quarantined at Army wellness centre in Jaisalmer

Iran’s official leading the country’s response to the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East on Sunday acknowledged that the pandemic could overwhelm health facilities in Iran, which is under severe U.S. sanctions.

Muslim authorities, meanwhile, announced that the Al-Aqsa mosque in east Jerusalem, the third holiest site in Islam, would be closed indefinitely due to concerns about the outbreak, with prayers continuing to be held on the sprawling esplanade outside.

Similar measures have been taken at the nearby Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews can pray, where outdoor prayers continue but only 10 people at a time are permitted in enclosed areas, in keeping with measures taken by the Israeli government.

Iran is battling one of the worst outbreaks outside China, with nearly 13,000 confirmed cases and more than 600 fatalities. The real number of infections could be even higher, as questions have been raised about the government’s transparency.

""If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,” Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak, was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency.

Also Read | 44 Indian pilgrims evacuated from Iran

Iran is believed to have around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in the capital, Tehran. Authorities have pledged to set up mobile clinics as needed.

Zali also acknowledged that “many” of those who have died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus were otherwise healthy, a rare admission by local authorities that the virus does not only prey on the sick and elderly.

For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. Most people recover in a matter of weeks.

The virus has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,800. More than 70,000 people worldwide have recovered after being infected.

In Iran, the virus has infected a number of senior officials, including the senior vice president, Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members and Health Ministry officials.

Authorities have nevertheless been slow to adopt measures taken by other hard-hit countries. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday ruled out a general quarantine and said the government was working to keep the borders open.

Dalia Samhouri, a senior regional official with the World Health Organization, said both Iran and Egypt, two of the most populous countries in the Middle East, were likely underreporting cases because of the nature of the virus, which can be spread by individuals who show no visible symptoms.

""We can easily say that the current figures are an underestimation of the actual figures,” she said.

Iran has struggled to respond in part because of crippling sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after the U.S. withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. The U.S. says it has offered humanitarian aid but that Iran has rejected it.

Countries across the Middle East have imposed sweeping travel restrictions, cancelled public events and in some cases called on non-essential businesses to close for the coming weeks.

In the skyscraper-studded city of Dubai, a global business and travel hub in the United Arab Emirates, authorities announced on Sunday that all movie theaters, arcades and gyms would be closed through the end of the month.

Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, also shut down its amusement parks and museums through the end of the month, including Louvre Abu Dhabi.

The UAE’s central bank meanwhile announced a $27 billion stimulus package directed at supporting banks and said regulatory limits on loans will be eased. Saudi Arabia announced its own $13 billion stimulus plan.

Al-Aqsa is the latest in a series of religious sites where access has been halted or strictly limited. Saudi Arabia has halted the umrah pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina and could be forced to limit or cancel the much larger haj later this year. On Sunday, it announced the temporary closure of all mosques and called off Friday prayers.

Sheikh Omar Kiswani, the director of the Al-Aqsa mosque, said Sunday that the closure of the mosque and other buildings on the compound, including the iconic golden Dome of the Rock, would continue indefinitely.

The religious site is also the holiest in Judaism because it was the location of the two Jewish temples in antiquity. Israel occupied and annexed east Jerusalem in the 1967 war in a move not recognized internationally. The Palestinians want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state, and the religious site has often been a flashpoint in the decades-long conflict.

Israel imposed sweeping travel and quarantine measures more than a week ago but has seen its number of confirmed cases double in recent days, to around 200. On Saturday, the government said restaurants, malls, movies, gyms and daycare centers would close. Schools and universities have already been shut down until next month.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s trial on serious corruption charges, which was supposed to begin this week, was postponed for two months due to restrictions on public gatherings.

Netanyahu has meanwhile been pressing for an emergency unity government with his main rival, former military chief Benny Gantz, following three inconclusive elections and more than a year of political deadlock. Gantz has appeared open to the idea.

Jordan, which had previously reported just one infection in a man who later recovered, confirmed six new cases. Four are French tourists while the other two are Jordanians, Health Minister Saad Jaber said Sunday.

Jordan has suspended all flights into and out of the kingdom except for aid workers and diplomats, and has closed schools for two weeks.

China has tightened checks on international travellers at Beijing airport and said it will centrally quarantine all arrivals at its capital, after new imported COVID-19 cases surpassed locally transmitted infections for a second day.

China, where the epidemic began in December, appears to now face a greater threat of new infections from outside its borders as it continues to slow the spread of the virus domestically.

Mainland China reported 20 new cases of infections on March 14, up from 11 cases a day earlier, data from by the National Health Commission (NHC) showed on Sunday.

Of those, 16 were imported, including 5 in the capital Beijing. Three of the cases in Beijing involved travellers from Spain while one came from Italy and the other from Thailand.

Against this background, the Beijing government has said anyone arriving from abroad will be transferred to city quarantine facilities for 14 days, starting Monday.

All expenses during the period will be borne by those in quarantine, city deputy secretary general Chen Bei said.

Some may be allowed to quarantine themselves at home after strict evaluation, Ms. Chen added, without offering details.

Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, urged Beijing residents to not travel abroad to reduce the chances of infection.

Those currently abroad who have been in contact with infected people or show signs of infection should seek treatment where they are and not return with symptoms, she said.

Beijing has redirected all international flights that were scheduled to land at its new Daxing International Airport to Beijing Capital International Airport, and as of Sunday has cordoned off a special area to process these passengers, the state-backed Beijing News reported.

Travellers who are transiting through Beijing to other destinations will be given special assistance, it said.

China’s eastern Anhui province also said anyone arriving from abroad should be put under central quarantine for 14 days, state media reported, without giving a timeline.

Other imported cases

Beijing’s moves follow those of Shanghai, also a hub for international flights to China, which stepped up airport screening last week, resulting in some passengers saying they had to wait as long as seven hours.

Three of the new imported cases are from Shanghai, including a Chinese native who lived in the Italian city of Milan.

The provinces of Zhejiang and Gansu reported four and three infections respectively, while Guangdong reported one case in a Chinese native who lives in the Philippines.

The Gansu government said one of its cases was linked to a charter flight from Iran while the others were travellers from Saudi Arabia. Zhejiang province did not say where its four imported cases were from.

Underlying growing concerns over these imported cases, the southern province of Guangxi has said it will provide a cash incentive of 3,000-10,000 yuan ($428-$1,428) to people who provided clues on anyone who had travelled in from abroad but not abided by quarantine rules.

Mainland China’s only locally transmitted new infections on Saturday were in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, which recorded four cases. It was the tenth consecutive day that the Hubei province recorded zero new infections outside Wuhan.

The virus situation inside Wuhan is, however, still “very severe”, said Zheng Yun, deputy director of the city’s health committee at a press briefing.

He advised patients with other conditions and not in urgent need of medical help to avoid visiting hospitals due to the risk of infection.

Push to restart

China is making efforts to restart work cross its factories and businesses, which had been halted amid virus-related curbs, as the numbers of new infections fall further.

Some cities with no infections in recent days, such as Shanghai and Hangzhou, have started opening tourist attractions, restaurants and gyms.

State organizations and public institutions in Xiangyang, the second-largest city in Hubei province, will fully resume work from Monday, the Global Times reported.

The western region of Xinjiang also plans to reopen schools in batches starting from Monday, state media reported.

Limitations, however, remain in place.

Beijing, for instance, has allowed restaurants to start reopening but requires them to prevent diners from eating meals while directly facing each other and tables must be spaced a metre apart, the Xinhua news agency said.

Saturday’s figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China to 80,844. The death toll reached 3,199 as of the end of Saturday, up 10 from the previous day. All ten deaths occurred in Wuhan, the NHC said.

63,2020/03/15,Queen shifted out of Buckingham Palace amid COVID-19 crisis,"She is weeks away from her 94th birthday.

Queen Elizabeth II has been shifted out of Buckingham Palace in London to Windsor Castle as the UK plans for isolation measures for people over 70 amid the country’s death toll from COVID-19 hitting 21, nearly doubling from 11 within a day.

The 93-year-old monarch and her 98-year-old husband, Prince Philip, are likely to be placed in quarantine at the royal Sandringham Estate in Norfolk in the coming weeks as tougher measures are put in place to fight the coronavirus outbreak in the UK affecting over 1,140 people.

The deadly virus has claimed over 5,300 lives and infected more than 142,000 people across 135 countries and territories, with the World Health Organisation describing the outbreak a pandemic on Wednesday.

“Other events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis in line with the appropriate advice,” a Buckingham Palace statement said as it announced diary cancellations for the monarch.

Some reports indicate that her move from the palace in the heart of London, which has a large staff and frequent visitors, was part of a regular weekend getaway for the Queen to Windsor on Thursday. However, other reports indicate that the situation will be kept under constant review before she is brought back to London and may instead be shifted to Sandringham, with a much smaller level of staff.

She is in good health but it was thought best to move her, a royal source was quoted by ‘The Sun’ as saying.

The Palace hosts a constant stream of visitors, including politicians and dignitaries from around the world. The Queen has met a lot of people there until recently. But she is weeks away from her 94th birthday and advisers believe it is best to get her out of harm’s way, the source said.

Meanwhile, UK health secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the government’s plans to put the elderly and vulnerable into complete isolation within weeks.

The heightened measure, in response to all the deaths from COVID-19 so far being among over-60s, would mean older people being asked to remain at home without visitors and with vital supplies dropped off for them on their doorsteps.

The coronavirus outbreak is the biggest public health emergency in a generation. It calls for dramatic action, at home and abroad, of the kind not normally seen in peacetime, he wrote in ‘The Sunday Telegraph’ as he called for a similar spirit as the previous generation which faced World War II in the 20th century.

Next week we will publish our emergency bill, to give the government the temporary powers we will need to help everyone get through this. The measures in it allow for the worst case scenario. I hope many of them won’t be needed. But we will ask Parliament for these powers in case they are, he said.

He revealed that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to call industry leaders on Sunday to urge British companies to join a “national effort” to produce more ventilators and other medical equipment “at speed” to help the state-funded National Health Service (NHS) deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

Work is also under way to buy up thousands of private hospital beds to boost NHS capacity, should it be needed.

Opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has asked for “urgent sight” of the draft laws and for a meeting with the Prime Minister to discuss the crisis. The party had already called on the government to publish the scientific modelling and data that it is using to form its approach.

More than 200 scientists have written to the government urging it to introduce tougher measures to tackle the spread of COVID-19 sooner rather than later. In an open letter, the cross-discipline experts from UK universities say the government’s current approach calling only for people with a cough and fever to self-isolate for seven days will put the NHS under additional stress and “risk many more lives than necessary”.

The signatories also criticised comments made by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, about managing the spread of the infection to make the population immune through so-called “herd immunity”.

In particular, we are deeply preoccupied by the timeline of the proposed plan, which aims at delaying social distancing measures even further, notes the letter from scientists across disciplines.

The current data about the number of infections in the UK is in line with the growth curves already observed in other countries, including Italy, Spain, France, and Germany. The same data suggests that the number of infected will be in the order of dozens of thousands within a few days, it says.

They believe that putting social distancing measures in place now would dramatically slow down the spread of the virus, with thousands of lives saved.

In another joint letter, UK supermarkets and retailers have urged customers to be considerate in their shopping, so that others are not left without much-needed items.

“There is enough for everyone if we all work together,” it notes in an appeal against panic buying and hoarding.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9mih6y/article31074357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BUCKINGHAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/queen-shifted-out-of-buckingham-palace-amid-covid-19-crisis/article31074358.ece
64,2020/03/15,"Al-Aqsa mosque, 3rd holiest in Islam, closes over coronavirus concerns","Most people recover in a matter of weeks. But the virus is highly contagious.

The Islamic endowment overseeing the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam, says the mosque itself and other buildings will be closed over concerns about the new coronavirus. Sheikh Omar Kiswani, the director of the mosque, said Sunday that prayers will continue to be held outdoors. The closure is to continue indefinitely.

Iran’s official leading the country’s response to the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East on Sunday acknowledged that the pandemic could overwhelm health facilities in the country, which is under severe U.S. sanctions.

Iran is battling one of the worst outbreaks outside China, with nearly 13,000 confirmed cases and more than 600 fatalities. The real number of infections could be even higher, as questions have been raised about the government’s transparency.

If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity, Ali Reza Zali, who is leading the campaign against the outbreak, was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency.

Iran is believed to have around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in the capital, Tehran. Authorities have pledged to set up mobile clinics as needed.

Mr. Zali also acknowledged that many of those who have died from the COVID-19 illness caused by the virus were otherwise healthy, a rare admission by local authorities that the virus does not only prey on the sick and elderly.

The Health Ministry released figures showing that while 55% of fatalities were in their 60s, some 15% were younger than 40.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

Most people recover in a matter of weeks. But the virus is highly contagious and can be spread by individuals with no visible symptoms.

The virus has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed more than 5,700. More than 70,000 people worldwide have recovered after being infected.

In Iran, the virus has even infected a number of senior officials, including the senior vice president, Cabinet ministers, members of parliament, Revolutionary Guard members and Health Ministry officials.

Authorities have nevertheless been slow to adopt measures taken by other hard-hit countries. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Sunday ruled out a general quarantine and said the government was working to keep the borders open.

The country has also struggled to respond in part because of crippling sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after it withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal. Last week, Iran asked the International Monetary Fund for a USD 5 billion loan, the first time it has sought help from the international lender since before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

The U.S. says it has offered humanitarian aid but that Iran has rejected it.

Countries across the Middle East have imposed sweeping travel restrictions, cancelled public events and in some cases called on non-essential businesses to close for the coming weeks.

In the skyscraper-studded city of Dubai, a global business and travel hub in the United Arab Emirates, authorities announced on Sunday that all movie theaters, arcades and gyms would be closed through the end of the month.

Dubai Parks & Resorts announced it would be closed through the end of the month. The sprawling amusement park, built at a cost of USD 3 billion, has lost hundreds of millions of dollars since opening.

Abu Dhabi, the capital of the UAE, also shut down its amusement parks and museums through the end of the month, including Louvre Abu Dhabi.

The UAE’s central bank announced a $27 billion stimulus package directed at supporting banks and said regulatory limits on loans will be eased. Saudi Arabia announced its own $13 billion stimulus plan.

Tiny, oil-rich Kuwait meanwhile shut down malls, salons and barbershops to slow the spread of the virus. Authorities allowed coffee shops to remain open, but said no more than five customers can wait in line at a time and must be a meter apart from each other.

Dalia Samhouri, a senior official with the World Health Organization’s regional office, urged countries to take further steps to aggressively track those who have been in contact with confirmed cases and to impose strict quarantine measures.

It’s not too late to control the situation or to contain the situation, she said.

In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s trial on serious corruption charges, which was supposed to begin this week, was postponed for two months due to restrictions on public gatherings.

65,2020/03/15,Pakistan’s coronavirus tally rises to 34,"Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said that he was personally monitoring measures to deal with the coronavirus in the country.

A new confirmed case of the novel coronavirus surfaced early Sunday in Islamabad, bringing Pakistan’s total number of cases to 34, according to a media report.

The new victim is the husband of a woman who recently travelled to Pakistan from the United States and tested positive on Saturday, the Express Tribune newspaper reported.

The lady is currently in critical condition, receiving treatment at the isolation ward in the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), the paper said, adding that there are now four COVID-19 patients at the isolation ward in PIMS.

Pakistan reported five coronavirus cases on Saturday - two in Balochistan, two in Sindh and one in Islamabad.

Balochistan now has a total of 10 confirmed cases while Islamabad has four and Gilgit Baltistan three. Sindh saw its second locally transmitted case bring the tally to 17.

Pakistan saw a sudden increase in coronavirus infections on Tuesday when a dozen new cases were reported across the country.

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday said that he was personally monitoring measures to deal with the coronavirus in the country.

Mr. Khan announced on twitter that he would soon address the nation to take the people into confidence about measures to combat pandemic.

“I want to inform the nation I am personally overseeing measures to deal with COVID 19 and will address the nation soon. I would advise people to follow safety instructions issued by our govt. While there is a need for caution there is no need for panic,” he said.

He said Pakistan government was fully aware to the dangers and taking steps.

“We are alert to the dangers and have put in place sufficient protocols for the safety and health of our people. The WHO has commended our efforts as being amongst the best in the world, he said.

The deadly virus that first originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year has claimed over 5,700 lives and infected more than 150,000 people across 135 countries and territories.

China remains the hardest-hit with more than 80,000 infections and 3,199 deaths.

Pakistan’s high-powered National Security Committee on Friday took several decision to boost efforts to defeat the threat posed by the virus.

68,2020/03/15,"Syria war rumbles into 10th year, still fueling global chaos","More than half of Syria’s pre-war population of 23 million people have been driven from their homes, and a staggering 80% of the population live beneath the poverty line, according to the United Nations.

In a world gripped by a pandemic, global unrest and a fast-moving news cycle, it can be difficult to remember that the war in Syria is still happening.

Even before the coronavirus outbreak took over daily lives around the globe, the conflict, which began in early 2011, had largely fallen off the world’s collective radars - reduced to a never-ending fight involving an ever-more complex web of players and refugees that few remember once lived in a country they called home.

But as it enters its tenth year, the war - which gave rise to the Islamic State group and triggered the worst humanitarian catastrophe of the 21st century - has shown it is still creating new tragedies that can have an outsized impact on global politics.

Earlier this month, Turkish and Syrian troops were clashing in Syria’s northwest. That brought NATO-member Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides of the war, to the brink of direct confrontation, and produced an unprecedented wave of displaced people. Arguing that it faces a potential new influx of refugees from Syria, Turkey announced it would no longer stop its vast migrant and refugee population from illegally entering Greece, touching off a new crisis for the European Union.

More than half of Syria’s pre-war population of 23 million people have been driven from their homes, and a staggering 80% of the population live beneath the poverty line, according to the United Nations. Half the country lies in ruins. A political process does not exist. Contrary to what some may hope, the Syrian war is nowhere near its end-game.

Chaos in the North

A cease-fire brokered by the Turkish and Russian presidents in Moscow last week may have put the brakes on the Syrian government’s devastating military campaign to retake the northwestern Idlib province. But the halt is not a long-term solution, and the war’s final and most devastating chapter is yet to come.

In the three months before it was paused, the Syrian offensive triggered the largest single wave of displacement of the entire war. That may be dwarfed by the flight of humanity toward Turkey if Syrian President Bashar Assad resumes the assault to retake Idlib, home to some 3 million people. The area is the last remaining rebel-controlled area in Syria, and from Assad’s perspective, the only place standing in the way of complete military victory.

""Even if Idlib is somehow retaken and an estimated 3 million people are accommodated in Turkey or elsewhere, it is unlikely that Damascus has the capacity or even the tools to rule over formerly opposition-controlled areas for long periods of time without trouble,” said Danny Makki, a London-based Syrian journalist.

Similarly, a Turkey-Russia deal brokered in October ended a Turkish military campaign against U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish fighters in the country’s northeast. But the oil-rich region is still contested. There are hundreds American troops there, ostensibly on a mission to protect Kurdish-controlled oil fields from remnants of the Islamic State group.

Both U.S. and Russian troops patrol the tense area separately, and thousands of Iranian-backed militias are stationed nearby.

‘A perfect storm of devastation’

Nearly a decade of fighting has transformed the Mideast country into a failed state providing free-for-all proxy battlefield where world powers can settle their scores.

Russia, Iran, Turkey and the U.S. all have boots on the ground in Syria. The Lebanese Hezbollah group and a slew of other Iranian-backed militias are fighting there. Israel bombs inside Syria frequently and at will. The war has pulled in so many international players that one Syrian joke says perhaps the Syrian people are the ones who need to leave the country, so as not to disturb those foreign powers fighting on their soil.

Mr. Assad, who has been able to keep his grip on the central government from Damascus throughout the war, continues to chip away at rebel-held territory with Russian help. The rebel hold has shrunk in size from more than half of the country at one point to a tiny strip in Idlib province by the Turkish border now.

But many areas recovered by the government are a wasteland of wrecked buildings. Few refugees have dared to return, and reconstruction efforts are on hold, pending a political resolution.

Meanwhile, the economic situation is deteriorating so fast that ordinary Syrians struggle keep up with prices that rise even over the course of a day. The currency is collapsing- it now takes 500 Syrian pounds to get a dollar, 20 times the pre-2011 amount. The economic squeeze has been worsened by neighboring Lebanon’s acute financial crisis.

""It is a devastating dynamic, almost a perfect storm,” David Beasley, head of the World Food Program, told in a recent interview. “You’ve got the war, the devastation of the war on the economy for the last eight, nine, 10 years. But now you compound the Lebanese economic collapse because the Syria and Lebanon economy are tied together, and this is really becoming a perfect storm of devastation,” he said.

Full circle?

Even if Mr. Assad were to recapture remaining rebel-controlled territory, ruling it is another issue. His government’s policy of “reconciliation” in areas it already seized - effectively forced surrender of all opposition - has proven futile.

In Damascus, there has been a series of mysterious blasts targeting civilians and military personnel using explosive devices in the past three weeks.

In the southern province of Daraa, where the uprising against Assad began in March 2011, a reconciliation between the government and insurgents reached two years ago has crumbled with acts of violence reported almost on daily basis.

Ambushes, explosions and shootings left scores of fighters dead on both sides, and anti-government protests have re-erupted in some areas. Government forces responded with brute force earlier this year when tensions with insurgents turning into uprisings in several parts of Daraa, including the village of Sanamein.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitoring group, said 217 people have been killed in violence in Daraa over the past months, including 45 civilians, 113 soldiers and pro-government gunmen, and 37 rebels who signed deals with the state in 2018.

""The growing insurgency in Daraa and the poor economic situation in Damascus is evidence that the war will not abruptly end, and in fact the socio-political and military circumstances are present to indicate that this will rumble on for many years to come,” Makki said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9bi134/article30949934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TURKEYSYRIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/syria-war-rumbles-into-10th-year-still-fueling-global-chaos/article31073752.ece
69,2020/03/15,Coronavirus | Australia to impose 14-day self-isolation for all international arrivals,"Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the new measures after a meeting with a newly formed national cabinet, dubbed the coronavirus war cabinet.

Australia will impose 14-day self-isolation on international travellers arriving from midnight Sunday and ban cruise ships from foreign ports for 30 days, mirroring restrictions in nearby New Zealand aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the new measures after a meeting with a newly formed national cabinet, dubbed the coronavirus war cabinet.

The strict measures were designed to slow the spread of the global pandemic across Australia and help the country flatten the peak of the virus, Mr. Morrison told a news conference.

“To help stay ahead of this curve, we will impose a universal precautionary self-isolation requirement on all international arrivals to Australia and that is effective from midnight tonight,” he said.

“Further the Australian government will also ban cruise ships from foreign ports from arriving at Australian ports for an initial 30 days.”

The new border restrictions come as Australia recorded more than 250 cases of coronavirus and three deaths.

As of mid-March, COVID-19, the deadly respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, has infected 156,00 people globally and killed more than 5,800.

Australia has already imposed bans for travellers from Italy, South Korea, Iran and China, countries with high infection rates.

The bans mean foreign nationals who have been in any of the four nations will not be allowed into Australia for 14 days from the time they left those countries.

Australian citizens and permanent residents travelling from those countries will still be able to enter Australia but must self-isolate for a fortnight after returning home.

Australia has advised against non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday, but this is yet to apply to schools and universities.

Mr. Morrison on Sunday urged people to practice “social distancing”, such as keeping a metre (three feet) apart and not to shake hands, in order to reduce transmissions.

He said the rate of community transmission had started to increase and that social distancing would help limit demand on the healthcare systems, which would mean better treatment for elderly and those in remote and vulnerable communities.

“Slowing the spread will free up beds, he said, That's what happens when you get this right and we've seen other countries going down this path.”

Neighbouring New Zealand on Saturday said it would require incoming travellers, including its own citizens, to self-isolate for two weeks and banned cruise ships..

The Australian government is yet to restrict the operation of schools, but earlier on Sunday the Health Minister Greg Hunt did not rule out such a measure in the coming months.

They were welcomed by mosque imam Gamal Fouda, who said people of all beliefs and cultures were stopping to pay their respects, and they were all united as New Zealanders.

People in the New Zealand city of Christchurch honored the 51 worshipers who were killed in a mass shooting a year ago in small but poignant ways Sunday, after a planned national memorial event was canceled due to fears it might spread the new coronavirus.

Outside the Al Noor mosque, dozens of leather-clad bikers from the Tu Tangata club performed a traditional Maori haka. They were welcomed by mosque imam Gamal Fouda, who said people of all beliefs and cultures were stopping to pay their respects, and they were all united as New Zealanders.

One of those who survived the shooting at the Linwood mosque was Mazharuddin Syed Ahmed, who said that marking anniversaries was not typically a Muslim tradition but they were doing it so the wider community could grieve and remember. He said the shootings had provoked an outpouring of love and compassion.

""Of course, we lost our loved friends, family, people and community,” he said. “But we are also seeing so much good has come out of it. So looking at the positive part of that. Today, it is such a privilege to be in this country.”

Temel Atacocugu, who survived after being shot nine times at the Al Noor mosque, said the anniversary had provoked strong feelings.

""We are sad more than we are angry,” he said. “It’s very emotional. When I woke up this morning, I’m speechless. I can’t explain what I feel.”

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Saturday the decision to cancel the memorial event planned for Horncastle Arena was pragmatic and precautionary.

South Korea on Sunday reported 76 new coronavirus cases and three more deaths, a fall in new cases to double-digits for the first time in over three weeks.

South Korea, which has the highest number of cases in Asia after China, now has a total to 8,162 confirmed infections and 75 deaths, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said (KCDC).

South Korea has been experiencing a downward trend in new cases and the latest numbers are significantly lower than the peak of 909 cases reported on Feb. 29 and down from the 107 recorded on Saturday.

Forty-one of the new cases were from the city of Daegu, the epicentre of the country's outbreak.

A total of 120 patients were released from hospitals and for the third day in a row the daily number of those recovered exceeded that of new confirmed cases since South Korea's first case was confirmed on January 20.

Starting Sunday, South Korea began to subject visitors from France, Germany, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands to stricter border checks, after imposing similar rules for China, Italy and Iran suffering a major outbreak.

Apart from measuring temperature at the airport, visitors from those countries now need to download an app the South Korean government rolled out to report whether they have any symptoms related to the virus everyday.

72,2020/03/15,UK advises citizens against travel to Spain amid coronavirus outbreak,"Spain put its 47 million inhabitants under partial lockdown on Saturday as part of a 15-day state of emergency to combat the coronavirus epidemic in Europe's second worst-affected country after Italy

British government on Sunday advised its citizens against all but essential travel to Spain amid the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

Spain put its 47 million inhabitants under partial lockdown on Saturday as part of a 15-day state of emergency to combat the coronavirus epidemic in Europe's second worst-affected country after Italy.

73,2020/03/15,"Coronavirus | Spain locks down its citizens, while France shuts nightlife","In a nationally televised address Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sŕnchez detailed the battery of exceptional measures put in place as part of a two-week state of emergency to fight the sharp rise in infections

Spain locked down its 46 million citizens and France ordered the closing of just about everything the rest of the world loves about it - the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, the cafes and restaurants - as governments took increasingly desperate measures to put more space between people and contain the coronavirus.

More borders snapped shut around the globe on Saturday and Sunday- President Donald Trump announced that the U.S., which days ago barred travelers from most of Europe, will extend the ban to Britain and Ireland. In the Philippines, thousands of police and soldiers started sealing the densely populated capital from most domestic travelers in one of Southeast Asia’s most drastic containment moves.

Meanwhile, China, where the virus first appeared late last year, continued to relax its drastic restrictions, illustrating the way the center of gravity in the crisis has shifted westward toward Europe. The virus has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide and killed over 5,600.

In a nationally televised address Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sŕnchez detailed the battery of exceptional measures put in place as part of a two-week state of emergency to fight the sharp rise in infections.

Later Saturday, Spain’s government said Sŕnchez’s wife has tested positive for coronavirus. Begoũa Gūmez and the prime minister are in good health, the goverrnment said.

Two ministers of Sŕnchez’s Cabinet, the minister of equality and the minister of regional affairs, had already tested positive earlier this week. The others member of the Cabinet have tested negative.

In a lockdown similar to the one already imposed in Italy, people will be allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and medicine, commute to work, go to hospitals and banks, or take trips related to the care of the young and the elderly. All schools and universities were closed, along with restaurants, bars, hotels and other non-essential retail businesses.

""From now we enter into a new phase,” Mr. Sŕnchez said after a Cabinet meeting that lasted over seven hours. “We won’t hesitate in doing what we must to beat the virus. We are putting health first.”

Spanish authorities said the number of infections climbed past 5,700, half of them in the capital, Madrid. That represents a national increase of over 1,500 in 24 hours. The country had 136 deaths, up from 120. Spain has the fifth-highest number of cases, behind China, Italy, Iran and South Korea.

For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover in a matter of weeks.

Despite please for calm from authorities, shoppers packed supermarkets in Spain in the morning. But overall, the normally bustling streets of the country’s two biggest cities were noticeably quieter as the message sank in that social distancing is the only way to stop the pandemic.

""We had to close and remain shut for 15 days,” restaurant owner Rachel Paparardo said in Barcelona, which was already under regional restrictions. “But this is nothing. It is just so more people don’t get infected and we can recover from this.”

Some flights bound for Spain turned around as word spread of the lockdown.

In the Philippines, new restrictions for metropolitan Manila - home to more than 12 million people - that went into effect Sunday mean the suspension of domestic travel by land, air and sea to and from the capital region.

Large gatherings like concerts, movies and cockfighting are prohibited and most government work in executive department offices will be suspended in the metropolis for a month. School closures at all levels were extended and curfew was in the works.

""If you’ll go to work, go. If you need to go out for medical treatment, go. If you’ll buy food, go, but other than that, stay home,” Philippine Interior Secretary Eduardo Ano told a news conference.

Countries around the world have been moving to prevent their health systems from collapsing under the load of all the virus cases.

Paris followed other cities in shuttering major tourist attractions, and France announced the closing of all restaurants, cafes, theaters and nonessential shops starting Sunday. France has recorded at least 3,600 infections. It has banned all gatherings of more than 100 people, ordered all schools closed and asked companies to allow workers to stay home.

France pressed ahead with plans for nationwide municipal elections on Sunday but ordered special measures to keep people at a safe distance and to sanitize surfaces.

In Italy, the worst-hit European country, the number of deaths climbed past 1,400 and infections surged roughly 20 percent overnight to more than 21,000 because of what authorities characterized as irresponsible behavior by people still socializing despite the nationwide lockdown. Many Italian cities, including Rome and Milan, decided to close playgrounds and parks, too.

Premier Giuseppe Conte has said production - particularly of food and health supplies - must not stop. On Saturday, union and industrial leaders reached an agreement to keep factories running.

At noon, people around Italy came out on their balconies, terraces or gardens or leaned out their windows to clap for several minutes in a gesture of thanks to medical workers.

In Britain, the death toll nearly doubled from the day before to 21, and the number of people infected rose to over 1,100. Ireland had 90 confirmed cases and one death as of Friday. Greece’s infection total approached 230 with three deaths, and police there arrested 45 shopkeepers Saturday for violating a ban on operations.

The U.S. has seen 59 deaths - including the first in New York, Louisiana and Virginia - and more than 2,100 cases. In hard-hit Washington state, where 40 have died and and more than 550 have been infected, officials said the disease is straining the supply of protective gear available to medical providers despite shipments from the federal government.

Mr. Trump has tested negative for the new coronavirus, the president’s personal physician said Saturday.

European countries took steps to isolate themselves from their neighbors.

Denmark closed its borders and halted passenger traffic to and from the country. Travelers will be turned away at the border if they are unable to show that they have “a legitimate reason” to enter - for example, if they are Danish citizens or residents.

Poland planned to close is borders at midnight and deny all foreigners entry unless they lived in Poland or had personal ties there. The Czech Republic and Slovakia took similar action. Lithuania said it was introducing border checks at the frontiers with Poland and Latvia.

Russia said its borders with Norway and Poland will be closed to most foreigners beginning Sunday.

In the Middle East, Iran’s death toll reached 611, with nearly 13,000 infections, including senior government officials.

In the Pacific, New Zealand announced that incoming passengers, including citizens, will be required to isolate themselves for 14 days, with few exceptions.

The measures increasingly mirror those taken by China, which in January quarantined more than 60 million people, starting with the epicenter, Wuhan, in the province of Hubei.

The spread of COVID-19 in China has slowed dramatically, according to the National Health Commission. After reporting thousands of new cases per day only a month ago, the commission said Saturday that there were 13 new deaths and just 11 new cases, including people who recently arrived in China from other affected countries like Italy.

Wuhan is now the only city in Hubei still designated “high-risk.” Several Hubei municipalities are gradually resuming public transportation and reopening businesses.

75,2020/03/15,Doctor says Trump tests negative for coronavirus,"“One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago, the President remains symptom-free,” Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said

President Donald Trump has tested negative for the new coronavirus, according to the president’s personal physician.

The White House released the test results Saturday night after Mr. Trump told reporters hours earlier that he had taken the coronavirus test, following days of resisting being screened despite the fact that he had been in recent contact with three people who have tested positive for the virus, including members of the Brazilian president’s delegation who visited with him at his Florida resort.

“One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation in Mar-a-Lago, the President remains symptom-free,” Sean Conley, the president’s physician, said in a memo.

Mr. Trump told reporters at a White House briefing on Saturday that he had his temperature taken and it was “totally normal,” shortly before stepping into the room to discuss the government’s efforts to halt the spread of the virus. The pandemic has now infected more than 2,200 people in the U.S. and caused at least 50 deaths.

The president had multiple direct and indirect contacts with people who have since tested positive for the virus, including three people he spent time with last weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.

The Brazilian Embassy in Washington said late Friday that the country’s chargş d’affaires, Nestor Forster, tested positive after sitting at Mr. Trump’s dinner table. So, too, have a top aide to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who took a photo with Mr. Trump and attended a party with him, and another person who attended a campaign fundraiser with the president that Sunday, according to two Republican officials who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss private health matters.

Mr. Trump, after days of insisting that he was not exhibiting symptoms of the virus, relented after being pressed by reporters about his resistance to testing when multiple lawmakers and countless citizens across the country who have had the same degree of exposure have not only tried to get tested, but also chosen to try to avoid potentially infecting others.

The president, according to two people close to the White House, had been reluctant to take the test for fear it would project weakness or worry. Mr. Trump has wanted to appear in full control during the crisis, and had expressed concerns that taking personal steps could undermine that appearance.

Mr. Trump came into office as self-described germaphobe who tried to avoid handshakes as he conducted his real estate business. But he acknowledged Saturday that he’s now finding it difficult to resist shaking hands, a habit that he says he’s picked up since becoming a full-time politician.

At a news conference Friday to announce he was declaring a national emergency, Mr. Trump eagerly shook the hands of several corporate executives, even though health policy experts on White House coronavirus task force have urged Americans to avoid physical contact to help stem the spread of the virus.

""People come up to me, they shake hands, they put their hand out,” Mr. Trump said. “It’s sort of a natural reflex, and we’re all getting out of it. All of us have that problem.”

The White House is stepping up efforts to try to keep the virus at bay.

On Saturday, the White House announced that it is now conducting temperature checks on anyone who is in close contact with Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, including reporters who attend a White House briefing and anyone entering the Oval Office.

Mr. Pence also wrote a memo to White House staff Saturday reminding them to take precautions such as avoiding physical contact, washing hands frequently and staying home when sick.

""It’s imperative each one of us do our part to take the proper precautions to keep ourselves and our colleagues safe,” Mr. Pence wrote. “As an employee aboard the White House Complex, we have an additional duty to protect the health of our Executive Branch and those working with us.”

Dr. Deborah Birx, who is helping coordinate the U.S. response to the outbreak, noted that testing results reflect a snapshot in time and that it’s crucial for people to maintain precautions.

""When you get a negative test, that means you’re negative that day,” Ms. Birx said. “That doesn’t mean that you couldn’t get the virus spreading overnight, because it replicates in your nose and your nasal secretions, and you would have a positive test tomorrow.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/71hfud/article31064606.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Trumpjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/doctor-says-trump-tests-negative-for-coronavirus/article31073143.ece

77,2020/03/15,Surveillance stepped up on inter-State border,"People entering Puducherry screened at four check posts

With the Centre notifying COVID-19 as a disaster, the Puducherry government has stepped up surveillance along the inter-State border.

Passengers arriving by various modes of transport will be screened at four check posts in Gorimedu, East Coast Road, Hanumanthai and Madagadipet, District Collector T. Arun said here on Sunday.

Mr. Arun told presspersons that although no suspected cases were reported in the Union Territory, the health authorities were on alert. Booths have been set up at the inter-State borders and public health officials will screen all passengers arriving by various modes of transport to Puducherry.

The screening for passengers was being done as a precautionary measure since Sunday. There was no need to panic since all preventive steps had been taken for the prevention and control of the disease. Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) would undertake door-to-door visit to create awareness.

Mr. Arun said the administration had directed all hotels in Puducherry to collect self-declaration forms from tourists indicating their country and if they had any illness. The forms would be sent to the Health Department for scrutiny.

To curb the spread of COVID-19, the entry points in all cinemas would be sanitised. Help desks had been opened in all cinemas.

78,2020/03/15,"Sankarabarani, Puducherry’s lifeline, faces threat","Thick spread of garbage, especially plastics, contaminates the river

Indiscriminate dumping of waste and negligence by the authorities has reduced the Sankarabarani in Villianur to a major drain.

Originating from Gingee in the neighbouring Villupuram district, the Sankarabarani, which flows for 24 km, is a major river in Puducherry after Thenpennaiar.

Rampant pollution due to dumping of waste by industries and unscientific disposal of sewage poses a serious health hazard to people living in the river basin. The water is highly contaminated downstream, especially at Uruvaiyaru and Villianur. The contamination has been aggravated by illegal sand mining in several areas.

Although Puducherry has a designated dump, the local bodies have miserably failed to enforce the rule. Mounds of solid waste can be seen on the banks of the river. The area near the Villianur bridge presents a sorry picture with vast quantities of solid waste, especially plastic carry bags and liquor bottles, floating in the river. Water hyacinth and weeds cover a major portion of the waterbody. Raw sewage is let into the river, residents allege. The authorities should take steps to prevent dumping of waste into the river, stop illegal sand mining, dredge the canals, remove encroachments on either side of the river and prevent discharge of raw effluents from industries, residents said. T.P. Raghunath, a member of Alliance for Good Governance (AGG), said: “Pollution is more visible near the bridges of the river in Villianur but the condition is the same all along the river. Several industries, including chemical and pharmaceutical companies near Uruvaiyaru and Mangalam, have been using the river as a convenient place to dump waste and the stench is strong, especially at night.”

An integrated approach by the district administration with the departments concerned is the need of the hour, he says. Letting out household and commercial sewage into the river only deteriorate the condition further. Knee-jerk reactions and occasional action will not bring in any solutions and the communities must be asked to act as watchdogs, Mr. Raghunath said.

A meaningful reporting system should be put in place with heavy punishment and fine, including cancellation of licences and disconnection of water and power connection, he added. “The Sankarabarani river is a major source of water recharge and supports agriculture in Villianur and several communes. There is a need to ensure that the river is protected from pollution and a close watch maintained to prevent dumping of industrial wastes, garbage and other waste materials in the river,” said B. Radha of Villianur.

“How much ever the municipal authorities and other agencies put in efforts, there is need for private industrial owners and others to have civic responsibility. The river is the lifeline for farmers and other sections in the neighbourhood. Water flows in the river from the Oussudu Lake and nothing should be left to chance,” she said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/5mehf7/article31076587.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16THPONDYUTMATTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/sankarabarani-puducherrys-lifeline-faces-threat/article31076588.ece

Two constables attached to the Grand Bazaar Police station and India Reserve Battalion (IRB) have been suspended as part of a preliminary inquiry against them on corruption charges.

According to a senior police official, constable D. Sathish Kumar and IRB personnel, Suresh K. , were suspended on charges of demanding bribe from a young couple from Tamil Nadu

The couple was staying in a guest house in the town. Occupants in adjacent rooms informed the police about “disturbance” caused by the couple.

The two constables were deputed to inquire into the complaint, said the official.

The police came to know from the couple about the harassment by the constables.

Preliminary inquiry revealed that they had collected money from the couple to avoid registering a case, the officer told The Hindu.

82,2020/03/15,An amusement ride turns into escalator,"On March 15, 1892, Jesse W Reno got his patent for an “inclined elevator”. Employed first as an amusement ride, the inclined elevator was among the first working models of what we now call an escalator. A.S.Ganesh takes a look at Reno and his escalator...

Every time you visit a shopping mall or a metro station (if your city has one), one aspect of it that you can’t fail to notice are the escalators that take you from one floor to another. These places are also provided with an elevator, but I bet most of you would rather be out there on an escalator, than inside an elevator.

A number of people have been involved in the development of what we see as escalators in the modern day. Even though the idea came about in the middle of the 19th Century, it was only by the end of the century that we had our first working models. The first working escalator, which came about as an amusement ride, was courtesy of American inventor Jesse W. Reno.

Reno’s idea

Reno was born in Kansas in 1861 and spent his early life in the mid-western and southern states of the U.S. After moving with his family to Georgia when he was 16, he started making his first plans of an inclined elevator.

He graduated from Lehigh University’s emergent engineering programme in 1883 and got to work with a mining company and then an electrical company. He moved to New York soon enough, the stage for his strong ambition and aptitude in engineering.

It was in the final decade of the 19th Century that Reno came up with his invention, which had a conveyor belt inclined at an angle of 25 degrees. The conveyor belt had planks of metal with a serrated surface and the design allowed for a smooth transition, especially in the top and bottom landings where people had to get on and off. The overall contraption provided the passenger with an added sense of security by having handrails that moved with the conveyor belt.

Patents “inclined elevator”

Reno received the patent for his “inclined elevator” on March 15, 1892. He didn’t meet with success immediately though. He had a huge professional setback when his extensive plans to New York City officials were turned down. These plans included building a double-decker subway system beneath the city’s streets, with his inclined elevators transporting passengers from the street to the underground station and vice versa.

In the end, Reno had to agree to his inclined elevator appearing as an amusement ride. One of the world’s first working models of an escalator thus appeared at the Old Iron Pier, Coney Island, New York as a temporary amusement ride. With a vertical rise of 2.1 m (7 feet) and the belt moving at a rate of 22.8 m (75 feet) per minute, the ride attracted an estimated 75,000 people during the fortnight-long installation.

Features still remain

Within years of showcasing it thus, Reno’s invention was finding its way into railway stations and department stores. Reno started his own company to manufacture them after the turn of the century and it was later bought out by Otis Elevator Company, that also got the rights to Reno’s patents.

It was Otis that came up with the name “escalator” – combining the words “elevator” and “scala” (the Latin word for steps) – for their own invention that worked similarly. When the term turned out to be popular with the larger masses to refer to all such machines as a whole, it came into generic public use.

The strength of Reno’s invention lies in the fact that many features of his inclined elevator are still found in modern escalators. Be it the comb of projecting fingers at each end of the machine or the rubber-covered chain handrail that moves in sync with the steps, they were all envisioned by Reno for the very first working model of an escalator.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/4jb0hc/article31014200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15istbCopenhagenMetroescalatorsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/an-amusement-ride-turns-into-escalator/article31014201.ece

The district administration has released the travel history and contact tracing details of the two people who had tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday. The patient known as ‘R2’, had on March 10 taken a flight from London to Bahrain, from where on the same day he took a Gulf Air flight (flight no – GF0060) to Thiruvananthapuram. After landing at the international airport here at 5 a.m., he travelled in a car with his brother-in-law, sister-in-law and father-in-law to their flat (Flat 1B, Artech Square), at Kaithamukku.

At 8 a.m. on March 11, he travelled in the family’s car to the General Hospital. From the parking area, he walked to the OP ticket counter and from there to the COVID-19 OP waiting area. After swab tests, he hailed an autorickshaw (KL-01 CB 4026) at 10.30 a.m. and headed to Kaithamukku.

Juice shops

He stopped at a shop opposite the Kaithamukku Cooperative Bank to drink lime juice. On not getting the same in the first shop, he headed to the next one, from where he drank the juice. In both these shops, he stood outside, and hence did not come into close contact with the shopkeepers, said District Collector S. Gopalakrishnan.

69 passengers on flight

He went inside the flat at 10.45 a.m. Till his test results came on Friday evening, he was in home quarantine, but was in close contact with the family. Seven persons, including the three family members, have been quarantined.

In his flight, there were 69 passengers. Out of this, 21 are from Tamil Nadu, 15 are from Thiruvananthapuram, 15 from Kollam, nine from Alappuzha, eight from Pathanamthitta and 1 from Malappuram. Seven are foreigners. Thirty-seven passengers have been identified as high risk contacts, within three rows of his seat. The district administration is in the process of contacting them, with 70% of them being contacted till now.

Regarding the other patient, an Italian national, who has been staying in Varkala, only about 70% of the contact tracing has been completed. He had taken a flight from Venice to Moscow on February 26. The next day, he took a flight to Delhi, reaching there at 4.25 a.m. From there, he took a Vistara flight (UK 897) to Thiruvananthapuram, arriving here at 10.25 a.m. on February 27. The district administration is in touch with the Vistara officials for more details, said the Collector.

Resort in Varkala

From that day, he has been staying in a beach resort in Varkala. He had visited shops and restaurants in this area over the period. He developed symptoms on March 10. Along with his friend, a Kashmiri native running a jewellery shop in Varkala, he went to the government hospital in Parippally in an autorickshaw. As per directions, they went separately to the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital.

The city went into a panic mode for a few hours during the day, following District Collector S. Gopalakrishnan’s announcement that malls have to be closed down and people have to stay away from beaches and other public places as part of steps to contain the spread of COVID-19. Streets wore almost a deserted look from the afternoon, while buses plied with a few passengers inside.

The panic eased only by late evening when Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan clarified during his press conference that the situation does not warrant a complete shutdown and that the Collector might have had a misunderstanding.

Advisory soon

The district administration will be issuing an advisory to commercial establishments involving personal contact, including gyms, ayurvedic massage centres, saloons and spas, to take extra safety measures or not function for a few days, if possible.

Eighty-seven people were put under observation in the district on Saturday. A total of 307 people are under isolation in their houses.

Results awaited

Sixteen people are now in the isolation ward at the General Hospital, with seven new entries on Saturday.

Those under home quarantine are found to be in close contact with their family. This should be avoided. They should spend the entire duration in a closed room. Collector

There are 16 people in the isolation ward at the Government Medical College Hospital, with four new entries on Saturday. Results of 87 samples are awaited.

“We noticed that people who were in home quarantine were not fully in quarantine within their homes. They were in close contact with their family members. This should be avoided. The person who is suspected of being affected should spend the entire duration within a closed room. Food or other essential items should be left at the door. Proper home quarantine is the best solution. Those who are returning from abroad should be in home quarantine for 28 days. As of now, the virus has not spread at the community level. So, we have to take all steps to arrest its spread,” said Mr. Gopalakrishnan.

As many as 2306 passengers were screened at the international airport on Saturday. Nine people with symptoms were referred to a hospital.

Valencia's Argentinian centre-back Ezequiel Garay said on Sunday he had tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the first player in the Spanish Liga known to have the disease.

“It's clear that 2020 has started on the wrong foot,” he posted on Instagram alongside a smiling selfie giving the thumbs up. “I tested positive for coronavirus, I feel very well and now all that's left is to do what the health authorities say, which is to isolate myself.”

Garay, 33, was in the stands on Tuesday for the Champions League round-of-16 second leg match behind closed doors at the Mestalla where Valencia lost 4-3 to Atalanta, who are from Bergamo in Lombardy, and were eliminated by an aggregate score of 8-4.

86,2020/03/15,Coronavirus: Rooney criticises England authorities over coronavirus response,"The Premier League, English Football League, Women's Super League and men and women's FA Cup competitions were suspended on Friday

Wayne Rooney has criticised England's football authorities over how long they took to suspend matches in the country amid the coronavirus outbreak, saying it felt like players were being treated like “guinea pigs”.

The Premier League, English Football League, Women's Super League and men and women's FA Cup competitions were suspended on Friday following an emergency meeting sparked by Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta testing positive for the virus a day earlier.

“Why did we wait until Friday? Why did it take Mikel Arteta to get ill for the game in England to do the right thing?” the former England and Manchester United captain wrote in a column for the Times.

“For players, staff and their families it has been a worrying week one in which you felt a lack of leadership from the government and from the FA and Premier League.

“After the emergency meeting, at last the right decision was made. Until then it almost felt like footballers in England were being treated like guinea pigs.”

Rooney said he would never have been able to forgive the authorities if anyone in his family had contracted the virus through him.

“The rest of sport tennis, Formula One, rugby, golf, football in other countries was closing down and we were being told to carry on,” he added.

“I think a lot of footballers were wondering, 'Is it something to do with money being involved in this?' Thankfully football made the right call in the end. We had to put the season on hold.

“If people's lives are at risk, that has to come first.”

Rooney, currently at second-tier Derby County, also proposed restructuring the fixture calendar once football resumed.

“We're happy to play until September if the season extends to then, if that's how it has to be. That's our job,” he said. “As long as we know we're safe to play and it's a safe environment for spectators, we'll play.

“The next World Cup is in November and December 2022, so you could actually use this situation as an opportunity and say we're going to finish the 2019-20 season later this year, then prepare for 2022 by having the next two seasons starting in winter.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/55uinn/article31074463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOCCER-FRIENDLY-ENG-USAPREVIEW,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/coronavirus-rooney-criticises-england-authorities-over-coronavirus-response/article31074464.ece

With anxiety running high over COVID-19 outbreak, Tiruchi residents are stocking up on face masks and hand sanitisers, causing a shortage across the city.

People are rushing to medical stores to get their hands on either N95 or surgical face masks, and hand sanitisers but many have been disappointed by the shortage.

Complaints of masks and sanitisers being sold at inflated prices at some outlets also abound.

N. Suresh, a resident of Thillai Nagar purchased 10 surgical masks, gloves and two hand sanitizers from a franchise medical store in Thillai Nagar on Sunday morning.

The store has 100 face masks left, which it had received on Saturday night. The shop owner said that a restock would take at least a month.

“My friends abroad say that all the commodities for basic needs will run dry soon. We are all afraid and are taking active measures. The prices have been jacked up by some online retailers too. The demand is only going to increase,” Mr. Suresh said.

Stocks run dry

At the medical stores outside the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital too, the stock has run dry.

“The sales of masks rose after patients began to be admitted at the isolation ward at the GH. Our masks were sold out five days ago and we are not able to procure any more,” said a salesperson. “We have shipped the country's stock overseas and are now facing severe shortage ourselves,” he said and claimed that the prices of masks have become dearer as the material is mainly imported from China.

A single-use surgical mask which usually costs ₹5 is now being sold at ₹ 20. An N95 mask, usually sold at ₹500 is being sold at over ₹750.

The Jan Aushadhi (Makkal Marundhakam) stores set up under the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) too has run out of face masks.

“Our last face masks were sold out two days ago. We have requested a restock but there has been no response,” said R. Kannan, at the Makkam Marundhakam on Puthur Road.

“Hand sanitizers and gloves are being purchased from private vendors and sold at the store as there is no government subsidised product,” he said.

K. Manoharan, president, Tamil Nadu Chemists and Druggists Association, said that efforts to replenish face masks stocks is on.

“We cannot fix a date and say that we will get more face masks soon. However, it has become an essential commodity now, which means that the government will take active steps to increase production,” he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/qb4x0o/article31075430.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY16MASKSTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/face-masks-hand-sanitisers-fly-off-the-shelves/article31075431.ece

89,2020/03/15,The bridge across Cauvery continues to jolt motorists,"Motorists traversing along the bridge across the Cauvery in the city continue to experience severe jolts due to recurring damages to the road surface at the expansion joints, despite repeated repairs carried out by the Highways Department in recent years.

The vital bridge connects Tiruchi city with Srirangam and caters to a huge volume of traffic right through the day. Extensive damages to the road surface at some of the expansion joints in between the spans of the bridge forced the Highways Department to take up repairs in September 2018. The department officials had then said that advanced guniting methods were used to repair the damaged edges. The work was taken up at six expansion joints where broken edges were identified. Repairs were taken up subsequently at a few other joints on the bridge.

However, the repairs keep resurfacing much to the annoyance of motorists. “As the damages get bigger and the gaps wider, we experience not just a jolt but a bigger thud,” says R. Gopal, a city resident.

“The bridge commissioned in 1976 is in a precarious condition. As an engineer I feel a new bridge must be built,” observed T. M. Ranganathan, a resident of Srirangam.

Recently, P. Ayyarappan, president, Road Users Welfare Association, presented a memorandum to the District Collector seeking urgent steps to repair the damages. “Despite the repairs carried out in the past, damages recur at the expansion joints, exposing the steel rods and leading to frequent accidents. A team of senior engineers should study the problem,” he had said.

When contacted, a senior official of the Highways Department said that the higher authorities of the department have been apprised of the situation and indicated that a team from the Highways Research Station, Chennai, may visit the city to study the problem as proposed earlier.

The Highways Department has been repeatedly drawing flak from the public over the works that it had carried out on the bridge over the past few years. A rehabilitation-cum-beautification of the Cauvery bridge, carried out by the Highways Department in 2015-16, drew much flak from the residents. Subsequently, it had to demolish the parapet that was built without perforations as part of the rehabilitation project and restore the original design.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/sro1wu/article31075412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY16BRIDGETRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/the-bridge-across-cauvery-continues-to-jolt-motorists/article31075414.ece

92,2020/03/15,No change in STP site: civic body,"Tiruchi corporation to go ahead with STP work at Keezha Kalkandarkottai

In spite of stiff opposition by a section residents, the Corporation has decided to go ahead with the proposal on setting up a sewage treatment plant at Keezha Kalkandarkottai.

The plant is to be established as part of the ₹ 344 crore-phase II underground drainage project, being implemented under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT).

The work on construction of manholes, laying of sewage mains and other work began in July 2018. According to a rough estimate, more than 50% of the work has been completed.

However, the work on construction of the sewage treatment plant is yet to begin mainly due to the stiff opposition by a section of residents of Keezha Kalkandarkottai.

Under package-III

To expedite the project, it has been brought under package-III of the UGD project on an outlay of ₹53 crore.

The residents staged a road roko recently expressing apprehensions that the sewage will pollute groundwater and nearby agricultural lands.

However, the Corporation, while allaying fears, has begun groundwork to start the construction work of STP at the proposed site.

A reliable source told The Hindu that the STP would come up on 3.14 acres, classified as “kalam poromboke” in revenue records. The Corporation had sent a file to the Revenue Department, seeking allocation of the land for setting up the STP.

The revenue officials, after inspecting the site, issued “Enter Upon Permission” to the Corporation. Following this, the site had been brought under the control of the civic body.

As per the standard procedure, the Corporation had already received a no objection certificate from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) for establishing the STP at Keezha Kalkandarkottai.

Moreover, after completing the tendering process, work order had been issued to the successful bidder to start the work.

“The Keezha Kalkandarkottai site has been chosen after a comprehensive study. There is absolutely no scope to look for an alternative site as most of the manholes and sewage mains have been constructed by lining them toward the proposed sewage treatment plant site,” a senior official said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/no-change-in-stp-site-civic-body/article31073150.ece

In all, the election commission received 801 nominations from various party candidates and independents and 733 were declared valid on Saturday by the election authorities. After nomination withdrawal by dummy candidates not more than 350 are likely to be in the final fray from the 64 municipal wards.

The number of valid nominations and the number of contesting candidates are both less than what was witnessed in the 2014 municipal elections though the number of wards has increased from 59 to 64. In 2014, over 1001 valid nominations were filed and 508 candidates were in the fray. The number of valid nominations by independent contestants in this elections is 94 while in 2014 elections 185 independents filed papers.

Alliances

While the ruling YSR Congress Party is the only party to contest from all 64 wards, the Telugu Desam Party has made a tie-up with the Communist Party of India and the Bharatiya Janata Party is contesting in alliance with the Jana Sena Party.

The TDP will contest in 58 wards and six wards were allocated to the CPI.

Surprisingly, the BJP and its ally JSP did not file nominations in three wards – 8, 10 and 24. Regarding the other seats, there is no clarity about sharing and the BJP candidates filed nominations for 33 wards while JSP candidates filed papers for 45 wards, which resulted in both parties having candidates in 17 wards.

94,2020/03/15,Malls continue to levy parking fee despite diktat,"Bypassing a GVMC order, the business establishments are now collecting ‘maintenance fees’ from visitors

Two weeks back, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) had issued a notice regulating the collection of parking fees by commercial establishments, cinema theatres, malls and shopping complexes.

The establishments were told in no uncertain terms that they would have to shell out hefty fines if they charged parking fees from customers who park their vehicles for less than half an hour. For those parking their vehicles for more than 30 minutes and up to an hour, no parking fee would be collected if the visitor does any shopping. No parking fees can be collected if the visitor’s shopping bill is equal to or more than the parking fee if the vehicle is parked for over an hour, according to the GVMC diktat.

However, despite the warning, the multiplexes, malls and shopping complexes are continuing to collect parking fees, now under the garb of ‘maintenance fees’.

The ‘maintenance fee’ is nothing but a blatant attempt at bypassing the law on the part of the establishments, say motorists. Signboards are being put up by some establishments displaying the ‘facilities’ being provided at the parking lots, such as lighting, security, washrooms and drinking water — all of which merit charging a maintenance fee, according to the establishments.

In an order issued by the GVMC Commissioner, the fine that will be imposed on establishments for first-time violations will be ₹10,000. A second violation would entail a fine of ₹50,000. For repeated violations, the GVMC can seal the premises or impose any quantum of fine as desired by the Municipal Commissioner.

Action sought

Demanding that the civic body begin implementation of the revised parking fee norms, many irked citizens posted on social media pictures of the ‘maintenance fee’ receipts and videos of the attendants collecting the money while entering or exiting an establishment. GVMC officials have been receiving a number of complaints regarding illegal collection of money both online and offline, but they are yet to respond.

""GVMC says parking is free, but here the scenario is different. The staff say that they are collecting maintenance fees, not parking fees. When we try to question them further, they say that they are just paid to do their job and that they cannot let us enter or exit without paying,"" said N. Raghu, a student from a deemed to be university.

According to the staff at a renowned commercial establishment in the city, they earlier used to charge ₹20 for three hours. But now, ₹20 is being collected from a customer if he/she parks a two-wheeler for up to six hours. Similarly, ₹40 is being charged for a car for up to six hours.

""We were instructed to collect maintenance fee, but not parking fee. Maintenance fee is the user charge for facilitating lighting, providing security, CCTV surveillance, drinking water facility, air ventilation system, firefighting equipment, and elevators,"" said a staffer of a commercial establishment.

GVMC Chief City Planner R.J. Vidyullatha said that they have asked the owners of commercial establishments, theatres and malls to streamline things within a week.

""After seven days, our staff will start inspecting the premises and impose penalties if any non-compliance is noticed,"" she said.

However, a senior police officer on condition of anonymity said that it will be difficult for the civic body to implement the regulations, as the establishments will somehow find a way to fleece visitors, as they would not want to lose out on a major source of revenue like parking fee.

According to him, every large mall or multiplex earns around ₹50,000 daily on an average from parking, which comes up to about ₹1.5 crore a month and close to ₹18 to 20 crore in a year. ""Why would they let go of such a huge revenue source? It requires some tough enforcement to bring them in line,"" he said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/jtxz4c/article31079269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/222646036col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/malls-continue-to-levy-parking-fee-despite-diktat/article31076583.ece

Private sector lender Yes Bank posted a whopping ₹18,564 crore loss for the third quarter of the current financial year as bad loans surged. The bank had posted a net profit of ₹1,000 crore during the corresponding period of the previous year.

The lender had delayed the announcement of its earnings for the third quarter. Last week, the government had put the lender under moratorium while dismantling the board and appointed an administrator.

Gross non-performing assets went up to ₹40,709 crore, which is 18.87% of gross advances, from ₹17,134 crore, or 7.39%, at the end of the second quarter. Net NPAs jumped to ₹11,114 crore from ₹9,757 crore sequentially. As a result, provisions excluding tax expenses, were ₹24,765 crore for the third quarter as compared to ₹1,336 crore reported in the second quarter. The bank recognised additional provisions of ₹15,422 crore in the most recent quarter.

Higher provisions depleted its capital adequacy ratio, which fell much below the regulatory requirement. The ratio as on end December 2019 was 4.1%, as compared to 16.3% in end September.

The bank said its deposit base was reduced from ₹2,09,497 crore as on September 30, 2019 to ₹1,65,755 crore as on December 31, 2019. “The impact of the said moratorium on the depositor confidence is uncertain. However, the bank has additional liquidity from RBI and expects to raise funds from CD issuance to take care of any probable outflow of deposits on withdrawal of the moratorium,” the bank said in the notes of account.

For the nine-month period, the loss of the bank stood at ₹19,046 crore.

“The bank has a total deferred tax asset of ₹8,029.2 crore as at December 31, 2019. Based on financial projections approved by the administrator, the bank is expected to have sufficient future taxable income to utilise the said deferred tax assets,” the lender said.

“The bank has Basel III complaint additional Tier 1 bonds of ₹8,695 crore and believes AT 1 bonds amounting to ₹8,695 crore can be utilised to enhance the common equity as of date,” the notes said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/hro9f7/article31071470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THBUYESBANK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/yes-bank-posts-18564-cr-q3-loss/article31071471.ece
98,2020/03/15,Uncertainty over floor test in Madhya Pradesh,"Madhya Pradesh government yet to move confidence motion in Assembly

The Madhya Pradesh government is yet to move a motion in the Vidhan Sabha seeking a trust vote, confirmed Assembly sources, despite Governor Lalji Tandon’s direction to Chief Minister Kamal Nath to take a floor test on Monday “in any condition.”

As of 9 p.m. on Sunday, the schedule for the first day of the Budget session beginning from 11 a.m. on Monday mentions only the Governor’s address and vote of thanks, raising questions on whether the government would go in for the test on Monday.

Claiming that his “prima facie belief” was that the government had lost the trust of the Assembly and was in minority, Mr. Tandon had directed Mr. Nath to take the test during Monday’s session, which shouldn’t be “postponed, delayed or suspended.”

Also read: BJP seeks voting by raising of hands in floor test

As there is no facility to register votes by pressing buttons in the Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha, Mr. Tandon, who had ordered that the trust would be sought on division of votes by pressing buttons, passed a new order stating that vote will now be taken by raising of hands and no other method. Earlier, during the day, BJP leaders had requested the Governor to change the method of voting to raising of hands, owing to lack of other required facilities.

BJP holds meets

Ahead of the crucial floor test, the Bharatiya Janata Party held a series of meetings on Sunday with former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan camping in Delhi to meet the party MLAs lodged at Manesar, near Gurugram.

Sources said Madhya Pradesh BJP leaders met at the residence of Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Sunday morning. The meeting was attended by Mr. Chouhan, Dharmendra Pradhan and newly inducted Jyotiraditya Scindia.

They all went to the residence of Home Minister Amit Shah and held a brief meeting with him.

Later, the BJP leaders met Solicitor General Tushar Mehta where they discussed the legal aspects of the political turmoil in the State and sought his opinion if the matter reached the Supreme Court.

99,2020/03/15,"Labour Ministry yet to spend ₹2,053.59 crore of 2019-20 Budget, says Panel","‘Utilisation percentage has been 70% and above in most schemes, while NCS recorded a low of 60.88%’

The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour in its March 13 report has flagged the under-utilisation of funds by the Union Labour and Employment Ministry, which was yet to spend almost 20% of its 2019-2020 Budget (revised estimate) as on February 10.

The Committee, which is chaired by Biju Janata Dal MP Bhartuhari Mahtab, wrote in its report on the demand for grants by the Ministry for 2020-2021 that it was concerned about the un-utilised funds. The report that was presented in both Houses of Parliament on March 13 said the Ministry had utilised 81.64% of the ₹11,184.09 crore allocated to its in the revised estimate.

‘Not evenly spread’

“The Committee are concerned to note that underutilised funds amounting to ₹2,053.59 crore still remain for the fiscal 2019-20. The Committee further find that for the current fiscal 2019-20, the utilisation of funds was not evenly spread out across all the four quarters which stood at ₹504.88 crore, ₹5,975.92 crore, ₹1,806.77 crore, ₹842.93 crore (upto 10.02.2020) respectively,” the report stated.

The report noted that utilisation of funds for the National Career Services (NCS) scheme of the Ministry, which facilitates job-seekers, was the worst compared to other schemes. The Committee said the while the Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana, which gives employers incentives to generate new employment, recorded 100% utilisation compared with the revised estimate, in “most other Schemes, utilisation percentage has been to the extent of 70% and above while NCS recorded a low of 60.88%”.

Job fairs

While 3,751 job fairs had been conducted under the scheme till December 2019, “only 3.69 lakh” of the 19.71 lakh candidates had received job offers. The Ministry explained that it had introduced a feature on the NCS portal in March 2018 for employers to record the number of hirings, but this was not mandatory. Since 2018, employers had notified 2,115 hirings, the Ministry said.

When asked why the number of successful candidates had been so low, the Ministry told the committee that the job fairs were meant to bring employers and job-seekers together at a common platform.

“Employers join job fairs with certain type of jobs involving variety of skill sets specific to the industry concerned. However, due to wide publicity, job-seekers who may not be necessarily unemployed, along with job-seekers with or without required skill sets for jobs on offer also report to job fairs. Given this background, skewed pattern of job-seekers to that of jobs on offer by the employers is being perceived,” the Ministry replied.

Targets met

The committee added that it was satisfied with the fact that physical targets for the NCS and welfare of Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe job-seekers through coaching etc. had been met for the last three years.

100,2020/03/15,Amit shah meets sufi delegation,"They discuss revival of Sufi culture in Jammu and Kashmir

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday met representatives from the Ajmer Sharif Dargah, the revered Sufi shrine in Rajasthan.

Syed Naseruddin Chishty, chairman of the All India Sufi Sajjadanashin Council, said the delegation discussed the revival of Sufi culture in Jammu and Kashmir.

“Kashmiris used to follow Sufism, but gradually the extremists stopped the people and the youth. Kashmir has a rich tradition of revered Sufi dargahs [shrines], such as the famous Hazratbal Dargah in Srinagar. We are working to revive and promote Sufism in Kashmir,” he said.

He said the Home Minister appreciated their efforts and promised them full cooperation.

“Kashmir has nearly 60-70 Sufi shrines that are 500 years old. Many shrines were desecrated. We are in touch with the clerics there, and the government has promised [us] that a policy will be announced soon,” he said.

On July 1 last year, taking part in a discussion in the Rajya Sabha on extending President’s rule in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Shah had raised the disappearance of Sufi culture from the region. “Jammu and Kashmir used to be the epicentre of Sufi culture. Where did the Sufis disappear? Who forced them out. Why didn’t anyone raise a voice.... Weren’t they part of Kashmiriyat? Sufis were attacked, they were targeted.... They were the ones who spoke about Hindu-Muslim unity, about India,” he had said.

Mr. Chishty said they would soon start a door-to-door campaign in Kashmir to promote Sufism. He said the issue of employment for Jammu and Kashmir youth was also discussed.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amit-shah-meets-sufi-delegation/article31075667.ece
101,2020/03/15,“DoT units seeking bulk call data records routinely”,"It’s a deviation from norms laid down by government, say telcos

Some units of the the Telecom department are seeking huge call data records of people in some circles on a routine basis which is alleged to be in deviation from the standard operating procedure laid down by the government, according to sources.

Industry players have raised concerns over such practices in a communication to the Telecom Secretary, the sources said.

They claimed the DoT unit of Delhi had demanded call data records (CDRs) of the entire State for February 2, 3 and 4, 2020 and separately for specific routes in Delhi with residences of Ministers, MPs, judge, important offices etc following which industry players gave representation before Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash to raise concern.

“Telecom industry players have written to the Telecom Secretary that CDRs sought for specific routes and areas may lead to allegations of surveillance, especially in Delhi having numerous VVIP zones having offices and residences of Ministers, MPs, judges etc,” a source aware of the communication told PTI.

An email query sent to the Department of Telecom elicited no reply.

The source, who did not wish to be named, said the DoT had already issued detailed instructions and standard operating procedures (SOPs) for providing CDRs to law enforcement agencies in August 2016 and April 2019.

The DoT including its field units under the SOP are required to ascertain the identity of the subscriber, examine the justification carefully for the demand, detail the purpose and not use them for any other purpose, define the officers authorised to seek and approve such a request.

However, various licence service area units of the DoT are not adhering to the process and seek voluminous CDR details on regular basis.

“Almost all LSA units of DoT seek one day CDR details from telecom operators on monthly basis in States like Andhra Pradesh on 1st and 5th day of the month, Delhi on 18th day, Haryana on 21st day, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir on the last day of the month, Kerala and Odisha on the 15th day, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab on the last day of the previous month and the first day of the current month,” the source said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dot-units-seeking-bulk-call-data-records-routinely/article31075662.ece
102,2020/03/15,MPs' panel critical of govt. for delay in overhauling film censorship process,"With previous reports ignored, archaic processes are followed with only superficial improvements

A Parliamentary Panel pulled up the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government for dragging its feet on overhauling the archaic film certification and censorship mechanism, bringing only incremental changes to the Cinematograph Act that was first introduced in 1952.

The Standing Committee on Information and Technology, headed by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, which will table its report on the Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill, 2019 on Monday in Parliament has said that the government was being “unambitious”.

Also read | Editorial: Cinema & censorship

The Cinematograph Amendment Bill, 2019 is a belated measure by the government to tackle the issue of piracy. It seeks to introduce two sections to the Cinematograph Act, 1952 — one, prohibiting illegal recording in cinema halls to make a “pirate copy” of the film, and second, prescribing punishment of up to three years or a fine of up to ₹10 lakh towards the said offence. The Bill was introduced in Rajya Sabha in February last year and referred to the Standing Committee.

Limited scope

The Committee, according to sources, has found the scope of the Cinematograph (Amendment) Bill 2019 very limited. “Piracy can happen at various levels. The Bill only tackles illegal recording at cinema halls. Also, the punishment prescribed in the Bill is too little when compared with the losses that a pirated film can lead to,” one of the members said on condition of anonymity.

Also read | Do we need a film censor?

The Committee has suggested that with the average budgets of films going up, some of them even up to ₹200-₹300 crore per production, the fine creating a pirated version of it should be a percentage of the total budget of the film instead of the relatively paltry ₹10 lakh prescribed in the Bill.

Efforts at reworking

The Committee has noted the two recent efforts at reworking the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), which in common parlance is referred to as the Censor Board. In 2013, the Information and Broadcasting Ministry under the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government had instituted a committee under Justice Mukul Mudgal. The report was forgotten by the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government, which in 2016 formed a committee under the leadership of filmmaker Shyam Benegal to look at the same issue.

Mr. Benegal in turn recommended that the CBFC should only be a film certification body whose scope should be restricted to categorising the suitability of the film to audience groups on the basis of age and maturity.

Nearly four years on, the Committee said, that the government has done little to implement either of these two reports and continues to follow archaic processes with only superficial improvements.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gbw6um/article31075640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16SHASHITHAROOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/panel-critical-of-govt-for-delay-in-overhauling-film-censorship-process/article31075641.ece

A day after the government hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel by a steep ₹3 per litre each, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, taking a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a tweet, said that instead of passing on the benefit of the global oil price crash, “our genius” had hiked excise duty.

“We are not here to be servants, we are here to rule the country,” declared Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad at the launch of the political arm of the outfit in Noida on Sunday.

After a skirmish with the Noida police, the Bhim Army announced the launch of the Azad Samaj Party during a glittering ceremony at a farmhouse in Sector 70, attended by hundreds of workers from across the country. “We will start with Bihar Assembly elections and Uttar Pradesh panchayat polls to be held later this year,” said Mr. Azad, who was appointed the national president of the party.

Political power

“Hum yahan naukar nahin, shasak banne aye hain. Every time we used to hit the streets to save the Constitution, I was put behind bars. It used to stop our work. With political power in hand, nobody would be able to stop us from implementing the ideals of Kanshi Ram,” he said, explaining the rationale behind forming the party.

It is significant that the announcement was made on the 86th birth anniversary of Kanshi Ram, the founder of the Bahujan Samaj Party. “It could not have been held on any other day,” said Kanishk Singh, a senior member of the Delhi unit of the party. “The withdrawal of permission at the last minute was politically motivated as the Bahujan Samaj Party was allowed to celebrate the birthday of Kanshi Ram ji at a nearby spot,” he alleged.

Mission 78

Mr. Azad also launched a social group, Mission 78, on the lines of The All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (BAMCEF), the brainchild of Kanshi Ram which has lost significance in the last few years. “Like BAMCEF, Mission 78 will also bring together the bureaucrats and technocrats from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and minority communities, the Bahujan samaj, to work for the uplift of the marginalised in the community,” said Mr. Azad.

Countering fears that the Bhim Army would lose sight of its goals after the formation of the party, Mr. Azad reminded of the work of Kanshi Ram who, he said, “continued to work for the marginalised even when the BSP came to power.”

‘Against Brahmanism’

On the aggressive image of the Bhim Army, Mr. Singh said the party was committed to saving the Constitution by legal means. “We have observed that no political party is ready to hit the road to save the ideals of Bhimrao Ambedkar. We want to fill this void. We are against Brahmanism, not Brahmins.”

Many feel that the party will cut into the vote bank of the Bahujan Samaj Party. In fact, some have suggested that the newly-formed party should first develop its base in States where BSP hasn’t been able to make a dent. “Our fight with the BSP is ideological. Under its current leadership, the BSP has wavered from the principles of Kanshi Ram. It is common knowledge that the party sells tickets in the name of collecting funds. The young leadership from the Bahujan samaj is not being allowed to grow. Having said that, we are not closing our doors on the BSP,” said Mr. Singh.

For crowdfunding

He said they had observed the Arvind Kejriwal model of crowdfunding. “The Bahujan Samaj constitutes 85% of the population. If each one contributes one rupee, there would not be any lack of funds. Also, Mission 78, would work towards financial contribution to the party,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/8jtjou/article31075919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THCHANDRASHEKHARAZAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bhim-army-chief-launches-azad-samaj-party/article31075629.ece
105,2020/03/15,"Poor women in urban areas shorter, thinner and more anaemic: Study","Innovative techniques needed to extend nutrition services in urban areas, it says

Poor women in urban areas were shorter, thinner and more anaemic as compared to those from higher wealth categories, according to a new study which calls for policy initiatives to focus on urban poor women to curb malnutrition.

The research aims at determining the levels and trends of different forms of malnutrition among urban poor women and look beyond mere averages for the entire urban population, which paints a rosier picture. It has also resulted in a skewed focus on rural areas because averages show that urban estimates of nutritional status are better than rural. It analyses data from two rounds of the Demographic Health Survey conducted during 2005-2006 (DHS-3) and 2015-16 (DHS -4). The study comes at a time the government’s policy think-tank, NITI Aayog, is working on a paper to improve nutrition services in urban areas as part of the National Nutrition Mission.

It is co-authored by Vani Sethi, Arjan de Wagt, Arti Bhanot and seven others and was published recently in peer-reviewed journal, Maternal and Child Nutrition.

The analysis includes women who delivered between two to less than five years and for whom anthropometric and biochemical data were available resulting in a sample of 5,458 and 20,876 urban mothers for DHS‐3 and DHS‐4. These were divided into four equal groups of population on the basis of wealth index or a household’s relative economic status. Among this sample of 5,458 urban women in DHS‐3 and 20,876 urban women in DHS‐4, 25% (1,387) and 30% (6,321) were in the lowest quartile by wealth index or poor.

The findings show that as per DHS-4, 12.8% of urban poor mothers were short, 20.6% thin, 13.7% overweight, 21.1% obese, 57.4% anaemic and 32.4% had moderate to severe anaemia. Prevalence of short stature was 4.4 percentage points higher among poor mothers compared with all urban mothers, thinness was 8.5 percentage points higher and moderate to severe anaemia was 4 percentage points higher. In contrast, prevalence of obesity was higher among all urban mothers compared with urban poor mothers by 11 percentage points. The prevalence of double burden of thinness and anaemia and thinness and short stature was also the highest among poor mothers. Poor indicators of different forms of malnutrition among mothers have implications for the growth of the foetus and are known to result in low birth weight.

The study also examines the socio-economic characteristics of urban poor mothers and finds that 49.3% of them were married before the age of 18 years as compared to 31.2% of all urban mothers, a quarter or more of the mothers among the urban poor were from the Scheduled Castes households as compared to 17% to 18% among all urban mothers and less than 40% of them in DHS-4 had a BPL card. Only 45% of urban poor mothers had secondary or higher education, while the urban average was at 53% in DHS‐4. Urban mothers were largely unemployed and a lower proportion of urban poor mothers had access to money, bank accounts and information on microcredit scheme.

The study proposes a greater focus on urban poor women while extending nutrition services as well as screening for anaemia. It also calls for a need to evolve new methods to ensure improved coverage of government schemes in urban areas as frontline health workers (ASHAS and Anganwadi workers) active in rural areas are unable to deliver results in cities because of various reasons, including higher population density. The study also harps on the need to ensure access to nutritious foods and counselling services and criticises the government for failing to address challenges of overweight and obesity in its National Nutrition Mission as the urban population and especially the poor are at a greater risk.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/poor-women-in-urban-areas-shorter-thinner-and-more-anaemic-study/article31075595.ece
106,2020/03/15,Estimate for Lokpal expenses exceeded DoPT figures: RTI reply,"Despite allocation of funds, hardly any action has been taken against corrupt officials on Lokpal’s direction, points out petitioner

The overall proposed revised estimate of expenditure under various heads for the Lokpal office this financial year, as on January 15, had exceeded the figure recommended by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), according to a reply provided under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005.

The data shared with RTI campaigner K. Govindan Nampoothiry from Kerala states that the DoPT had given the total proposed revised expenditure as ₹18.01 crore, whereas it was subsequently revised to ₹18.58 crore for the entire financial year, owing to an increase in projected expenses. This was mainly on account of office expenses and minor works.

The total expenditure for the Lokpal office stood at ₹11.61 crore as on January 15, when there was an additional committed liability of about ₹6.09 crore. The total requirement was then about ₹17.7 crore.

Mr. Nampoothiry approached the Appellate Authority, following which the Proposed Revised Estimate for 2019-20 was shared. However, the names of accused persons and other related information were not given, he said.

‘Nationwide movement’

“There was a nationwide movement demanding the institution of Lokpal. A total of ₹101.29 crore was allocated to the Lokpal in the 2019-20 Budget. Now that it has been established and a lot of funds are being spent on its functioning, hardly any action has been initiated against corrupt officials and politicians in power on its direction. There is an apprehension that it might not yield desired results,” said Mr. Nampoothiry.

Compared with the DoPT’s estimates, on revision the amounts increased from ₹5 crore to ₹6 crore for “office expenses” and from ₹1 crore to ₹2.55 crore for “minor work”. There was also a minor hike in the revised expenditure, from ₹10 lakh to ₹13 lakh, for professional services. However, on account of salaries, the figure slightly declined from the required amount of over ₹3 crore.

The proposed revised estimates under the heads “rent, rates and taxes”, “domestic travel expenses”, “foreign travel expenses”, “other administrative expenses”, “overtime allowance” and “other charges” were also lower than the DoPT’s proposed figures.

Against the DoPT's figure of ₹8 crore, the proposed estimate on account of “rent, rates and taxes” came down significantly to ₹6.5 crore for this financial year. The Lokpal office, which was earlier set up temporarily in The Ashok hotel, was recently provided its new office space at the Vasant Kunj Institutional Area Phase II.

In response to Mr. Nampoothiry’s query, the Lokpal office had earlier said that it had received 1,255 complaints and that seven meetings of the full Bench of the Lokpal had been held till December 20, 2019.

Information not shared

However, it did not share information pertaining to the names of accused persons, details of corruption charges and action taken by the Lokpal, stating that they were not in a segregated format. Details of the expenses for office functioning, salary for members and other works were also not given.

It was almost a year after the Lokpal became functional that, in the first week of March, the DoPT issued a notification providing the rules and prescribed format for filing complaints with the anti-corruption ombudsman.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/estimate-for-lokpal-expenses-exceeded-dopt-figures-rti-reply/article31075383.ece

“We came to know that the electronic voting system in the State assembly is not functional. So we have urged the Governor that the division of votes in the House should be carried out by raising the hands,” Mr. Bhargava said.

In his letter to CM Nath, the Governor directed that the division of votes during the floor test should be conducted only by pressing the button (through the electronic voting system) and no other way should be adopted.

When asked about this, State Assembly Secretariat’s Principal Secretary A.P. Singh told PTI that the Vidhan Sabha doesn’t have the electronic voting system.

“We have a set procedure for conducting division of votes. As per the procedure, MLAs have to sign in a register placed in the lobby along with their names and constituencies. They sign in two columns separately for those in favour and against..,” Mr. Singh explained.

In his letter to Mr. Nath, Mr. Tandon stated, “I came to know that 22 MLAs have sent their resignations to the M.P. Assembly Speaker and they have also informed about it on electronic and print media. I have seen the coverage on both media.

“They have also sent the letter to me separately on March 10, 2020 and the same MLAs have requested for the central security to present these resignation letters to the Vidhan Sabha speaker on March 13,” it stated.

“Under Article 174 and 175(2) of the Constitution, I am empowered to direct that M.P. Assembly session will begin on March 16 at 11 a.m. with my address. Soon after that the only work to be done is voting on trust vote,” the Governor stated.

109,2020/03/15,Nirbhaya case: Tihar asks hangman to report three days ahead of execution,"The four convicts in the case are to be hanged together at 5.30 a.m. on March 20

With just five days left for the execution of death sentence in the sensational 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, the Tihar Jail authorities on Sunday said they have asked the hangman to report three days ahead of the scheduled hanging.

The four convicts in the case are to be hanged together at 5.30 a.m. on March 20, according to an order by a Delhi court earlier this month.

The death row convicts are Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).

The execution of their death warrants has been deferred thrice so far due to delays by them in exhausting legal remedies.

After the fresh death warrant was issued, the Tihar Jail authorities wrote to their counterparts in Uttar Pradesh requesting for the service of hangman Pawan Jallad, a senior jail official said.

“Pawan Jallad, a hangman from Meerut, has been asked to report at Tihar Jail on March 17, three days ahead of the scheduled date of hanging,” said Sandeep Goel, DG (Prisons).

According to the jail authorities, dummy executions will be conducted again after the arrival of Mr. Jallad.

Health checks-up of the convicts is being done once in a day. They are also being counselled on regular basis, they said.

Out of the four convicts, Mukesh, Pawan and Vinay have had their last face-to-face meetings with their respective families. The authorities have written to the family of Akshay about the date for final meeting before the scheduled date of execution.

The jail authorities have also not stopped the convicts’ weekly meetings with their families yet.

A 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ‘Nirbhaya’ (fearless), was gang raped and savagely assaulted in a moving bus in South Delhi on December 16, 2012. She died after a fortnight.

Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused. Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail days after the trial began in the case.

The juvenile was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe into the dastardly Pulwama attack of last year has revealed that terror groups such as the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) were roping in young boys in Kashmir for making online purchases, including chemicals used for manufacturing explosives, officials said.

Also read | Pulwama attack case: NIA arrests two more

The investigation into the terror attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel recently led to the arrest of two people, including 19-year-old Wazir, who during his interrogation gave the officials an insight into the radicalisation process of the terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed.

Wazir is alleged to have procured online aluminium powder, jackets used in high-altitude areas, mobile battery banks and trekking shoes, officials said.

Aluminum powder, which was used in earlier times by photographers to create camera flashes, is highly flammable and used as an ingredient in blasting agents used in commercial mining, they said.

Wazir handed over the aluminium powder to JeM overground workers and it was used by terrorists in the February 14 suicide attack when an explosive-laden car hit a CRPF convoy killing 40 personnel.

His interrogation also gave an insight into how JeM overground workers were brainwashing young boys and preparing them to indulge in terror activities, the officials said.

The case, which had virtually come to a halt as all conspirators had been killed, got a fresh impetus after the NIA identified the house where Adil Ahmed Dar, the terrorist who was driving the explosive-laden car, had shot his last propaganda video that was subsequently released by the terror group from Pakistan.

On February 28, the NIA achieved a major breakthrough in the case when it arrested 22-year-old Shakir Bashir Magrey, a furniture shop owner and resident of Hajibal in Pulwama’s Kakapora.

Magrey had provided shelter and other logistical assistance to suicide bomber Adil. He was introduced to Adil in mid-2018 by Pakistani terrorist Mohammad Umar Farooq and he became a full-time overground worker of the JeM.

This month, the NIA has arrested four people, including Tariq Ahmed Shah, his daughter Insha Jan, Wazir-ul-Islam and Mohammad Abbass Rather.

113,2020/03/15,J&K will have a domicile policy: Amit Shah,"Union Home Minister denies move for demographic change in region.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday assured members of the newly formed Apni Party of Jammu and Kashmir that the intention of the government was not to bring in any “demographic changes” in the region.

Mr. Shah informed a party delegation that J&K would have a “better domicile policy than other States in the country”.

Also read | Will work to restore J&K statehood: PM

On August 5, 2019, the Centre revoked the special status of J&K under Article 370 and Article 35A of the Constitution. The two revoked provisions had enabled the J&K Assembly to decide the “permanent residents” of the erstwhile State, prohibiting people from outside from buying property and ensuring job reservation for residents.

There are 12 States including Himachal Pradesh where provisions granting special status under Article 371 of the Constitution apply.

The special provision for J&K will ensure protection to domiciles of J&K in government jobs, educational institutions and land rights.

A statement issued by the Home Ministry on Sunday said Mr. Shah met a 24-member delegation from the Apni Party, led by Altaf Bukhari, and held discussions on some 40 issues. Mr. Shah said “visible changes will be seen on the ground in the next three to four months”.

The delegation was told that the statehood of J&K, which was made a Union Territory along with the abrogation of special status, would be restored at an early opportunity and “this is also good for India’s interest, as the region is a border area”.

Mr. Shah said all decisions on relaxation of restrictions in J&K that were being taken by the Prime Minister and implemented by the Home Ministry were based on ground realities and not under any pressure.

“He referred to steps like release of people from preventive detention, restoration of the Internet, relaxation in curfew, and added that even political prisoners would be freed in the time to come as the main objective of the government is that not a single person should die, be it a common Kashmiri or security personnel,” the Ministry’s statement said.

Mr. Shah told the delegation that soon, an attractive industrial policy and an economic development policy would be announced.

A land bank had been created. “He said for the last 70 years, J&K attracted ₹13,000 crore and expressed hope that by (the year) 2024 three times more investment will come in the region as there is huge potential for the same,” the statement said.

‘Open to suggestions’

On the issues of reservation, the Home Minister said a commission would be set up soon and reiterated that no injustice would be done to Gujjars, nomads and other communities.

Mr. Shah said the government was open to suggestions and feedback from all including “old parties, new parties and individuals”.

Emerging from the meeting, Mr. Bukhari, who was a Minister in the previous Peoples Democratic Party government in J&K, denied allegations that the Apni Party was a “B” team of the BJP.

“We came with a message from the people of J&K. Time will show whether we are an ‘A’ team or ‘B’ team. We have been clearly told that there will be no demographic changes, and our land will not be snatched. We are here to discuss the economic distress and other problems faced by people in the past eight months,” Mr. Bukhari said.

He said half the Apni Party members would be experienced people and the rest newcomers.

By restricting the number of terms a person could become party president to two, the party would ensure that it did not turn into a dynasty-driven party.

However, a senior researcher at an institution affiliated to the Union Science Ministry, who did not wish to be identified, said “it is likely” that community transmission is ongoing in India but has not been recorded in official counts due to inadequate testing.

Senior Congress leader Ajay Maken told presspersons at a press conference that the government should reduce the rates of petrol, diesel and LPG by at least 35-40%. “The Modi-Shah government has looted the people by increasing excise duties and huge taxes on petroleum products and did not bring this under GST despite the consistent demand of Congress,” Mr. Maken said after the Centre hiked excise duty on petrol and diesel by a steep ₹3 per litre each that will fetch an additional revenue ₹39,000 crore.

Governor Lalji Tandon, in a letter to Chief Minister Kamal Nath to call upon him to prove his government’s majority, stated that his “prima facie belief” was that the government had lost the trust of the Assembly and was in minority. In addition, Mr. Tandon pointed to the BJP’s claim that the State government was putting “unwanted pressure” on those who’d resigned and other members.

At the end of the letter, he wrote that the test must be conducted in any condition and shouldn’t be postponed, delayed or suspended. Earlier during the day, BJP leaders had alleged the Congress was attempting to stall the test.

The Governor rejected the Leader of Opposition's demand to hold the test before his address.

Madhya Pradesh Vidhan Sabha Speaker N.P. Prajapati accepted the resignations of six rebel MLAs, who are in Bengaluru, after they failed to appear before him to attest to their resignations even after being given time to do so on two days.

“The news given by them relating to this in electronic media is also raising questions marks,” Mr. Prajapati wrote in his order, accepting the resignations submitted by BJP leaders on March 10. “This way, their conduct seems to be astounding and they are not fit to be members of the Vidhan Sabha,” he added. The six members whose resignations have been accepted were ministers in the State government and supporters of Jyotiraditya Scindia, who crossed over to the BJP. Governor Lalji Tandon had on Friday approved Chief Minister Kamal Nath’s recommendation to remove them from the cabinet.

Meanwhile, Mr. Nath wrote to the Union Home minister exhorting him to ensure the release of 22 rebel MLAs held in “captivity” in Bengaluru so that they could attend the session from Monday. “There is no point in the demand for a floor test if 22 of my MLAs are held hostage outside,” he wrote. On Friday, Mr. Tandon had asked Mr. Nath to provide cover of the central paramilitary forces for those MLAs asked to appear before the Speaker. “I assure you that if Karnataka police ensures their release, I’ll provide them with the highest security arrangements here,” he wrote.

Earlier, a day after the ruling Congress had asked the Governor to hold a floor test in the forthcoming budget session starting from Monday, the Opposition BJP on Saturday urged him to hold the test even earlier, claiming that the government was in a minority and attempting to stall the trust vote.

A BJP delegation that included the Leader of the Opposition Gopal Bhargava and former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan submitted a letter to Mr. Tandon at the Raj Bhavan urging him to use his powers under Article 175 (2) of the Constitution — relating to sending messages to Houses — and issue orders to conduct the test. They also demanded that no other issue ought to be taken up during the session.

Mr. Chouhan claimed that the 22 rebel MLAs, currently in Bengaluru, had made it clear in videos released by them that they had resigned. “The Kamal Nath-led government is in minority now, and doesn’t have the right to take decisions... it doesn’t have the constitutional right to govern,” he told reporters.

There was no point to a budget session or the Governor’s address, he contended, given the minority nature of the government. “We request it also because several divisive elements inspired by the government are giving inducements to and pressuring [MLAs], threatening relatives and opening new cases against them,” the former chief minister said.

In addition, the delegation had requested the Governor to accord Central paramilitary security-cover to BJP MLAs. “They are not willing to return without adequate security,” said Mr. Chouhan.

In the letter, they requested for a test not by a voice vote but by division of votes and asked that the proceedings be videographed by an official authorised by the Governor.

“We also request you to ensure that the minority government doesn’t postpone the date of the floor test using any excuse,” the leaders exhorted Mr. Tandon.

Former Minister Narottam Mishra, part of the delegation, pointed out that both parties wanted a floor test now. “Yet, they are flagging the coronavirus threat to postpone the session. Well, the Lok Sabha session is underway, and there is no platform above it. The threat is not so much here as in Delhi. This is delaying tactics which we will not allow to succeed.”

Meanwhile, Congress Chief Whip Govind Singh issued a three-line whip to the party’s MLAs to be present during the session on all days, remain in Bhopal and vote compulsorily in favour of the government.

“All the honourable MLAs are requested to be present mandatorily in Bhopal during the fifth session of the Vidhan Sabha on all working days, that is from March 16 to April 13, and in the House during all the proceedings, ensure their attendance at all times and in every condition vote compulsorily in favour of the government,” the whip said.

Separately, the Bhopal police have registered a case against 35 unidentified persons after BJP leaders staged a dharna here on Friday night demanding an FIR against alleged Congress workers showing black flags and obstructing the passage of the vehicles of the BJP’s Mr. Scindia and his supporters.

“We have booked 30-35 persons for obstructing the road,” said Shailendra Chouhan, Superintendent of Police, North Bhopal. The case had been registered under sections 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 147 (punishment for rioting) of the Indian Penal Code.

“There is no law and order left in the State,” asserted Mr. Chouhan. In a reference to Mr. Scindia, he also alleged that there had been an “attempt to kill” a former Union Minister who is “BJP’s senior leader” and a Rajya Sabha candidate. “They tried to stop his [Mr. Scindia’s] vehicle and pelted stones. The driver somehow saved his life by driving through,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bk0nxh/article31071752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LALJITANDON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/madhya-pradesh-floor-test-on-monday/article31071753.ece
121,2020/03/15,Renovation of CCC building nears completion,"We are not disturbing any wooden material used in the construction, says secretary

Renovation of the 109-year-old heritage building of the Cocanada Chamber of Commerce (CCC) is nearing completion, without any change in its architectural beauty and design.

CCC Secretary Mangayya Pantulu Paracha told The Hindu on Wednesday; “The renovation of our historical building will complete by June.

The renovation project is being executed as per the plan finalised by our former chairman Dantu Suryarao (passed away in 2017). The renovation has commenced in February, 2011.”

History

“We are not disturbing any wooden material used in the building construction with a precaution that the building should not miss any of its architectural features,” added Mr. Mangayya.

The red-coloured CCC building is located near the one-town police area in Kakinada.

The CCC office-bearers and members have raised ₹ 1 crore that is being spent on the renovation. In 2011, then British Deputy High Commissioner Richard Hyde has grounded the renovation task.

According to souvenir (1997), the Cocanada Chamber of Commerce was established in 1868 and ran in the offices of the British firms until a permanent building was built in 1911 during the Chairmanship of P.J. Rose.

The chamber was known as the ‘European Chamber’ as it was established by the European companies and no Indian firms were given the membership in the chamber during the European regime.

By now, the chamber has a membership of nearly 55 firms, playing a prominent role in the maritime trade activity on the Kakinada coast, apart from addressing the issues of the workforce that engage in the operation of Kakinada deep sea port and anchorage port.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/6wtcul/article31076597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12VJ-COCANADA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/renovation-of-ccc-building-nears-completion/article31076598.ece
122,2020/03/15,COVID-19 takes a heavy toll on banana exports,"Price plummets as importing countries are in lockdown

Novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has hit the banana farmers of Anantapur and Kadapa districts hard as the importing countries like Iran have gone into a lockdown.

The price of a tonne of banana, which used to command between ₹13,000 and ₹14,500 just a month ago, came down below ₹8,000. It would be non-remunerative for farmers if the average price of banana falls below ₹6,000 a tonne.

Desai Fruits Company, which exported about 15,000 tonnes of Happy Banana brand of bananas so far from Anantapur district with 20 rakes of goods container trains to Iran, stalled it from Sunday as it exhausted its cold storage capacity also.

Deputy Director of Horticulture S. Subbarayudu said when there was demand for bananas a couple of months ago, many farmers did not part with their stocks even at ₹14,000 a tonne, but today it has come down to ₹8,000 a tonne.

The local market was offering only ₹5,000 a tonne. Exports have seen a drastic fall resulting in flooding of domestic market with stocks from Pulivendula and other places in Kadapa district.

Kadavakallu in Putlur mandal of Anantapur district is plush with banana stocks and had sent the first fruit train of the country to Iran. Now the farmers are waiting for buyers who would offer a good price.

Pomegranate not hit

He said Special Economic Zones were set up in Visakhapatnam and Tada. In automobile sector though the State is lagging when compared to Tamil Nadu, he said a robust ecosystem was being created in Anantapur bordering Karnataka after establishment of a car factory by Kia Motors.

IT, pharma hub

Stating that in the field of IT and IT enabled services and pharma, Visakhapatnam had already carved a niche for itself, he said there was a need to create more clusters in other parts of the State. Though pharma units cause pollution, there was a need to contain it as far as possible.

Favouring development of more pharma units, he said Visakhapatnam had attracted second largest investment in the pharma industry after Hyderabad, the bulk drug capital of India, in the combined A.P.

Referring to IT and ITES, Mr. Reddy said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was firm on transforming Visakhapatnam into a prominent hub in the country by developing the required ecosystem.

Giving details on the emphasis being laid by Mr. Jagan on welfare measures for the SC, ST, BCs and minorities, he said the industrialists should join hands with the government in putting A.P. in the forefront in all the areas.

Seafood export

Expressing satisfaction over fish and prawn sector contributing 7.4% of State GDP, he said now the State had overtaken Tamil Nadu and Kerala in exports of seafood.

A Russian national, who had come to Puttaparthi from Kochi, has been put under observation in the Isolation Ward of the Government General Hospital in Anantapur. He was sent from the Sri Sathya Sai Super Speciality Hospital at Puttaparthi after he developed cold and cough on his arrival.

Not taking chances

“The 51-year-old Russian man who came to the GGH on Sunday has mild symptoms, but not strong enough to doubt that he had contracted COVID-19. But the doctors here are not taking any chance and have sent a sample to the SVIMS Hospital in Tirupati. If they can confirm, he would be either discharged, or treated if positive,” said GGH Resident Medical Officer R. Lalitha.

“If the SVIMS laboratory cannot determine conclusively, the sample would be sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune,” GGH Superintendent M. Ramaswamy Naik said.

A walk-in suspect

Meanwhile, another Indian national from Anantapur came to the hospital on Friday on his own with suspicion of having COVID-19 symptoms. But the doctors did not find anything wrong or symptoms strong enough to suggest it was COVID-19, hence put him under observation at the Isolation Ward. He had visited the Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad and feared he could have contracted the virus. Currently, only these two patients are there in the Isolation Ward.

District health officials meanwhile had received information about 27 persons whose passports mentioned their addresses in Anantapur district, have travelled to suspect nations and arrived recently. “Whereabouts of the persons are not known now as some of the addresses were old or they had shifted to Bengaluru or Hyderabad for jobs,” District Medical and Health Officer K.V.N.S Anil Kumar told The Hindu.

128,2020/03/15,Pawan Kalyan appeals to SEC to conduct fresh nominations for local body polls,"JSP to submit a report to the CEC and Union Home Ministry on the threats to, and physical attacks on its contestants, police inaction, among others

Jana Sena Party (JSP) President Pawan Kalyan on Sunday appealed to the State Election Commission (SEC) to conduct fresh nominations for the local body elections.

Addressing a press conference here after the SEC announcement postponing the local body elections for six weeks, Mr. Kalyan said the nomination exercise (MPTC/ZPTC) for the local body elections were not completed fairly across the State.

A silent SEC

“We appeal to the SEC to conduct the nomination exercise afresh. The SEC was calm over the incidences of physical attacks on our contestants across the State, though it is supposed to stop the election in the segments where such incidents took place,” he said.

“Police, government officials and public representatives have together created an environment of terror, in which the contestants from the JSP and BJP were either threatened to withdraw their nominations or join the YSRCP. Such environment prevailing in the State speaks of anti-democracy,” said Mr. Kalyan.

Report from the ground

In a report to the Chief Election Commission (CEC): Mr. Kalyan said: “Our party is preparing a ground-level report, documenting the incidences of physical attacks on our contestants, audiotapes of threats from the public representatives to withdraw the nominations by our contestants. The report will be submitted to the Central Election Commission, the Home Ministry, and the Central government.”

“The party will no more tolerate the physical attacks on our contestants and supporters. We will not hesitate to take hit the roads to respond to the YSRCP’s threats in the local body elections. No police officer who reportedly supported the YSRCP in threatening our contestants can escape from our future legal battle,” said Mr. Kalyan.

The JSP supremo has further stated he would personally meet the CEC, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, and other authorities, explaining the way the local body elections were being conducted in the State.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pawan-kalyan-appeals-to-sec/article31073938.ece

The State Election Commission (SEC) has deferred the local body elections by six weeks due to the threat of COVID-19. It will resume the election process after the arrest of the spread of Coronavirus, or its decline, and normalcy is restored, State Election Commissioner (SEC) N. Ramesh Kumar announced at a press conference here on Sunday.

Mr. Ramesh Kumar said political parties have requested him in a meeting held on March 6 to postpone the polls due to the outbreak of Coronavirus in several parts of the country, and public gatherings across towns and villages for campaigns.

Safeguards needed in place

The Commission has taken inputs from senior health functionaries, who indicated that health safeguards needed to be put in place immediately to avoid large public gatherings in order to contain the possible spread of Coronavirus.

“The Central government has declared the Coronavirus outbreak as a notified disaster prompting necessary measures by the States. There was a likelihood of the movement of a large number of voters from Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, which could aggravate the situation,” he stated.

130,2020/03/15,Foreign returnees under surveillance in State,"Number of people under house quarantine on the rise

The medical and health administration in Chittoor district has mounted surveillance on people suspected to have contracted COVID-19, while the number of persons under “house-quarantine” after returning from foreign countries is on the rise.

In view of the presence of famous pilgrimage centres of Tirupati, Tirumala and Srikalahasti, which attract close to one lakh pilgrims a day with the start of holiday season, the entire paramedical and medical personnel have been put on alert.

According to the District Medical and Health Officer P. Penchalaiah, after a person in Nellore district tested positive to the virus, “we have doubled our precautionary measures.”

250 under watch

The official said that since a month, more than 250 persons from several parts of Chittoor district, who returned from the foreign countries, particularly from West Asia, South East Asia and Europe, were quarantined at their respective houses. “So far, 60 persons were declared absolutely not affected by the virus as they tested negative, after 28 days. As all the persons who are presently under surveillance showed no signs of any serious illness, it is a big relief to the district administration,” Dr. Penchalaiah said.

The DMHO said that as most people who return home in Chittoor district arrive at Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad and Tirupati airports, the respective surveillance teams had full access to their itineraries, right from their arrival in foreign countries to the places they had visited, and the time they had boarded the return flights, along with their medical records.

“Following the Central government’s directive, all the foreign returnees should now get ready for voluntary quarantine at their house. In case of any government employees among the surveillance target, they have to continue their leave period,” Dr. Penchalaiah said, adding that for every case under surveillance, two paramedical staff were being allotted for regular and daily health checks.

The DMHO said the authorities of all the major temples in the district were implementing precautionary measures against COVID-19 in coordination with the surveillance teams, apart from launching massive sanitation drives and sensitisation of devotees about dos and don’ts.

50 screened in Vizianagaram

Vizianagaram District Medical and Health Officer S.V. Ramana Kumari on Saturday said that special wards were allocated in all government hospitals, including Vizianagaram MR Hospital, for the treatment of peopel showing symptoms of COVID-19, while stating that there were no cases reported so far in the district.

She said that the department had screened 50 persons who had come from different countries to Vizianagaram district in the last few days and that all were declared healthy by the medical teams. She said that there was no need to panic over the dreaded disease since persons who would observe healthy and hygienic practices would not be affected by the virus.

The elections are scheduled from March 21 to 30, including declaration of results.

But medical experts feel that the State government should take a cue from the Delhi government and postpone the elections.

Delhi government has taken some steps such as banning a gathering over 200 people at one place and closing down some schools, colleges, cinemas and shopping complexes.

During elections, there will be rallies and public gatherings and most importantly a large number will turn up at the polling booths and standing close to each other in close proximity, said a senior doctor from community medicine, King George Hospital, Visakhapatnam.

“Infections can even spread through the handling of ballot papers from an infected person,” said P.V. Sudhakar, Principal AMC.

“It is not possible for the authorities concerned to screen people and send them to the booths at polling stations. Neither do we have the manpower nor the machinery, in such a case it is advisable to postpone the elections, as most of events, including sporting events, have been cancelled or shifted beyond April 15, as safety of people should be given prime importance,” said C.V.

Mr. Jagadeesh asked the High Court to step in and give an order postponing the elections. “If the High Court takes a call, the funds from the Centre will come to the State even if the elections are not immediately conducted,” he added.

The district secretary later claimed that there is a shortage of masks and hand sanitisers in the State. “The government must distribute masks and hand sanitisers,” he said, adding that the government must take a cue from other States and immediately shut down schools, theatres and shopping malls to curb the spread of Coronavirus.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/high-court-should-pass-order-to-postpone-the-elections-cpi/article31071550.ece

Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan on Saturday said the party members, supporters and youth who wish to be ‘ruled by criminals could join the YSR Congress Party’.

Speaking at the party’s sixth foundation day celebrations held here on Saturday, Mr. Kalyan said at the time of launch itself the party was prepared to deal with failure. “The six-year journey was not happy and the future may also not be rosy. However, the party has the courage to face any situation and consequence. In this journey, those who wish to be ruled by criminals could leave us and join the YSRCP,” the JSP chief said.

National service

Accompanied by his brother and PAC member Nagababu, Mr. Pawan Kalyan said, “I see national service in politics and continue to raise voice for the voiceless. I never entertained the idea of gaining power with caste equations.”

On the party’s future, Mr. Kalyan said that he had put faith in the youth to strengthen the party. Those who were with him in the beginning, had left him later, he added.

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development Botcha Satyanarayana, referring to stray incidents of violence that occurred in the State recently in the run-up to the local body elections, said on Saturday that former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu is making baseless allegations against the State government.

Addressing a media conference here, Mr. Satyanarayana said that the government was making all arrangements to ensure free and fair elections in the State.

“The TDP is trying to show the government in poor light by highlighting trivial issues. Law and order is absolutely under control in all the districts. The opposition is fearful about tasting defeat even before the elections. That is why it is resorting to mudslinging,” Mr. Satyanarayana said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-levelling-false-allegations-botcha/article31071407.ece
139,2020/03/15,Out for shopping? Be ready for temperature checks,"Hypermarket outlets are scanning visitors for fever with forehead thermometers

In a bid to boost customer confidence, hypermarket outlets have started scanning visitors with forehead thermometers here in a bid to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

Visitors with body temperature above normal are being politely asked to leave the premises.

“Our corporate office has instructed us to do this to instill confidence among customers so that they can go about their shopping without any fear,” an employee said.

While this practice is far from being a foolproof method to detect persons suffering from COVID-19, business establishments are resorting to it as a last-ditch measure to keep footfalls intact. This may also help those who are unaware that they are running a temperature go to a doctor.

Former superintendent of ESI Hospital and senior general physician T.V. Narayana Rao welcomed the development.

“Forehead thermometers are fast, effective and well-suited for checking the temperature of large groups. These thermometers are also being used extensively in developed countries,” Dr. Narayana Rao said.

Also known as temporal artery thermometers, they use infrared technology to detect the temperature of the temporal artery on the forehead.

Forehead thermometers are being increasingly used at clinics, particularly by paediatricians as it takes only two seconds for the doctor to get a temperature reading, which makes it easier for them to deal with toddlers.

Forehead thermometers cost anywhere between ₹700 and ₹3,000 and are widely available online.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/out-for-shopping-be-ready-for-temperature-checks/article31071372.ece
140,2020/03/15,Pilgrims will not be made to wait in Vaikuntam complex: TTD EO,"They will be allowed for darshan on an hourly basis from Tuesday

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams has resolved to temporarily bid adieu to the system of making pilgrims wait at the Vaikuntam Queue Complex before allowing them for the darshan of Lord Venkateswara. Normally pilgrims wait between two and 10 hours inside the complex subject to the turnout on the day.

Briefing the media, TTD Executive officer Anil Kumar Singhal and Additional EO A.V. Dharma Reddy on Saturday said the decision was taken in the backdrop of growing number of COVID-19 cases across the country. The State government has identified Tirumala as the premier town experiencing a large gathering of pilgrims.

Hence it had been decided to strictly follow the ‘time slot’ system in darshan and allow the pilgrims on an hourly basis without making them wait in the compartments.

The system will come into force from Tuesday and every pilgrim should invariably have the tokens and report at the complex only at the time as mentioned on them.

Sevas

Devotees attending sevas such as Visesha pooja, SD Seva and Vasanthotsavams can henceforth postpone the day of their pilgrimage or swap to another darshan format like VIP break in case of their finalised visits, as the management strongly feels that allowing large number of people stay at a common place is likely to prove hazardous.

Vontimitta fete

The Sita Rama Kalyanam at Vontimitta temple in Kadapa would be a low key affair without much fanfare. The festival would be restricted to the temple precincts and devotees could witness the religious proceedings on live telecast. Similarly the ground breaking ceremony (bhoomi pooja) for the construction of the temple of Lord Venkateswara in Mumbai had also been postponed.

To thwart away the evil effects of COVID-19, the TTD board had decided to perform Sri Srinivasa Shanti Utsavam along with Dhanvanthari Yagam.

Mr. Singhal said that priority had been attached in the maintenance of hygiene atop the entire town and periodical sanitising of crowded places such as Queue complex, Free meals complex and Central Reception Office and other places of pilgrim congregation.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/d8gbf8/article31071334.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15VJTIRUMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pilgrims-will-not-be-made-to-wait-in-vaikuntam-complex-ttd-eo/article31071335.ece

The SPSR Nellore district administration is maintaining a heightened vigil to prevent the spread of COVID-19, now declared a ‘State epidemic’, as three persons — two Italy returnees and one from Kuwait — underwent treatment at the Government General Hospital here.

“A 24-year-old person who has returned from Italy and was admitted to hospital on Monday is recovering, while another person who also returned from Italy has tested negative. A 40-year-old person from Kuwait with symptoms has been hospitalised,” District Joint Collector Dr. V.Vinod Kumar told The Hindu.

A district emergency operation centre was set up at the Collectorate with a COVID-19 help desk, he said, after a District Disaster Management Authority meeting here on Saturday evening. Roles of personnel were defined for a coordinated effort as part of the disease containment strategy.

Those in need of help can contact 9618232115. People need not panic but take precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded places and maintaining personal hygiene.

Meanwhile, masks went out of stock in most medical shops as panic-stricken people vied with each other to buy them.

Masks, which were available at a price of about ₹50, were sold for up to ₹500 each, complained some denizens who said they would rather cover their face with a handkerchief.

Shopping malls wore a deserted look and theatres remained closed, as well as educational institutions.

Meanwhile, former TDP Minister Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy demanded postponement of the local body elections in the district, taking into account the health situation. “It is not enough to close theatres, swimming pools and schools. Civic polls can also be held at a later date,” he opined.

Health officials advised people to avoid ice creams and soft drinks and instead drink hot water and do gargling with saltwater. They should frequently wash their hands with alcohol-based solution. They can contact the helpline 104 for advice.

Andhra Pradesh Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling Task Force (APRSASTF) personnel on Saturday seized two tonnes of ‘A Grade’ red sanders logs worth ₹4 crore, along with a lorry used to smuggle the logs, in a raid at Gunjana forest 25 km from Tirupati.

Addressing a press meet at the Task Force office in Tirupati, Superintendent of Police Ravi Shankar said that during the combing operations, the task force personnel had nabbed two local operatives at Balapalle area on Friday night.

“Upon interrogation, the duo revealed that a group of 30 more operatives were inside the forest range, getting ready to load red sanders logs into a lorry,” Mr. Shankar said.

A raid party was formed immediately which rushed to the spot on Friday midnight.

After an hour of combing, a 12-wheeler lorry, believed to have been hired from Punjab, was detected in the reserve forest zone, bound towards the Tirupati-Mumbai national highway. On seeing the raid party, the driver abandoned the vehicle and disappeared into the forests along with the operatives engaged in loading the logs. It was found that the lorry contained 52 logs of ‘A-Grade’ variety. Combing operations were intensified in the Seshachalam hills to flush out the smuggling operatives.

143,2020/03/15,COVID-19 scare: Social media flooded with unverified messages,"Those forwarding these messages not realising that they are creating panic, says police official

Social media platforms are being flooded with unverified messages regarding the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). The messages, most of which are misleading and untrue, are causing panic among netizens.

Messages are doing the rounds on messaging platforms like WhatsApp, claiming that several persons in the city have tested positive for COVID-19. Some messages even claim that a few infected persons have left hospitals without the consent of doctors and are now untraceable.

On Friday, a message went viral claiming that a resident of Malkapuram tested positive for the virus and has infected several others. There are also messages stating that schools, colleges and malls will be shut down indefinitely and examinations will be postponed.

“A few days ago, I received a message claiming that a person studying at a corporate college in Rushikonda has tested positive, and has also infected many other students on his campus,” said a resident of Visalakshi Nagar.

Officials not amused

“These messages are all fake,” said a furious S. Tirupathi Rao, District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) of Visakhapatnam.

“I condemn such messages. Till date, the district has not registered a single positive case. People should not panic if they come across such messages. Awareness is already being created through various means,” Dr. Tirupathi Rao added.

Cybercrime Police Station Inspector V. Gopinath took a harsh view of people forwarding such messages without verifying if they are true or not.

Word of caution

“People should refrain from forwarding such messages without verification. Those forwarding such messages might believe they are doing so to spread awareness, but do not realise that they are ending up creating panic,” Mr. Gopinath said.

The Inspector also had a word of caution for scaremongers.

“Unless officials release a statement, the public should not be concerned and should not respond to the unverified messages or forward them. If a person is found tp be circulating false messages, action will be initiated,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/covid-19-scare-social-media-flooded-with-unverified-messages/article31071182.ece

Retired judge of the Supreme Court Justice Jasti Chelameswar released ‘Sahiti Sowrabham,’ a compilation of literary articles in Telugu and Hindi written by A.P. Official Language Commission Chairman Yarlagadda Lakshmi Prasad, here on Saturday.

Justice Chelameswar complimented Prof. Lakshmi Prasad for striking a productive balance between literature and politics.

He had successfully made literature his way of life and became a bridge between Telugu and Hindi, he said. Justice Chalameswar expressed his concern over language losing its primacy after computers began dominating all walks of life. Recalling the movement against Hindi in the past, he said it was not against the language but apprehensions over its domination. Learning languages would enrich life.

Prof. Lakshmi Prasad said he took up Hindi translation as a means of comparative study in literature. He expressed happiness in having a number of disciples in the nook and corner of the world to spread his views. He vowed to continue his endeavour in literature balancing it with politics.

The book released was organised by Lok Nayak Foundation at the Hindi Bhavan of Andhra University.

Professors Chandu Subba Rao and M. Mutyala Naidu introduced the books.

Dattatreya Patil Revoor, MLA, directed the officials of the Health Department to spread awareness on COVID-19 in the districts on a war footing as a suspicious case is enough to create panic among citizens.

“Based on feedback on the precautionary measures taken by the government, we will take a call after a week on the steps to be taken to prevent the spread of the disease,” he said and added that the State has sought help from the Union government in preventing the spread of the virus.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-govt-will-present-basava-award-to-puttappa-shortly-cm/article31076108.ece
153,2020/03/15,Examinations for high school students to be deferred,"SSLC and II PU examinations will take place as scheduled

The Department of Primary and Secondary Education on Sunday instructed schools to defer examinations for students of classes seven, eight, and nine across the State until March 31. This will be applicable to schools across boards. The government had initially announced that schools could conduct examinations for these classes, but not classes.

The department said that this was a precautionary measure to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. So far seven persons have tested positive for the virus, including the 76-year-old man from Kalaburagi who died on March 12. “The revised dates will be scheduled after taking stock of the situation,” said the department in an order.

While welcoming the decision to defer the examination in the interest of the safety of students, some school managements, however, said it may not be feasible to conduct the examination after March 31 as the teachers and staff would be busy conducting SSLC examination.

The department has once again reiterated that the SSLC and the II PU examination will take place as per the schedule.

Last week, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar had announced that summer vacation would begin for students of Class 1 to 6, and that they would be graded on their earlier assessments.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/examinations-for-high-school-students-to-be-deferred/article31076102.ece
154,2020/03/15,All courts in Karnataka will hear only urgent cases from March 16,"This is to prevent spread of COVID-19 by avoiding large gatherings

The Karnataka High Court and all the courts in districts and taluks across the State will take up only urgent cases for hearing from March 16 to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by avoiding gathering of litigants, lawyers, visitors, and court staff in large numbers on the court premises.

“Having regard to the safety of all the litigants, lawyers, visitors to the court premises and the court staff, and with a view to assisting the efforts made by both the Central and the State Governments to prevent spread of COVID-19, the Chief Justice has issued several directions,” it has been stated in the communications published on High Court’s website on Sunday.

Though the cause lists would be issued as usual and sittings of courts will commence regularly at 10.30 a.m., only those cases on the cause list, which are stated to be urgent by the members of the Bar or the parties-in-person would be taken up at the discretion of the court, it has been stated in the communication.

The non-urgent cases, in the High Court and the courts in districts and taluks, would be taken up provided, all the contesting parties on both the sides consent for taking up the matters, and in other cases the dates would be assigned as per the discretion of the concerned courts.

In the courts in districts and taluks, the recording of evidence of witnesses shall be postponed except in exceptional cases. However, videoconferencing can be resorted to for this purposes, it has been stated in the communication.

In the High Court, visitors (except members of the Bar) will be subjected to thermal screening by officials of the State Health Department from March 17, and the staff would be subjected to thermal screening in High Court’s offices.

Both the members of the Bar and the staff have been advised to follow the advisory issued by the Health authorities. Meanwhile, the court staff who are showing the symptoms, as disclosed in the advisory have been asked to immediately consult the Health Department officials, and in emergent cases, contact Arogya Sahayavani through phone – 104. The communication also made it clear that no functions of the legal services authority or the courts should be conducted with a large number of gathering, and new court buildings should be occupied without formal functions, which could be held later if necessary.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/auu9ma/article31076091.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/all-courts-in-state-will-hear-only-urgent-cases-from-march-16/article31076092.ece
155,2020/03/15,Vegetable dealers keep away from wholesale markets,"Misinformation and State’s attempt to close markets have hit our business, says a trader

The fear of being infected by COVID-19 has kept vegetable dealers away from wholesale markets, leading to a drop in prices in the Belagavi Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard.

Around 4,500 tonnes of 60 vegetables are dumped in the yard every morning. The tonnage increases two days a week when potatoes and brinjal are brought in. Supplies arrive from different villages in Belagavi and some surrounding districts of Maharashtra. Horticulture farmers in Belagavi district alone produce around 2,000 tonnes of vegetables per day on around 3 lakh hectares of land.

Onion forms the largest lot of the vegetables received in the yard. Between 500 and 700 tonnes of onions are procured and sold by evening. Bidding starts early morning and ends by noon. However, in the last two days, there has been reduced buying from dealers. On an average day, dealers from Goa buy around 300 tonnes of vegetables from the Belagavi APMC yard.

“Various vegetables have suffered a fall in prices between 30-50%,” said Suresh Pujari, a trader. “Our daily transaction is around ₹ 3 lakh. But we have not been able to sell goods worth more than ₹60,000 per day in two days now,” he said. He feels that misinformation about COVID-19 and the State government’s attempt to close markets and advisory against large gatherings have hit their trade.

“People know that the virus does not spread by eating vegetables. But they are afraid of coming to places like markets where people gather in large numbers,” he said.

Ravikumar Langoti, another trader, said they would suffer losses, as would retail sellers and vendors in the vegetable markets in the city if the same situation prevailed for more than a week.

Azad Desai, a horticulture farmer from M. Mallapur near Gokak, said that he has let his sheep graze in his one-acre cabbage field as he has suffered huge losses. The cost of harvest and transportation is more than the price we are getting at the vegetable mundi, he told The Hindu.

He said most vegetable farmers were suffering losses, due to fall in prices. A few large farmers can absorb the losses. Others will continue to suffer. We will not have enough money to take up cultivation in the kharif season, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9tmmrs/article31076073.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGAPMC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vegetable-dealers-keep-away-from-wholesale-markets/article31076075.ece
156,2020/03/15,"We are not the competent authority to allot site to Rajeshwari Gaikwad, says Vijayapura Commissioner","Rajeshwari Gaikwad was promised site, ₹25 lakh four years ago

The issue of the Vijayapura Municipal Corporation’s promise of a plot and ₹25 lakh to international cricketer Rajeshwari Gaikwad has taken a new twist now, with the Municipal Commissioner expressing the civic body’s inability to allot any site to her.

A story about the corporation’s failure to offer the site and the cash reward by the government to Ms. Gaikwad was carried in The Hindu on March 9.

Responding to the report, Corporation Commissioner Harsha Shetty has termed the resolution passed by the corporators as ‘illegal’.

Speaking to The Hindu, he made it clear that since the corporation was not a competent authority to grant any site, it could not offer any residential plot to anyone.

“I really have no idea how the resolution was passed in the first place. Before passing any such resolution, prior discussion on the possibilities and limitations of the corporation should have taken place. But nothing of that sort had happened,” he said.

“Sites can be offered only by the Vijayapura Development Authority or the Karnataka Housing Board and that too only after getting government permission and clearing the legal requirements. Since the corporation has no provision for allotting sites, the question of plot allotment does not arise,” Mr. Shetty said.

However, he clarified that to help the cricketer, the corporation could announce a cash award. “Once the new council of the corporation is formed, a new resolution announcing the cash award can be passed,” he said.

But that is unlikely to happen immediately as the tenure of the council has ended and the government is yet to announce dates for electing the new body.

Prakash Rathod, Congress MLC, had raised the issue of Ms. Gaikwad during Zero Hour of the ongoing Legislature session on March 12 and had pointed out that her family members, who live in a rented house in Vijayapura, were yet to receive any help from the State government, even after four years after the announcement of the reward.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dyho/article31080422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGRAJESHWARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/site-to-cricketer-not-possible-corporation-commissioner/article31074777.ece
157,2020/03/15,Tiger tranquilised for treatment in Kodagu dies while being shifted to Mysuru zoo,"A tiger which was suspected to be injured and was immobile in a coffee plantation abutting the borders of Nagarahole National Park and Virajpet in Kodagu was tranquilised for treatment but died while being shifted to the Mysuru zoo on Saturday night.

The tiger was first sighted by the local people who informed the forest department staff in Virajpet. Though there was a commotion in the area, the tiger remained still for a long time raising suspicion that it may have injured itself, probably in a territorial fight and hence was not able to move.

Mr. Shivashankar, Deputy Conservator of Forests, Virajpet said they received the information around 1.30 p.m. on Saturday and it was observed that the tiger remained immobile for a long time despite the presence of people around it.

“We suspected it was injured and sought permission from the PCCF (Wildlife) and followed the standard operating procedure for its capture. It was tranquilised and was in the process of being shifted to the Mysuru Zoo for treatment but died enroute’’, he added.

The tiger was a male aged around 9 to 10 years and though its canines were intact, one of it was corroded. Mr.S hivashankar said the tiger’s hind limbs seemed to be weak and during the operation it used to drag itself forward to evade capture. Post-mortem reports will indicate whether the tiger had injured itself in a territorial fight or whether the injury was due to other causes.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tiger-tranquilised-for-treatment-in-kodagu-dies-while-being-shifted-to-mysuru-zoo/article31074012.ece
158,2020/03/15,"Karnataka CM attends grand wedding, despite restrictions due to COVID-19","Yediyurappa had advised people to postpone weddings till the threat passed off, or to restrict the number of guests to around 100

Despite issuing an order banning large gathering, including lavish weddings, Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa attended the grand marriage celebrations of the daughter of BJP MLC Mahantesh Kavatagimath in Belagavi on Sunday.

The Chief Minister had advised people to postpone weddings till the COVID-19 scare passed off, or to restrict the number of guests to around 100. But the wedding on the lawns of Shagun gardens in the Udyambag industrial area in Belagavi had many more times the number of visitors.

A police officer on duty at the venue estimated the crowd to be over 3,000.

The large gathering was in clear defiance of the government order and the Chief Minister’s appeal. But Mr. Yediyurappa’s presence seems to have vindicated this act.

Hundreds of cars were parked on both sides of the Khanapur road, outside the venue which was decorated with flowers, buntings, rolls of paper and colourful cloth. Two huge banners about preventing the spread of COVID-19 have been put up at the venue. There are wash basins at two ends and several hand sanitiser counters across the ground.

Apart from Union Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi, and ministers Srimanth Patil and MLA Mahesh Kumthalli, there were several leaders from the BJP, the Congress and the JD(S) who attended the marriage. There were some officers from the city corporation and district administration among the guests.

The Chief Minister arrived around 11 a.m. and stayed for nearly an hour at the venue. He left after wishing the couple and greeting some leaders.

On his arrival, at the Sambra airport, Mr. Yediyurappa said the State was well-equipped to handle the spread of the infection. “Over one lakh have been tested. Among the 100 suspected cases, the virus was detected only in six persons. One person has died. But otherwise the situation is under control. Officers are working round the clock,’’ he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/e7ppzg/article31073952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Yediyurappa,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-cm-attends-grand-wedding-despite-restrictions-due-to-covid-19/article31073810.ece

The accused duo had spread false information that a girl from Nanjangud and a man from Kabbali village in Gundlupet taluk had tested positive for COVID-19.

The posts shared by the accused contained bold and highlighted text with pictures that had been morphed on the screenshots of a private television channel footage to lend it a stamp of credibility.

160,2020/03/15,COVID-19 | Karnataka starts screening international passengers in three risk categories,"11 new patients quarantined in State on Saturday

Although no positive COVID-19 case was reported from the State on Saturday, the government has intensified screening all international passengers at airports by classifying them into three risk categories.

All passengers who are symptomatic on arrival fall under risk category 1, and those aged above 60 and have co-morbidities fall under category 2. Those who fall in both these categories are being quarantined at designated facilities for 14 days from arrival.

Asymptomatic passengers arriving from any of the COVID-19 affected countries will fall under category 3 and will be advised to be under strict home quarantine for 14 days, Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said here.

On Saturday, 11 new patients were quarantined in various hospitals in Bengaluru, Dakshina Kannada, Chikkamagaluru, Udupi, and Bidar. A total of 32 patients are isolated in the State as on Saturday. Of the 731 sample collected for testing, 590 have tested negative and the reports of the rest are awaited.

Positive cases recovering

The five positive cases under quarantine at Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases and Jayanagar General Hospital are responding to treatment and recovering fast. They are being treated with anti-viral drug Tamiflu and other supportive medicine. “Although some doctors elsewhere are treating positive cases with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) drugs used on HIV patients, we are not following that method,” the Minister said.

Meanwhile, with the Centre bringing masks and hand sanitisers under the Essential Commodities Act, the Karnataka government will soon notify the Central order in its official gazette, said Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education.

162,2020/03/15,"COVID-19: Hampi, key attractions in Kodagu among places closed for a week","Golden Chariot’s March 22 trip stands cancelled

The tourism sector continues to face a blow this holiday season, with most travellers putting off plans by choosing to stay safe in the light of COVID-19 threat and some key heritage places such as Hampi being closed for a week as part of precautionary measure. The restrictions on entry of visitors to India has also contributed to the low footfall.

Tourist attractions in Kodagu too will be closed for a week.

Ballari Deputy Commissioner S.S. Nakul ordered the closure of heritage sites in Hampi exercising powers vested under Section 144(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Deputy Commissioner and the District Magistrate issued the order on Saturday banning the entry of all tourists between 6 a.m. of March 15 and 6 a.m. of March 22.

Since the monuments in Hampi have been recognised as a World Heritage Site by the UNESCO, there is heavy footfall of foreign and local tourists, many of whom arrive at the location without undergoing the 14-day compulsory quarantine, Mr. Nakul said.

Kodagu will also see main tourism attractions shut from Sunday for a week, including Raja Seat in Madikeri and Cauvery Nisargadhama near Kushalnagar. Footfall had fallen hugely in Kodagu since January after COVID-19 cases were reported from Kerala. Occupancy rates in resorts and homestays had come down to less than 20% owing to cancellation of bookings.

Two back-to-back calamities in the district had badly affected tourism and the stakeholders, who had been facing continuous losses, had sought aid from the government for dealing with the situation.

Entry of tourists, both Indian and foreign, to the historical Brindavan Gardens and the Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary has been banned for an indefinite period owing to the COVID-19 scare. Mandya Deputy Commissioner M.V. Venkatesh issued the closure order on Friday night. Both places attract lakhs of visitors annually.

The Vijayapura district administration has also banned the entry of visitors to historical monuments, including Gol Gumbaz and Ibrahim Roza.

Districts to take a call

The State government has given powers to the district administration to take a call on shutting down tourism destinations. Minister for Tourism C.T. Ravi told The Hindu that the government had been sharing health bulletins from the Centre and the State, and it was up to the district administration to decide on whether tourism spots should be open or not.

“Only large gatherings have been suspended. But if the districts want to take a precautionary measure and close tourism spots, it is their call. They have all been advised to follow basic processes such as use of masks and sanitisers,” he added.

The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), on the other hand, has not announced closure of any monuments as of now. Shivakant Bajpai, Superintending Archaeologist, ASI, Bengaluru Circle, said that “as of now”, monuments under the Bengaluru Circle will remain open despite lower footfall. The temples at Belur and Halebid, ASI monuments, were open to tourists on Saturday.

The Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation (KSTDC) properties too continue to remain operational. KSTDC managing director Kumar Pushkar said its properties were open, but had registered extremely low occupancy rates of 26%.

The outbreak has, however, led to the cancellation of the debut run of luxury train Golden Chariot, which was scheduled for March 22.

163,2020/03/15,"II PU student spreads rumour about question paper leak, gets caught","A paper leak rumour ahead of Saturday’s Computer Science II pre-university examination sent PUE Department officials and the police into a tizzy on Friday night. They finally traced the rumour to an 18-year-old II PU student, who had allegedly called up the board helpline and told them that the Computer Science paper had been leaked.

According to the police, the accused is a student at a private college in Jayanagar. “He called up the helpline and said the question paper was trending on social media and on WhatsApp,” said a police officer.

Panicked officials alerted the police, who formed a special team and tracked the student down. He was brought to the police station along with his parents for questioning. The accused reportedly confessed that he made the hoax call as he had not prepared well for the paper. Inquiries also revealed that the student had started circulating messages saying that the question paper had been leaked and that a fresh question paper should be issued by the department. “He thought that by doing this, the exam would be postponed and he would get more time to prepare,” the officer said.

Officials traced the number from where the message originated. A complaint was registered with the Bengaluru North police. As the student was a minor, the police did not arrest him. They released him after recording his statement and counselling his parents.

The PUE Department, however, took strong exception to the matter and did not allow him to sit for the exam. “We wanted to send out a message that this would not be tolerated. But keeping his future in mind, we have only debarred him from this exam. He can write the supplementary exam,” said DPUE director M. Kanagavalli.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ii-pu-student-spreads-rumour-about-question-paper-leak-gets-caught/article31071058.ece
164,2020/03/15,"Rail museum is back on fresh, gleaming tracks in Mysuru","The Mysuru rail museum, renovated and expanded at a cost of ₹9 crore, was opened to the public on Saturday, adding a new heritage site of historical value to the city.

Providing an experience of the history and evolution of the Railways, starting from the steam era down to the modern times, the exhibits, including the steam locomotives and wagons, have been refurnished and restored aesthetically.

The renovated museum was inaugurated on Saturday by H. Ashwathnarayana, a long-serving employee of the museum, in the presence of Ajay Kumar Singh, general manager, South Western Railway, Aparna Garg, Divisional Railway Manager, and other officials of SWR.

The Maharani’s Pavilion, housing the vintage saloon used by the maharanis of the Wadiyar dynasty, was inaugurated by G. Mala, a veteran staff member of the rail museum. Originally, it was supposed to be inaugurated by Jamuna Bai, one of the members of the cleaning crew of the steam era, but she could not make it owing to illness.

Ms. Garg said the renovated museum was the Railways’ contribution to the heritage city of Mysuru. “We wanted to make it more experiential, rather than a collection of exhibits. The Indian Railways and the city of Mysuru have one thing in common — a lot of heritage — and the museum complements this,” she said.

Sumedha Sah, an architect from Bengaluru who was involved in the redesigning of the museum, said a lot of thought went into it and the few old structures were renovated and connected with the walking pathway. Each site is connected visually and spatially by the pathway, inspired by how the Railways has knitted the sub-continent. Likewise, the pathways link all the exhibits, she said.

Cafeteria and galleries

A metre gauge coach has been converted into a cafeteria while there is a coffee shop with a library, complete with literature and books related to the Railways. There are pictorial galleries tracing the evolution of the steam locomotive and diesel locomotive, while the old signalling contraptions used by the Railways have been painted and displayed in the signalling section along with other equipment.

The earlier exhibits have been refurbished and given a fresh coat of paint, while the audio-visual gallery with touch-screen monitors provides complete information about the museum but the Railways in general. The toy train and the Central Park station have been redone. The museum also has a website (www.mysururailmuseum.com).

165,2020/03/15,Steps to check rush at Bevco outlets,"Govt. rules out closure of bars, liquor shops

The government is weighing options to prevent overcrowding in front of State-owned liquor outlets.

It has come under severe criticism from the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) for permitting the sale of liquor amid a lockdown prompted by the COVID-19 outbreak.

Commissioner of Excise S. Aananthakrishnan is scheduled to chair a meeting with the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco) and other stakeholders on Monday to plot measures to ensure that public health is not compromised when people turn up at liquor outlets in large numbers.

An official said several courses of action are on the table. The options include opening more counters, implementing crowd-control measures outside outlets, and extending open hours by altering the liquor rules.

The idea is to create more space in front of outlets, a measure of social distancing to reduce the chances of the infection spreading through Bevco customers.

The government has ruled out clamping down on liquor sales and shutting down bars till the COVID-19 threat recedes.

To check illegal liquor

Officials said they fear a surge in the sale of bootleg alcohol if the purchase of legal liquor is banned.

The State has also received counsel that total prohibition during the outbreak could open the door for the entry of toxic liquor and spirits and brews of dubious quality into the State’s massive market for alcohol.

The government was unwilling to run the risk of a possible liquor tragedy at the time of the public health crisis.

Excise Minister T.P. Ramakrishnan told journalists in Kozhikode on Saturday that the pandemic situation in the State was under control and the case did not warrant the closure of bars and Bevco outlets.

However, several health experts flag the possibility that crowded liquor outlets could accelerate the spread of the virus.

Giving a major relief to health authorities, the throat swab samples collected from two persons who died while in home quarantine have been tested negative for COVID-19. They both were secondary contacts of COVID-19 patients.

While the first sample belonged to a person from Chengalam who died two days ago, the other sample belonged to a relative of the COVID-19 patient at Ranni in Pathanamthitta. Post-mortem examinations were held on the bodies at the Government Medical College (GMC) Hospital here.

Meanwhile, the authorities here on Sunday sent five more samples for tests. With the Health Department recommending home quarantine to 72 more persons, the total number of persons in isolation rose to 1,179.

Further, a man who had returned from Dubai recently, was admitted to the special isolation ward at the GMC.

The officials also identified one primary contact and a secondary contact of one of the COVID-19 patients here. So far, the authorities have identified 128 primary contacts and 458 secondary contacts in the district.

As many as 28 teams, each comprising a junior health inspector, junior health nurse and police officer, have been deployed at the bus and railway stations to screen the passengers.

167,2020/03/15,Two Spaniards under quarantine,"They were picked up from a KSRTC bus on their way to Munnar

Kuravilangadu town here on Sunday witnessed high drama when a joint team of police and Health Department officials intercepted a KSRTC bus headed for Munnar and shifted two Spanish nationals on board to a hospital.

The drama began to unfold around 1 p.m. when the Spanish nationals, a woman and a man, reached the KSRTC bus station here. Though the KSRTC officials asked them to appear for a medical examination, they refused to cooperate and boarded a bus to the hill station.

By the time District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu was apprised of the incident, the bus had left Kottayam. Soon, a direction was issued to trace down the duo and accordingly, a police team intercepted the bus and forced the tourists to get off the vehicle.

Though the tourists insisted on continuing the journey, the health officials eventually succeeded in convincing them about the necessity to serve the isolation period.

They were then shifted to the government hospital at Kuravilangadu for a primary examination.

Observation for 14 days

“The duo exhibited no symptoms of the virus infection though we have decided to keep them under observation for 14 days at the Pala General Hospital,” said Jacob Varghese, district medical officer

According to him, a situation report by the World Health Organisation mentioned Spain as one of the worst COVID-19 affected countries . “The Spaniards have reportedly reached Kerala about a week ago and visited different places before reaching Kottayam. They are being kept in quarantine considering the possibility of local transmission of the virus through them,” the DMO said.

Earlier in the day, the police had intercepted an Italian tourist who had reached the Kottayam bus station from Wagamon and sent him for an examination.

168,2020/03/15,Curbs on foreigners,"Restrictions in Munnar till March 31

The district administration has imposed a curb on foreign tourists in Munnar till March 31. The tourists from outside the State will have to undergo tests to prove that they are COVID-19 negative if they have to be admitted to home stays and resorts in Munnar. The administration took the decision after a COVID-19-positive U.K. citizen left a Munnar resort, Tea County, and reached the Nedumbassery airport on Sunday.

List of tourists

Idukki District Collector H. Dinesan, after an emergency meeting convened by Electricity Minister M.M. Mani at Munnar, told The Hindu that a list of tourists, including foreigners, staying at Munnar would be collected and no further bookings by foreigners would be allowed.

The meeting decided to prepare a list of persons who stayed at the homestays and resorts at Munnar.

Strict action would be initiated against those resorts and homestays that violated the directions of the administration.

A squad consisting of political representatives, cultural leaders and officials of government departments would be formed and awareness campaign would be held at Munnar.

All protection would be given to already admitted guests and if any symptoms of the disease were found, it should be informed to health workers.

The samples of those who interacted with the U.K. citizen would be collected and sent for medical tests. It was confirmed that all in the group stayed at Tea County.

A special team of Health Department officials would conduct check on border check-posts and roads.

Mr. Dinesan said that the list of primary and secondary contacts of the tourists who stayed at Tea County would be prepared. Those in the primary contacts’ list would be quarantined.

Isolation wards were ready at the Chithirapuram Primary Health Centre and those staying at the resorts and homestays could opt for it.

Tea County closed

Meanwhile, the district administration closed the Tea County resort.

Mr. Dinesan said that there had been lapse on the part of the resort in informing the district administration about it and taking timely action. The police are questioning the manager who allowed the tourists to leave the resort.

169,2020/03/15,COVID-19 containment depends largely on public compliance,"As COVID-19 challenges the capacity and efficiency of the State’s health system, the success of all containment and subsequent mitigation efforts will depend on how compliant the public are to adapting behavioural changes which will minimise transmission of the virus in the community.

Though Kerala is preparing itself for the long haul to battle SARS CoV-2, inadvertent lapses in surveillance and the inability of the system to convince people on the merits of home quarantine/self-isolation to counter virus transmission are bringing forth new challenges daily. Public health professionals are worried that the State may lose grip on the window of opportunity for the containment of COVID-19, given the strain the health system infrastructure is being put to. In the past three days, Kerala has added on an average 1,500 to 2,000 people daily to its surveillance network.

“We have been investing heavily in human resources, time and effort in the surveillance and the subsequent contact tracing exercise, which is indeed a crucial part of the containment activity. But every time some systemic lapses happen or people wilfully try to escape surveillance and quarantine, it puts an additional burden on the system, which is already under much strain,” a senior Health official pointed out.

Practical public health should account for the vagaries in human behaviour which might trump the system’s best laid-out plans. Health officials are disappointed that despite their massive IEC efforts — every person coming in to the designated corona clinics for screening is sent back with printed literature on dos and don’ts — home quarantine/self-isolation efforts have been failing miserably.

More efforts

Failed home quarantine (if people have been freely mingling with family/friends or moving about freely in society, instead of isolating oneself in self-contained rooms) means more people having to be isolated in hospitals and more efforts at contact tracing in the community.

“At this rate, we will soon need more hospital beds, human resources and materials. The COVID-19 isolation wards are being run alongside the regular hospital work and the health-care staff are quite overworked. Caring for patients for hours in sweltering heat, wearing the full protective gear, is quite taxing,” a senior doctor at the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) said.

All available government hospital beds in both modern medicine and AYUSH systems would be utilised.

Vulnerable sections

If this outbreak gets out of hand, the health-care requirements of the vulnerable sections — the elderly, dialysis patients and those with chronic conditions like cancer — would also go for a toss.

“At this point, we estimate that we may just have a short window of opportunity — two to three weeks at the most — for the containment of the virus. As of now, we are able to trace every reported positive case back to the point of contact. As of now, we have no documented evidence of community spread. It is human behaviour which will determine the course of COVID-19 outbreak in Kerala in the coming days,” a senior Health official said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a2p3h1/article31076528.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16TVTVCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-containment-depends-largely-on-public-compliance/article31076529.ece
170,2020/03/15,Kannur ups vigil against COVID-19,"Collector convenes meeting of religious leaders; public functions to be stopped

In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it has been decided to cancel all public functions in the district.

The decision was taken at a meeting of religious leaders convened by District Collector T.V. Subhash in the wake of a person testing positive for COVID-19 in the district.

Collector’s warning

The Collector pointed out that contact between people should be reduced to prevent the spread of the disease. “It takes just a few seconds to transmit the coronavirus from one carrier to another,” he observed.

“If the virus spreads to more people, things will go wrong,” he warned.

District panchayat president K.V. Sumesh pointed out that there were complaints that some of the residents in home quarantine had gone out and met others. There should be a collective effort on the part of everyone,” he said

Religious leaders informed that rituals at temples, theyyams, feasts, special prayer ceremonies and other religious functions had been stopped. People had been asked to postpone wedding ceremonies, they added.

The Collector noted that some churches had started live-streaming of prayers.

Those who come from affected areas should not participate in religious ceremonies. Only close relatives should attend funerals and perform rituals quickly.

171,2020/03/15,Chirakkal Chira to get a fresh lease of life soon,"Dredging work to desilt one of the biggest man-made tanks in Asia under way

Constructed over three centuries ago, the Chirakkal Chira, said to be one of the biggest man-made tanks in Asia, is all set to get a fresh lease of life.

The dredging work to desilt the Chira began recently with a large number of people gathering around the Chira, which was completely dried after the water was pumped out.

It turned out to be exciting as people took turns to catch fish from the Chira. However, for many others, the cleaning of the Chira had been a long-pending demand, which is finally getting materialised.

About 318 metres long and 150 metres wide, the Chira is spread over 14.70 acres. The private tank is owned by Chirakkal Kovilakam. It can serve as a huge reservoir and help increase the water table in the region. However, lack of maintenance and continuous inflow of drainage water polluted the Chira, said Ravindra Varma Raja, a member of Chirakkal Kovilakam. “It was not possible for the family to maintain the tank,” he added. However, the Kovilakam also did not want to hand it over to the government.

Though the panchayat was in talks with Chirakkal family members since 2016, the project to clean the tank was submitted two years ago and the Irrigation Department took over the work to dredge it, said A. Soman, president, Chirakkal Panchayat. It was a long-pending demand of people to clean the Chira and make it a reservoir or use it for drinking purposes. But since it was a private tank, there was difficulty in sanctioning government fund for dredging work, he said. But the funds were finally approved considering the importance of the facility.

Sindhu, Assistant Engineer, Irrigation Department, said that a fund of over ₹2 crore had been sanctioned for dredging and other works. Permission had been given to remove silt of upto 80 centimetres in depth. Besides, parapet would be constructed around the tank to prevent drain water entering it. The work had been awarded to a private contractor and it would take about a year’s time. However, the contractor had been instructed to complete the dredging work before the monsoon, she added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/zc0pn0/article31076465.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12krchirakkalchirajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/chirakkal-chira-to-get-a-fresh-lease-of-life-soon/article31076466.ece
172,2020/03/15,ASI turns a blind eye to Bekal Fort conservation,"Outer walls damaged over 9 months ago yet to be restored

The negligence towards the conservation of Bekal Fort by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has left conservationists and tourists disappointed.

It has been over nine months since the outer walls of the bastion on the northeastern side of the fort got damaged in rain. However, the ASI, which is entrusted with the conservation of the cultural monument, has turned a blind eye to it. No steps have been taken to restore the walls, which is about 10 metres high and seven-metre wide. The mud plastering and laterite stones have collapsed.

Saifudheen Kalanad, social activist and general secretary of Bekal Tourism Organisation, said it was unfortunate that the walls still remained collapsed and tree roots were further causing damage to them.

“Despite the Central government allocating huge amounts for conservation work, no steps were taken to restore the walls for almost a year. They may completely come down at any time,” he said. With monsoon just a few months away, rain could heavily damage the bastion, he added. “It was surprising to see that so much of work has been undertaken to beautify the fort from inside. However, the walls, which guard the fort, are left to fall apart,” said Vinay Kumar, a tourist from Karnataka. The government had the responsibility to restore them on war footing, he added.

Apparently, at least two bastions, on east and north sides, have been closed for tourists for the past several months. On an average, 600 tourists visit the fort every day, while the number increases to 3,000 during weekends.

When contacted, K.P. Mohandas, superintending archaeologist, ASI, said the work would be carried out by the next financial year.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/w4fy2/article31076461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12krbekalfortjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/asi-turns-a-blind-eye-to-bekal-fort-conservation/article31076462.ece
173,2020/03/15,430 under home quarantine,"Collector urges people to comply with home quarantine norms

A total of 430 people who came from different parts of the world since February 25 have been placed under home quarantine in the district, according to District Collector P.B. Noohu.

Mr. Noohu said these people had come from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Doha, Georgia, Germany, Italy, Jidda, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, the U.K., Muscat, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Nepal, Oman Qatar, Riyadh, Russia, Salalah, Sharjah, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and the United States of America.

Ninety-one of them are from Dubai, 65 from Saudi Arabia, 48 from Quatar, 46 from Kuwait, and 35 are from Abu Dhabi.

Those who came from the worst-hit areas of COVID-19-affected countries will have to undergo 28 days’ quarantine period. Those from other countries will have to remain under home quarantine for 14 days.

The Collector asked the general public to pass on information to DISHA office (Phone: 1056) in the event of finding any person failing to comply with the quarantine.

174,2020/03/15,Virus scare no deterrent for grand wedding,"Health squad members abused for trying to control guests

The Health Department, engaged in a massive exercise to prevent the spread of COVID-19, had to face an unanticipated crisis on Sunday — families going ahead with grand weddings.

Despite strict instructions from the district administration to restrict the number of attendees, a wedding solemnised at Kollam Town Hall saw a large gathering of guests. The Corporation health squad members, who arrived on the venue to control the inflow of guests, were allegedly abused and manhandled by the relatives. “While many families are conducting just the ceremony in the presence of close relatives, some others are causing a huge health risk by throwing lavish weddings. If a single guest tests positive for COVID-19, all others will have to be quarantined,” an official said.

Many calls

According to the Corporation authorities, they got in touch with the person who booked the hall on Saturday and instructed the family to conduct the wedding in a simple manner with minimal guests. “We all know there is a ban on mass gatherings and the public is expected to cooperate. We had contacted them before the wedding to ensure this, but on the day of the wedding we received many calls about the crowd at Town Hall,” he said.

After reaching the hall, the officials, including Corporation secretary, closed the gate and blocked the entry, much to the annoyance of the family, who reportedly had made arrangements for hosting 2,000 guests. “More than 500 persons were already inside the hall when we reached and we tried to restrict the entry of more people. We were heckled and verbally abused while we were trying to do our duty,” he said.

Following the incident, the hall was locked after the wedding and permission was denied to conduct the reception scheduled for the evening. The Kollam Corporation secretary has filed a complaint with District Collector, Assistant Commissioner of Police, and District Medical Officer demanding legal action against those involved.

Many weddings conducted in the district on Sunday had restricted the number of guests below fifty and all related events and celebrations were called off. Health officials said they were keeping a close tab on all auditoriums and inspections would be held on the coming days too.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/57h00l/article31076437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tvko-Marriagerestricted2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/virus-scare-no-deterrent-for-grand-wedding/article31076438.ece
175,2020/03/15,Construction of Hill Highway protection walls complete,"Highway cuts through Punalur, Anchal, and Kulathupuzha

The construction of protection walls along the sides of the 46.1-km stretch of the Hill Highway cutting through Kollam has been completed. The huge walls have been constructed at two places that include the beginning of highway near Punalur KSRTC depot and Madathara Junction.

The 75-m-long and 4-m-high wall at Punlaur was constructed after expanding the one-way road parallel to the Punalur national highway.

Eastern parts

The wall at Madathara is 15-m long and 8-m high. The completion of the Hill Highway is crucial in expediting the development of eastern parts of the district and according to officials, the construction will be over by August. Currently, first round of tarring has been completed for 45.2 km while a stretch of 11.5 km has been spread with the last finishing layer.

So far 150 culverts, a 17-km drain, and a protection wall covering an 8-km stretch have been constructed as part of the project.

It also involved procurement of 40 acres of puramboke land and the development of junctions on the highway.

The construction began in August 2018 with Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) providing ₹201.67 crore for the project.

The Kerala State Electricity Board and the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) had also sanctioned nearly ₹10 crore for the shifting of electric poles and pipelines supplying drinking water.

The portion of 1,250-km Hill Highway in Kollam links KSRTC Junction at Punalur to Agasathyacodu and also goes from Alencherry Junction to Challimukku through Kulathupuzha and Madathara.

Starting from Kaliyakkavila in Thiruvananthapuram, it cuts through the major hilly areas like Punalur, Anchal, and Kulathupuzha in the district.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/construction-of-hill-highway-protection-walls-complete/article31076429.ece
176,2020/03/15,PWD opens newly built culvert for vehicular traffic,"MLA decries official delay in shifting electric posts

The Public Works Department (PWD) has thrown open the newly constructed culvert on the Kuttoor-Manackachira road for vehicular traffic on Sunday.

However, the road development work was stopped abruptly a month ago owing to the inordinate delay in shifting a few electric posts from the middle of the road to the wayside, despite the decision taken in this regard at a meeting convened by Electricity Minister M.M. Mani earlier.

The local MLA, Mathew T. Thomas, told The Hindu that he had already taken up the matter with the KSEB higher-ups against the backdrop of the lackadaisical and irresponsible act of the authorities concerned in complying with the directions issued even by the Electricity Minister.

Mr. Thomas said the government had launched the work on the Kuttoor-Manackachira-Kizhakkan Muthoor-Muthoor Link Road development project, funded by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), 16 months ago with a gestation period of 18 months that ends in May.

The MLA said the local people had voluntarily surrendered the land required for widening the road to 10 m. The disruption of the road development work owing to the delay on the part of a government agency in shifting a few electric posts could never be justified, he said.

He said the government departments and agencies should work in unison to ensure time-bound completion of various development projects launched by the State.

The Changanacherry-based Palathra Constructions that has undertaken the ₹26.8-crore project has already completed almost 85% of the road work on the 8-km Kuttoor-Kizhakkan Muthoor stretch.

The raising and resurfacing of the road could be completed in two weeks, once KSEB shifted the electric posts.

The MLA has called upon the KSEB and PWD officials concerned to sort out the issues, if any, over shifting of the posts and facilitate a conducive atmosphere for completing the road development project as scheduled.

Canal shutters

Kuttoor grama panchayat president Sreelekha Reghunath has called upon the irrigation wing of the Water Resources Department to take immediate steps to install steel shutters on the riverside portion of the culvert for regulating the flow of water through the canal that connects the Manimala river with the Madhurampuzha wetland.

Villagers’ worry is that the new culvert sans shutters for regulating the canal water flow will leave the region highly vulnerable to more aggressive floods during the monsoon.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9g0edn/article31076416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tvpt-culvert1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pwd-opens-newly-built-culvert-for-vehicular-traffic/article31076417.ece
177,2020/03/15,Kumarakom on total lockdown,"It is hit due to proximity to Chengalam, where two were tested COVID-19 positive

Sailing through the canals of Kumarakom can normally be a struggle for a tourist for most of March. It’s peak tourism season and all water bodies in this village, nestled in the backwater landscape of Kottayam, would normally be heaving with visitors from abroad.

But the usual lines of tourists at the boat jetty here have all disappeared. The houseboats idle along the canal banks while the local businesses have shut shop. A destination that receives over seven million visitors annually, Kumarakom is now ghastly empty.

According to officials with the Tourism Department, the outbreak of COVID-19 has dealt a huge blow to this internationally acclaimed backwater destination, which was on the track to recovery from the setbacks caused by the floods of the past two years. The destination has witnessed a total cancellation of hotel and holiday packages while a zero-demand situation is likely to extend over the next month as well.

“While the tourism industry across the State is on a rapid retreat, Kumarakom is the worst hit, considering its proximity to Chengalam, where two persons were tested COVID-19 positive and several people are under quarantine,” an official said.

Though the village received a fairly good number of foreigners last month, the disease outbreak has caused panic among the local people. “People are wary of interacting with guests, especially foreigners. A few days ago, they even forced a tour operator to cancel the house boat rides for foreign guests at a location near Vaikom,” he added.

Among the most affected are operators of the houseboats and small-sized shikara boats, who have huge bank loans to repay. All the 120-odd house boats and 58 small boats that operate out of Kumarakom for have been docked for over a week now.

“While the last two years have been particularly depressing, this must be the most extensive hit to the sector as this time, even a cut down in fare per hour is not working. The cancellations and zero bookings have forced the boat employees to take up casual work to make both ends meet,” said a houseboat owner.

Bookings cancelled

The local economy, primarily dependent on tourism, too reeling under the shock. The workers and artisans enlisted in the village life packages, restaurants offering ethnic cuisine, and the local transport operators have all witnessed a sharp fall in daily income.

Confirming the stoppage of bookings till March 31, K. Roopesh Kumar, coordinator, State RT Mission, said the bookings would be revived based on directions from the government. “We have received an advisory from the District Medical Board against the free movement of guests through the interiors as a precautionary measure against the spread of virus. Accordingly, the bookings for about 500 guests have been cancelled,” he said.

Arun Kumar K, secretary, Chamber of Vembanad Hotels and Resorts (CVHR), said the situation had been particularly severe for the middle and bottom-line operators. “With zero bookings, even the high-scale resorts are finding it difficult to meet their fixed costs. More than the fall in the global travel and tourism, what is even more depressing is the uncertainty of its impact on the sector,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mbvn0b/article31076410.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DSC9472copy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kumarakom-on-total-lockdown/article31076411.ece

According to District Collector P.B. Noohu, a total of 1,553 persons were subjected to screening on Sunday and two of them were found having symptoms of fever other than COVID-19.

Both of them were sent back after a detailed medical examination and first-aid at the Government Hospital at Pampa.

Mr. Noohu said digital infrared thermometers have been used for screening the people before permitting them to proceed to the holy hillock from Pampa in the wake of the COVID-19 threat. 1,250 persons home-quarantined.

Mr. Noohu said a total of 1,250 persons have been quarantined at their homes in different parts of the district as part of the ongoing intensive disease prevention drive against COVID-19.

Meanwhile, the surveillance teams of the Health Department have identified two more primary contacts of the infected people, who have been placed under isolation at the Pathanamthitta General Hospital.

A total of 29 persons, including the seven infected persons, have been admitted to the isolations wards at various hospitals in the district as on Sunday evening.

Of them, 22 are at the Pathanamthitta General Hospital, six at the District Hospital in Kozhencherry, and one person at the Pushpagiri Medical College in Thiruvalla.

The Collector said the throat swabs and blood samples of a total of 90 persons from the district have been sent to the Virology Laboratory in Alappuzha for clinical examination as on Sunday. Of this, nine have been tested positive and 40 others were tested negative.

Results of the remaining samples are expected in the next few days.

179,2020/03/15,Melody tops a multifaceted career,"A 1,000-odd songs have put Sreekumaran Thampi on the pantheon of accomplished lyricists. He turns 80 today

Sreekumaran Thampi turns 80 on Monday. The songs he has written – more than a thousand of them – will never age.

He is not just one of our most prolific lyricists but one of the finest as well.

To write more than a thousand songs is one thing, but to write those songs so well that they could be treated as poetry is quite another.

Thampi is more than a lyricist. He has also been a prolific director, scriptwriter and producer, but in those roles he has been surpassed by many. When it comes to writing songs, however, he has very few peers — Vayalar Ramavarma, P. Bhaskaran, and O.N.V. Kurup.

Those three legends are no more, but Thampi continues to write, though these aren’t exactly great times for songs in Malayalam cinema. He had debuted as a lyricist at a time when Vayalar and Bhaskaran were writing most of the songs, but the confident young civil engineer from Haripad was determined to seek his own place in showbiz.

After beginning his career with Kattumallika, in 1966, Chithramela announced his arrival, with songs like ‘Madam potti chirikkunna’... and ‘Akashadeepame.’ Devarajan had tuned those hits, but he told the young writer that he would rather continue working with Vayalar, with whom he had established one of the most melodious collaborations in Indian film music.

Thampi wasn’t deterred. He worked with composers like V. Dakshinamoorthy, M.K. Arjunan and M.S. Viswanathan and came up with one brilliant melody after another. Before long, Devarajan also resumed composing his lines.

Love and philosophy

When it comes to writing lines that speak so meaningfully of love and philosophy, Thampi has few equals.

And he has a knack to use the prettiest of words in Malayalam. Little wonder, we never get tired of his songs. Happy Birthday, Mr. Thampi!",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bil7d4/article31076370.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tv-Thampi-musiccol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/melody-tops-a-multifaceted-career/article31076372.ece

182,2020/03/15,Spotlight on poor health care,"A volunteer at Sabarimala died of heart attack on Thursday

Poor health-care facility at Sabarimala has been brought to focus yet again with the death of the 74-year-old Akhila Bharatha Ayyappa Seva Sanghom (ABASS) member Thanchavur Damodaran at the Sannidhanam on Thursday.

His death, for want of even first-aid facility, has drawn sharp criticism from all around.

The government hospitals at Sannidhanam and Pampa function only when the temple opens during the monthly puja as well as during the annual pilgrim season, making it a seasonal affair, says D. Vijayakumar, former vice president of ABASS.

Around 300 people, including the head priest (Melsanthi), construction workers, police personnel and other staff on deputation, are camping at Sabarimala round the year. Damodaran had fainted at the Sannidhanam on March 12 and die of cardiac failure before he was taken to a hospital in Pathanamthitta.

Earlier too, lives have been lost in Sabarimala because of lack of basic health care. On February 2, a worker, Krishna Pillai, too died of a heart attack before he could be brought to the hospital at Pathanamthitta. A worker on daily wages and an Excise Inspector suffered heart attack at Sabarimala in November 2008.

Both died on the way to the hospital situated 70 km from the Sannidhanam.

The then Devaswom Minister G. Sudhakaran had taken up the issue with the Health authorities, and it was decided to keep the government health-care centre at Sabarimala open throughout the year. However, the arrangement did not last long. The then Special Commissioner appointed by the Kerala High Court, too had submitted a report to the court, highlighting the grave need to provide permanent health-care facility.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/spotlight-on-poor-health-care/article31076141.ece
183,2020/03/15,Kerala tops NDRI study on dairy production,"States ranked on the basis of indicators

A recent study by the National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI), Karnal, on dairy production systems in the country has given Kerala the top spot overall among 20 milk-producing States.

The study, ‘Development and testing of potential indicators for evaluation of dairy production systems’, published in the November edition of the Indian Journal of Animal Sciences, ranked the States on the basis of six major indicators of dairy production.

Kerala stood first in three categories — animal breeding, resource availability and policies and regulations. The State was placed second in veterinary infrastructure; seventh in dairy production and eighth in value addition and marketing.

Alongside Punjab, Goa, Haryana, Gujarat and Rajasthan, Kerala was deemed to have a “dynamic” dairy production system, one of three State groupings which also included “transient” and “subsistent” systems.

Punjab second

Punjab, which topped the list for dairy production, has bagged the second spot overall. “Kerala ranked first in overall dairy production system index owing to its highest literacy rate in India, prompting the farmers to acquire more knowledge and awareness about the scientific dairy farming practices and further likely to adopt new technology. The government policies are quite favourable to dairy development. The State has highest crossbred to indigenous cattle ratio and highest AI performed per 1,000 breedable population,” the study noted.

The 20 States selected for the study contribute 98% of the total milk production of the country.

Rajesh Kumar Singh, Principal Secretary (Animal Husbandry, Dairy), expressed satisfaction at the study result, stating that it does convey a correct picture of the dairy scenario in Kerala.

“Obviously there is some way to go, particularly in areas such as productivity and self-sufficiency,” Mr. Singh said.

“The study shows that Kerala has come up as a model for the rest of the country, especially in matters like animal breeding, policies and availability of resources in the sector,” Jose James, Managing Director, Kerala Livestock Development Board (KLDB), said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-tops-ndri-study-on-dairy-production/article31076118.ece
184,2020/03/15,Govt. unlikely to tamper with college vacation pattern,"Lukewarm response of stakeholders to proposal

Reluctant to ruffle the feathers of the academic community, the government is going slow on its plan to implement a split vacation system in colleges.

The lukewarm response of the stakeholders to the proposal has made it almost certain that the two-month annual vacation pattern, i.e. from April to May, will continue.

Response

The Higher Education Department had sought the response of State universities towards the feasibility of replacing the existing system with a split pattern to schedule vacation for November and May.

The proposal was mooted by the Kerala State Higher Education Council, which maintained that the reform would maximise the mandatory number of teaching days in a semester and facilite the smooth conduct of examinations. It was envisaged to ensure a minimum of 450 contact hours distributed over 90 working days under the scheme. Citing the experiences of the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, where the system has been in place since 2002, and Mahatma Gandhi University, which implemented the split system for two years from the 2011-12 academic year, the council pointed out that the reform could clear backlog in the publication of results as well as eliminate teacher absenteeism in examination and valuation duties.

However, the proposal has not found favour among the majority of teaching and non-teaching staff in higher education institutions. Notably, no university except the Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit backed the proposal.

“Most universities have expressed their reservations on replacing the vacation pattern. Many cited the logistical difficulties that could arise by way of coordinating with a large number of affiliating colleges to implement the reform,” an official said.

No pressing need

Asserting that there existed no pressing need to overhaul the existing system, most universities also highlighted the progress attained towards meeting the government’s target of commencing the next academic year on June 1. Besides, there have been significant improvement in publishing examination results within stipulated deadlines under the current vacation system.

Other reasons that have been cited include the prevalence of water shortage that various parts of the State experienced during the months of April and May.

The government has opted against upsetting the existing arrangement and creating discontent among the stakeholders in the sector.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-unlikely-to-tamper-with-college-vacation-pattern/article31076093.ece
185,2020/03/15,Painful parting with their pets,"Rapid response teams cull ornamental pet birds too

Haris Rahman Kavungal, an ornamental poultry farmer at Parappanangadi, stayed away from his farm on Saturday as the rapid response teams of the Animal Husbandry Department killed 105 ornamental pet birds of his one by one.

Among them were turkeys, costly doves and pigeons, swans and several exotic fowls and ducks Mr. Rahman had procured from different places.

Painful

A businessman in the Gulf, Mr. Rahman said it would be too painful for him to see his pets being culled.

Even the rapid response team members did not hide their anguish as Mr. Rahman let them do their job without a single word of protest.

“It is so anguishing for me, but it is the government protocol for avian flu management,” he said.

Mr. Rahman said it was not the cost of the exotic birds that made him sad, but it was the emotional attachment that he had.

“It was like parting with your children… so painful,” he said.

Like Mr. Rahman, a few other small-time farmers too expressed their anguish at the culling. However, the officials succeeded in convincing them of the importance of culling in the management of the deadly avian flu.

Culling to continue

The culling will continue on Monday. After sanitising the entire one kilometre area from Palathingal, where the bird flu was detected two days ago, the authorities will check further for birds in the region. If detected, they will be caught and killed.

The district administration said that no compensation would be given to those birds culled in the secondary stage.

It goaded the people to come forward to help the rapid response teams cull the birds.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/painful-parting-with-their-pets/article31076051.ece
186,2020/03/15,Two more COVID-19 confirmed cases in State,"Total number of cases in the second wave of the disease reaches 21

Two more COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the State on Sunday, taking the total number of cases reported in the second wave of the disease to 21.

One of the confirmed cases is that of a Thiruvananthapuram-based doctor, who had just come back from Spain where he had gone for higher studies. The other case was that of a tourist from the U.K., who was staying in a resort in Munnar, where he had been asked to self-isolate.

The former is now in the isolation ward in Thiruvananthapuram Medical College Hospital, while the foreign tourist and his wife have been isolated in Ernakulam Medical College Hospital.

Kerala put 3,287 persons more in its COVID-19 surveillance network on Sunday, taking the total number of persons under surveillance in the State to 10,944. However, only 289 persons are in isolation in hospitals, while 10,655 have been asked to self-isolate.

Briefing the media here on Sunday, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said that even as surveillance and other containment activities were going on, people should not panic and that normal life should go on. The only restriction was on mass gatherings.

The public should follow the necessary precautions such as frequent handwashing, social distancing, respiratory hygiene and avoid unnecessary travel. The Chief Minister has directed that all bus services should be run and that people should be able to travel for their work.

Passenger screening at border check points had commenced, while in railway stations, passengers would be screened at the health desks being set up near the exits.

187,2020/03/15,CM seeks report on disease control ‘slip-up’,"He calls for steps to minimise disruption while maintaining vigil

The ‘slip-up’ in the vigil against COVID-19 virus reportedly dominated the high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan here on Sunday to review the pestilence control measures adopted by the State government.

The government appeared caught off guard when a British citizen under surveillance by the health authorities for suspected COVID-19 gave the Idukki district administration the slip.

Authorities were alarmed when the tourist and his companions dashed for the Kochi airport soon after the administration discovered that he had tested positive for the virus and posed a severe public health risk.

Officials interdicted the group from flying to Dubai. The police have booked the manager of the State-owned resort where the tourist stayed under supervision for criminal negligence.

The government also seemed unwatchful when hundreds of members of a local cooperative bank congregated in large numbers in a constricted locality at Vamanapuram here to vote to elect new office-bearers. The district administration appeared to have woken up to the risk belatedly and cancelled the polling midway.

Mr. Vijayan had reportedly asked the police, revenue, tourism and cooperative departments to explain the oversights. He ordered resorts, home-stays and hotels to inform the police about the port of departure and travel history of their foreign guests.

Only those who tested negative for the virus would qualify for travel. The State police have to update revenue and health authorities about the whereabouts of foreigners. Mr. Vijayan said vigilance and not alarm would halt the march of the disease. Authorities should ensure the partial lock down did not disrupt life.

Public and private transport bus services should normalise operations. Officials should ensure that commerce and trade were restored. They should facilitate the functioning of malls and markets.

Mr. Vijayan ordered District Collectors to call a meeting of the management of places of worship to brief them about the need to take pestilence control precautions, including a measure of social distancing, to break the chain of the infection.

The government would train and deploy citizens who have offered to help the State's disease control bid as ""paramedic volunteers"" to screen for infected persons in trains and at railway stations.

Chief Secretary Tom Jose, State Police Chief Loknath Behera, Additional Chief Secretary, Home, Biswas Mehta, and Principal Secretary, Health, Rajan Khobragade and Additional Director General of Police T.K.

191,2020/03/15,Coronavirus | Kerala to test based on risk assessment,"Persons with mild symptoms told not to approach hospitals

People in Kerala who have come in contact with COVID-19 patients and showing mild symptoms will not be tested, according to revised guidelines issued on March 12 by the Kerala Health Ministry. Kerala has so far reported 22 confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Following the changes, people exhibiting low grade fever, mild sore throat, cough, rhinitis or diarrhoea will not be tested for the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Only those with severe symptoms or with underlying conditions of the lungs, heart, liver and kidney, pregnant women and those older than 60 years will be tested for the virus.

The revised guidelines are for testing, quarantine and hospital admission of COVID-19 patients based on risk assessment.

“Patients with mild symptoms are advised not to come to hospitals for testing and treatment. Testing is not going to change either the clinical course or management of the patient with mild symptoms,” the Kerala Ministry guidelines said.

As per ICMR guidelines

According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) testing guidelines for COVID-19 issued on March 9, individuals with a travel history to the affected countries or close contacts of positive cases who are in quarantine will be tested if they show symptoms during quarantine.

Explaining the rationale behind the revised guidelines, Kerala Health Minister K.K. Shylaja told The Hindu: “Many of the mild symptoms are similar to other conditions. If we give importance to patients with mild symptoms then testing for the more deserving ones will get delayed.”

“We had traced and tested the samples of around 1,500 people who came in contact with the family that returned from Italy and tested positive for coronavirus. We are also testing samples of passengers arriving in Kerala airports if they exhibit symptoms,” the Health Minister said.

More labs authorised

The National Institute of Virology (NIV) unit in Alappuzha was one of the first testing labs in the country that was permitted to confirm COVID-19 positive samples without sending them to NIV-Pune. Due to increased number of people being tested, Kerala has got permission from ICMR to confirm samples for novel coronavirus in two more labs in Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram.

According to Dr. Nivedita Gupta of ICMR, confirmatory assays have been shipped to these two labs. “After standardisation, both labs will be able to confirm for COVID-19 from Wednesday onwards,” she said.

The ICMR has also permitted Thrissur Medical College Hospital to test for COVID-19 beginning March 16. However, the Thrissur Hospital will be required to send samples to the NIV unit in Alappuzha for confirmation. Kerala has sought permission from the ICMR to carry out tests in two more institutions in the capital — the Public Health Lab and the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB).",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dgf7gs/article31075342.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KERALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-kerala-to-test-based-on-risk-assessment/article31075343.ece
192,2020/03/15,Public access to HC to be regulated,"Public access to the Kerala High Court will be regulated shortly considering the “security risks involved in providing free access to all” to the court complex.

What has prompted the judicial authorities to think of clamping immediate restrictions is the COVID-19 scare.

However, the restrictions will continue even after the period of vigil and only litigants will be allowed to enter the complex and that too with an authorisation from their lawyers. Even in that case, the litigants will be permitted to enter only the court hall where their cases are being considered.

The litigants who come to the court complex with the authorisation letters from the lawyers will have to produce it at the office of the Public Relations Officer, who in turn will verify the case number and other details. Later, the litigants will be provided with a photo-pass. The visitors will have to present themselves for a security check at the door of the court hall concerned. No heavy baggages would be permitted into the court complex, judicial sources said.

A safety audit of the court complex, notified as a high security zone, had highlighted the loopholes in the security system. The audit carried out by the State police had also identified the vulnerabilities, including the probability of terror attacks from militant groups from all sides of the building and from the coast. However, the report had concluded that there was no specific input regarding the possible attacks or threats to the complex.

Currently, there are such security restrictions in Madras High Court and the Supreme Court.

On a daily average, around 6,000 persons reach the building, including 1,800 members of the staff and lawyers. The present security check is limited to noting down the name and contact details of the visitors, who will then have to walk through the door-frame metal detector.

The security audit had also recommended the formation of a 438-member exclusive security group for manning the complex. Though the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) had expressed its willingness to provide its men, it wanted the State government to foot the salary bill.

The security committee of the Kerala High Court, which approved the security proposal, had forwarded it to the State government. The need for enhanced security system was raised at a meeting of Kerala Chief Justice with the Chief Minister. However, the proposal was yet to get the clearance of the State government, sources said.

It is estimated that the security arrangement would cost the exchequer ₹17.06 crore annually.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/public-access-to-hc-to-be-regulated/article31075108.ece

District Collector Adeela Abdulla, MLAs I.C. Balakrishnan, C.K. Saseendran, O.R. Kelu, people’s representatives from local bodies and senior officials of various departments attended the meeting.

Transport for students

Later, Mr. Saseendran, told mediapersons that the government would provide all help to Malayali students, who were studying in various educational institutions in Karnataka, to reach their native places in the State. Four buses of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation would be operated from Bengaluru to Kozhikode to ensure the return journey of the students.

Patrolling would be intensified on the Kerala-Karnataka and Kerala-Tamil Nadu border checkposts in the wake of a COVID-19 death reported in Karnataka.

Though the Kyasanur Forest disease or monkey fever outbreak in the district was under control, preventive measures would be intensified to tackle the spread of the tick-borne disease, Mr. Saseendran said.

The holy hillock of Sabarimala witnessed very low pilgrim flow on the first day of the five-day monthly rituals at the Ayyappa temple on the first day in the Malayalam month of Meenom on Saturday.

There was only a moderate crowd in the early morning hours. However, the crowd slowly dispersed themselves after offering prayers at the temple in the minimum possible time owing to the restrictions for offerings in the wake of the COVID-19 threat in the district. A few pilgrims were found wearing masks while undertaking the pilgrimage.

The rituals began with the Tantri performing Maha Ganapati homom followed by Abhishekom and Ushapuja. Only Neyyabhishekom as part of the routine daily ritual was performed at the temple and devotees could not make the offering as Devaswom ticket counters remained close. Utchapuja and Athazhapuja were the other rituals performed on the day. Special rituals such as Kalabhabhishekom, Udayasthamanapuja, Shasrakalasapuja and Padipuja and Pushpabhishekom were cancelled.

The Travancore Devaswom Board has also decided to do away with annadanam (free feeding) and accommodation facility at Sabarimala during the ongoing monthly puja period.

196,2020/03/15,Avian flu | 500 birds culled at Palathingal,"About 4,000 birds are expected to be culled in the next two days

More than 500 birds, mostly poultry, were culled on Saturday in Wards 15, 17, 18 and 19 of Parappanangadi municipality that fell within one km from Palathingal, where avian flu was detected two days ago.

When nine rapid response teams (RRTs) of the State Animal Husbandry Department, supported by health and civic body officials, went about culling the birds, one team focussed on incinerating and burying the killed birds. About 4,000 birds are expected to be culled in the next two days.

Chickens, ducks, turkeys, pigeons and doves were among the birds culled methodically as per the bird flu management protocol on Saturday.

Some local people were caught unawares, as the RRTs wearing protective gears swooped down on the village in the morning. Local people said they had not been informed of the culling. Several of them had let the chickens go out of their cages.

As many as 20 veterinary surgeons, supported by 119 livestock inspectors and 30 attendants, were out in the field, catching, killing, incinerating and burying the birds. A section was engaged in sanitising the area.

A spacious coconut seed farm owned by the government at Chiramangalam was used for incineration and burial. Apart from the culled birds, their feeding utensils, feeds and other accoutrements were incinerated.

Public announcements were made on Saturday asking the people not to let their poultry from cages. S. Nandakumar, disease investigation officer from the State Institute for Animal Diseases, Palode, who led the operation, said that culling would continue on Sunday and Monday.

Birds in Munniyoor and Tirurangadi regions will be culled on Monday, he said.

The district administration has suspended the licences of poultry shops within 10 km area from Palathingal in Tirurangadi and Parappanangadi municipalities. Sale or transport of poultry or any other pet bird is banned in the region for the next three months.

District Collector Jafer Malik said that people would be compensated for the culled birds, but in accordance with the government rates. A special cleaning drive will begin for three days after the culling.

Yet another inspection of the birds will be conducted on the fifth day. If any bird is found in that inspection, it will be confiscated and killed. The State government will submit a sanitation certificate to the Centre after the culling process.

197,2020/03/15,More stringent steps to combat COVID-19,"Unprecedented announcement of virtual lockdown triggers panic in capital city

Kerala is throwing all its energy, attention and human resources into surveillance, monitoring and contact tracing, in an attempt to ensure that the window of opportunity for the containment of COVID-19 is not lost. More stringent measures were announced on Saturday for strengthening surveillance at airports, railway stations and border points to ensure that every one entering the State is screened properly.

However, in an attempt to be one step ahead of the coronavirus disease, authorities seemed to be jumping ahead of the containment phase, announcing a virtual lockdown of the capital city by proposing the closure of all shopping malls and warning people not to step out unless necessary.

While social distancing is one of the crucial and most effective measures to break the transmission of the virus, this unprecedented announcement led to a state of total panic in the capital city on Saturday.

CM clarifies

With little time for preparation, panic buying by people for essentials ensued. Even though the Chief Minister clarified later that the government only intended to warn people about reducing crowding and that malls were not to be closed, the damage had already been done.

With airport arrivals going up steadily, especially from nations where active transmission of COVID-19 is on, the State put 2,209 people more on surveillance and another 106 new patients in isolation on Saturday.

On Saturday, there was no new cases. The total number of people under surveillance in Kerala went up to 7,677 and the number of hospital admissions, to 302.

Briefing media, Mr. Pinarayi Vijayan said that corona care centres would be readied near airports as per the directive of the Centre to provide a safe environment for those arrivals who may need to be housed overnight while completing airport screening. Preparations were already on to identify and ready suitable locations.

The district administration will be in touch with private hospitals to rope in their support to ensure that proper isolation facilities with ICUs and ventilator support can be additionally arranged.

Mr. Vijayan reiterated that while the public need not panic, it was important that they listened to the directives issued by health authorities as the State was going through a public health emergency of an unprecedented scale. He warned that the police may have to intervene if the directive of avoiding public gatherings was violated. He again warned the public not to harass tourists unnecessarily and to treat them well as COVID-19 was an issue common to nations the world over.

Though people from foreign nations without apparent symptoms were being put on home quarantine, what actual “home quarantine” entails seems to have been lost on people despite the massive awareness campaigns run by the Health Department. Home quarantine essentially means confining oneself to a self-contained room with little or no contact with other family members. Unless this is followed strictly, more people have to be admitted into isolation facilities, creating unnecessary strain on hospitals.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/8ugjvp/article31071290.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15tvCOVID-191111,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/more-stringent-steps-to-combat-covid-19/article31071291.ece
198,2020/03/15,Self-restraint could prevent spread: Minister,"Minister for Industries E.P. Jayarajan has said that self-restraint could help prevent the spread of COVID-19 across the world.

He was speaking at a meeting of people’s representatives and officials on Saturday to review and coordinate the district’s COVID-19 preventive measures.

Instructions will be issued from March 18 to 22 to educate the public about precautionary measures to be taken in the context of COVID-19. Local body representatives, health workers and volunteers will conduct campaigns at the ward-level. The Minister directed local bodies to hold a special meeting on March 16 to plan the events. Local body members, political party representatives and health workers should attend the meetings, he said. The meeting also decided to include Mahe area in preventive and awareness activities. The District Collector will contact the Mahe administrator for the purpose.

The meeting directed that those who come to the district from foreign countries or neighboring states that have reported coronavirus infection should contact local body representatives or health workers immediately. Surveillance and awareness will be strengthened at railway stations and bus stands in addition to the Kannur International Airport.

The meeting suggested that those in isolation at houses should use only one room and minimize interaction with others in the house. Those who are on supervision should not leave the house under any circumstances.

He was addressing a meeting of representatives of local bodies and district officials on Saturday to coordinate activities to prevent the spread of COVID-19 at the district-level.

The Minister said complaints had been received that those who had come from abroad and patients with symptoms were not cooperating with health workers as part of preventive measures. He said the Health Department intended to be vigilant, and not intimidating. Everyone should be prepared to act with a high civic sense, he added.

Preventive measures at the ward and panchayat levels were more effective than handling the situation from the district centre, he said. The meeting decided that foreign tourists in the district should avoid visiting tourist attractions. The Health Surveillance Division, headed by the District Medical Officer in collaboration with the Department of Tourism, will conduct inspections at tourist destinations.

The Minister said that since a number of patients have tested positive in Kerala, one must remain vigilant, wash hands regularly with soap and ensure that they educate others.

Moving on to discussing the National Population Register (NPR), Mr. Udhayakumar said that it is essential to ensure that people stop panicking based on what the opposition parties say. “We have only moved the notification to ensure that census takes place. The NPR, as Home Minister Amit Shah says, will not brand anyone doubtful citizens if they have been Indian citizens. It is irresponsible of Opposition party leader M. K.

The State unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will work harder to reach out to Dalits, the unit president L. Murugan told journalists in Coimbatore on Sunday.

“The objective of the party is to unite people of all castes and faith. But after my appointment, the party will work harder to reach out to Dalits and people from other communities as well to take them along as one,” he said.

Calling for peace in Coimbatore, Mr. Murugan wanted the police to arrest those responsible for assaulting RSS worker Suryaprakash of Madukkarai and Hindu Munnani leader Anand. They had arrested only two of those involved in assaulting Mr Anand, he alleged.

“The police should show no leniency in acting against extremists as that is the only way to ensure prevalence of peace in the city,” he said.

As part of precautionary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Sunday appealed to the general public to avoid travel out of Tamil Nadu for the next 15 days. He also urged people to keep off social gatherings in large numbers in public places.

The State government ordered closure of kindergarten and up to class V sections in all schools till March 31.

Malls and cinema halls in certain taluks in 16 districts, which share borders with other States, have been ordered to be closed till March 31.

These taluks are in Theni, Kanniyakumari, Tiruppur, Coimbatore, the Nilgiris, Krishnagiri, Tirunelveli, Tenkasi, Tiruvallur, Vellore, Tiruppattur, Ranipet, Erode, Dindigul, Dharmapuri and Virudhunagar districts.

“The CM has also requested that aged-persons, ill, children and those with less immunity avoid public and crowded areas. He has also urged general public to maintain personal hygiene by washing hands while entering their homes,” an official release from the government stated.

The advisory also urged parents not to allow children to play in groups and to ensure their personal hygiene.

Cooperation from all quarters, including the general public, was necessary in taking precautionary measures against Coronavirus, it said.

The Chief Minister also appealed to people to approach government hospitals, if symptoms of the pandemic were noticed.

204,2020/03/15,T.N. Fisheries University to double its admission from 2020-21,"More girls willing to take up the Nautical Technology programme: Vice-Chancellor

The Tamil Nadu Dr. J. Jayalalithaa Fisheries University will admit 600 students next academic year. It currently admits 355 students.

The university received approval for four undergraduate vocational programmes from the University Grants Commission just ahead of admission last year and could admit only 20 students in each of these programmes. From the next academic year, it will admit 50 students in each of these programmes.

Vice-Chancellor S. Felix said, “We started six constituent colleges last year and offered 15 courses. We plan to admit 600 students in the next academic year.”

Students with science subjects in class 12 could opt for Fisheries Engineering or Fisheries Food Technology. Last year, three girl students were admitted to B. Tech Nautical Technology programme. Although the university had more girls enrolling, he said it came as a surprise that girls were willing to take up the Nautical Technology programme.

“We expected students from fisher community but they came from all sectors. This programme requires people to stay for several months in the sea. We are surprised to see girls coming forward. It is good that they are coming,” he said.

The graduates had a wide range of opportunities, Mr. Felix said as the Centre’s Fisheries department had raised the target of production to 20 million tonnes by 2022-23 with focus on marine fishing.

There were also proposals to explore opportunities in near shore fishing. The country was following the example set by Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Taiwan, which were into cage farming and seaweed farming.

The university has purchased two deep sea fishing vessels — one for the university and the other to train fishermen in the Mandapam region.

“Now I am asking the students to visit schools and talk about fish-eating habits. We are targeting youngsters to create awareness about the benefits of eating fish,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tn-fisheries-university-to-double-its-admission-from-2020-21/article31073721.ece

Tenders will soon be called for phase I of Chennai-Kanniyakumari Industrial Corridor Project (CKICP) covering 654 km of State Highway roads at a total cost of ₹6,448 crore.

Sources in the Highways Department said tenders were likely to be called by March and construction would commence as soon as possible.

“The acquisition of land, which is a crucial portion, for the project is at an advanced stage. We have a separate land acquisition unit with 350 persons. Of 360-odd parcels of land, 15 (2) notifications informing about the acquisition of lands and seeking objections of any have been issued. Under this project, we are also accepting private negotiations that would allow land owners to get better rates and speed up the process of acquisition,” explained an official.

Industrial nodes

Thoothukudi-Tirunelveli; Madurai-Dindigul-Virudhunagar-Theni; Cuddalore-Nagapattinam and Ariyalyur-Perambalur industrial nodes are to be covered under the project.

The 15 identified roads will be widened and strengthened to improve connectivity to ports and other transport gateways, proposed industrial nodes, urban and tourist centres.

The Kancheepuram-Chennai (SH 58) and Omalur-Tiruchengode via Sankari ( SH86) roads would be widened into 4-lanes and the other roads including the 110 km long Cheyyur to Polur (SH115), including ECR link, and 74.9-km-long Tiruchendur to Ambasamudram via Palayamkottai (SH40) road, would have a width of 10 mt with hard shoulders.

The project would have 23 bypasses and 10 road overbridges and would be funded through the Asian Development Bank loan. Land acquisition cost of ₹1,574 crore would be borne by the State government with which 463 hectares would be acquired.

About 280 families of boom boom mattukarars (a nomadic community of soothsayers) in the district would soon get ration cards and other necessary identification documents, such as Aadhaar cards to help them avail of government welfare schemes, thanks to the initiative of Collector Praveen B. Nair.

The initiative came after officials of Mahalir Thittam in the district conducted a survey under which the community's needs were assessed. “We found that their most important requirements for the 280 families were ration cards, voter ID, Aadhaar card, Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS) card and community certificates. They had understood that these would be necessary to get more stable jobs,” said B. Balan, Assistant Project Officer, Mahalir Thittam, Nagapattinam. Mr. Balan presented his findings to the District Collector who invited elders of the community and administrative officials to discuss the matter and provide solutions, he added.

Through Mahalir Thittam, five self-help croups have been formed. “They have begun collecting money as savings. After they collect it regularly for six months, we will open a bank account and teach them how to keep books and accounts,” Mr. Balan said. All 280 families have also been issued CMCHIS cards. The youth of the community, under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana, were given vocational training for free. “Of them, 13 members have been selected for various jobs,” he said.

Mahalir Thittam, in association with Vaanavil Trust, an NGO working in the region is also seeking to provide job opportunities and education to the children and youth in the community, Mr. Balan said. “Vaanavil has been teaching children at these villages,” said R. Revathi, founder, Vaanavil Trust.

Efforts on rehabilitating families involved in begging or those with no permanent income in the district were under way, Mr. Balan said.

“About 150 families make a living from exchanging scrap material for plastic goods and selling them in the district. By forming a common livelihood group with the assistance of Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihoods Mission we will purchase items and hand them over to them to sell, providing them with a steady income,” he said.

208,2020/03/15,‘T.N. should be proactive in handling the disease’,"N. Murali was speaking at the annual day of Aishwarya Trust

Tamil Nadu cannot be complacent just because it has fewer COVID-19 cases as compared to other States. The State government should be more aggressive and proactive, N. Murali, chairman, Kasturi and Sons Ltd., said on Saturday.

He was speaking at the 12th annual day of the Aishwarya Trust. The trust, which works with underprivileged families to reduce the infant mortality rate, through early detection and treatment of congenital heart defects (CHD), along with a team of doctors from MGM healthcare, has supported surgical treatment for 502 children with CHD, including 21 transplants.

Mr. Murali, who was the chief guest for the event, said he was sure that the government would announce some measures in the coming days. Pointing out that India was in the midst of a serious pandemic, he said: “Infectious disease specialists are predicting a hike in the number of infected cases here because its spread is not just from foreign travel but also through contact. All of us have to take elementary precautions. Probably it’s time even Tamil Nadu suspends, for a few weeks, some major activities like cinemas and large gatherings. IPL has already been suspended till April 15.”

Speaking about the yeoman service rendered by Aishwarya Trust and the team of doctors, he said child healthcare was neglected by public health policies and private hospitals. He said it was heartening to see people like cardiothoracic surgeon K.R. Balakrishnan, who is a trustee of the body, come forward even in the face of such constraints to transform the lives of people.

Dr. Balakrishnan said there were very few children’s hospitals in the country. He spoke about the activities of the trust. “The trust has been supporting clinical work for heart diseases in children through surgery and transplant programme. Going forward, we have some important research projects in the pipeline. One of them is to create an artificial heart pump. This will bring more affordable heart care to larger sections of the society,” he said.

209,2020/03/15,Role of private hospitals in handling COVID-19 remains unclear,"IMA to hold State council meeting today to discuss the issue

Many private hospitals in the city have said there is no clarity about their role in handling the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This is despite the State Health department announcing that it had held meetings with representatives of private hospitals and the Indian Medical Association, and that treatment protocols had been shared with them.

C.N. Raja, State president, Indian Medical Association - Tamil Nadu branch, said, “Private hospitals have not prepared isolation facilities so far. IMA is having a State council meeting on Sunday, and we will be discussing COVID-19, how we can handle [it], and cooperate with the government.”

In response to queries on their preparedness, at least three major private hospitals said that as per the Central government’s instructions, they are not supposed to divulge any information. A few said they had earmarked isolation facilities, while some doctors said they were told not to treat patients with suspected symptoms of COVID-19 but refer them to government hospitals. Many doctors said no proper guidelines or information had reached them. A doctor at a private hospital in Tambaram took to social media to air his concerns. The hospital, he said, had been receiving patients with classic symptoms of COVID-19 and travel history to the Middle East for the last two weeks. “We called the helpline numbers. They said they do not check persons with minor symptoms. The patients were sent home,” he said.

A senior consultant said suspected COVID-19 patients had been referred to the government hospital. “At the GH, they were not screened or tested. The government should test at least suspected patients,” she said.

Navin Gnanasekaran, associate director of medical services, MGM Healthcare, said they had identified an appropriate area for the isolation of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19, and were ready to attend to in-patients. He added that as of now, the government had directed healthcare professionals to identify patients with symptoms of cold/cough or fever and determine their travel history or contact with patients who had tested positive for the virus. In case of suspicion after assessment, they will call the government hotline, and based on the advice they receive, the patient will be sent home for quarantine or referred to the government in-patient admission facility.

A senior official of a corporate hospital said, “There are certain areas of concern. The lack of testing kits is one.” “We have procured about 5,000 full body suits, protective gear, long shoe covers and goggles. But if 10 to 15 patients come in, these will be exhausted within a week,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ure5r/article31073144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/pvt-hospital-graphic-page-001jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/role-of-pvt-hospitals-in-handling-covid-19-remains-unclear/article31071558.ece

The State government has declared COVID-19 a notified disease under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act, 1939.

“The World Health Organisation has declared COVID-19 a pandemic. While the government is taking preventive measures, declaring it a notified disease under the Public Health Act means delegating more powers to health officials and taking stringent measures to control the infection. Now, if a person with symptoms of COVID-19 approaches a private practitioner/hospital, they should immediately notify the public health authorities,” said K. Senthil Raj, mission director, National Health Mission-Tamil Nadu. He added that they should notify the Deputy Director of Health Services of the respective district or the municipal health officials who, in turn, would take measures to isolate the patient and prevent further transmission. “This is important to prevent transmission in the community,” he said.

Another testing laboratory has been readied in the State - at Tirunelveli. With this, Tamil Nadu has a total of four testing facilities, the others being King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy, and government medical colleges at Theni and Tiruvarur.

Tasmac challenged the constitutional validity of Section 40(a)(iib) of the Income Tax Act of 1961 on the premise that the legal provision “distorts federal polity” and was aimed at “unjustly” enriching the Centre, but a Bench led by Chief Justice of Madras High Court Amreshwar Pratap Sahi dismissed the writ petition.

He agreed with Hema Muralikrishnan, senior standing counsel for the I-T Department, that the official concerned was in the process of assessing whether Tasmac was liable to pay tax for ₹14,574.74 crore for the assessment year 2017-18 and hence a challenge to the statutory provision could not be entertained in the present stage.

Assessment order

A Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax had passed an assessment order (A.O.) on December 30, 2019 holding that Tasmac must pay tax for ₹14,574.74 crore. However, Justice Anita Sumanth of the High Court on February 26 set aside the A.O. on the ground that it appeared to have been passed in “a haste” and ordered a fresh inquiry.

In his order, the Deputy Commissioner said the State government was in the habit of taking away almost all the profit earned by Tasmac every year through liquor sales. Till 2013, the revenue was being appropriated under the guise of ‘privilege fee.’ Hence, Parliament introduced Section 40(1)(iib) to the I-T Act to avoid certain exemptions.

The Section states that money paid by way of “royalty, licence fee, service fee, privilege fee, service charge or any other fee or charge, by whatever name called” to a State government by its own undertaking shall not be liable for deduction while computing the taxable income under the head of ‘profits and gains of business or profession.’

Increased VAT

Immediately after Parliament introduced the Section, the Tamil Nadu government did away with the practice of charging privilege fee and instead began collecting revenue from Tasmac under the head of Value Added Tax (sales tax) after amending the Tamil Nadu VAT Act of 2006 and increasing the VAT rates on liquor to as high as 270%.

“Therefore, even while not levying the special privilege fee, the State government used yet another colourable device in the guise of VAT levy to appropriate this accumulated profit, which would have otherwise been assessable to tax as per the provisions of the Income Tax Act,” the Assessment Order passed by the Deputy Commissioner read.

Laying stress on the use of the words “fee or charge by whatever name called” found in Section 40(1)(iib) of the I-T Act, the official held that the “abnormal, exorbitant and arbitrary” amount of money shown as ‘VAT expense’ in the book of accounts of Tasmac could not be allowed to be deducted from its profits so as to avoid payment of income tax.

“VAT, in this case, is actually not an expense but only a book entry in the form of fiction created by a statute using the legislature in which the people had placed trust. This State VAT levy is a weapon aimed at crucifying the legislative wisdom of Parliament. Therefore, the VAT amount claimed as allowable deduction is disallowed,” the officer had concluded.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/k46fme/article31071543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THMARMADRASHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/centre-wants-a-share-in-tasmac-revenue/article31071544.ece
213,2020/03/15,"Tamil Nadu a pioneer in health sector, says Palaniswami","CM lays foundation for ₹327-cr. medical college in Dindigul

Laying the foundation for a ₹327-crore government medical college and hospital here on Saturday, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami rejected the claims of political opponents and asserted that the State government was fulfilling the promises it had made to the people.

Appealing to the public to ignore the statements of Opposition parties, he said they were unable to stomach the popularity of “Amma’s (Jayalalithaa’s) government”.

Stating that the new medical college will come up on a vast 20-acre area, Mr. Palaniswami thanked the Union government for granting approvals and sanctioning funds for medical colleges in 11 locations, including Dindigul.

The one in Dindigul will become functional from the next academic year (2021-22), and 150 students will be admitted to the institution, he said.

Listing the schemes implemented by the government since 2016, Mr. Palaniswami said the Chief Minister’s Special Grievances Cell had granted old-age pension (OAP) to over five lakh genuine applicants from across Tamil Nadu in the last 100 days, out of the nine lakh applications it had received.

Similarly, the Kudimaramathu scheme had fetched the desired results — not only were farmers happy about the availability of water for irrigation, but also the public had appreciated the project as it had enabled water conservation in their localities, the CM said.

The Department of Public Health in T.N. was leading the pack at the national level. Many government hospitals were performing complex surgeries free of cost, he said.

Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said the objective of establishing a medical college in each district was to provide quality treatment to the poor and the needy. The government hospitals were fully equipped and on a par with many private hospitals in Tamil Nadu. The very fact that the State attracted people from all over the globe for medical treatment showed that there were experts here, he said.

‘No need to panic’

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said there was no need to panic about COVID-19. The State was proactive and its preparedness had paved the way for speedy diagnosis. “We had one case that tested positive in the State. The patient has recovered,” he noted.

Welfare measures were distributed to beneficiaries on the occasion. Senior officials from various departments took part.

CPI(M) MP from Madurai S. Venkatesan condemned the T.N. government for conducting a function in Dindigul at a time when people had been told not to assemble in large numbers due to the COVID-19 threat.

Earlier, speaking to reporters on arrival at Madurai airport, Mr. Palaniswami said the AIIMS that was to come up in Madurai will benefit not only Madurai but also all the southern districts and a few districts in the delta region.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/b7t52c/article31071541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-a-pioneer-in-health-sector-says-palaniswami/article31071542.ece
214,2020/03/15,"Anbazhagan believed I was heir apparent, says Stalin","Leaders pay rich tributes to late DMK general secretary, hail his contributions to the Tamil community and language.

Following in the footsteps of late party general secretary K. Anbazhagan, DMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday vowed to adhere to the Dravidian ideology and serve the Tamil community and language.

Unveiling Anbazhagan’s portrait in the presence of party leaders and the stalwart’s family members, Mr. Stalin said Anbazhagan was the one who proposed his name for the party’s leadership.

Recalling his father and DMK president M. Karunanidhi’s words that it was difficult to get respect and acceptance from Anbazhagan, he said he had the honour of gaining both. Mr. Stalin said the death of Kalaignar had a bearing on Anbazhagan’s health.

“When Kalaignar died, we took solace from his [Anbazhagan’s] presence. We wanted to celebrate his centenary. But he is no more. Had Kalaignar survived, he also would have survived,” he said.

Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani said for Anbazhagan, politics was about sticking to ideology and the government instrumental in implementing the ideology.

Party treasurer Duraimurugan said Anbazhagan used to be a very angry man and called a spade a spade. “His fury was apparent in his speeches in the general council of the party and had even led to Ministers losing their positions,” he said. He said Anbazhagan did not accept the leadership of Kalaignar in the beginning, but subsequently accepted him and praised him.

“I once asked him about his speech at Chintadripet against Kalaignar’s leadership. He told me that he would accept anyone who was ready to fight and work for the Tamil language and Tamils. Kalaignar is doing it,” he said, adding that the two never had a difference of opinion in the last 43 years.

TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said the friendship between Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh could be likened to that of Kalaignar and Anbazhagan. The meeting proved to be an occasion to introduce Anbazhagan’s grandson Vetriazhagan, who extended his family’s support to party president Mr. Stalin.

215,2020/03/15,Prataya Saha's 'The Good Wife': The long and short of patriarchy,"The 17-minute short film, set in 1992 Kolkata, was screened last week at Auroville’s Cinema Paradiso

A woman covering her face with a saree pallu (loose end of the saree) scurries through narrow bylanes of Kolkata, defying a riot-induced curfew, in search of fish to cook her husband’s favourite meal, for it is their wedding anniversary — this is the opening shot of the short film, The Good Wife, by independent film-maker Prataya Saha.

The film, set in 1992 Kolkata, was screened last week at Auroville’s Cinema Paradiso.

The first few scenes quickly establish the protagonist’s character as a stereotypical wife of the 1990s — eager to please the husband, leads a life of sacrifice and subjugation under an abusive, alcoholic husband.

Through a series of quick cuts and carefully crafted sound design — music on the radio, the ticking of a pendulum clock and the scraping of utensils — the film takes viewers on a journey into a day in the life of ‘the good wife’.

For the most part, the film delves on the woman’s uncomplaining acceptance of her life, shown through fleeting thoughts of emptiness that cross her mind. After devoting herself to serving her husband, cooking his favourite meals, eating from leftovers, she wonders why he doesn’t so much as glance at her with an iota of love.

“Whose fragrance do you carry”, she helplessly asks while washing his shirt one day, to a whiff of unfamiliar perfume.

The film ends in a decisive act of rebellion by the protagonist against her husband, portrayed more as an embodiment of patriarchy than a mere character.

The 17-minute film, from the stable of Bengaluru-based Red Polka Productions founded by Anshulika Kapoor who also plays the lead character, has been on an awards-winning spree.

It has so far won 12 awards globally and has been selected for over 20 international film festivals. The film has also been exclusively curated by various platforms, most notably by SRFTI, Kolkata.

The short has won best film awards in Chicago and Toronto, a slew of awards at the Vipra International Film Festival in Kochi, and the best actress award at Continental Film Festival, Toronto. More recently, it won the jury award for best film at Chennai International Short Film Festival.

“That the film still speaks to audiences across geographies is an eye-opener really and attests to the fact that the plight of women trapped in abusive marriages is universally relatable,” said Mr. Saha.

“In the contemporary world perhaps, a woman might have alternative choices to get out of an abusive relationship. But, in those times (the 1990s), women suffered silently for the sake of family honour, lacked confidantes and were socially conditioned to remain in abusive relationships,” said the film-maker, who derived inspiration for the movie from a traumatic marital relationship of an aunt.

This is as much a story of a woman’s realisation that her love for her husband is the outcome of years of social conditioning, as a tribute to her immense inner power. “Maybe not the power or strength with chest thumping, typical of toxic masculinity, but a more subtler, inner feminine strength”.

“We not only transport the audience visually to an era from 25 years ago, but also retrospectively throw light on how little (or how much) has changed over the last two-and-a-half decades in the lives of these seemingly ‘good wives’,” he said.

The short film’s sound design/music is by Sandeep Sugunan and editing by Raihan Siddique.

Prataya Saha has several short films and a play — Chitraa, a Rabindranath Tagore adaptation — to his credit. He said the The Good Wife is the breakthrough in his career. In the vein of exploring socio-political issues, he is now working on a film that deals with water scarcity crisis “as seen through the eyes of a child” and another film, titled Newly Weds, which tackles the fading out of interpersonal communication in the new age.

“This is a great time for independent cinema. There is a proliferation of video-delivery platforms and digital devices creating new commercial value for content. And, the shorter the better, given how much attention spans have shrunk”, he said.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/zd59th/article31076412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GOODWIFE1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-good-wife-addresses-the-long-and-short-of-patriarchy/article31076414.ece
216,2020/03/15,Coronavirus | Concern over future of daily wage earners as Indian film bodies decide to halt all shoots,"Filmmakers mull option of setting up funds for the affected workforce

The Indian Motion Picture Producers’ Association (IMPPA) on Sunday called for a halt of shoots of all entertainment formats in view of the spread of the COVID-19. A joint meeting of the leading bodies — IMPPA, Western India Film Producers’ Association (WIFPA), Indian Film and TV Producers Council (IFTPC), Indian Film and Television Directors’ Association (IFTDA) and Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) — arrived at the unanimous decision to stop shooting of films, TV serials, web series and all other entertainment, including digital formats, from March 19 to March 31.

The film units shooting till then have been advised to follow all precautionary and preventive measures without fail.

Concerns were raised about life ahead for the daily wage earners, the light boys, spotboys, set workers, carpenters, painters, sound assistants, junior artistes and junior technicians and stuntsperson etc who would be the most affected by the decision. Like in the case of demonetisation in 2016, the closure will be most crippling for the humblest workforce.

“How can the industry come together to help the daily wagers? They’re the ones who’ll be cast adrift when the production lockdown comes into effect,” tweeted producer Anupama Mandloi. “How do the workers that live off daily wages make their ends meet? We must put our heads together. We are not getting past this problem in a hurry…” tweeted filmmaker Anubhav Sinha. Filmmakers like Sudhir Mishra and Hansal Mehta spoke about setting up funds, with Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap voicing support.

“During such times it is practically impossible to set up a machinery in place quickly. A machine that will collect monies from all of us and then will disburse to the needy,” filmmaker Anubhav Sinha told The Hindu. According to him setting up a large fund and its management would be complex and he proposed that each filmmaker could look after and cover workers from their previous films. “So what I am doing is that any daily wage worker from my last film who has an urgent need because of the shoot cancellations can reach out to the respective head of department (HoD) and then the HoD will reach out to me and I will do the best that I can do,” he said.

The decision on the resumption of shoots will be taken on March 30 after taking the prevailing conditions into consideration.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/nmq0vi/article31076184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-ENTERTAINMENT-BOLLYWOOD-TOURISMjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/coronavirus-concern-over-future-of-daily-wage-earners-as-film-bodies-decide-to-halt-all-shoots/article31076042.ece
217,2020/03/15,Red carpets happening in living rooms,"Glitzy premieres are giving way to screenings at home and via online platforms

Hollywood directors who had their glitzy premieres cancelled due to COVID-19 are finding inventive ways to build buzz for their films — including bringing the red carpet into their living rooms.

Movie festivals such as SXSW in Texas and Tribeca in New York have been scrapped in recent days as the deadly pandemic spreads. This has shorn major titles of the publicity generated by opening night reviews and galas, and left hundreds of unsold indie films without distributors.

The makers of The Carnivores, a quirky thriller-meets-love story set to debut at SXSW, took matters into their own hands by shifting the “premiere” to the cinematographer Adam Minnick’s Austin home.

“We have full catering, we have a red carpet, we have a photographer coming, we have local news,” said director Caleb Michael Johnson.

The red carpet will run from the front porch, through the house, and back to a taco stand — which is being catered for free by a local sponsor.

The idea emerged from a bar conversation the day the festival was cancelled.

“Our world premiere was on Saturday 14th and dammit we wanted to still have our screening on Saturday 14th in Austin.”

The same tactic was employed by U.S. actor David Arquette, whose documentary about his controversial forays into pro wrestling shifted from a SXSW premiere to his home near Hollywood within 24 hours.

Mr. Arquette and his wife flew in the director from the East Coast — and made a dash to wholesale store Costco for drinks — before guests gathered on couches and the living room floor, the Los Angeles Times reported.

‘No substitute’

Mr. Johnson said the more intimate nature of these events put guests at ease about the risk of contagion — but others are skipping physical events altogether, turning to technology.

SXSW’s prestigious film competitions will go ahead as planned, with movies available to juries online.

218,2020/03/15,"A comedian’s role is limited, says ‘Orrey Bujjiga’ actor-comedian Saptagiri","The Telugu funnyman insists that he’s not switched to playing lead roles only

Saptagiri is returning as a comedian in multiple films but hasn’t given up on playing lead roles. He says that it is a myth that comedians can’t flourish as heroes and cites Saptagiri Express and Saptagiri LLB as an example to prove his statement. He has done a special role in Orrey Bujjiga, starring Raj Tarun and as it draws closer to release, he speaks about how careful he is when it comes to playing a hero and it is a misconception that he is averse to playing a cameo in other projects. “My two films did well but Vajrakavachadara Govinda did not. My success rate is around 60 percent and I’m choosing stories that suit me. As a lead, I ensure I don’t repeat roles that I did in over in 150 films I worked in. My monologue from Dana Veera Doora Karna from one of my films won applause and it satiated my thirst as an artiste. Our work as a comedian in films is limited so these intermittent projects which I take up as a hero makes me happy. I may not have got 100 marks, but I did pass the test,” he says about his two films.

He says he’s aware that it doesn’t make sense to spend more money on his films and only when done in a stipulated budget, the project is safe. None of the producers, he says, have lost money on him. His next is Harilo Ranga Hari, a crime drama. “There is so much competition that if you don’t show variation, you are bound to fail. Every Friday is a challenge, I repeat that we as artistes are capable of expressing all emotions but we are chosen to only make the crowd laugh. We gain sympathy only when we cry and that is possible only when we play lead roles. Any film runs on its subject, it has nothing to do with a hero or comedian. We always hope our films will work. Sometimes it fails and we need to analyse where we went wrong and not blame ourselves for doing a lead role. All we need is to have clarity on what we can and cannot.”

He adds, “Every time people see me they say I should work as a comedian and not ignore star hero’s films but when did I say I left? No one approached me or approaches me. I never issued a statement that I will never work as a comedian. Once you begin playing a hero, people presume we won’t do anything smaller. When ever I got an opportunity I grabbed it. You will see me in Orey bujji ga, Tagithe thandana, Krack and many more are in the pipeline.”

Saptagiri and another comedian ‘Shakalaka’ Shankar are a hit combination. When asked when the duo will be seen again, he says very soon and there’s something in the pipeline. The Chittoor-born Saptagiri began his career as an assistant director in producer Dil Raju’s banner and continued for around seven films. While working in Bommarillu and Parugu, director Bhaskar offered him a role. There was no looking back since then. Vijay Kumar Konda, director of Orey Bujjiga has designed an entertaining episode around him in a hospital in that film and Saptagiri vouches that will have all in splits.

About social media, he refrains from commenting. He says he is a sensitive person, and scared to talk media. “I don’t know what they will write when I say something. So far I never hurt anyone and none hurt me. I always think in a positive way.”

Before signing off he talks of his daily regimen. “I am a vegetarian and do yoga every day which is why I am active. For the past 30 years, surya namaskar and pranayama has become my routine. I do it for 45 minutes to one hour. I never stepped into a gym. Practicing yoga made my body flexible. Turning vegetarian also helped me a great deal.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/k1b3rx/article31074046.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Hy16saptagiri-llb,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/comedian-saptagiri-saptagiri-llb-orrey-bujjiga/article31074048.ece
219,2020/03/15,NSP stretch a virtual death trap,"Bridges, culverts have dilapidated parapets in old Khammam district

Danger seems to lurk in the 700-metre (0.7 km) stretch of the Khammam-Aswaraopet section of National Highway 365BB that runs along the Nagarjunasagar Project (NSP) canal devoid of safety barriers in Khammam town.

The canal stretch extending from NTR Circle to Sri Sri Circle, without protection wall, is posing danger to motorists.

In the absence of a protective mechanism, the long canal stretch could turn into a death trap for motorists as hundreds of vehicles criss-cross it daily, commuters fear.

Several narrow bridges and culverts with dilapidated parapet walls and a few without proper railings across the NSP canals and various streams in different parts of the erstwhile Khammam district continue to pose grave danger to commuters.

The NSP left canal, the lifeline of thousands of farmers, spans over a distance of 117 km in the district. It passes through around 35 bridges and culverts built more than four decades ago.

Though some of the bridges, including one at Pallegudem on the Khammam-Mahabubabad main road, were repaired, several others are yet to be refurbished.

There were several fatal road accidents on the bridges and culverts that claimed quite a few lives in the past.

The horrific car accident at Gollagudem on the city suburbs in September last year has turned the spotlight on the need for strengthening safety mechanism at bridges across canals.

A pregnant woman and her mother-in-law were killed when the car they were travelling in nosedived into the NSP canal at Gollagudem. Husband of the pregnant woman, who was driving the car, had a miraculous escape.

Local police attributed the accident to “driver’s mistake” saying he lost control over the wheel while reversing the car on the slope of the approach road of the bridge after attending nature’s call on the roadside.

Ten passengers were killed and 16 others injured when a private bus plunged into the canal of the Palair reservoir after it crashed into a temporary protection wall on the narrow bridge near Nayakangudem in Kusumanchi mandal in 2016.

The enormity of the tragedy and the subsequent public outcry prompted the authorities to initiate corrective measures such as installing crash barriers and laying speed breakers at a few accident prone spots on the Khammam-Suryapet highway.

In the same year, a month-old baby was killed and 10 persons were injured when an RTC bus fell into the canal almost at the same spot.

Twelve passengers were injured when a bus ploughed into the roadside ditch along the weir of the Palair reservoir at Nayakangudem in October 2017.

In a ghastly accident, eight schoolchildren were killed and 20 others injured after a school bus carrying them plunged into a stream while crossing an old bridge without safety barriers at Tungaram in Chandrugonda mandal in March 2012.

As many as 84 black spots were identified in the district’s road network by the police department in coordination with other allied departments recently.

A collaborative strategy has been worked out to fix these black spots to prevent road mishaps. Most of these black spots are located on NH 365BB.

About a half-km. stretch of this NH at the bridge across the weir of the Palair reservoir near Nayakangudem earned notoriety as the treacherous accident-prone spot. More than a dozen accidents occurred on this stretch in the last three years.

Recurring road accidents on the Gopalapuram-NSP canal stretch of the NH 365BB has become a cause of concern for road users.

When contacted, Roads and Buildings Department (NH Wing) Divisional Engineer Thaneswar told The Hindu that a proposal has been sent to the government for erecting crash barriers along the NSP canal stretch of the NH 365BB from NTR Circle to Sri Sri Circle in Khammam to improve road safety.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/pkv6bs/article31076686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16KHAMMAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/nsp-stretch-a-virtual-death-trap/article31076688.ece
220,2020/03/15,"Roads along SRSP, KLIP canals unsafe","Due to Kaleshwaram project, there is steady flow of water in the canals

Unprotected roads all along the SRSP canals and the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP) canals pose a threat to road users, particularly the vehicle-users, in various parts of undivided Karimnagar district.

Though the irrigation authorities had constructed 2,500 protection walls all along the canals at bridges in the district, there are no protection walls or railings all along the distributory canals of the Kakatiya canal. The distribution canals pass through over 250 km. in the district.

Even the SRSP flood flow canal which was filled with KLIP water as part of the rejuvenation programme is also posing threat to the road users all along the canal covering around 160 km.

Majority of the villagers located along the canals use the unprotected roads abutting the canals to reach their destination and there are several incidents of vehicles plunging into the canals killing people.

The roads along the irrigation canals do not have any side walls and railings and there are dangerous curves and unprotected too. Several villagers travel in autorickshaws risking their lives along the canals as there was no other way for them to reach the main roads.

Akula Manohar Rao, a resident of Gattududennapalli village of Manakondur mandal, said that that the villagers of Munjampalli and Edulagattepalli villages are forced to travel on kachha road along the irrigation canal very dangerously, risking their lives, as there are no barricades or railings along the canal.

Earlier, there was hardly any water in the canal. But due to Kaleshwaram project, there is a steady flow of water into the canals and it had become risky for the road users to travel along the canals.

When the government is spending several crores of rupees for the construction of projects and canals, it can also accord priority for the safety of the road users by constructing railings along the canals to prevent accidents and erection of radium signboards, he urged.

Admitting the irrigation canals were now posing threat to the road users due to availability of abundant water following Kaleshwaram project, an irrigation official said that they had erected around one meter earth bund along the roads adjoining canal to avoid accidents.

“We had also informed the villagers not to use the roads along the canal. But, the villagers will use them as the distance is shorter to travel,” he stated.

In the wake of a series of accidents with vehicles plunging into the canals and killing people, he said that they have decided to submit a proposal to the State government for the construction of railings all along the canals in the district following the advice of the State road safety authority.

Ironically, officials of the Telangana road safety authority have not visited the district in spite of several accidents -- to take necessary corrective measures, he noted.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/gcokmx/article31076663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16KNK1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/roads-along-srsp-klip-canals-unsafe/article31076666.ece
221,2020/03/15,"For the police, it’s the drivers who are to be blamed","However, roads don’t lie in undivided Nalgonda district

Two roads diverged in a wood for Robert Frost, the Pulitzer Prize-winning American poet, and he took the one less travelled by, and that made all the difference.

For the 36, including 25 women and a three-year-old, who were killed in ‘canal accidents’ – vehicles plunging into irrigation canals and tanks – here between April 2018 and now, journey was their only choice, the road wasn’t.

Narrow approach roads, further shrunk by pending civil works or ‘avenues’ of Prosopsis juliflora (sarkar thumma), and unsafe roads between their habitations and water bodies – their only motorable road – left many children as orphans.

Accidents, according to the police, were contributed by drivers’ negligence. “The driver was lighting his cigarette, he was on his phone, he did not have a driver’s licence, and the vehicle was also overloaded,” the police said in the various incidents.

But roads don’t lie too. Padamati Tanda of Pedda Adiserala Pally mandal, whose nine women drowned in the Alimineti Madhava Reddy Project (AMRP) canal in April 2018, still has the same road condition, but with a barbed wire fence and closed dug-up road.

“That fence is no protection, you can see that some stones of the fence have fallen into canal. This road is actually caving in, and any time a tractor with cotton or paddy, a school bus or auto-rickshaw could collapse with the road and end up in the canal again,” says Ramavath Dharma, whose mother R. Keli was one among the nine drowned.

About eight kms away in the same mandal, the narrow road to Dugyala near Vadderigudem is no different. On February 27, last week, a car with a family of four went airborne and plunged into the canal after one of the tyres hit a small rock on the curve, drowning three and leaving a nine-year-old as orphan.

“Giving way to the opposite vehicle is very difficult, even the thumma consumes the road. And at nights, since there is only vehicle’s light, the road and the water appear almost the same and there’s no fence between,” Vadderigudem residents say.

Officials in both the cases say residents have been using shorter and unsafe routes to save on distance.

“Padamati thanda’s official road to Waddipatla is not in use for the past 10 years, it became a Donka. Vadderigudem also has a road towards Tirumalagiri, but a kilometre longer.”

Village tanks, on the other hand, without safety fences -- have also been just as dangerous. Fourteen women, all agriculture workers and a child, were killed when their tractor overturned on their way to the fields in Vemulakonda of Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri in June 2018.

The most recent incident was also from its neighbouring Ramannapet mandal, where the bodies of the husband of Sarnenigudem’s village sarpanch along with his son and driver were retrieved on February 22, a day after their SUV lost control on the ‘S curve’ road, and plunged into the Vellanki tank.

And, cautionary road signs such as danger, culvert and ‘S curve’ road ahead, were put up near Nadigudem block only after an SUV with six persons plunged into the Nagarjunasagar Project canal and drowned in October 2019.

The 135-km Nagarjunasagar Left Bank canal, the Sriramsagar Project canal, the Musi, modernised Bunadigani and Pillaipally canals and more than 4,000 village tanks in undivided Nalgonda maximize the districts’ irrigation potential. However, several modernisation works on these canals in the past were limited to lining and did not identify danger spots, address railing and other safety measures.

The AMRP Srisailam Left Bank Canal Project, which is also located in Puttamgandi Tanda of Pedda Adiserla Pally mandal, and runs through the district for almost 136-km. till Udayasamudram reservoir, has damaged lining, leakages, and needs repairs. A ₹ 60 crore proposal for the same, submitted to the government in 2017, remains to be cleared, and officials recently have worked out revised rates and re-submitted it for consideration.

Preventive action and safety measures along the canal have been a mere eyewash.

While the Irrigation department has submitted ₹ 3.4 crore proposal for walls near culverts and road joining, fences at villages and habitations, after the Padamati Tanda tragedy in April 2018 – only ₹9.9 lakh expenditure was allowed to erect 1.6 km-long barbed wire fence. A ₹ 7 crore proposal, for protection walls on the village-side of the AMRP canal, is the latest submission to the government, pending for sanction.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/1f5ixd/article31076634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16NLG-DANGEROUSBUND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/for-the-police-its-the-drivers-who-are-to-be-blamed/article31076635.ece
222,2020/03/15,"Ignoring safety, drivers take dam inspection pathway","When the famous Kadem dam was commissioned in Kadem mandal of what is now Nirmal district in 1962, no one would have expected cars and other vehicles to run on the rather narrow and unsafe inspection pathway on the bund of its left canal. Over the years, the inspection pathway on the 73-km long canal has become a facility for accessing interior villages, especially those that exist alongside the canal in Nirmal as well as Mancherial district.

The rise in level of danger to users of bund road is in proportionate to the increase in number of vehicles plying on the unsuitable gravel track elevated to a height of one to three metres. There have been accidents like a car plunging into the canal in the last few years, the latest coming in October last year in which two youths from Jannaram mandal in Mancherial district lost their lives.

The incident took place near Revojipet village in Dasturabad mandal of Nirmal district. A small stretch of the canal bund road on either side of the spot of the car accident is very dangerous, going by the number of deaths that have taken place here. “At least 10 persons have died on this stretch,” pointed out Mesram Chitru, an Adivasi villager as he talked of lack of safety. He said most deaths occur when there is water flow in the canal.

“The good monsoon has water being released continuously from the Kadem project. The flow of water was strong when the two boys drowned,” he added.

“Yes, the government should think of putting up protection measures like guard rails or stones to make driving safer on the inspection pathway or bund road,” opined Kadem Assistant Eecutive Engineer T. Sreenath. At present, the government gets the gravel road repaired under its programmes. The about 75-km. long Saraswathi canal of SRSP dam in Nizamabad, which runs through Nirmal, Soan, Lamanchanda, Mamda, Khanapur and Kadem mandals in Nirmal district, does not pose as much a threat to life as the Kadem left canal does.

223,2020/03/15,Lifetime of grief for parents of Sai Sangeeth and Shashank,"The two were washed away in Kadem canal

Adlapuram Laxman and Swaroopa, who run Karimala Junior College in Jannaram of Mancherial district, have not come to grips with their personal tragedy which snatched away from them their 18-year-old son Sai Sangeeth and 26-year-old nephew Komroju Shashank in October last year.

Not a single day passes without the parents grieving about the duo who were washed away in the Kadem canal near Revojipet village in Dasturabad mandal of Nirmal distirct.

""Look at this hydroponic model developed by our Sai. He had made this miniature model in order to convince bankers of the business prospects so that he gets a loan,"" Ms. Swaroopa pointed out with tears in her eyes.

""He was definitely set for bigger things in life,"" observed Sai's father as he looked towards the vacant seat at the work table of his son.

""He keenly read the success stories of the likes of Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg before deciding to do something unique and make a mark as a businessman,"" he added.

Despite the age difference, Sai Sangeeth and Shashank were close to each other.

The former had learnt a lot from the latter who was a computer science graduate.

On October 26, 2019, the cousins had been driving on the canal bund road near Revojipet in Laxman's car when the tragedy struck. ""We do not know who was driving the car and why they went there,"" Mr. Laman recalled.

""According to a villager the car slid into the canal after hitting a treacherous spot while being driven in reverse,"" the father remembered. ""If only they had known swimming they would have come out of the speedily flowing water alive,"" he lamented as he looked into the distant horizon, lost in thoughts.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/l72se8/article31076609.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16PARENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/lifetime-of-grief-for-parents-of-sai-sangeeth-and-shashank/article31076610.ece
224,2020/03/15,MLC’s claim of China visit creates a mild flutter,"Colleagues heave a sigh of relief on coming to know that it was a few years ago

The China visit of a TRS MLC Egge Mallesham created a mild flutter in the Legislative Council on Saturday.

As soon as Mr. Mallesham took his turn during a debate on coronavirus and said he had visited China, his colleagues sitting next to him were rattled and raised an alarm “When?”. Mr. Mallesham pacified them saying that it was not any time in the recent past, but three or four years ago. He also said that had he been there recently, he would have straight away gone to a hospital on arrival. There was no need for panic because he was under the watchful eyes of everyone all these days.

The banter in the House did not stop with that. Another MLC Farooq Hussain ruled out coronavirus for Muslim women because they were clad in burqas which had masks to cover their faces. Hindu women and college going girls were also well protected these days because they covered their faces with ‘chunnis’. Perhaps, the most chuckle was reserved for him when he said he walked away from a trader pretending to answer a call on his mobile phone when the latter came up to him coughing during a transaction at his shop.

There’s more to a name!

What’s in a name .. that which we call a rose by another name would smell as sweet goes the old adage. But the same is apparently not the case with some names.

Parakal MLA Ch. Dharma Reddy complained in the Assembly that the name of his native village has not been changed “officially” in spite of repeated requests. The earlier name of the village “Dongala Singaram” (with part reference to thieves) has been changed to more sanguine “Pragati Singaram” (meaning place of development) several years ago. But the official gazette was yet to be issued to notify the change and the old name continues to be in some official records.

Police taken unawares

The police were taken aback when a large group of ABVP and PDSU activists suddenly landed near the Osmania gate of Public Gardens in a bid to gate crash into the Assembly premises on Wednesday demanding higher budget allocation for the education sector.

The high-drama of police versus mob lasted nearly 30 minutes as the uniformed men did not anticipate such a situation and were totally unprepared. Some youth had already barged inside the premises by the time additional forces arrived. The police beat up the youth ‘black and blue’ and, as a result, 25 protesters suffered injuries, but the damage was done by then. Questions were raised on the credibility of the intelligence agencies even as the blame game went up in the chambers of senior officers. A few officers bore the brunt of the ire of their top brass and also the political bosses.

By evening, Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar had issued a statement justifying use of force under the protection of law to control the unruly crowd. He said “Assembly is a very sacred institution” where proceedings cannot be allowed to be disrupted.

226,2020/03/15,Officials step up campaign on prevention of coronavirus,"Bar on operation of places of public gathering to be enforced strictly: Collector

In the wake of a woman from the region, with a travel history to Italy, testing positive for COVID-19 in Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad on Saturday, the district administration has scaled up preventive measures to check the spread of the contagious disease.

The entire machinery of the District Medical and Health Department and other allied wings, including the field level functionaries such as ANMs and ASHAs has been activated to spread awareness on preventive measures in the form of distribution of pamphlets on how to keep coronavirus disease at bay. The isolation wards at the State-run hospitals in both Kothagudem and Bhadrachalam have been fully equipped with adequate beds and requisite medical staff, including doctors, as a precautionary measure.

The district administration also geared up to strictly enforce the State government’s order to shut all educational institutions, cinema theatres, bars, sports stadiums, swimming pools and other major facilities to avoid public gatherings in the next couple of weeks.

This apart, a strict surveillance is being maintained on all those with travel history to coronavirus hit countries and also those who have been in contact with the only one confirmed case of COVID-19 from the region to ensure their screening for coronavirus as a precautionary step, sources said.

In a statement, Collector M. V. Reddy said stern action will be taken against those who violate the closure orders issued by the government to avoid major public gatherings as part of preventive steps to check the spread of coronavirus.

The provisions of Section 2 of the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897, and the relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act would be invoked if necessary, he added.

227,2020/03/15,Third COVID-19 case confirmed in Telangana,"Officials tracking all those the patient came in contact with

A third case of COVID-19 caused by coronavirus was confirmed in Telangana on Sunday. The patient is a 48-year-old man who returned from the Netherlands a few days ago and got admitted into Gandhi Hospital on March 11. His samples sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune tested positive for the virus. Another sample, collected from an air hostess tested negative at NIV Pune.

According to statistics presented by Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the three positive cases from the State include the one who was discharged. The index (first) case from here was discharged on Friday night after recovering completely.

From Sunday morning, the Health Department’s District Rapid Response Teams (RRT) started the task of tracking all the people the third COVID-19 patient came in contact with by speaking to the person and his family members. Apart from three from his immediate family, nine more people, including extended family members, were isolated at Gandhi Hospital.

Precautionary test

Their swab samples would be tested for presence of the virus as a precautionary measure. Officials from the department said that the process of tracing all contacts was going on.

Officials said that widespread awareness about symptoms and helpline number ‘104’ is working effectively as the person had dialled the number after developing fever.

In case of the second positive case, a 24-year-old woman who returned from Italy, at least 28 people were identified as having come in contact with the patient. That includes three family members, and around nine people from a private hospital where she consulted after developing symptoms.

Home isolation

While the family members were admitted at the government hospital, the remaining 25 are under home isolation whose condition will be monitored for 14-days.

“She was at the private hospital for a short while. After knowing her travel history and symptoms, doctors immediately contacted the Health Department,” officials said, adding that anxiety among her neighbours were quelled by explaining them how coronavirus spreads, why would they be not at risk and other details.

The Karimnagar Consumers’ Council in association with the Indian Institute of Public Administration (IIPA) and Lok Satta voluntary organisation organised World Consumer Rights Day at Film Bhavan in the town on Sunday.

Speakers urged the State government to crack the whip on those indulging in adulteration of food and other products.

Stating that food adulteration was more dangerous than COVID-19, they said that there was rampant adulteration of oil, fast food, eatables in hotels, snacks sold in kirana shops and other junk food.

Declaration of holidays alone would not check the spread of COVID-19, they said and urged the government to accord priority to sanitisation. They also requested the government to start providing breakfast to students in government schools on the lines of midday meals.

Karimnagar Consumers’ Council president K. Ramachandra Reddy wanted the revival of consumer clubs in educational institutions to empower students.

A poster on new Consumer Rights Protection Act 2019 was also released and government urged to implement the new Act in true letter and spirit.

229,2020/03/15,Police on high alert on reports of Maoist recruitment,"General public asked to report on movement of Naxalites across State borders

Have the Maoists descended on the erstwhile Adilabad district to recruit cadres in a big way? The extent and manner in which the police of Kumram Bheem Asifabad and Mancherial districts are making preparations to counter the reported move of the naxalites indicates only this.

Combing operations apart, the police has activated the network of former extremists, who have been designated as special police officers (SPO) in police stations which look after the inter-State riverine border shared with Maharashtra. Police has also put out a word asking the commoners to inform them of movement of people who raise a suspicion.

The threat perception is so high that the police has issued a warning to all police officers not to respond to calls on dial 100 emergency service after dusk or move singly. Apparently, such calls could be traps for the security forces.

According to sources, six or seven teams of Maoists, number in each team unspecified, are said to have crossed the Pranahita near Motlaguda-Rampur in Dahegaon mandal and Jilleda and Kannergaon in Penchikalpet mandal of KB Asifabad and Motlaguda, Sumputam, Makkidigudem and Kallempally in Vemanpalli of Mancherial district. They are said to be moving in the hinterland on a recruting spree.

The naxalites are also reported to have entered the thick forest, most of which is now either the core or buffer area of Kawal Tiger Reserve. Special police forces are combing forest in Lingapur mandal and in Jannaram-Kadem-Khanapur stretch, an old route that the extremists take to arrive till the interiors of Sirikonda mandal, earlier their stronghold.

Experts in Maoist affairs, however, point out that the extremists do not prefer moving in the forests in these areas in summer months. “The dry tree cover will not be helpful as camouflage,” the expert observed.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hruxt4/article31074525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16ADBRIVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/police-on-high-alert-on-reports-of-maoist-recruitment/article31074526.ece
230,2020/03/15,Adivasi women’s movement against belt shops set to revive in Adilabad agency areas,"Adivasi Mahila Organisation’s leader Kova Indira says there are at least 40 belt shops in Kerameri mandal headquarter village alone; police turn unresponsive, ditto from tribal men

As alcoholism has become a scourge in the agency areas of former composite Adilabad district, the dormant anti belt shop - euphemism for an illegal liquor vend - movement of the Adivasi women could see a revival.

The raid conducted by aboriginal women and children on a belt shop in Devapur village of Indervelli mandal of Adilabad district on March 13 is a pointer unless the government gets cracking to curb the rampant unauthorised sale of liquor in almost every corner of the tribal land in Adilabad and Kumram Bheem (KB) Asifabad districts.

Call to action

“There are at least 40 belt shops in Kerameri mandal headquarter village alone,” alleged Kova Indira, leader of Adivasi Mahila Organisation which has spearheaded the anti belt shop movement in KB Asifabad district. “If authorities start closing down belt shops in Narnoor, Utnoor and Indervelli mandals, it will take them at least a month to sanitise the area,” was how a Raj Gond tribe elder in Adilabad district put it.

“Women become targets of violence unleashed by drunken men, we are unable to educate our children because of alcoholism which is on the rise because of easy availability of liquor,” Ms. Kova said of the prime reason for the increasing family discord in ethnic homes in the agency. “Only a few days ago one drunken resident of Sakda village and another from Surdapur got killed in road accidents,” she added, pointing to the catastrophical effect of untimely deaths on tribal families, thanks to alochol addiction.

Raid and destroy

The anti belt shop movement had started in Kerameri mandal in KB Asifabad district late November last year when aboriginal women started raiding illegal liquor vends and destroying the seized stocks. In order to control the situation from going out of hand the police had promised to shut down the illegal vends, but evidently nothing happened.

“We took the assurance of the police seriously then. But time seems to have come now to restart ‘action’,” the movement leader said while discussing the issue with women from her village, Modi. “We will soon convene a meeting of all women who were involved in the movement earlier to chart out a course of action,” she averred.

Ms. Kova was also sore over the lack of support to the movement from the men of ethnic tribes. In Adilabad district, however, the sarpanch of Devapur, Marsakolla Jaku, has promised support to the women’s efforts declaring a ₹ 5,000 fine on anyone selling liquor in the village.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/adivasi-womens-anti-belt-shop-movment-set-to-revive-in-adilabad/article31074428.ece

District authorities had given serious instructions to all educational institutions - including professional colleges - to declare holidays till March 31. Authorities have informed the institutions to keep only those students appearing for the SSC examinations in the residential schools and send the rest to their homes.

Special isolation wards

The District Medical and Health Department had already opened a COVID-19 Isolation Ward at the District Headquarters Hospital in Karimnagar. It had also ensured that the two private medical colleges opened isolation wards equipped with a physician, pulmonologist and other staff to provide 24x7 service.

Hoteliers were informed not to give rooms to people who come from abroad. People were also informed to dial 104 during emergencies and for any help with regard to COVID-19.

The Commissioner of Police warned the people of serious action for posting rumours in social media about COVID-19.

232,2020/03/15,‘People with vested interests playing into the hands of rival parties’,"BSP supremo Mayawati’s veiled attack on Bhim Army chief

In a veiled attack on Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, BSP supremo Mayawati on Sunday said people with vested interests are playing into the hands of rival political parties and claimed they have nothing to do with B.R. Ambedkar and his movement.

“Even now, people with vested interests are playing into the hands of rival political parties. They have nothing to do with Babasaheb Ambedkar and his movement. Nor they have anything to do with Manyavar Kanshi Ram’s sacrifice and austerity,” Ms. Mayawati said without naming the Bhim Army chief.

“The truth is that these people are only using their (Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram) names to realise their vested interests,” she said in a statement issued by the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) central office in New Delhi.

Ms. Mayawati’s statement assumes significance as it comes on the birth anniversary of BSP founder Kanshi Ram and amid reports of Mr. Azad floating a new political party.

Sharpening her attack, she said, “Kanshi Ram had written a book ‘Chamcha Yug’ to alert the innocent Dalits, tribals, people from backwards castes and from other oppressed section from selfish and ‘bikaau’ (saleable) people like these.”

‘Divide and rule’

Ms. Mayawati also said, “formation of new parties or organisations will not benefit these people, but it will lead to success the policy of divide and rule of the casteist parties and people opposing these sections, thereby making these people helpless, and then they will never be able to stand on their feet.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/people-with-vested-interests-playing-into-the-hands-of-rival-parties/article31076354.ece
233,2020/03/15,"Wheat harvesting to be delayed in Punjab, Haryana","Inclement weather takes a toll; farmers, facing financial losses, a worried lot in both the States

The recent rain could delay harvesting of the standing wheat crop by at least a week in Punjab and Haryana , an agriculture expert and farmers said on Sunday.

Standing crop in the two States had been hit by heavy rain, wind and hailstorm in the past few days, after which both the State governments had ordered “girdawari” (revenue survey) to assess crops damage.

Most parts of Punjab and Haryana experienced widespread rain with gusty winds in the past week, according to the Meteorological Department. Another forecast of rain, expected to hit the region from March 20, has only increased the worry of the farmers.

Dilbag Singh, a farmer in Patiala’s Fatehpur, who has sown wheat in around 16 acres, said there’s no doubt that the harvesting will be delayed due to inclement weather. “Rain water is still standing in my field. Gusty winds have flattened the crop. At least 50% of my crop is damaged. Even if clear weather prevails now it will difficult to recover the losses,” he said.

Wheat, the main rabi (winter) crop is sown between late October till December while the harvesting of the crop usually starts from April onwards. The wheat procurement season in Punjab and Haryana usually begins on April 1.

P.S. Rangi, an agriculture expert and former Punjab State Farmers Commission adviser told The Hindu that the unseasonal rain has damaged the wheat crop not just in Punjab and Haryana but also in western Uttar Pradesh.

“The crop, which has flattened in fields, will be difficult to harvest.. even when it is harvested, mostly manually, the yield will certainly drop. Also water logging at this time will damage the crop. The inclement weather has caused extensive damage to the wheat crop in may parts, and if it rain in coming days then definitely it could be a cause of worry for farmers,” he said.

‘Unfavourable condition’

Mr. Rangi said that the harvesting of wheat is likely to be delayed by at least a week on account of unfavourable weather conditions. “The wheat crop now needs bright sunshine as the crop is all set to be harvested in the next few days. If overcast condition prevail and it rains the wheat crop will absorb moisture, which will delay harvesting.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5i2fth/article31076340.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE15-WHEAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wheat-harvesting-to-be-delayed-in-punjab-haryana/article31076341.ece
234,2020/03/15,Students blocked from taking out march at AMU,"Sixty of them booked for protest to mourn death of youth

Student protesters tried to take out a candlelight march at Aligarh Muslim University here to mourn the death of a youth who had died of gunshot injuries sustained in violent clashes during protests over the amended citizenship act last month, but were blocked at the main gate itself, police said.

Sixty students, including 50 unnamed, have been booked by police at the Civil Lines police station in connection with the protests at the AMU campus on Saturday night.

Ten students were named for violating Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code.

The protesters tried to march towards the Collectorate, which is located close to AMU, to submit a memorandum to senior district officials but were thwarted from doing so by police personnel who reached the spot and blocked them at the Sir Syed Crossing, the main university campus gate, according to Civil Lines Circle Officer (CO) Anil Samania.

Candlelight vigil

Earlier in the evening, a group of protesting students had announced that they were going to hold a candlelight march to mourn the death of Mohammad Tariq Munawwar, a youth who was injured on February 23 at Upper Kot and succumbed to his gunshot injuries late on Friday night at the Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College Hospital inside AMU, where he was being treated.

The protesting students were demanding the arrest of two persons who were booked in the case but are still at large.

Circle Officer Samania told media that the main accused Vinay Varshney has already been arrested and the police were following up on the matter.

“The protesters were insisting on proceeding towards the Collectorate and they were not ready to hand over their memorandum at the Babey Sir Syed gate where senior district officials were ready to accept the memorandum,” he claimed.

Later, the memorandum was handed over to officials, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/students-blocked-from-taking-out-march-at-amu/article31076332.ece
235,2020/03/15,Distress sale of mustard in Haryana as govt. yet to start procurement,"‘Farmers can’t afford to wait for long since they have no storage facility, have loans to repay and many other expenses to meet’

In urgent need of money to pay for Haj, Abdur Razzaq, a resident of Murad Bas village in Nuh, sold off his mustard crop to a commission agent at the new grain market here for a price far lower than the minimum support price as the Haryana government is yet to begin the procurement process.

Accompanied by his farmer sons and two grandsons, Abdur, on Friday sold off around 26 quintal of mustard from his two acre land at ₹3,150 per quintal — much lower than the ₹4,425 per quintal MSP fixed by the Haryana government for the crop this year. Abdur said he suffered a loss of around ₹26,000 but had little choice as the government was yet to announce even the schedule for procurement.

“I had to pay ₹2.40 lakh for Haj today (Friday). So I could not wait even for a single day,” said Abdur, sporting a white flowing beard.

His son Javed, with a land holding of only half an acre, also sold off his entire produce — around four quintals — at the same rate as his father. He too had to repay a loan of around ₹7,000, contribute to his father’s Haj and also had some other immediate expenses to take care of. He said he had borrowed money from private lenders for irrigation and seeds and had to repay them.

Kisan Credit Card

Javed said he did not know the procedure to procure the Kisan Credit Card. “I have heard about the Kisan Credit Card, but do not know how to procure it,” he said.

Bustan, an elderly farmer from Salaheri village, too sold off his mustard from over an acre of land — around six quintals — at a price almost ₹1,000 per quintal lesser than the MSP. “Farmers with small land holdings cannot afford to wait for the government to start the procurement. Most of them sell off their crop soon after harvesting. It is only the big farmers who avail of the government’s procurement policy,” chipped in Aas Mohammad, another farmer. He added that almost half the farmers in Nuh district who produce mustard sell off their produce by mid-March every year while the procurement starts only in April.

He said the farmers could not afford to wait for the government to start the procurement as they had no storage facility, had loans to repay and many other expenses to meet. Also, the government agencies had procured mustard at only two of the four mandis — Tauru and Punhana — last year and not at Nuh. “We don’t even know when the government would start the procurement process and whether it would buy mustard at Nuh or not,” said Aas Mohammad.

Besides, the commission agents make immediate payment while the payment from the government takes weeks. This too discourages farmers from selling their produce to government agencies.

Sitting in a huddle with other commission agents sipping tea, Laxman Kumar, 62, himself a commission agent, lamented that business was slow this year and the mandi, usually abuzz with activity during this time of the year, wore a deserted look.

“The commission agents are too busy to find time even for meals during this time of the year, but now they are sitting idle. It is partially because the unexpected rain has delayed the arrival of mustard, and also because mustard production is less this time round. The farmers, helped by better irrigation facilities, have shifted to wheat,” said Laxman.

The agents said starting the procurement process early could be of little help this time round as the mustard arriving in the mandi had 20-25% moisture while the government bought it only at 7-8% moisture.

Few takers for scheme

As per the policy, the Haryana government procures the crop of only those farmers who have got themselves registered under the “Meri Fasal Mera Byora” scheme, but only 8,203 farmers in Nuh district with a total area of 40,220 acres have registered themselves this year. A market committee employee said the government publicised the scheme, made announcements in the villages and extended the deadline several times, but still people were reluctant to get themselves registered. It was partially because Nuh is a Muslim-dominated region and they have little faith in the BJP-ruled government and also because most of the farmers took the land on lease for agriculture and did not actually own it.

No date for procurement

District Food and Supply Controller, Nuh, Seema Sharma told The Hindu that the department had received a letter on Thursday evening designating Tauru and Punhana mandis for procurement of mustard but no date was provided to initiate the process. She added that there was also no word on the policy for procurement.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yyrfee/article31076323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE15-MANDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/distress-sale-of-mustard-in-haryana-as-govt-yet-to-start-procurement/article31076324.ece
236,2020/03/15,New law in U.P. to recover costs for damaging property,"Claims Tribunals to decide compensation, awards declared final by Ordinance

The Uttar Pradesh government has now armed itself with a stringent new law to recover compensation from those who damage public and private property during protests and riots.

Claims for compensation will be decided by designated ‘Claims Tribunals’ that will be authorised to investigate complaints and assess the damage.

The State government on Sunday notified the ‘Uttar Pradesh Recovery of Damage to Public and Private Property Ordinance, 2020, promulgated by the Governor, Anandiben Patil. The State Cabinet had met under Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Friday and approved the ordinance.

The owner of any private property or the head of the office concerned in respect of public property, may file claims for compensation within three months of any incident that causes any damage uring public protests, bandhs or riots. The claim can cite as respondents those who “exhorted” or “instigated” or “committed” acts that caused the damage, as well as those named by the police.

Every order or award passed by the Claims Tribunal would be “final” and no appeal against such orders would be ""maintainable"" before any court, it said. Also, no civil court will have the jurisdiction to entertain any questions regarding the claims.

The chairperson of the Claims Tribunal would be a retired district judge while its members would be of the rank of additional commissioner.

The Claims Tribunal would have the power to attach the property of the respondents and publicise their names, addresses and photographs to warn public against purchasing the property.

""As soon as the order for recovery of damages is passed, the property of the respondent to be attached and the authorities shall be directed to publish the name address along with a photograph of a warning for public at large not to purchase property attached,"" the notification said.

The Claims Tribunal shall have all the powers of Civil Court for the purpose of taking evidence on oath and enforcing the attendance of witnesses and compelling the discovery and production of documents and material objects, the notification said.

The claims would cover not only damage to public and private property but also the costs borne by the police and administration in taking preventive measures.

The liability would be fixed on the alleged perpetrators as well as those accused of instigating or exhorting them. The Tribunal will have to adhere to the principles of natural justice, issue notices and receive replies from the respondents, but it also has the power to decide a matter ex parte, if those given notices do not respond.

The pendency of any criminal proceedings relating to the incidents would not be a bar on the Tribunals proceeding with their work.

The Claims Tribunal also has the power to appoint a Claims Commissioner to estimate the damage caused and investigate liability to assist it in holding the inquiry. The compensation, if unpaid, can be recovered through the District Collectors as arrears of land revenue.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/d5auhf/article31076018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15YOGI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/new-law-in-up-to-recover-costs-for-damaging-property/article31076019.ece

239,2020/03/15,3 arrested after boy found dead in Arunachal school,"The boy was missing after a fight among a group of students at the end of the school’s games and sports period, a police report said

The police in Arunachal Pradesh’s Papum Pare district on Sunday arrested three employees of a school after a Class VI student was found dead. Two minors were also detained.

The incident happened at the Vivekananda Kendra Vidyalaya (VKV) in the Sher area near Kimin town on Friday evening.

“The autopsy report said the boy died of asphyxia. A case was registered against the three employees for abetting suicide,” the district’s Superintendent of Police Jimmy Chiram told The Hindu from district headquarters Yupia.

He said three employees of the school were arrested and two boys detained for production in a local court and Juvenile Justice Board respectively. The case against the employees was under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code, and the minor boys under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act (punishment for cruelty to child).

According to the police inquiry report, the boy was missing after a fight among a group of students at the end of the school’s games and sports period. Two students found him dead almost two hours later in the bathroom of the hostel.

Probe demanded

The district’s Child Welfare Committee (CWC) has demanded an impartial probe into the incident. CWC members from Yupia and State capital Itanagar visited the school on Saturday and recorded the statements of the teachers, students and others besides asking the school authorities to install CCTV cameras.

The VKV in Sher was in the news in 2019 after some students of lower classes were allegedly sodomised by their seniors. The same year, the school authorities had also rusticated 60 students of Classes XI and X for vandalising school and hostel property.

Kani Nada Maling, general secretary of the Arunachal Pradesh Women’s Welfare Society, also visited the school. She said most of the students were found to be too scared to report any wrongdoing.

240,2020/03/15,Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker says decision on holding floor test will be announced on March 16,"Governor has asked the Congress government to seek a trust vote after his address in the Assembly on Monday.

Madhya Pradesh Speaker NP Prajapati on Sunday refused to commit whether he will order a floor test in the Legislative Assembly on March 16 as directed by Governor Lalji Tandon to Chief Minister Kamal Nath.

All eyes are on Mr. Prajapati whose call on the floor test — allowing or disallowing it on Monday on the first day of the Budget session — will have a bearing on the prevailing political situation in the Congress-ruled State.

“This will be known tomorrow,” Mr. Prajapti told reporters in Bhopal when queried on whose order prevails in ordering a floor test.

“I said yesterday that a decision which I will have to take, I don’t take it pre-decided. This question is like taking a blind shot. I don’t want to be a party to it. I will read out my ruling tomorrow,” the Speaker said.

The Kamal Nath-led government in Madhya Pradesh was pushed to the brink on Tuesday when 22 MLAs resigned from the party, immediately after senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia quit the party. He later joined the BJP.

The Speaker has so far accepted resignations of six of the 22 MLAs, bringing down the effective strength of the House to 222 and the new majority mark at 112. The opposition BJP has 107 MLAs.

Earlier in the day, state Public Relations Minister P C Sharma said that although the Governor has asked the Congress government to seek a trust vote after his (Governor’s) address in the Assembly on Monday, the Speaker is empowered to decide the proceedings of the House and he would take a call on it.

According to sources, the BJP is keen to go for a floor test on Monday itself while the Congress is in favour of buying some time with the hope to win back some of the rebel legislators.

If the BJP can win over 300 seats in Uttar Pradesh by “spreading lies” then with honest hard work, truth and by bringing people together, “we can win 351 seats” in 2022, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said on Sunday.

The Assam government on Sunday shut down all educational institutions, cinema halls, multiplexes, gyms and swimming pools besides suspending school annual exams “with immediate effect” up to March 29 to prevent the possibility of the outbreak of COVID-19.

The order followed the quarantining of two “symptomatic” men who returned from Kerala and the rescue of a couple from Switzerland who locals presumed to be infected with the virus.

All exams except those of CBSE and SEBA (State Board) have been postponed too,” Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna said.

In some districts such as Sivasagar, the authorities have banned all functions including spiritual gatherings and periodic convergence at the namghars, Vaishnavite prayer halls.

Mr. Krishna said 10,605 people have been surveyed so far while 599 others who came in contact with COVID-19 have been identified and kept under home surveillance. The samples of five symptomatic cases among them were found to be negative.

Those under home surveillance include a doctor couple in western Assam’s Barpeta who returned from Saudi Arabia a few days ago.

“Janta Mange Jawaab: In Dangaiyo se vasooli kab” (The public want to know: when will these rioters pay for the damages?) read the headline of the poster.

251,2020/03/15,Campaign against CAA reaches Odisha,"Samajwadi Vichar Yatra started from Delhi, will culminate in Hyderabad

Members of Samajwadi Vichar Yatra, involved in creating awareness against CAA, NPR and NRC, entered Berhampur in Odisha on Saturday after travelling through 11 States.

The yatra started from New Delhi on January 30 and will culminate in Hyderabad on March 23. It has been taken up by an organisation named ‘Samajwadi Samagam’. Several other organisations such as Rashtra Seva Dal, Hind Mazdoor Sabha, National Coordination of Public Movements (NAPM), Hum Bharat Ke Log, Yusuf Meher Ali Centre, People’s Association in Grassroots Action and Movement Federation are supporters of this yatra.

The members of the yatra were welcomed in Berhampur by human rights activists including president of Jan Jagran Abhiyan, Madhusudan Sethi, and social activist Rabi Rath. The yatra is being led by the general secretary of Samajwadi Samagam, Arun Srivastava, who is also the convener of this campaign, and the co-convener, Dr. Sunilam.

Plea for resolution

Mr. Srivastava and Dr. Sunilam appealed the Naveen Patnaik government to pass a resolution in the State Assembly against CAA, NRC and NPR. According to them, 14 States have already passed similar resolutions and Odisha should follow this trend to protect the basic rights of its citizens.

They demanded that the huge amount of money that is to be used for implementation of “anti-people” CAA, NPR and NRC in the country should be used to enhance employment guarantee for the poor.

They alleged that through demonetisation, GST, repeal of Article 370, CAA, NPR and NRC, the BJP government at the Centre has destroyed the economy of the country. “We feel a large number of citizens of our country will not participate in the coming census because of NPR and NRC and there is no law in our country to take action against them for not divulging personal and private information,” said Dr. Sunilam.

They were also critical of the massive restrictions being put in place over COVID-19 threat. “In stead of creating coronavirus panic, the Union government should try to end the communal hatred virus,” said Mr. Srivastava.

As part of the yatra, they are also creating awareness against rising unemployment and displacement. They also demanded the release of all the political prisoners in Jammu and Kashmir for start of democratic process for election as early as possible.

From Berhampur, this yatra will go to Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Angul and Sambalpur before entering West Bengal.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pcypyz/article31072038.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE15SAMAJWADIYATRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/campaign-against-caa-reaches-odisha/article31072039.ece

With masks vanishing from shops following the COVID-19 alert, women in Odisha’s Cuttack district have come forward to manufacture masks and make buyers in rural pockets aware about the importance of staying sanitised.

As many as 150 women in two blocks of Cuttack are stitching over 5,000 mask per day. These masks are sold at ₹10 per piece and can be sterilized at home.

“While manufacturing the masks, we ensure the place is completely disinfected and women themselves are wearing masks. We have so far supplied 1,2000 pieces. Three women self-help groups are involved in the manufacturing of the masks,” said Rina Moharana of Maa Mangala Producer Group.

“We had mooted the idea of manufacturing precautionary masks when rising cases of swine flu had triggered panic. Now, after COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic, women who are part of self-help groups have started manufacturing the masks, which are in great demand,” said Bipin Rout, Deputy Chief Executive of Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS).

Although the masks being stitched by the women SHGs do not meet medical standards, they are very handy compared with handkerchiefs used by people to cover their nose and mouth, said Mr. Rout.

“Apart from manufacturing masks, the women groups also regularly sensitise the people coming to buy them,” he said.

257,2020/03/15,Greenfield highway to connect Konkan,"Taking a cue from the previous government’s ambitious Mumbai-Nagpur super expressway named after Shiv Sena founder Balasaheb Thackeray, the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Saturday announced a new 500-kilometer greenfield highway connecting Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts of Konkan which will run parallel to the sea coast.

Announcing this on the last day of the Budget session, the Urban Development Department (UDD) minister Eknath Shinde said the road would bring Konkan closer to international market. “The expressway will start from Chirle village in Raigad district where Mumbai Trans Harbour Link connecting Sewri to Nhava-Sheva port ends and will run up to Patradevi at Maharashtra-Goa border in Sindhudurg district,” said Mr. Shinde.

Konkan being one of the strongholds of Shiv Sena, the opposition had accused the MVA government for neglecting it.

The road will be built by Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) which falls under Mr. Shinde’s department. “The MSRDC has been asked to prepare a technical and financial feasibility report of the project,” he said.

“This road will run parallel to Konkan’s coastline and will boost tourism. It will give access to Alphonso mangoes, cashew, betelnut, and coconut produced in the region to the international market, and create employment opportunities for the locals,” he said, adding that locals would be taken in to confidence before going ahead with the project.

258,2020/03/15,Devendra Fadnavis seeks action against Umar Khalid for inciting Delhi violence,"On last day of Budget session, Assembly witnesses pandemonium over CAA, NPR

Former chief minister and Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday asked the Home Department to take action against former Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student leader Umar Khalid alleging his speech in Amravati asking the people to come out and protest on the streets led to the violence in New Delhi.

“Umar Khalid had addressed a rally in Amravati and asked people to come out on streets during the visit of United States president Donald Trump to India. Riots took place in Delhi on the day Mr. Trump visited India. The State government did not take any action against him,” Mr. Fadnavis said during the discussion on the budget on the last day of the session on Saturday.

Earlier, Mr Fadnavis speaking on the budgetary demands for Home Department transgressed in to the debate over Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and National Citizenship Register (NRC) which led to the uproar in the Assembly.

Objection to remarks

The treasury benches objected to Mr. Fadnavis speaking on issues not related to the Budget to which the Opposition said that it was speaking on policy issues. Sudhir Mungantiwar (BJP) read out a list of subjects which could not be talked about in Assembly and said there was nothing wrong in the LoP’s speech.

Minority Affairs minister Nawab Malik and Food and Civil Supplies minister Chhagan Bhujbal said the CAA matter was being heard in Supreme Court and could not be discussed in the House. Mr. Fadnavis had said that CAA doesn’t take away citizenship of Indian citizens. “But rumours are being spread about CAA. In NPR, information is optional. Prime Minister had already said NRC is not being implemented,” he said.

Mr. Bhujbal and Mr. Mungantiwar indulged in sharp exchanges over the names of each other’s party. Members from both sides entered the well of the Assembly and traded charges and shouted slogans. The Speaker Nana Patole adjourned the House for 30 minutes. After the House regrouped, Mr. Patole ordered that the name calling by NCP and BJP be expunged.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/devendra-fadnavis-seeks-action-against-umar-khalid-for-inciting-delhi-violence/article31071973.ece

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar appealed to the people to make sure crowded places are avoided. “Even in case of weddings, I appeal to both sides to limit the number of invitees. The administration has given clear instructions for various establishments to follow. In case anyone is found flouting it, strict action will be taken against concerned establishments,” he said.

Sudhir Mungantiwar (BJP) pointed out that the government resolution (GR) allowing MLAs to use their fund for publicity against novel coronavirus in their respective constituencies has not been issued to which Mr. Pawar said that 10% of the ₹3 crore MLA fund can be used.

Meanwhile, Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi has written to Commissioner of Police Parambir Singh stating, “Some people are spreading false information on WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter or other social media which can lead to panic among people.

Australia’s white-ball captain Aaron Finch has revealed he had nightmares during India’s 2018 tour when pacers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah were taking his wicket “for fun”.

Opening the innings, Finch struggled across all three formats during the India series, especially while trying to navigate Bhuvneshwar’s inswinging deliveries.

“I’d wake up in a cold sweat, he’s (Bhuvneshwar) got me out a lot with the ball moving back in,” Finch said in Amazon’s recently released docu-series titled ‘The Test’

The Indian seamer had scalped Finch’s wicket four times, including during all three ODIs and one T20I, in the six-match limited-overs series.

Finch also said that he would wake up at night just thinking about facing Bumrah the next day.

“There were times that I’d wake up in the night thinking about getting out. Thinking I’m facing Bumrah again tomorrow, he’s getting me out for fun,” Finch said.

India enjoyed an unprecedented summer, winning the Border Gavaskar Trophy 3-1, its first-ever Test series win on the Australian soil. It was followed by a 2-1 victory in the ODIs, while the T20 series ended in a 1-1 draw.

Bumrah was instrumental in India’s historic Test victory. The right-arm pacer emerged as the joint highest wicket-taker in the four-match series, claiming 21 wickets.

The Test, which is an eight-part series, shows the Australian cricket team’s journey of redemption from the 2018 ball-tampering scandal to a successful defence of the Ashes.

The BCCI on Friday postponed the start of this year’s IPL from March 29 to April 15 in wake of the pandemic, which has caused massive upheaval across the globe.

On Saturday, the BCCI and the eight IPL team owners met in Mumbai to discuss the various options after government-imposed travel restrictions and refusal of three states to host any matches forced the postponement of the cash-rich T20 tournament.

The 38-year-old Dhoni hasn’t played any form of cricket since featuring in India’s semifinal loss to New Zealand at the 50-over World Cup in England last year.

There has been a lot of speculation over Dhoni’s international future ahead of this year’s T20 World Cup in Australia, with some saying it will depend on his performance in the IPL-13.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kz58em/article31074688.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DHONI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/coronavirus-dhoni-leaves-chennai-after-ipls-deferment-amid-covid-19-scare/article31074689.ece
265,2020/03/15,"A bit over-exaggerated, says Lockie Ferguson after coronavirus scare","The New Zealand fast bowler was placed in isolation immediately after Friday’s first ODI against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground following complaints of a sore throat.

The way things played out after he reported a sore throat, leading to COVID-19 tests and isolation in his hotel room, were a “bit over-exaggerated”, feels New Zealand pacer Lockie Ferguson.

The 28-year-old pacer was placed in isolation immediately after Friday’s first ODI against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground following complaints of a sore throat. He underwent tests on Saturday which returned negative, clearing the pacer.

Back with his family, Ferguson thinks it was blown out of proportion.

“No. Probably a bit over-exaggerated as to how I was,” he told reporters at the Auckland airport.

“I just sort of had very, very mild cold symptoms and the procedures were as they were and followed by Tommy (Simsek, physio) and the support staff. Completely understandable. So yeah, kinda had a day in the hotel room by myself.”

The coronavirus outbreak has so far claimed nearly 6,000 lives and infected close to 1,60,000 people across the world.

The pandemic has also wreaked havoc on the sporting calendar, leading to either cancellation or postponement of events in the Olympic year. Like other sports, cricket also suffered.

Ferguson returned home following the postponement of the ODI series against Australia. The first match was played in front of empty stands.

Empty stands

The fast bowler said, “It was strange certainly playing the game under the circumstances and with an empty crowd. For sure, that was an odd experience.

“At the same time, we were a little bit disappointed with how the game ended up. And yeah, that night I was sort of taken to get swabs and talked to the doctor there and fortunately all was good and yeah happy to be home.”

Was he nervous, given how rapidly the coronavirus had spread throughout the world?

“From my point of view, I just thought it was normal, small cold symptoms,” he said.

“Get quite rundown from time to time playing cricket and travelling a bit. So not too unusual for me. But as I said, Tommy our physio and the doctors followed procedure as is needed.

“So yes, been 24 hours in isolation but that’s okay. And I’ll be honest, I actually felt good the next day I woke up. I was fine.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/t3ugog/article31074519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FERGIEK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/a-bit-over-exaggerated-says-lockie-ferguson-after-coronavirus-scare/article31074520.ece
266,2020/03/15,"Ranji Trophy | Should strengthen our resolve, says Bengal coach Arun Lal","It was a case of so near yet so far for Bengal

It was so near yet so far for Bengal, which made it to the Ranji Trophy final after 13 years.

Following its loss to Saurashtra in the final on the basis of first innings lead at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Bengal coach Arun Lal looked at the positives and called for improvements.

“This should strengthen our resolve that we are not going to let it go next year. Since we have come this far, we now know that we are as good as any other side in the country, if not better,” said Lal.

The positive influence of Lal on the squad was discernible as one could hear a loud round of applause from the Bengal dressing room despite its defeat in the final on Friday. This was unusual in Bengal cricket.

“Everybody should realise how good we are, what fabulous cricket we have played. They have made us proud. We don’t focus on results.

“We needed to win each other’s hearts and we have done that. Next year we will win the trophy as well.

“They are fond of each other. It was a great atmosphere. Lovely to see how happy they are. Even the guy who was dropped is not sulking,” said Lal, taking pride in the team bonding.

Even though Lal was not sure about continuing as Bengal coach, he said the team must work on several areas. “There are lots of areas to improve. We have to be consistent.”

Lal pointed out some areas that the team needed to focus on. “We could not get the tail out in any match, not just in the final. We have to work on that.

“The bowling unit has to go a long way. It has superb potential. We need to work on yorkers and variations. Someone like Shahbaz Ahmed has to work on his bowling. Ishan Porel needs to improve his batting to increase depth.

“The players have to make a promise to the team that they will get better.

“Now you know what is required at the highest level and you need to work harder,” Lal, the hard taskmaster, said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/27v9dh/article31071127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15BENGAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-should-strengthen-our-resolve-says-bengal-coach-arun-lal/article31071129.ece
267,2020/03/15,Ranji trophy | Saurashtra’s win a culmination of its rich cricketing history,"I ensured that players were picked purely on basis of performance: Jaydev Shah

Carrying on a long legacy from the time of the British rule, the friendly and hospitable Saurashtrians finally experienced a dream come true when Jaydev Unadkat lifted the Ranji Trophy for the first time by beating Bengal at home here on March 13.

After the erstwhile Nawanagar (the previous version of Saurashtra) won the Ranji Trophy — which was named after the legendary Ranjitsinhji of Jamnagar — way back in 1936-37, incidentally beating Bengal, its cricket administration went through a lot of changes before the Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) came into being in the 1950s.

Renowned cricketers

Over the years, the region has produced several renowned cricketers — including Duleepsinhji, L. Amarsinh, L. Ramji, Vinoo Mankad, Salim Durrani, Dhiraj Parsana, Karsan Ghavri, Ravindra Jadeja, Unadkat and Cheteshwar Pujara — and takes pride in its rich cricketing history.

Pujara, who was part of the winning squad, said,

“This victory means a lot to me. For the entire team and the region, this is special. It means a lot to my father, who has played the Ranji Trophy. For generations to follow, it will give them belief,” said Pujara.

For former Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Niranjan Shah and his son Jaydev, the Ranji Trophy triumph was a lifetime achievement.

“Earlier, our players used to migrate to other States. During Jaydev’s captaincy (for 12 years), he held back the players to build a team.

“Our effort to groom talented under-19 players for Ranji Trophy also helped,” said Niranjan.

Evolution

Jaydev, the current SCA president, elaborated how he built a solid unit. “Once, we were No. 28 among 30 teams. Then we became the Plate division champion, came to Elite, qualified for knockouts and ultimately became a Ranji champion.

“I ensured that players were picked purely on the basis of performance without any discrimination and showed faith in them. That’s how we got an experienced side. You need experience to win Ranji Trophy.

“I kept some senior players in the leadership group before deciding to hand over captaincy to Unadkat. The transition was smooth.

“Every small thing was taken care of. Getting such top class infrastructure (at the SCA) also helped,” said Jaydev.

Former captain and coach Sitanshu Kotaka, who spent 27 years with the side, said, “A good unit, which was developed over the years, has made this possible. It’s a proud moment for all of us,” said Kotak.

Coach Karsan Ghavri said, “Except Unadkat and Pujara, it is a team of normal Ranji Trophy players. For five-six of them it was like religion.”

Sujitkumar Bose, a Rajkot-based former journalist and a keen follower of Saurashtra cricket, said the achievement was a matter of pride. “The SCA started from almost nothing. Saurashtra becoming the Ranji champion is an emotional moment for the region,” said Bose.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cj57yj/article31071124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14APP,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-saurashtras-win-a-culmination-of-its-rich-cricketing-history/article31071125.ece
268,2020/03/15,"Coronavirus | It could be a truncated IPL, says Ganguly","BCCI will keep ‘reviewing the situation every week’

After a day of frantic activity at Cricket Centre — the BCCI headquarters — where the the Board’s office-bearers met with the owners of all the eight Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises, followed by the IPL Governing Council discussing the way forward after suspending the event till April 15, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly hinted that “truncated IPL” is the only way forward but that’s the last possible option that the BCCI is considering.

Once the BCCI adhered to the government advisories on Friday and suspended IPL’s 13th edition till April 15 in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the franchise owners were anxiously waiting to be briefed by the BCCI bosses on Saturday.

No wonder then that the meeting saw virtually all the high-profile owners — including Kolkata Knight Riders’ Shahrukh Khan, Mumbai Indians’ Akash Ambani, Ness Wadia of Kings XI Punjab and Parth Jindal of Delhi Capitals — in attendance, along with their chief executives.

While the BCCI secretary Jay Shah, in a statement, stressed that “the BCCI and all its stakeholders are committed to providing a safe and healthy environment for everyone involved in our great sport and the nation” after the meeting, Jindal and Wadia, while speaking to reporters, also stressed on the “safety” aspect, without spelling the details.

After the Governing Council meeting, however, Ganguly admitted that truncated IPL is definitely being considered. “It (truncated IPL) will happen because if it is (starting by) April 15, then in any case 15 days are gone, so it has to be truncated. How truncated, how many games, I can't say at the moment. Till April 15, (there are) no visas,” Ganguly said.

Various options

However, multiple franchise officials confirmed to The Hindu that the BCCI office-bearers and IPL executives tabled various options to the teams. Possible start dates that were mentioned were April 15, April 20, April 25, April 30 and May 1.

“We were told that with multiple double-headers, a full IPL season will require 37 days, so considering the IPL can be stretched till May 31, if the season can start on or before April 25, there’s a bright chance of playing the full season,” said a franchise official.

“There are a couple of options for a truncated IPL: Eight teams playing each other just once instead of home and away in the league (32 games, including 4 playoffs) or the teams being divided into two groups of four each and playing home and away basis (28 games, including playoffs) can be considered should the need arise,” an IPL official said.

He corroborated that the two possibilities of a truncated IPL will arise only if the Union Government gives a go-ahead and clears visas of overseas players and support staff members for a start at the end of April or early May.

However, all these possibilities will arise if and when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides in India. Till then, as Ganguly admitted, BCCI will keep “reviewing the situation every week”.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/6yf0l1/article31071056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15IPL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/coronavirus-it-could-be-a-truncated-ipl-says-ganguly/article31071057.ece

The centres would send the appliances to a facility in Chennai, where they were sent for recycling. The Collector also underlined that disposal of electronic appliances on the streets, or through any random person was an offence.

The Forest Department is taking measures to make the Kurumbapatti zoological park a medium category zoological park. The works are expected to begin in the coming financial year.

Located at the foothills of Yercaud, the zoo is the only picnic spot for people within the city limits. To improve visitor experience, the department has been introducing various amenities in the park and it recently introduced battery cars in the zoo.

About ₹5.5 crore would be used to construct enclosures for animals.

“A medium category zoo will require 35 hectares. The zoo is currently situated on about 31 hectares and additional land will be taken. About 35 species of animals and 350 numbers have to be present in a medium zoo. Necessary steps will be taken to introduce new animals here,” he added.

The police said that M.M.S. Murugan, 50, a resident of Angannan Layout near Ramanathapuram and a member of DMK's urban district unit, was arrested based on a complaint filed by an AIADMK worker Gowtham.

The complainant alleged that Murugan posted derogatory remarks about Mr. Velumani in a WhatsApp group, levelling corruption charges against him. The message was leaked from the WhatsApp group to members of the AIADMK in the locality, following which the complaint was filed.

DMK members thronged outside Ramanathapuram police station in the early hours of Sunday after Murugan was called for questioning.

The police said that he was arrested under Sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505(1)(b) (with intent to cause, or which is likely to cause, fear or alarm to the public, or to any section of the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or against the public tranquillity) of the IPC and 66 E (punishment for violation of privacy) of the IT Act.

Coimbatore east district DMK unit in-charge and MLA N. Karthik has condemned the arrest of Mr. Murugan. In a release issued here on Sunday, he said by taking away Mr. Murugan at 1 a.m. without furnishing any information and detaining him at the Ramanathapuram police station, the Police worked at the behest of Mr. Velumani.

The reason the Police had proffered was that the detention of Mr. Murugan was for his social media post allegedly defaming Mr. Velumani. If that be the case, the DMK would not be cowed down by the action but would continue to expose Mr. Velumani for his alleged excesses in the Municipal Administration Department and his brother S.P. Anabrasan’s alleged transgressions.

Mr. Karthik asked the Police how was it that they were silent to the AIADMK’s street corner meetings against the DMK. Though the meetings were provocative and vulgar and aimed at inciting violence, they had taken no action.

But they had chosen to immediate detain Mr. Murugan.

281,2020/03/15,Manmatha’s praise,"King Nimi asks Dhrumila, one of the nava yogiswaras, to tell him about Lord Narayana’s avataras, said P.T. Seshadri in a discourse. He wants to know about the Lord’s deeds in the past, present and future. Dhrumila answers that the Lord is limitless, and so are His gunas. None is capable of speaking of all His qualities. It is far easier to try to describe the specks of dust in the world than to try to describe His qualities. Even the Vedas tried to praise Him and failed, for His auspicious qualities are infinite. The Lord made the Universe and everything in it, and He is in everything as antaryami. He has the three lokas as His body. He creates, sustains and dissolves the world. His first avatara was the Nara Narayana avatara in Badrikasrama, where the Lord appeared as both Nara and Narayana and did tapas. Indra wanted to disturb the penance. He sent Manmatha, the god of love, to disrupt the tapas.

When Narayana opened His eyes and looked at Manmatha, he praised the Lord thus: “When yagas are performed, havis is offered to various devatas. Because they get havis, they do not disrupt the yagas. But Vishnu bhaktas seek no benefits. All they want is Paramapada. If everyone becomes a Vishnu bhakta and reaches Sri Vaikuntha, there will be none left on earth to give havis to the devas. Afraid that this might happen, they put hurdles in the path of Vishnu bhakthas. But because of Your mercy, Your devotees cross these hurdles. Those who do not worship You do not know how trivial worldly desires are. They drown in worldly pleasures. Even small joys of life are enough to keep them immersed in worldly life. They are like a man who can drown in even a small volume of water, for example, the water that can be contained in a cow’s hooves.”",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/manmathas-praise/article31075986.ece

285,2020/03/15,"L-G can appoint law officer for police, Delhi govt.: MHA circular","Direction may escalate power tussle between L-G, AAP govt.

In what could escalate the tug-of-war between the Delhi government and the Lieutenant-Governor, the Home Ministry has issued a circular stating that the L-G may at his discretion appoint a law officer to represent the Delhi Police and the government in public interest litigations and writ petitions.

Delhi government senior standing counsel Rahul Mehra took to Twitter on Saturday to say that the move was “unconstitutional and illegal”. “I have no doubt in my mind that this is not only unconstitutional & illegal but is actually an attempt by the Union Government to obstruct the administration of justice [sic],” he said.

“Let’s see if the Full Court of Delhi HC protects its law officers? I sure am optimistic [sic],” he added.

The MHA’s March 12 circular states: “In the Supreme Court, the Delhi Police can be represented by any law officer(s) along with advocate(s) to assist the law officer(s) so appointed.”

When contacted, Mr. Mehra said: “We do not even know if it is a confirmed thing or not. This is illegal on the face of it. We will continue to do our job irrespective of such illegal order.”

Recently, the power tussle over who would represent the Delhi Police played out before the High Court during the hearing of a bunch of petitions related to the riots in the city. Some of the pleas related to registration of FIR against BJP leader Kapil Misra for his alleged hate speeches.

286,2020/03/15,COVID-19 victim cremated after initial refusal,"We had to seek permission from North Delhi Municipal Corporation: authorities

The body of a 68-year-old woman from Delhi, who succumbed to COVID-19, was cremated at Nigambhod Ghat on Saturday after initially being denied permission by the crematorium, said her family.

“We reached the crematorium by 10.30 a.m., but the authorities refused to cremate the body. They said they did not have any guidelines from the Health Department about coronavirus victims. We refused to go back and had to wait for about two-and-a-half hours for the cremation,” said Sanjeev Arora, the deceased’s relative.

“There was some confusion initially and the body was later cremated at the CNG crematorium,” said Ashok Rawat, a North Delhi Municipal Corporation health officer.

The family said that the government should have made better arrangements. “The government knew about the death. We had come to the crematorium in an RML Hospital ambulance and had to wait for hours,” Mr. Arora said.

Suman Gupta, the coordinator of an NGO, which runs the crematorium, said that the delay was because they had to seek permission from the north civic body. “This was a special case and we had to seek permission. As soon as we were granted the permission, we made arrangements for the cremation,” he said.

‘Safety gears’

Mr. Rawat said that the “initial confusion” was because it is a “new disease”. “The confusion was cleared and safety precautions were also taken. Two persons from the crematorium who helped the hospital staff in the cremation were also provided headgears, goggles, gloves, and shoes,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/covid-19-victim-cremated-after-initial-refusal/article31071705.ece
287,2020/03/15,Baijal reviews quarantine arrangements in Capital,"‘Quarantine facilities for 1,400 to come up at police training schools’

Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal on Saturday chaired a high-level meeting to review arrangements of quarantine facilities in the wake of the outbreak of COVID-19, with Health Minister Satyendar Jain and senior government officials.

Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, made a detailed presentation regarding arrangements of quarantine facilities in Delhi for passengers returning from COVID-19-affected countries.

“At the outset, requirements for establishment of quarantine facilities, as per the laid down guidelines from the Government of India were discussed. It was informed in the meeting that Delhi will prepare quarantine facilities for approximately 1,400 persons at police training schools, Jharoda Kalan and Wazirabad,” the Raj Niwas said.

“These facilities will be run by the District Magistrate concerned in association with the Department of Health and Family Welfare and Delhi Police. It was decided in the meeting that Delhi Police will provide security and the Department of Health and Family Welfare will provide health care facility at the isolation facilities,” it said further.

According to Raj Niwas, it was decided that the quarantine facilities in these centres will be provided as per the guidelines of the Government of India along with proper food, security, infrastructure and sanitation.

288,2020/03/15,"Soon, pay traffic fine on the spot","Lieutenant-Governor gives nod to notification of amended Motor Vehicles Act

In the coming days, drivers caught on the wrong side of traffic laws in the city will be able to pay on-the-spot fines to the Traffic Police and Transport Department personnel, instead of going to court.

The enhanced quantum of fines under the provisions of the amended Motor Vehicles (MV) Act — which came into effect in Delhi on September 1, 2019 — for various traffic violations, however, will remain in place with Lieutenant-Governor Anil Baijal giving his nod to a notification to this effect. The move will come into efffect following the publication of the notification in the Official Gazette.

According to the notification, the L-G has authorised officers of the rank of Head Constables and above of both the Traffic Police and the Transport Department to issue fines up to ₹1,000 while officers of the rank of Assistant Sub-Inspector and above from both units have been authorised to issue fines for a majority of the traffic offences.

While restricting the movement of emergency vehicles entails a fine of ₹10,000, parking in an unauthorised manner leads to a ₹2,000 fine.

Violations such as not wearing a helmet will mean a fine of ₹1,000 fine, and not having a valid Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate entails a fine of ₹10,000.

The quantum of fines has not been reduced by the Delhi government despite it having the discretionary powers to do so. Motorists have been paying enhanced penalties prescribed in the amended MV Act since September 1, 2019, but were forced to go to court since the Act had not been notified by the Delhi government.

State discretion

Section 200 of the amended Act authorises the State government to fix the quantum of penalty for some offences that are compoundable. The Traffic Police and the State Transport Department are empowered to collect a fine on the spot.

The amended Act prescribes penalties for 61 offences. The State government does not have discretion in 27 offences. The Delhi government had the discretion of keeping the penalty 100% as prescribed in the Act or reduce it in the case of 34 compoundable offences.

It decided to keep the maximum prescribed penalty with road safety in mind.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/23jz7/article31073461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15DEPOLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/soon-pay-traffic-fine-on-the-spot/article31071688.ece

Amid COVID-19 scare, women protesters at Shaheen Bagh and Hauz Rani on Saturday said that “panic” around the virus would not make them call off their movement against the citizenship law, the National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the National Population Register (NPR).

The protesters, who have been on a sit-in for a few months now, said that “adequate precautionary steps” were being taken to safeguard themselves against COVID-19. Nasreen Banu, a regular at the Hauz Rani protest site, said: “We are taking all kinds of precautions possible and are covering our mouths while speaking to people and washing our hands regularly. Our houses are in close proximity so we can go there whenever we want to get cleaned up. We are also trying to keep the children a little away from the crowds.”

291,2020/03/15,"Kejriwal telling lies about NPR, NRC: BJP","AAP provoking people even when city is recovering from riots: Tiwari

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Saturday accused Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his Council of Ministers of “misleading the people” and “telling lies” about National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

A day after the Delhi Legislative Assembly passed a resolution against the NPR and the NRC at a special session, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari claimed that efforts were being made by AAP to “provoke people” on these issues.

“First the Delhi government misled the people on the amended Citizenship Act and efforts are now being made to mislead people by spreading lies about the NPR and NCR... during the debate in Rajya Sabha, Home Minister Amit Shah clearly said that no citizen will have to show any document for the National Population Register,” Mr. Tiwari alleged.

“Kejriwal and his Ministers are misleading the people by giving wrong information on NPR and NRC. Few days ago, a propaganda was initiated on the CAA which led to violence and arson and people are still recovering from it. AAP is provoking people even in such an atmosphere,” he alleged.

Taking a dig at the Chief Minister for his statement on birth certificates, Mr. Tiwari questioned the validity of the election of Mr. Kejriwal and his Ministers since, he argued, the minimum age for contesting Assembly elections in India was 25 and he and his Ministers “did not have birth certificates”.

“Kejriwal must answer these questions if he does not want to be held guilty of speaking lies in the House,” Mr. Tiwari added.

During the debate in relation to the resolution against the NPR and the NRC, Mr. Kejriwal had asked for a show of hands to ascertain how many legislators present in the House at that time had birth certificates issued by government agencies. In the 70-member Assembly, it was found that as many as 61 did not have one.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-telling-lies-about-npr-nrc-bjp/article31071587.ece

Mr. Sharma’s body was found in a drain near his home in Chand Bagh on February 27, a day after he went missing. His body bore multiple stab wounds.

293,2020/03/15,State cannot abdicate its responsibility to victims,"The response of both the Central and Delhi governments in the aftermath of Delhi riots has laid bare the lack of an institutional framework governing relief and rehabilitation in such situations

The recent spate of communal violence in the Capital claimed 53 lives and left more than 200 people grievously injured. Thousands were displaced from their homes in the wake of the vandalism and arson that engulfed houses, shops and places of worship in north-east Delhi.

The response of both the Central and Delhi governments in the aftermath of violence has laid bare the lack of an institutional framework governing relief and rehabilitation in such situations. While the Centre is yet to act, much of the response of the Delhi government has been marked by ad hocism.

It became amply clear by the second day of the violence that a very large number of people had fled their homes in a bid to save their lives. Yet, no relief shelters were set up to accommodate them. A visit to the affected areas nearly a week after the violence broke out revealed that most people were taking refuge in houses of private individuals who opened their doors to them. Others had moved in with their relatives or fled to their villages.

Eventually, nine centres were designated by the Delhi government as relief camps. There were no takers for eight of them, which were gender-segregated night shelters for the homeless in temporary tented structures located on the roadside with little security. Well-publicised guidelines defining the minimum standards for setting up relief shelters would have served as a benchmark to hold the government accountable for providing proper facilities.

Tents were subsequently erected by the Delhi government on the premises of the Idgah in Mustafabad and a relief camp was set up for 1,000 people. The camp filled up overnight. Despite heavy rain flooding the tents, the camp has been functioning at full capacity.

Unfortunately, no comprehensive policy framework appears to exist for addressing the immediate, medium and long-term shelter requirements of those displaced. Based on the extent of damage to property, it is critical that an assessment be made for shelter requirements. To this end, the role of law enforcement agencies, like the Delhi police, is important in ensuring that strong measures are taken to prevent recurrence of violence in affected areas and safe passage is provided to people willing to return to their homes.

The importance of a well-structured compensation package for victims of communal violence cannot be overemphasised. While the Delhi government was quick to announce a compensation scheme, and disburse the initial instalment to many survivors, there were glaring procedural gaps. Compensation forms were primarily distributed, filled and collected by volunteers and public-spirited individuals. Since these were not numbered and no proof of submission of the compensation claim was provided to the survivors, there is no way to ascertain whether forms were registered in the government system. A standard protocol for issuing receipts, public disclosure of details of forms and compensation dispensed could have prevented confusion among the survivors.

A standardised system for calculating the quantum of compensation with differentiated slabs would go a long way in addressing arbitrariness in compensating survivors. Next of kin of those killed in Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013 were given a compensation of ₹15 lakh. Seven years later, in an urban setting, an ex gratia compensation of ₹10 lakh to families of deceased announced by the Delhi government appears woefully inadequate.

As the Capital struggles to recover from the violence unleashed on some of its poorest and most vulnerable, the state cannot abdicate its responsibility of providing proper compensation and time-bound relief, including access to medical facilities, counselling and assistance for restoring official documents destroyed in the riots. Unless governments actively step in to create an environment where survivors feel secure and justice is delivered, the process of healing cannot begin.

294,2020/03/15,‘NPR a step towards divisive citizenship regime’,"Rights groups demand amendments to 2003 citizenship rules

Two umbrella organisations of NGOs and rights groups on Saturday said that they would withdraw their call for boycott of the National Population Register (NPR) if Home Minister Amit Shah made amendments to the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003, according to the statements made by the latter in the floor of the Parliament.

The statements were made by groups “We the People of India” and “Alliance Against CAA-NRC-NPR”, of which activist Harsh Mander and Swaraj Abhiyan founder Yogendra Yadav are members. Mr. Yadav, however, said that the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) would continue.

They termed the NPR as the first step towards the new “discriminatory” citizenship regime and opposed clubbing of NPR with the census.

“We have been opposed to the Union government’s attempt to introduce a new citizenship regime through the CAA and the allied NPR and National Register of Indian Citizens [NRIC],” an official statement said. The groups said these were “divisive”, “discriminatory”, and against the letter and spirit of the Indian Constitution.

“We have read and carefully considered the statement of Home Minister Amit Shah in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday where he has categorically assured the nation that in the context of the NPR, if any information is not available with a person, he/she may not provide the same and the NPR shall not be used for categorising any citizen as ‘doubtful’. We welcome the spirit of the Home Minister’s statement and now seek legalisation and formalisation of the same by way of the Union government amending the Citizenship [Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards] Rules, 2003,” an official statement said.

The groups said that such an amendment may remove any reference to the NPR in the Citizenship [Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards] Rules, 2003. “Alternatively, the government may delete Rule 3 (5), 4(3), 4(4) which allow the NPR to be used for identifying citizens as doubtful and their deletion from the NRIC. The government may also suitably amend Rule 7(2) and 17 to ensure that providing information in the NPR is voluntary and no one would be penalised for failure to provide information. We believe that these amendments would give effect to the Home Minister’s statement on the floor of the House and set at rest the widespread apprehensions about the NPR,” the statement said.

They also said that various State governments have already passed resolutions in their Assemblies or issued orders opposing the implementation of the NPR in its current form.

“As soon as the Union Government carries out the above mentioned amendments, we would be prepared to withdraw the call for boycotting the NPR. The movement against the CAA and the NRC and the entire discriminatory citizenship regime shall, however, continue in peaceful, non-violent and democratic manner,” the statement added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gmlkla/article28192581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE28YOGENDRAYADAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/npr-a-step-towards-divisive-citizenship-regime/article31071583.ece
295,2020/03/15,‘My 13-year-old boy has been in jail since last week of February’,"Police claim he is an adult; court to hear matter tomorrow

Sitting in his drain water-filled house on a rainy Saturday in north-east Delhi, Munawar Ali* said he was at a loss for what to do next.

“My 13-year-old son Amir* was arrested by the police and has been in jail since the last week of February,” alleged the rickshaw-puller who suffers from a speech disorder.

Advocate Abdul Gaffar, who is handling the boy’s case, said: “The police have claimed that at the time of arrest, the boy said he was 19 years old, and that they arrested him after enquiring from his family. But his documents show, and his family has stated, that he is 13. The matter will be presented before the court on Monday.” The boy’s Aadhaar card, seen by The Hindu, states his date of birth as November 21, 2006.

Mr. Gaffar added that the police should have verified his age with the family before arresting him.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (North East) Ved Prakash Surya said: “The boy was apprehended from the spot. When he was taken for medical examination, he informed the doctor that he was 22 years old, and the same was recorded in the medico legal certificate. The family is now producing documents of his age. In the court, we will ask for ossification test.”

He added that the school Amir claimed to have studied in was also contacted for verification, but the authorities denied that he studied there. The response from the school, read by The Hindu, was dated March 13.

The family said that the boy, a Class 5 dropout, had gone to look for his 10-year-old brother, who they thought was out on the streets when riots broke out on February 25. “Around 7.30 p.m., we asked Amir to go look for his brother... my 10-year-old returned but Amir did not,” said Mr. Ali.

Despite severe restrictions on movement and heavy police deployment, the family spent the next two days searching for Amir but could not find him. “The police were not letting us go out on the streets but I went looking. I could not find him,” said Amir’s elder brother.

Unable to meet son

The teenager’s mother, Saima*, said that she received a call on February 26 mentioning her son’s name but before she could understand what the person on the other side had to say, the phone got disconnected. “When I called back, no one answered,” she added. On February 27, Saima received a call from a lawyer who told her that her son has been arrested by the police and is being sent to Mandoli Jail. Since then, she has been running from pillar to post to meet him but to no avail.

Unaware of police or court proceedings, or the Juvenile Justice Act, Saima said she got another call from a lawyer on February 29 telling her not to worry. “I visited Khajuri Khas police station a number of times and asked them how I could speak to my son but officers did not tell me anything. The lawyer had asked me to come to Karkardooma Court on Friday but he could not meet me. I asked him if I could visit the jail but he said it is not the right time,” said Saima, who works as a domestic help.

Amir’s family admitted that the teenager had been going to anti-CAA protests regularly for the past two months, but denied that he was a part of the riots. “He is a child. His interest in attending the protest was free food and tea, and to while away his time. He would leave around 5 p.m. and come back by 11 p.m. It is tough to believe he would be a part of any mob,” Mr. Ali added.

296,2020/03/15,"Pass low crude oil price benefit to people, Chadha tells Central govt.","‘Aviation fuel is cheaper than petrol and diesel in country’

AAP on Saturday demanded that the Centre passed the benefit of the “lowest” crude oil prices in 15 years to people and make petrol available at ₹39 per litre and diesel at ₹31 per litre.

“Currently, aviation fuel is cheaper than petrol and diesel in the country. You tell me whether this [Central] government works for the rich or the poor,” AAP national spokesperson and MLA Raghav Chadha said. “Crude oil prices are the lowest in 15 years. If the government passed on the benefit of reduction in the prices of crude oil in the international market to you, petrol should be sold at ₹39.76 per litre, but the rate is about ₹69,” he said.

Mr. Chadha said that excise duty on diesel has increased from ₹3.56 per litre to ₹18.80 per litre and on petrol from ₹9.40 per litre to ₹22.90 per litre under the BJP government. “In the past few years, the Centre has increased the excise rate nearly 12 times. Therefore, the prices of petrol and diesel have increased exponentially. Today, in our economy, the price of aviation fuel is cheaper than that of the per-litre price of petrol and diesel.

297,2020/03/15,"Hailstorm, record rain lash the Capital","Safdarjung Observatory has recorded 101.9 mm of rainfall in March so far, the highest ever in Delhi

Heavy rain and hailstorm pummelled Delhi on Saturday afternoon, creating a new record of precipitation in March.

The intense showers led to a drop in the mercury and heavy waterlogging in several areas, throwing traffic into haywire.

The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative data for Delhi, has recorded 101.9 mm of rainfall in March so far, the highest ever in Delhi, said Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the Regional Forecasting Centre of the India Meteorological Department.

People share photos

The rainfall was 97.4 mm in March 2015, 61.6 mm in March 2007 and 36.5 mm in March 1995.

Residents shared pictures and videos on social media of flooded streets and rooftops covered in a blanket of hail from various parts of Delhi and surrounding areas.

The Central Pollution Control Board’s data showed the rain brought the pollution levels down to the moderate category.

The overall air quality index stood at 108 at 4 p.m.

The IMD said the weather station at Safdarjung recorded 37 mm of rainfall on Saturday, the second highest in a day in March after 56.8 mm on March 2, 2015. The Lodhi Road Observatory received 47.6 mm of rain till 5.30 p.m.

Western disturbance

Mr. Srivastava said Delhi witnessed rain on the nights of Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, too, under the influence of an active western disturbance. The weather system is expected to withdraw on Saturday night onwards.

So far, Delhi has received rains on nine days this month, the scientist said.

The maximum temperature was 24.7 degrees Celsius, around four notches less than the previous day.

The weather from Sunday is predicted to be dry and the maximum temperature is expected to touch the 30 degrees-Celsius mark by Wednesday.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/eckwd9/article31071545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE15RAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hailstorm-record-rain-lash-the-capital/article31071546.ece
298,2020/03/15,State makes Aadhaar submission mandatory for GST,"Decision comes in the wake of difficulties in the new tax regime and to curb fake registrations

The State government has decided to make submission of Aadhaar details mandatory for obtaining registration under the Goods and Services Tax.

The decision comes in the light of certain difficulties faced in the new tax regime, which is in nascent stages. One of the major issues that led to leakage in the revenues was fake registrations. It was therefore decided to amend the Act suitably making Aadhaar submission mandatory to curb fake registrations.

The Legislative Assembly on Sunday passed The Telangana Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill 2020 in this direction. Piloting the Bill on behalf of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, Animal Husbandry Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav said the Bill envisaged putting in place a facility for filing of returns once in a year and payment of taxes once every quarter as part of promoting ease of doing business among small and medium tax payers. It was also decided to remove unnecessary litigations and confusion among taxpayers and implementing authorities by the constitution of National Appellate Authority for Advance Ruling.

The amendment prescribes the methodology for constitution, appointment, tenure, conditions of service and functioning of the appellate authority in addition to the manner of removal of its president and the members. Empowering the Anti-Profiteering Authority to impose penalty equivalent to 10% of the profiteered amount and provisions for making single authority for refund disbursal effective, charging interest only on the net tax payment in cash and facility to taxpayer to transfer amount from one head to another in the cash ledger were among the other highlights of the amendment.

Another Bill amending the provisions of the Telangana Payment of Salaries and Pension and Removal of Disqualifications Act, 1953 had also been passed by the Assembly. Accordingly, a person would be disqualified for being chosen as or for being a member of the State Legislature on the ground that the respective representative holds office of profit. The Bill was aimed at adding 29 more institutions including the posts of chairmen of several corporations like Kaleshwaram Irrigation Project Corporation, Urban Development Authorities, Official Language Commission in addition to the 121 institutions already listed under the Office of Profit. The House also passed a Bill repealing the Telangana Self-Help Group Women Co-Contributory Pension Act 2009 as the government had brought SG women who crossed 65 years into the ambit of Aasara pensions while several others would also be enrolled once the decision to reduce the qualifying age for pensions to 57 years was implemented.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/state-makes-aadhaar-submission-mandatory-for-gst/article31076586.ece

300,2020/03/15,Coronavirus remark: Uttam seeks apology from KCR,"Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy strongly condemned Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for equating coronavirus with the Congress party and said KCR was a real coronavirus while Congress party was the nation builder.

In a statement here on Sunday, he said the remarks made by KCR in the Assembly were highly objectionable and reminded that he would not have made that speech as Chief Minister, if the Congress party had not granted statehood for Telangana.

‘Withdraw remarks’

He advised KCR to restrain from indulging in cheap talk and demanded immediate withdrawal of the remarks and tender an unconditional apology. He also demanded that the remarks be expunged from the Assembly records.

Referring to KCR’s earlier speech in the Assembly that coronavirus would go away with a paracetamol tablet, Mr. Uttam Reddy advised the Chief Minister to be mature as everything can’t be made fun of.

“While the entire world is taking precautions to prevent the spread of deadly coronavirus, KCR has ridiculously commented that it won’t come to Telangana as it has high temperature and it can be cured by taking a paracetamol.” he said. “Now he has suddenly realised the threat coronavirus poses to the State and announced lockdown.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/coronavirus-remark-uttam-seeks-apology-from-kcr/article31076570.ece
301,2020/03/15,TS health sector not in pink of health: Bhatti,"Govt. urged to improve infrastructure and availability of doctors, paramedical staff and medicines at PHC level

Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader M. Bhatti Vikramarka has observed that the medical and health in Telangana is not in the pink of health, in spite of the tall claims made by the government often and it needs immediate treatment from the primary health centre (PHC) level to the super speciality hospital level.

Speaking as part of the voting on demands for grants pertaining to 25 departments taken up in the Legislative Assembly on Sunday, he requested the government to improve infrastructure and availability of doctors, paramedical staff and medicines at the PHC level so that people were saved from fleecing by private hospitals. The condition of major hospitals like Osmania General Hospital was also no different either as one could see street dogs roaming in some wards there during nights. He also wanted the government to ensure proper functioning of the 104 and 108 services.

On the education sector, Mr. Vikramarka said in the absence of Vice-Chancellors administration of all universities in the State was suffering. Stating that the IIIT established at Basar by the previous Congress government had been helping rural students pursue their dreams of engineering education, he suggested the State government to establish three more IIITs in Telangana to cover all areas since two more IIITs established then had gone to Andhra Pradesh after bifurcation.

Complimenting the government for having its focus on the agriculture sector, the Congress Floor Leader said agriculture department was in need of more extension (field) staff to help farmers on-field and establishing more agriculture polytechnics in rural areas, at least one in every district headquarters, to ensure availability of more such hands. He also wanted the government to hold Group-I services examination since it was not held since formation of the State.

He requested Speaker P. Srinivas Reddy to call for a meeting on establishing a constitution club for the benefit of legislators, particularly those in the opposition, as getting information to speak on issues would be difficult for them.

Another Congress member D. Anasuya alias Seethakka pointed out that there were no proper buildings for PHCs and Area Hospitals in the tribal areas and there was shortage of ambulances too. She requested the government to sanction at least one ambulance for every two mandals and in-patient (beds) facilities in PHCs in the tribal areas and wanted upgrading of MGM Hospital at Warangal.

302,2020/03/15,Bandi Sanjay begins innings with broadside against KCR,"BJP chief demands a proper audit of how the Centre’s funds are spent

The coronavirus scare has prevented Telangana BJP leaders and partymen from taking out a rally from the international airport at Shamshabad to give a grand welcome to the newly appointed president and Karimnagar MP Bandi Sanjay on Sunday afternoon.

However, they made it up by giving him a rousing reception at the Nampally party office, led by top leaders including Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy, K. Laxman and others. True to his reputation, Mr. Sanjay came out with all guns blazing against Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his Telangana Rastra Samithi (TRS) government.

“Beware KCR, the war has started from today and your countdown has begun. We will not tolerate if you jail our brothers foisting false cases and accuse our party of being communal. The Chief Minister is afraid of lotus symbol, not coronavirus. We will see that the saffron flag is hoisted on the Golconda Fort,” he thundered, amid cries of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and ‘Jai Sree Ram’.

The MP continued his tirade against KCR and taunted him if he had the ‘guts’ to seek Centre’s help for funds and claimed he had the capacity to get them. “The monies being distributed for social welfare programmes in Telangana belong to the people of the State and is not being paid from the Chief Minister’s pocket,” he said and demanded a proper audit of how the Centre’s funds were spent.

Mr. Sanjay said he has been a loyal party worker and will stand by all those who have been languishing in jails due to the partisan attitude of the TRS government. “I am ready to face any number of cases for the sake of workers. The incidents of Bhainsa continue to haunt me, I will definitely visit the place and provide succour to the affected families,” he said.

“We don’t need this TRS government which has not given unemployment dole to youth or loan waiver to farmers while the education sector has been destroyed,” he charged.

Vote bank politics

The BJP will oppose the ‘minority vote bank politics’ of TRS. Ridiculing the CM’s dismissive tone on the coronavirus scare, he claimed KCR has become the laughing stock of the nation. Mr. Sanjay said he will soon be touring TS and visit each and every mandal and village. He thanked Prime Minister Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and party president J.P. Nadda for choosing him for the challenging task.

Earlier, he paid his tributes to the Telangana Martyrs Memorial at Gun Park before the Legislative Assembly. The MP, however, has not taken formal charge of office and will do so at a later date, party sources said..",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/6nzjao/article31076552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16SANJAY2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bandi-sanjay-begins-innings-with-broadside-against-kcr/article31076553.ece
303,2020/03/15,"SC, ST student admissions in private schools dismal: Congress","‘State failed to utilise RTE funds and implement the Act’

Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Bhatti Vikramarka has accused the State government of totally neglecting the poor students and failing to admit them in private schools using the provision under Right To Education (RTE) Act.

In a letter to Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, he said that as per the DISE data of 2016-17 only 0.02% of students were admitted while the school participation rate was just 0.01% under Section 12(1) (c) of the RTE Act 2009. This section aims at social integration in private aided schools by mandating admission of children belonging to socially disadvantaged and economically weaker sections for 25% of the seats in each class. He said as per DISE data of 2016-17 Telangana has about 91,849 potential seats every year across 12,753 private unaided schools under the 12(1) (c) provision. But statistics prove that the Scheduled Caste (SC) students in private unaided schools are 11.17% and ST students 6.93%. SC and ST student population in government schools is 44.2% and it reflects the lack of diversity and inclusion in private unaided schools.

Notifications

Mr. Bhatti said Telangana has not issued notifications for admission and not notified the per-child cost that is required to claim reimbursement from the Central government for students admitted under Section 12 (1) (c). Moreover, Telangana is also one of the two States that has failed to set up a State Advisory Council that ensures effective implementation of the RTE Act in the State, Mr. Bhatti said. The CLP leader also recalled that the CAG report of 2017 has listed Telangana as a non-compliant State and several Public Interest Litigations have also been filed in the High Court and Supreme Court on the failure to implement the 25% reservation.

Mr. Bhatti said based on devolution of funds to States by the 14th Finance Commission, the fund sharing ratio for Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) is 60:40, which means Central government provided 60% of the funds for implementation of RTE under SSA. So last year Central government would have provided ₹1095.24 crore as its share and Telangana would had to contribute ₹730.16 crore as its share. But Telangana failed to utilise this money properly, he claimed.

Mr. Bhatti also argued that Andhra Pradesh government has passed AP School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission bill in 2019 to ensure 25% of reservations.

The CLP leader advised the government to follow States like Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Gujarat that have spent 85% of the SSA funds released to them and Rajasthan was reimbursed 100% of its demand in 2017-18. Chattisgarh has also started online provision for admission forms ensuring that students don’t need to submit multiple forms seeking seats under RTE Act.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cs4dcg/article31076539.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY16ISKOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/sc-st-student-admissions-in-private-schools-dismal-cong/article31076540.ece
304,2020/03/15,Study taken up on development of schools: Minister,"Minister for Education P. Sabitha Indra Reddy told the Legislative Assembly on Sunday that the Education department has taken up a study on developing schools on the lines of those in Delhi so that a pilot scheme could be taken up in some urban schools.

Replying to the debate on voting of demands for grants, she stated that the government was also planning to introduce biometric attendance system for teachers and students in schools and colleges. Stating that education in government sector had improved in leaps and bounds after formation of Telangana State, the minister said people were approaching legislators seeking admission for their children in government residential schools after taking them out from private schools.

Along with the allocation made by welfare departments for their educational institutions, the total allocation for education would come to ₹16,450 crore, she noted.

Minister for Health E. Rajender said the State government was working towards strengthening the medical and health system at all levels and the fact that 84 public health centres (PHCs) had secured quality certification given by the Centre besides bringing down maternal mortality rate and infant mortality rate was an indication of improved condition of the health sector in the State.

The minister asked the people not to get panicky over non-availability of masks as they were not needed for every one. He explained that partial shutdown of some establishments and educational institutions had been taken up in the wake of coronavirus spread, although it was in very small scale in the country, only as a precautionary measure.

305,2020/03/15,UPSC applicants can now call it quits,"Facility available to those who are not well prepared for the exams

To reduce the burden of making arrangements and for saving costs, Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) has introduced withdrawal facility for the candidates from this year.

Candidates who have applied for the Civil Services Examination this year can now withdraw the applications before March 18 if they feel their preparations are inadequate. A notice posted on the UPSC website said UPSC has no provision to refund any fee amount and even if candidates withdraw their applications, fees will not be refunded.

About 9 to 10 lakh candidates apply for the Civil Services examination every year but only 50% of them actually appear for the preliminary examination. This year the prelims will be held on May 31.

Last year too 10,65,552 candidates applied for the examination but only 5,00,484 had appeared at the examination. In the same year 79,697 candiates had applied from Telanagana and Andhra Pradesh but only 40,732 took the test.

The UPSC has to take lot of effort to make the required arrangements for all applicants including issuing the admission tickets to printing the required number of papers, booking the venues, fixing the required number of invigilators and the provisions for safe and orderly conduct of the examination.

“This places an enormous burden on the commission involving huge costs of time and expenditure for the logistics. Hence, UPSC has taken the decision to allow students who feel are not adequately prepared to withdraw their applications,” says V. Gopalakrishna of Brain Tree.

However, he feels there is no clarity if the withdrawal would be counted as an attempt and UPSC should clarify on this crucial aspect.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/upsc-applicants-can-now-call-it-quits/article31073247.ece
306,2020/03/15,"MoCA for fortnightly revision of ATF price, 30-day credit to clear fuel bill","Tweaks needed, not bailout package for airlines facing COVID-19 heat: Civil Aviation Minister

Union Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Saturday said tweaks, especially revision of ATF prices on a fortnightly basis and 30-day credit to clear the fuel bill, and not bailout packages, are needed for domestic airlines in the face of fall in travel demand.

“Yes, there are challenges, 10-15% drop in domestic air travel demand. At the same time, crude oil prices have dropped from $70 a barrel to $27,” he told the media, when asked whether a bailout package for airlines was under consideration in the wake of challenges resulting from COVID-19 outbreak.

Ruling out the bailout package, the Minister suggested that instead, the airlines should approach oil companies to provide them credit for 30 days and adjust prices of aviation turbine fuel every 15 days.

“Every time there is a challenge, you do not come to the government for a bailout,” he said, adding that falling crude oil prices would obviously benefit the sector.

Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) has already recommended to the Petroleum Ministry so that the full benefit of drop is available to the airline operators, he said.

Bringing ATF under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime is another request of the airlines that the Ministry had recommended to the Finance Ministry.

The Minister, who was at Wings India 2020 event, said that all the stakeholders, be it airlines or airport operators, were more or less on the same page after the challenge that COVID-19 has posed, and has provided India an opportunity to emerge from that even stronger.

To queries on Air India, he said that with 120 planes, flying to 50 international routes and 80 domestic routes, and competent staff, it is a first-rate airline. The government has decided to divest Air India for a number of reasons, including the airlines’ accumulated debt. “The privatisation process is in a fairly advanced stage. We have issued a preliminary information memorandum, 600 queries have come in and we are going to respond to all of them,” he said, adding that the deadline for bids had been extended.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/vchsr4/article31073291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARDEEPSINGHPURIjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/moca-for-fortnightly-revision-of-atf-price-30-day-credit-to-clear-fuel-bill/article31071514.ece
307,2020/03/15,U.S. students banish virus blues with #SunshineSongs,"Actress Laura Benanti implored her followers to “find some bright spots” in the moment of crisis

American students are belting out show tunes on social media to make up for high school musical performances that were called off because of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Schools have closed across the U.S. while cultural institutions such as Broadway have been shuttered in a bid to slow the spread of the contagion.

Actress Laura Benanti sparked the Twitter trend after imploring her followers to “find some bright spots” in the public health crisis.

“If you were meant to perform in your High School musical and it was cancelled please post yourself singing,” the Broadway performer tweeted.

Hundreds of students responded to the #SunshineSongs call over the next hours with clips from rehearsals or home renditions of musical numbers from Phantom of the Opera, Les Miserables and other popular theatre plays.

308,2020/03/15,45 years ago: A look back at Indian hockey’s only World Cup win,"Ajit Pal Singh-led Indian team scripted history with a thrilling 2-1 win over Pakistan on the night of March 15.

More than four decades ago, the Indian hockey team lifted its only World Cup crown on this day — a glorious chapter written after the heart-breaking loss two years earlier in 1973.

After enduring a topsy-turvy campaign, the Ajit Pal Singh-led Indian team scripted history with a thrilling 2-1 win over Pakistan on the night of March 15 at the Merdeka Football Stadium in Kuala Lumpur.

The golden voice of Hindi commentator Jasdev Singh, describing the winning moments of that iconic final, still reverberates in the hearts and minds of millions of Indians.

Ashok Kumar and Aslam Sher Khan, the stars of the semifinal and final, remembered those moments on the 45th anniversary of that historic win.

Heartbreak

“We were very close to winning the trophy in 1973 but lost to the hosts despite leading by two goals at one time. I missed a goal in extra time and we missed a penalty stroke in sudden death. It was heartbreaking for us. So we did not want to leave any stone unturned in 1975,” said Ashok Kumar, the son of legendary Dhyan Chand, who scored the winning goal against Pakistan in the final.

“We had a practice camp in Chandigarh prior to the tournament. Huge crowd used to gather to watch us. Giani Zail Singh was the chief minister then and he along with sports minister Umrao Singh visited us twice a week. Our morale was high and we were determined to win.”

India was trailing host Malaysia in the semifinal when team manager Balbir Singh Sr. pushed Aslam into the battlefield. The move earned rich dividends as he scored the equaliser to take the match into extra time.

Singular goal

“I can never forget that goal in my life. We had left Chandigarh with only one goal: to win the World Cup. Every member of the team had the same goal and we wanted to win it for our country,” recalls Aslam.

“We were riding high on confidence after the semifinal win. Pakistan was the former champion and a very strong team but they could not match our confidence in the final,” he added.

For Ashok Kumar, there was added pressure as he was Dhyan Chand’s son.

“Definitely pressure was there. More because of my family background. When we reached Malaysia and I saw the World Cup trophy for the first time in the hotel lobby, I made a promise to myself that I will make my father proud,” he said.

National holiday

A National holiday was declared in India on the day of the final and the Indian community in Malaysia was equally excited.

“Wherever we went, people gathered to have a glimpse. Autographs and photographs were taken. People went crazy and we were treated like heroes in Malaysia and India.”

Balbir Singh Sr. also went down memory lane.

“The historic World Cup triumph almost didn’t happen. The team entry for the tournament was almost withdrawn before it started. So many people worked so hard to make it possible,” he said.

Team motto

“I had created a unique team motto — ‘Regaining world supremacy is our goal.’ It was painted in bright red on the entrance to the team dormitory during the training camp. The boys played with unity, for each other and there was no place for showmanship. It was the combined efforts that made winning for India possible.”

Fortyfive years have passed since then and India is yet to win another World Cup.

Ashok Kumar lamented that despite such a historic feat, the winning team did not get its due.

“Forget about celebrations, nobody called us to congratulate on this day. I think not many remember the day. After all we are a cricket crazy country. Who remembers hockey heroes?”",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/kooazg/article31075878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15Hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/45-years-ago-a-look-back-at-indian-hockeys-only-world-cup-win/article31075879.ece
309,2020/03/15,COVID-19 | Children stare at a dismal summer vacation,"Holiday camps go for a toss owing to COVID-19 scenario

Despite getting almost one full extra month than their normal two-month vacation, this may yet turn out to be the most dismal summer for the school-going generation as everything from arts and sports camps to malls and movies looks unviable for the time being.

With the probability of the partial lockdown till the end of March getting extended both in scope and duration increasingly looking real, summer plans of children may go awry.

Chandradasan, founder and artistic director of Lokadharmi Centre for Theatre, has taken a ‘wait and watch’ approach. “We were planning to hold a five-day theatre workshop towards the end of April before SSLC classes begin. But we have decided not to announce the dates and rather watch how things pan out,” he said. Lokadharmi has also called off its three-day annual day celebrations and theatre fest originally scheduled from March 27 to 29.

Noted artist T. Kaladharan also remains indecisive of his annual summer camp planned for the second week of April, with the situation surrounding the breakout of COVID-19 still remaining fluid.

Things are no different for football and cricket camps in the city. Ravi Kumar, an accredited coach who has been holding summer coaching camps for children for nearly three decades, has publicised his academy’s 20-day camp for children at St. George’s High School, Edappally, next month in the hope that things will settle down by then. “Academies and clubs usually conduct camps ranging from 15 days to a month during April every summer. We were expecting more girls to join camps this time, especially with the surge in interest in the game among girls after the national women’s cricket team reached the final of the latest edition of women’s T20 World Cup,” he said.

SportHood, a network of neighbourhood sports centres in Bengaluru and Kochi, was planning to hold three modules of camps running into two, four and six weeks for children aged between five and 15 years at Edappally. “As of now, all our academy sessions for both adults and children remain suspended till month-end, while a call on summer camps will be taken based on the evolving situation,” said Abin Joy, who is associated with the group.

Manu Jose, storyteller and an authority in children’s theatre, is thinking of ways to reach out to children who are forced to remain indoors through new media. “Uploading videos of storytelling sessions and games on YouTube to reach out to children is something I am seriously considering. It’s a given that children staying indoors will be into new media in a big way, and such videos will be one way of positively utilising the scenario,” he said.

Mr. Jose is also planning to encourage a limited number of children in the immediate neighbourhood and from families known to each other to gather in a household to play together, thus utilising the situation to engender a sense of community feeling long lost.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/qtgebv/article31071789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15-KI-PARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/children-stare-at-a-dismal-summer-vacation/article31071790.ece

With the price tags on face masks suddenly showing prohibitive costs in the wake of COVID-19 scare, two young partners running a surgical shop at Pachalam have shown the way to many of their counterparts by making masks available at regular rates.

When face masks were being sold at more than ten times their normal prices, Cochin Surgicals sold around 5,200 of them at the standard rate of ₹2 in three days between March 11 and 13 shortly after the second wave of infection was reported from Pathanamthitta. “We are into exports and have received a fresh stock from Chennai procured at a price ranging between ₹7 and ₹9 a piece when we heard about the acute shortage of face masks across the State. They were getting sold at inflated prices and were soon unavailable even at those prices. When there was such a crisis in our own State, we felt the need to put our stock to best use, benefitting needy groups like hospital staff and doctors and public servants working among people,” said P.K. Thasleem, one of the partners.

As soon as a board was put up outside the shop announcing that face masks were available at ₹2, inquiries began pouring in, and the stock was sold out in three days. “We, however, made sure that they were sold to genuine people and not to those looking to stockpile them,” said M.V. Nadheem, the other partner. Initially, they had set aside 4,000 pieces for the initiative, but the numbers soon exceeded 5,000. They would have even sold them for free but for fear of potentially unmanageable rush and a backlash from traders’ association.

“We reserve a portion of our revenue for charity every year, and we will count the distribution of face masks as part of it,” said Mr. Thasleem. The partners have been running the shop for the last eight years.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hqy891/article31071774.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ki15Maskjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/partners-who-turned-good-samaritans-in-times-of-crisis/article31071775.ece
311,2020/03/15,Protest at Kothamangalam church scaled down,"District administration orders to cut down on gatherings due to COVID-19

A gathering of people to mark the 100th day of the relay protest in front of the Marthoman Cheriyapalli (St. Thomas’ Church) at Kothamangalam has been scaled down following instructions from the district administration to cut down on gatherings in the wake of COVID-19 spread.

A.G. George, general convenor of Matha Maithri Samrakshana Samiti, a combine of people in Kothamangalam town, said the gathering on Saturday was reduced to less than a dozen people in view of public opinion against a large gathering.

Mr. George added that the Samiti still stood by its demand that the historic church be protected and its administration not change hands.

The Supreme Court had in July 2017 ordered that the administration of all parishes under the Malankara Church should be handed over to the Orthodox Church, and that no parallel administration would be allowed even in cases related to burial of the dead.

The Matha Maithri Samrakshana Samiti has maintained that the Marthoman Church is central to the life of Kothamangalam town, and a change in administration will affect its future.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/protest-at-kothamangalam-church-scaled-down/article31071759.ece
312,2020/03/15,Taxi operators seek relief,"Appeal comes after closure of tourism centres following COVID-19 spread

Travel Operators’ Association of Kerala (TOAK) has appealed to the Centre and the State to announce relief measures to help tourist vehicle operators, who have been severely hit by COVID-19 crisis. The appeal comes in the wake of the government’s decision to indefinitely close down tourist destinations in the State.

TOAK president M.S. Anilkumar said the association had made representations to the Prime Minister, Chief Minister, Union Finance Minister, Union and State Tourism Ministers, and the State Transport Minister. Two years ago, it was the Nipah virus that adversely affected the industry. It was followed by the 2018 floods. Thanks to timely steps taken by the government, the industry partly survived the crises, but taxi operators could not completely get off their liabilities. Compared to those crises, COVID-19 spread has brought the industry to a complete standstill. TOAK’s representation appealed for a cut in tax on vehicles as well as a temporary relief from GST and a moratorium on EMIs. Travel operators also called for a rollback of the plan to increase insurance premium.

They also felt that with crude oil prices in the international market coming down drastically, oil companies should reduce fuel prices proportionately.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/taxi-operators-seek-relief/article31071756.ece

Seemingly healthy people could infect older and vulnerable individuals at such gatherings.

Screening will be intensified in the district, with focus on major bus terminals and railway stations to check community spread of COVID19, said V.S. Sunil Kumar, Minister for Agriculture, here on Saturday.

Speaking to the media after reviewing the screening facilities at the international terminal at the Cochin international airport, he said it would not be just airport and seaport facilities that would be screening passengers. Instructions have been issued to bus owners conducting inter-State services to have limited bus stops — one in a district — so that it becomes easy to screen passengers, the Minister said.

Domestic terminal

Screening has begun at the domestic terminal of the Cochin international airport to check community transmission, he said.

Over 60,000 passengers were screened in the last couple of days at the airport. On Saturday alone, 30,000 passengers were screened, Mr. Sunil Kumar said. Passengers alighting from aircraft are screened on the bridge itself and advised hospital observation if required.

Help desks opened

316,2020/03/15,"Aluva hospital takes load of testing, transit of passengers","41 passengers from Italy, Germany, and Spain taken to the facility on Saturday

A massive drill is on as the Health Department has taken up the job of taking care of passengers arriving at the Nedumbassery airport from countries hit by COVID-19, all through the night.

As doctors, assisted by nurses, health inspectors, and other technical hands, examine passengers at the airport and categorize them to be sent to various healthcare facilities, yet another group will be making arrangements for serving food to passengers.

By that time the logistics of ambulance deployment comes into play to transport passengers to the designated healthcare facilities. Category-A patients with no symptoms or very mild ones are sent to the Aluva hospital for a thorough check-up, while Category-B and C patients who are symptomatic are shifted to the Government Medical College for isolation.

Meanwhile, a total of 41 passengers from Italy, Germany, and Spain were taken to the Aluva hospital on Saturday morning. The group included three children, one of them an infant.

The new pay ward facility at the hospital is a separate block, which is ideal for isolation, despite the fact that the hospital, located in 18 acres, has very little open area.

Doctors and nurses receive passengers from ambulances and get a detailed examination done, besides tracing their travel history other health issues. Another batch of doctors and nurses get prepared to take over from those examining patients in the isolation ward. “It is difficult for anyone to work wearing personal protection equipment for long hours. So, doctors and nurses at the Aluva hospital take turns in examining people arriving from the airport,” said a doctor who co-ordinates the process.

A health inspector co-ordinates ambulance drivers, who ferry passengers from the airport and then to their homes since they cannot be using public transport.

All passengers who were brought to Aluva were sent for home quarantine in ambulances to various parts of the State such as Piravom, Mala, Irinjalakuda, and Kasaragod.

The isolation ward also has two foreign nationals brought in from Alappuzha. Swabs taken from them were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Alappuzha. The Health Department will be considering further action after the test results come in. If negative, they could be sent back home in the US and UK.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/aluva-hospital-takes-load-of-testing-transit-of-passengers/article31071723.ece

As part of preparedness to handle any possible spike in COVID-19 cases, an isolation ward with 80 rooms is being readied at Government Ayurveda Medical College, Thripunithura.

The hospital authorities shifted a few patients to the general ward, while the others were discharged.

As many as 62 pay wards have been readied at the hospital for isolation. With a separate entrance to the isolation ward, the rooms were cleaned up by Saturday morning. More rooms will be readied soon, the hospital authorities said.

More arrangements will be made as per instructions from the district administration, said K. Murali, hospital superintendent.

The government had decided to create space to accommodate those with COVID-19 symptoms, and government healthcare institutions are being utilised for the purpose.

As of now, three COVID-19 positive patients are being treated at Government Medical College, Ernakulam, the primary treatment centre for the infection. To ease the burden of the hospital, other facilities are being opened in the neighbourhood. The Government Hospital at Aluva is the nearest main centre from the airport where passengers are being examined. Those who require observation can be accommodated in 10 rooms in the isolation ward at the centre.

The Muvattupuzha General Hospital is another facility where people with COVID 19 symptoms from the eastern belt of the district are being isolated.

Pay wards at Government Taluk Hospital, Thripunithura, have also been spared for isolation of patients. Besides, private hospitals have joined the government in providing isolation facilities.

However, Nest is quite the opposite. It is a night shelter where a family can send its elderly members for a night or two when they are otherwise occupied, like travelling.

Nest is an experimental project of Kozhikode-based Living Life Charitable Trust, which has been in the field of elderly care for the past six years and has quite a network of senior citizens under it, in the form of elderly clubs across Kozhikode city.

327,2020/03/15,COVID-19: rough sleepers miss preventive measures in Kozhikode,"They continue to roam around public places without any health support

Even as the Health Department and local bodies claim flawless precautionary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the plight of city’s rough sleepers who stay at vulnerable spots and public places remains the same. In the absence of any health screening mechanism, they continue to roam around public places without any protective masks, sanitisers for cleaning hands or health support to check symptoms.

The Kozhikode railway station and its premises have the highest number of rough sleepers who never care to seek the support of any shelter homes. This risky group includes children, women and elderly persons who throng bus stands and other busy streets. Some of them are also suspected of suffering from various ailments. With the closure of a number of wayside eateries following COVID-19 and bird flu scare, there are also people who even struggle to get their food.

Members of voluntary associations say the distribution of free masks and sanitisers for this vulnerable community is a basic requirement, but no one has even thought of it. If the Health Department issues a directive seeking support, organisations and individuals will be ready to take up the challenge, they point out.

Meanwhile, some of the voluntary organisations in the city are seriously considering the scope of distributing free masks and sanitisers for the use of such wanderers. The plan is to collect the required quantity of products with the support of the youth and sponsors.

Pramod Kottuli, secretary of Yuvadhara Club in Kozhikode city, says the club members will try to cover maximum areas in the city on Monday and distribute all the essential items in the morning. “We have no plan to wait for any official directives to do it.

328,2020/03/15,Small businesses feel the pinch of COVID-19,"Hundreds of families that placed their hopes on small ventures are now scared of the virus infection ripping apart their lives

Thahir’s illuminated push cart is now lying idle at the backyard of his house near the Kozhikode beach. The middle-aged man, his wife, and four children are seemingly hopeless as they are unable to move on with their payasam business in view of the COVID-19 scare that has hit everyone in the district.

At least for three more weeks, he will have to keep aside his business and look out for other options for survival.

Along with other wayside traders, Thahir and his family used to sell about 200 glasses of payasam with an assured daily revenue of ₹2,000. As they offered the home-made product for just ₹10 a glass, there were many takers. Like Thahir, hundreds of families who placed their hopes on small ventures are now staring at uncertainty and are scared of the virus infection ripping apart their lives.

With restrictions in place on the beach and other eco-tourism destinations, small entrepreneurs who opened their wayside eateries in line with the corporation’s sanitation guidelines are out of their jobs. Many of those entrepreneurs who work in the catering field during the day are the worst-hit as most private and public events have been cancelled as a precautionary measure against the viral infection.

Safety first, income next

“We can’t blame anyone else as it is an unexpected challenge. All are bound to follow the safety norms. Being a small-income family, the main challenge is to overcome this tough period just like how middle-income groups without any financial burden do it,” says Faizal, who was part of a beach-side wayside eatery. Even a small fall in the number of beach goers affect the lives of many poor families here. The consequence of the almost temporary closure of all beach destinations is beyond anyone's prediction, he points out.

Unexpected cancellations

The cancellation of private and public events has equally created a domino effect on a number of local entrepreneurs operating in the rental business and other associated fields. Light and sound operators, people who offer mike and other facilities for stage shows, are one of the worst-affected. Naseeb, owner of Calicut Sounds, says he has already given up 13 major pre-booked events in Kozhikode city. “My workers are jobless. The money spent to update our sound systems is going to be a loss with the unexpected setback during this season,” he adds.

To comply with safety instructions, performing artistes in the city have already cancelled most of their pre-scheduled outdoor events. For many, it comes as a blow amid their attempts to survive the loss caused by the previous episodes of floods and the subsequent cancellation of events. They too are uncertain about their job this season.

Double whammy

For Kozhikode, the outbreak of bird flu was a double whammy, which equally put the poultry farmers, traders and consumers in a predicament. Though the Animal Husbandry Department has announced compensation for poultry farmers after culling of pet birds, it is not likely to reach beneficiaries on time with technicalities taking their own sweet time. For those who owned costly ornamental birds, the compensation amount is yet to be fixed.

V.K. Peethambaran, Kozhikode district president, Poultry Farmers Association, says farmers will not be able to survive without the speedy release of compensation amount. “The disease has also affected other connected business ventures. Many of the chicken shops are still remaining closed as part of precautionary measures,” he points out.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/u56twv/article31076468.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16CTPUSHACART,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/small-businesses-feel-the-pinch-of-covid-19/article31076471.ece

Tourists from other States, where the virus was prevalent, too, were screened.

At the GH in Kanniyakumjari the medical team took samples from some of the medicos who arrived from China. After the tests showed negative, they were discharged.

Others, who arrived from overseas, were also quarantined in their homes. On a daily basis, medical teams monitored their progress, Mr. Raja said and added that the district being a tourist spot and neighbour to Kerala, they were also screening public travelling on road including private transport.

Traders in Thoothukudi are feeling the brunt of COVID-19 as they are unable to import Chinese products such as mobile phones, batteries, phone covers, torch lights, emergency lamps, earphones or mosquito bats.

A. Jalal Mohammed, proprietor, Jayachitra Agencies, says they usually procure Chinese products from larger markets in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai.

But with goods just trickling in from China, the vendors in major cities too have run out of stock, he told The Hindu.

Many businesses are solely dependent on Chinese products as they are cheap and sell quickly. “With large markets selling their products at 20% higher than the usual rate, we have no choice but to hike ours too. Since customers are accustomed to buying their products cheap, they are not coming to us anymore,” he says.

According to another businessman, A. Hamid, the choices preferred by customers are also not flowing in, causing another blow to the business. “Customers usually either have a product, its features or its colour in mind. Because of the slow down, we cannot even assure them of when the goods will arrive,” he says.

340,2020/03/15,Usurer jailed for nine years,"DINDIGUL

Sending a strong message, the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court here had punished a financier, who had charged exorbitant rates of interest, to undergo nine years in prison. A co-accused in the crime was also ordered to serve jail term for three years.

The landmark judgement has come as a big relief to the gullible borrowers.

In 1999, Santhanam of Mettupatti near here had borrowed ₹ 5 lakh from Babu alias Abu Sakman of Nehruji Nagar for his hotel business near the bus stand. While receiving the money, the borrower had furnished a blank cheque and signed in promissory notes.

In 2002, though, according to the complainant, he had returned ₹ 9.08 lakh to the financier, he kept on sending messages that he still owed money. The financier, with the help of his relative Rowther Naina of Pudukottai district, had deposited the blank cheque issued by Santhanam, with ₹ 4.20 lakh. It was dishonoured due to insufficient funds. Citing that Santhanam had cheated, the financier lodged a complaint.

However, submitting valid evidence as per the laws, when Santhanam approached the District Crime Branch police, they registered a case against Abu and Rowther.

The court, which tried the case, delivered the judgement on Friday directing the financier under three different sections for three years each totalling to nine years with a fine of ₹ 15,000. In the event of non-compliance of the fine, the guilty shall serve three more months in jail. Also, the court directed the other accused to undergo three year jail term.

Hailing the judgement, consumer activists said that the police should enforce the laws against the usury practised here against gullible persons. Also, they urged the courts to dispose of the cases within a time frame so that it could act as a deterrent against the usurers.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/usurer-jailed-for-nine-years/article31075650.ece

This is one of the stations newly constructed by Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd., which has taken up doubling and electrical work from Vanchi Maniyachi-Nagercoil and Madurai-Vanchi Maniyachi-Thoothukudi.

According to officials, construction of railway stations at Vanchi Maniyachi, Naraikinaru and Gangaikondan in the stretch leading towards Nagercoil is completed.

“At present, a few minor works are under way after the recent inspection of Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Circle, K. A. Manoharan. A speed test is expected to happen by the end of March. After that, train services will be commissioned between Vanchi Maniyachi and Gangaikondan,” said R.

342,2020/03/15,‘Palani temple should procure bananas from Sirumalai’,"Farmers discuss ways and means to enhance coverage area

DINDIGUL

Members of Sirumalai Banana Growers’ Association have appealed to the Palani Sri Dhandayuthapani Swami Temple officials to consider procuring Sirumalai variety bananas from them for making the world famous panchamirtham.

The banana growers who met here to discuss ways and means to enhance the coverage area post the floods have urged the State government to intervene and ensure that the temple administration revived the procurement.

To give a fillip to the banana growers, the then government issued a G.O in 2004 following which the temple administration directed the contractors to procure the fruit from the Sirumalai banana growers.

Apart from the pride for the Sirumalai banana growers, who supplied their produce to the temple for making panchamirtham, it was a unique recognition, said P.E.T. Vignesh Thiyagarajan, a progressive banana grower in Sirumalai.

Though the actual reason was not known for stopping purchases from the Sirumalai growers, the farmers would be delighted to see their bananas bought by the temple administration again.

With the dwindling crop area, there was an urgent need for intervention by researchers from the State-owned Banana Research Station in Tiruchi to study pest problems.

Explaining the issue, the farmers said that a kind of pest had been hitting the crop frequently that close to ₹ 5,000 was spent per acre to mitigate the disease. The scientists can also suggest ideas which would help farmers enhance productivity.

The Sirumalai, situated at 1,600 metres above sea level, had once a total coverage of 16,000 acres, had fallen to less than 2,000 acres of banana crop. Though there were very many reasons, farmers felt that there was a lack of government support during crisis.

Like on the lines of providing subsidy to the fishermen to procure diesel, the government should consider giving relief to the banana growers who used oil motors to pump water and spray fertilizers for the crop. The gunny bags meant for transport too should be offered at a subsidised rate.

Former Panchayat Union chairman Vellimalai said that the Dindigul district administration should write to the Banana Research Station in Tiruchi and invite the scientists/pathologists to study the disease at the earliest.

“If this is prevented, farmers will be relieved to a great extent, as many considered switching to alternatives to banana crop in the hill station,” he said.

The Sirumalai banana, which had the GI tag in 2008, should restore its uniqueness and to achieve the goal, the government support was imminent.

Other speakers at the meeting mentioned the misuse of Sirumalai variety by some growers. Despite not belonging to Sirumalai, they sold them as Sirumalai fruit. The officials should stop such fake circulation in the markets and consumer awareness programmes should be held.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/2bpjeh/article31075225.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA16DGL-BANANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/palani-temple-should-procure-bananas-from-sirumalai/article31075226.ece
343,2020/03/15,Match industry gets uniform GST,"Centre has done away two different tax rates

Sivakasi

A prolonged fight to get a level playing field among match manufacturers has at last come to an end with the Union Government bringing the industry under uniform taxation by doing away with two different tax rates.

During the last Goods and Service Tax council meeting held on Saturday, the Government as done away with the classification of “hand-made” matches which was being taxed at a rate of 5% and other matches made either by partially mechanised or fully mechanised units were levied a tax at a rate of 18%.

“Now the GST has recognised our problem of two tax rates for the same product and has done away with 5% tax and reduced the GST from 18% to matches made by semi-mechanised and fully-mechanised units,” said a leading match manufacturer G. Athipathy.

All India Chamber of Matches has been fighting for over a decade to impress upon the Union Government that hand-made match industry did not exist any more and it was either semi-mechanised or fully mechanised.

“People were making matches using machinery but were claiming to be making hand-made matches only to get the tax benefit. This was leading to lot of tax evasion and thereby created a situation wherein honest tax-paying manufacturers were losing out their business to “so-called” handmade manufacturers,” Mr. Athipathy said.

Stating that those manufacturers who had declared themselves as using semi-mechanised or fully mechanised units were at a disadvantageous position as they had to pay a higher tax — 13% more than those who claimed to be making hand-made matches, he explained.

“With the end product being sold only for Re 1 a box of matches, it was only the manufacturers who were bearing the additional tax,” he said.

The problem that started even during CENVAT regime continued in GST regime too.

However, after the industry’s repeated plea, the Union Government studied the industry and understood that there were no more hand-made match units, Mr. Athipathy said.

Besides, on removing check-posts on State borders after introduction of GST, the misuse of “hand-made” matches increased manifold and the Centre also lost huge tax revenue.

“Now, that every manufacturer will be treated on par, tax-paying manufacturer will gain with the input credit. With an input credit of 7.5%, the actual tax paid by the manufacturer will be around 4.5%,” he added.

Representatives of the industry on Sunday thanked the Minister for Dairy Development, K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji, as the State Government exerted tremendous pressure on the Union Government to solve the issue. Virudhunagar, Thoothukudi. Tirunelveli and Vellore districts were major contributors to the country’s match production.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/match-industry-gets-uniform-gst/article31075189.ece

350,2020/03/15,Savings can save you,"It’s important to have some funds at hand to help you deal with unexpected circumstances

It was July 26, 2005. The afternoon rain had started its frenzy in the city of Mumbai.

The rain continued the whole night and well into the next day.

People were stranded in offices, in trains, in cars and buses. “The whole night, I was sitting in the train, without food to eat, water to drink and no access to washroom facilities to relieve myself,” was the experience of many.

The next day had its own set of problems. One of the difficulties faced by many was the lack of cash. They had balances in bank accounts but not much at home.

“I always thought, in the case of emergency, I will go across the street and withdraw cash from the ATM,” said a friend.

Unfortunately, in some parts of low-lying suburban Mumbai, ATMs were submerged in water.

We all end up facing situations in life or sometimes have been witness to situations that are not only unplanned but also unexpected.

These could be in form of natural or man-made calamities, e.g. torrential rain, tsunami, earthquakes, floods, terrorist attacks or geopolitical situations. These impact the entire region.

There could be some situations which impact a particular individual or a family e.g. loss of income due to job loss, slowdown in the economy, health condition of bread-winner, and the like. At such times, there could be loss of income or an unexpected rise in expenses or both.

In most situations, there is no formal insurance available and hence, it is prudent to keep aside some funds to meet these vagaries of life.

My CEO

Most of us who are salaried have a CEO for our organisation. Ever company in whose shares we have invested has a CEO.

As individuals, we have no control over these CEOs even though they directly or indirectly impact our lives.

However, there is one CEO over whom we do have control, and that is our Contingencies and Emergencies Options (CEO). These are funds kept aside to help us deal with adversities in times of stress. We all have heard the saying ‘a stitch in time saves nine.’

Whether it saves nine or ten, I don’t know, but if there are funds kept aside for contingencies and emergencies, that would certainly enhance our ability to deal with adversity.

How much? Where?

During such times, there will be emotional trauma and financial stress. If there are adequately planned contingencies and emergencies options in place, then our emotional trauma will dilute significantly.

Usually, most financial planners recommend we keep aside funds equivalent to about three months’ mandatory expenses for emergencies. Three months, or 90 days, is sufficient time to come to terms with any kind of trauma.

How long-lasting the scare from trauma is, is dependent on each individual’s frame of mind but in most instances, within about 90 days, life starts limping back to normalcy.

Advice to elderly who are dependent on investments and pension could be to keep aside about 180 days’ reserve. In some extreme cases, advice is also to set aside provision for 220/240 days.

After deciding on how much to keep, the next question that comes to mind is where to keep these funds. Here, the recommendation is to keep funds equivalent to about one week’s expenses in the form of cash at home.

Even today, in most parts of the country, vegetable vendors, milkmen and their ilk prefer cash; more so, if it is a calamity-struck area. The remaining funds may be parked in a savings bank account. This account should be linked to a fixed deposit.

Returns on investment

‘What kind of returns should I expect on these funds?’ was a question posed to me in an investor awareness programme.

Please do not think of returns, tax benefit etc. on funds set aside for emergencies. The only focus should be to ensure a portion of it should be available any time and the rest should be accessible at the earliest with the least effort.

Prepare, don’t predict

Preparation is about taking action. Prediction, a lot many times, is manifestation of inner fears due to hearsay, gossip and rumours.

We are witnessing the pandemic of COVID-19. It is difficult to predict the future but at our end, we can always take small steps to ensure that if there is a slowdown, loss or reduction in income, there is sufficient financial armour to meet our routine expenses for a while.

351,2020/03/15,How to invest my money after I become a senior citizen? Answers to your personal finance queries,"Readers can send in queries on personal ﬁnance and investing to moneywise@thehindu.co.in

Q. I will be retiring in May 2020 at the age of 58. On retirement, I will have about ₹1 crore in savings. I also own a house. Kindly advise on how to invest my money for the next two years and after I become a senior citizen.

Ram

A. Even if you are less than 60, you can invest in the Post Office Senior Citizens’ Scheme. The law says: “an individual of the age of 55 years or more but less than 60 years who has retired on superannuation or under VRS can also open account subject to the condition that the account is opened within one month of receipt of retirement benefits and amount should not exceed the amount of retirement benefits.” So, you can invest up to ₹15 lakh (maximum permitted) in your name as soon as you retire. The balance can be invested in a combination of large bank FDs, post office time deposit and select top-rated corporate deposits. If you are familiar with mutual funds, you can also consider liquid funds and do a systematic withdrawal plan (SWP). It would be very tax efficient. Assume you generate an average 7%, or ₹7 lakh of income, from your corpus per annum. If this is more than adequate, then reduce investments in the above safe options and invest a small proportion in some quality hybrid funds under the category of equity savings. This will also provide some tax efficiency and earn debt-like returns.

Q. I am married and have children. My home loan EMI is ₹10,908 and my personal loan EMI is ₹6,200. My wife wants to close the home loan with ₹4 lakh from pledge of gold. I feel we should close the personal loan...

Sabarinathan

A. It is good to close the loan that does not provide any tax benefit. In your case, personal loan repayment should come first. However, we see little need to pledge gold to close any loan. Is your interest rate on pledging gold lower than the personal loan rate? It is unlikely but if that is the case, then it can be a reason to pledge. Else, my candid answer would be to sell gold now (prices are high) and repay, if you don’t need that gold and your monthly cash flows are becoming tight, post EMI.

Q. I’m 23 years old and currently preparing for a competitive exam. I have savings of ₹50,000. Can you suggest some investment plans for 1-3 years?

Karthik

A. For your time frame, you can consider a combination of large bank FDs, short duration debt mutual funds that are consistent and some exposure to equity savings fund. Given your short time frame, we do not wish to recommend any equity exposure.

Q. I have made mutual fund (MF) investments in physical statement of account (SOA) form through a lump sum investment mode. Please advise on the benefits of conversion of physical SOA MF units into an online demat mode.

Varun Dambal

A. Physical form of investing is not an optimal way to organise your investments. You should consider going online. However, there are several platforms that provide you online MF services without demat form. In other words, they are like having a statement, except that it is all online and you can view your investments at any point in an app or laptop. Demat form of investing also helps you consolidate your investments and view them online (assuming your broker is indeed online). But it is not a necessity. If you are already investing in stocks, then holding MFs and stocks in the same demat can help you consolidate. If you aren’t, then you could look at other online options to avoid demat or brokerage charges.

352,2020/03/15,Is the global economy headed for recession?,"How deep has the impact of COVID-19 been on businesses around the world? And which are the ones that have been hit the hardest?

The story so far: The global death toll due to COVID-19 has crossed the 5,300 mark, with over 1.42 lakh people infected. India, where 88 people have been infected, saw two casualties when a 76-year old man died in Karnataka and a 68-year-old woman died in Delhi this week. A diverse set of industries has been impacted by the spread of the virus. With daily news reports painting a dismal picture of supply chains affected, it is easy to visualise the global economy virtually grinding to a halt.

What does it mean to the global economy?

Analysts fear that the global economy may tip into a recession unless the virus turns out to be seasonal. (A recession sets in when the economy shows two consecutive quarters of contraction.)

The problem with current predictions is no one knows how long the virus will remain potent, how authorities around the world are able to stanch new cases and the resources they pull out to treat old ones. What business hates is uncertainty and uncertainty is the only thing that abounds when it comes to predictions about the vitality, endurance and longevity of the new virus.

Rabobank has been cited in the media as saying that a global recession now is all but certain. It has predicted global GDP growth to be 1.6% for 2020, a figure that was 2.9% the last year, as per IMF estimates.

Also read: What can India do to overcome the global slowdown?

Economists from Nomura have warned that a global recession might be inevitable.

This year, in early March, the Institute for International Finance had said that global economic growth could turn out to be as low as 1%, and this was even before the OPEC club and Russia fell out on production agreements to maintain stable oil prices. Oil prices have had a free fall, sending stock markets into a tizzy. The UN’s United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said the virus outbreak could cost the global economy up to $2-trillion this year and that the pandemic could cause a recession in some countries causing global economic growth to clock in below 2.5%.

Why should the economy be affected?

If you engage less with the outer world, and avoid work, education, fitness and entertainment, a lot less economic activity would occur. Businesses face the challenge of disrupted supply of components to make products, or of having to shut some of their factories temporarily, not to mention large swathes of the workforce having to be quarantined.

Which are the industries impacted?

There is no industry that has experienced the impact. When China, with the disease’s epicentre in Wuhan, was brought to its knees, the Indian pharmaceutical, automobile and mobile phone industries, for example, immediately wobbled. India depends on China for supplies of components for products that these sectors make.

The Indian pharma industry, which depends on China for 70% of raw materials needed to manufacture drugs here, has seen input costs go up by 50% as of February this year. The pesticides sector is another that has been affected as manufacturers depend on China for raw materials. While there are comforting stock levels for now in India, farmers may soon face pesticide availability issues unless the situation resolves quickly.

The Indian gem and jewellery makers lament the partial closure of the Chinese and Hong Kong markets, which is likely to result in a loss of about $1-billion by April this year to the Indian sector which depends on these two foreign markets for 70% of its exports.

Even the software services industry, which so easily lends itself to working from remote locations, can only progress so far. Decision-making in the West, a key market for software services, may have been hit, with in-bound travel restricted and the U.S. declaring emergency. When a health challenge hits you, analysts say the pricing of a technology contract will not be top of the mind.

It is for this reason that the markets have barely taken note of regulators’ attempts to infuse funds into the global economy. A few days ago, the U.S. Federal Reserve held an emergency meeting and cut interest rates by a half percentage point. The stock markets reacted favourably for a short while before losing steam and spiralling downwards.

On Thursday, the Euro markets remained unmoved even after the European Central Bank announced fresh stimulus measures to help the economy cope with the growing cost of the COVID-19 epidemic. But, the U.S. declaring a state of emergency over the spread of the virus will help allocate the significant quantum of funds needed to deal with a health-care requirement of this magnitude. Investors reacted positively to this, and the U.S. markets zoomed in response.

How will it hit the travel sector?

Travel has been hit severely as countries issue advisories to eliminate unnecessary travel and go into lockdown mode. The U.S., for instance, has halted all in-bound travel from Europe. India has temporarily stopped grant of visas except for emergency situations.

The impact on profits of — and jobs at — airlines, airport authorities and oil marketing companies is obvious and immediate, not to mention the economy around air travel — the vendor of coffee and sandwiches pays out a monthly premium to occupy prime airport space so that he can sell you a cappuccino and a sandwich when you pass by his counter.

At an aviation event in Hyderabad the past week, Boeing executives gave rough estimates indicating there had been a 50% reduction in daily flight count in the Asia-Pacific region. In normal times, mainland China would see 15,000 departures a day and at the peak of the virus the country was operating 3,000 flights a day. The rest of Asia-Pacific sees 5,000 flights operated in a day. “At one point we saw 2,500,” said a Boeing executive. As the virus spreads to other markets, airlines in Europe and the U.S. are bound to cut capacity.

When normalcy returns, wouldn’t pent-up demand make up for lack of economic activity now?

Take the example of shared mobility in India. Anecdotal evidence tells us that at steady state, cab drivers cannot quite afford to have their cabs out of circulation for even as short a period as a week, if they have to put food on the table for their families. Curtailed travel and commutes can be devastating for them unless the situation resolves quickly. Only some of the expenses that are being held back by consumers can be made up for later when pent-up demand is unleashed after the situation returns to normal. A postponed vacation may eventually see light of day. But micro-expenses, which contribute significantly to an economy, such as a cab fare or buying snacks for a commute, can never be made up for, once the sun sets that day.

Wouldn’t entertainment and sports offer a reprieve?

Entertainment via mass media has seen significant impact. The very popular Indian Premier League has been postponed. The South Africa-India cricket series has been cancelled. States such as Kerala have shut down cinema halls for this month. Indian movie releases have been postponed indefinitely.

Also read: Coronavirus live blog - March 14: Impact on sports

Globally, the picture is no different. In football, all Union of European Football Association (UEFA) competitions, including the Champions League and Europa League matches, have been postponed. Formula 1 has called off the first race of the season, the Australian Grand Prix. In golf, the PGA has cancelled its Players’ Championship.

The U.S. basketball association, the National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its season’s events indefinitely while the body that conducts college championships for the sport, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), has cancelled both its men’s and women’s upcoming events. The fate of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo is up in the air.

The iconic Disneyworld has brought down its shutters temporarily to help prevent the spread of the virus – it has shut shop earlier in its history: immediately after President Kennedy’s assassination in 1963, and post the 9/11 attacks in New York.

Is there a silver lining at all?

Sales of medical supplies, soaps, hand sanitisers and essentials to be stocked up at home will evidently rise.

It is said that after the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China in 2003, shoppers began to prefer buying online, to avoid crowded spaces and that e-commerce major Alibaba’s fortunes zoomed after this. Digital shopping may see even more traction.

353,2020/03/15,Coronavirus | How does soap use help in tackling COVID-19?,"Is there a difference between using soap and water and alcohol-based hand sanitisers?

The story so far: Ever since the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak began in China in end-December 2019, various measures have been mentioned to reduce the risk of infection. Guidelines by the World Health Organization specify that one of the ways to reduce the risk of infection is by regularly and thoroughly cleaning one’s hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water. Regular washing becomes important as the virus tends to be viable from hours to more than a day on different surfaces that are regularly touched with hands.

How does washing with soap help get rid of the coronavirus?

The grime on our hands contains innumerable viruses and bacteria. Washing with water without using soap helps reduce the amount of microbes but does not remove most of the virus and bacteria completely. Using soap, therefore, becomes far more effective in removing microbes.

Viruses such as coronavirus, influenza-causing viruses, Ebola, Zika have their genetic material encased in a layer of fat called the lipid envelop. Soap molecules are pin-shaped with a head that is water-loving (hydrophilic) and a tail that is oil-loving (oleophilic). Being oleophilic, the tail portion of the molecule tends to have an affinity for and ‘competes’ with the lipids in the virus envelope. Since the chemical bonds holding the virus together are not very strong, the long oleophilic tail gets inserted into the envelope and tends to have a ‘crowbar’ effect that breaks the lipid envelope of the virus. The tail also competes with the bond that binds the RNA and the lipid envelop thus dissolving the virus into its components which are then removed by water.

Do all viruses have the lipid layer?

No, certain viruses do not have the lipid envelop and are called the non-enveloped viruses. Rotavirus which causes severe diarrhoea, poliovirus, adenovirus that cause pneumonia and even human papillomavirus (HPV) do not contain the lipid envelop.

Also read: Coronavirus in India | 4,000 under watch

The oil-loving tail of the soap molecule also disrupts the bond that binds dirt and non-enveloped viruses to the hand. The dirt and viruses are surrounded by several tails making them remain as suspended particles. Rinsing with water washes away the suspended particles leading to clean hands.

How do alcohol-based hand sanitisers help get rid of coronavirus?

Like soap, the alcohol present in hand sanitisers dissolve the lipid envelop, thus inactivating the virus. In addition, the alcohol also tends to change the shape or denature the mushroom-shaped protein structures that stick out of the lipid envelop. The mushroom-shaped protein structures help the virus to bind to special structures found on human cells and enter the cells. To be effective, the sanitisers should contain at least 60% alcohol.

Unlike soap lather, the alcohol does not come in contact with all parts of the hand. So care needs to be taken to use sufficient amount of sanitiser to increase the coverage. Unlike water, alcohol run does not remove the dead viruses from the hand. While a sanitiser can quickly reduce the number of microbes, it does not get rid of all types of germs, and is “not as effective when hands are visibly dirty or greasy”.

Should healthy people who are not taking care of COVID-19 patients use a mask?

Medical masks help prevent the spread of coronavirus infection. If worn properly, masks may be effective in preventing transmission of coronavirus. An article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) says there is no evidence to suggest that masks worn by healthy individuals can help prevent infection.

But a 2010 study says: “Mask wearing was associated with reduced secondary transmission and should be encouraged during outbreak situations.”

Even the World Health Organization (WHO) says wearing a medical mask is “one of the prevention measures to limit spread of certain respiratory diseases, including novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), in affected areas”.

Transmission through droplets from coughing and sneezing is one of the major routes of virus spread. When worn correctly, a mask can reduce the risk of inhaling droplets containing the virus.

With many studies showing that people infected with novel coronavirus transmit the virus even before symptoms show up, it may be prudent to wear a mask especially when the virus is spreading in the community.

In a country like India, maintaining at least one metre distance can be a challenge, especially when there is no way of knowing who is infected till such time the person starts showing visible symptoms.

What other precautions should be taken when a mask is used?

WHO cautions that using a mask alone will be insufficient to provide an “adequate level of protection”. It should be combined with hand hygiene to prevent human-to-human transmission. Wearing medical masks can give a person a “false sense of security that can lead to neglecting other essential measures such as hand hygiene practices”. So if an individual decides to wear a mask, care must be taken to regularly wash hands with soap or alcohol rub, and avoid touching the face with hands.

Incorrect mask wearing might otherwise reduce the effectiveness in cutting the risk of transmission. It should be discarded once it gets wet or dirty, and care should be taken to safely dispose of used masks. The same mask should not used for more than a couple of hours.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gavzb1/article30656819.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGHANDS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-does-soap-use-help-in-tackling-covid-19/article31070630.ece
354,2020/03/15,Keep your insurance policies well serviced,"It is your duty to renew policies on time, keep documents safe, assign nominees

In this column, over the past year, we saw how to buy various types of insurance policies including health insurance, life insurance, annuities, motor insurance and some property insurances.

One way of looking at insurance is that the policy you buy is not the product. The claim is. The implication is also that when you buy the policy your job is not over. You have to maintain the policy and administer it in such a way that you get your claim paid.

What does this involve?

Firstly, it means keeping your policy current and valid. Most people think it is the insurance company’s or agent’s duty to remind them about renewal and chase up the renewal premium. Maybe it makes business sense for them to do so, but it is really our duty to keep our policies valid by paying renewal premiums on time and ensuring we receive the policy documents and checking if they are in order.

Renewal in the case of non-life policies are more mission-critical because the typical policy is annual and actually expires in one year unless renewed.

So, if your policy expired yesterday, any claim that arises today will just not be payable. The policy itself can be renewed after a gap, but you can lose out on benefits during the waiting period for pre-existing conditions, or will have to fulfil some additional formalities like medical examination, or inspection in the case of a motor policy.

Considering this hassle, it’s not that difficult to put a reminder on your smartphone or your wall calendar/diary and renew your policy well ahead of time!

Renewal time is also an opportunity to review your requirements, enhance coverage, add family members to policies and so on. If you want to port your policy to a different insurance company, you need to keep the renewal date in mind as the formalities for this start about six to eight weeks ahead of the renewal date.

Keep your insurance company updated with your personal information whether it is your new mobile number or a change of address. This will help the insurer serve you better for renewals and, in case of a claim, you will be saved additional formalities at a time of distress.

The most important thing you have to do to maintain your policy is to ensure your nominations are in place. This applies to any policy that involves mortality.

Any type of life policy including annuities, hospitalisation policies and personal accident policies should have a clear nomination and you should file an acknowledged copy of it along with your policy for your records, or rather, that of your family members.

Another key duty is to keep your policy documents safe and in a handy place. Of course, we live in a digital age, but you have been issued a policy which is a signed, stamped bond and you should safeguard it and retrieve it at the time of need. Keep policies under lock and key. Higher value policies of longer term that need to be negotiated after you pass may even be kept in your bank locker which your heirs should be briefed about and should have access to.

Ensure your documentation is absolutely perfect to support your insurance claim. Address proof, identity proof, age proof, ownership proof in case of property insurances like motor and home insurance, your PAN card, bank details — since most claims are paid only through electronic channels — all these will help you sleep in peace, once insured. And when there is a claim, you and / or your family will find the process painless — exactly the kind of support needed during trying times.

Oil giant Saudi Aramco on Sunday posted a 21% decline in 2019 net profit due to a drop in oil prices and production, and said it plans to “rationalise” capital spending in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

This was Aramco's first earnings announcement after it listed in December in a record $29.4 billion initial public offering (IPO) that valued the company at $1.7 trillion.

358,2020/03/15,Yes Bank and bonds,"Why are investors stuck with Additional Tier 1 bonds? What is the Reserve Bank of India policy on this?

The story so far: Depositors and investors in Yes Bank received a rude jolt on March 5 when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced its decision to impose short-term curbs on their withdrawals, citing the bank’s declining financial position. Since then, efforts have been made to quickly stitch together a bailout package for depositors before the event took a systemic toll. With the State Bank of India (SBI) agreeing to acquire a 49% equity stake, other investors joining in and the Cabinet clearing a reconstruction proposal, the fog has cleared a bit for depositors, as the withdrawal limits may soon be lifted. But one set of Yes Bank stakeholders who were expected by the RBI to take immediate and complete write-offs at the first sign of the bank’s troubles, were the holders of its Additional Tier 1 bonds. Apart from mutual funds, pension funds and other institutions who usually invest in such bonds, quite a few retail investors are also stuck with them.

What are AT1 bonds?

AT1 bonds, also known as Additional Tier 1 bonds, are unsecured perpetual bonds issued by banks to shore up their capital base to meet Basel III requirements. Basel III norms were a set of rules that banking regulators around the world came up with after the global financial crisis in 2008, to strengthen bank balance sheets. Requiring banks to have their own skin in the game in the form of permanent capital, before taking on deposits or loans, is one of the underlying principles of Basel III norms. The RBI’s version of Basel III norms requires Indian banks to hold a minimum capital amounting to 11.5% of their risk-weighted loans. Of this, about 9% is supposed to be the bank’s core capital (called Tier 1), with 5.5% in equity. AT1 bonds are issued by banks to supplement their permanent or Tier 1 capital which is mainly made up of equity shares.

Don’t bonds have a fixed maturity? Why are AT1 bonds ‘perpetual’? Will investors never get back their principal?

Yes, as per their contract terms, AT1 bonds are supposed to remain permanently with the bank and pay investors interest for perpetuity. In practise though, these bonds have a ‘call option’ after 5 or 10 years that banks use to retire one set of AT1 bonds and issue another. Indian banks have so far never failed to call back their AT1 bonds after 5 or 10 years, and this has led to people forgetting their ‘perpetual’ nature.

In the Yes Bank case, why did the RBI propose that AT1 holders alone must take a write-off?

The contract terms for AT1 bonds mention clearly that the value of these bonds can be completely written off if the bank’s capital ratios fall below certain regulatory thresholds. The write-off also kicks in if the RBI decides that the bank is beyond the “Point of Non Viability” or needs a public sector capital infusion to survive. This is the clause that the RBI seems to have originally invoked in the Yes Bank case. So, even though bond-holders generally come higher in the pecking order of stakeholders than equity shareholders in most situations, AT1 bonds incorporate special situations where their contract terms allow for their holders to suffer write-offs before equity shareholders.

Also read: Explained: Why did Yes Bank have to be bailed out?

Are there other such clauses lurking in the fine print for AT1 bonds?

Yes, several. One, these bonds can partly or fully skip their interest payments for any year if the bank’s Tier 1 capital ratios fall below the RBI’s thresholds. They can also give interest payouts a miss if the bank makes losses and has insufficient reserves. Two, the bank can also reduce the principal value of these bonds temporarily or for good, if its equity Tier 1 ratio falls below specified limits. Finally, there is the bombshell clause that the RBI used in Yes Bank. When a bank is teetering, the RBI can decide on a complete write-down of its AT1 bonds or convert them into equity if it feels that it has reached the point of non-viability.

How did these bonds get into the hands of retail investors?

Reports suggest that retail investors were sold these high-value bonds (the face value is ₹10 lakh each) as high-return alternatives to fixed deposits, given that they were offering 2-3% higher interest than FDs. Some investors also bought them through their brokers based on their high yields in the secondary market.

So who should invest in AT1 bonds?

Only affluent investors who are willing to take on higher risk of a capital loss for higher yields.

So what happens to Yes Bank AT1 bond holders?

Bondholders need to wait for clarity from the Centre or Courts. While the RBI’s original scheme had proposed a complete write-off of these bonds, this was protested by institutions who were exploring legal options. The reconstruction scheme notified this week does not mention the way ahead for AT1 bonds.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/jjbxw9/article31070607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THiStock-477857405,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/yes-bank-and-bonds/article31070609.ece
359,2020/03/15,Circuit breakers temper market frenzy,"A pre-opening session of 15 minutes was mandated after trading resumed post the compulsory halt.

What are market wide circuit breakers?

Market-wide circuit breakers refer to the daily limit — both on the upside and the downside — that the benchmark indices can move in a single day before a trading halt is initiated. The circuit breaker mechanism was introduced in July 2001 as a measure against a significantly huge swings in the Sensex or Nifty.

Most recently, the circuit breakers were triggered on Friday after the Nifty hit the first limit of 10% soon after the start of the trading session. As per regulations, trading is suspended in both the BSE as well as the National Stock Exchange (NSE), if either of the benchmarks hits the circuit breaker.

What are the circuit limits?

The limits have been pegged at three levels — 10%, 15% and 20% — and the duration of the trading halt has been linked to the time at which the triggers are hit. If any of the benchmarks move 10% before 1 p.m., then trading is halted for 45 minutes.

Such a movement between 1 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. entails a 15-minute halt, while a 10% swing after 2:30 p.m. does not call for any trading halt.

A 15% movement in the Sensex or Nifty before 1 p.m. leads to suspension of trade for 1:45 hours while a 15% swing between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m. brings trading to a halt for 45 minutes. If the Sensex or Nifty hits the 15% limit after 2 p.m. then trading is suspended for the rest of the day. The maximum market-wide circuit breaker limit has been fixed at 20% and if this trigger is hit at any point of time during the trading session, then trading is halted for the rest of the day.

Are circuit limits revised often?

Earlier, when the concept of ciruit breakers for indices was introduced, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) made it mandatory for exchanges to translate these trigger limits in absolute points on a quarterly basis.

At the end of each quarter, these absolute points were revised and made applicable for the next quarter. From 2013 onwards, the regulator directed stock exchanges to introduce daily calculation of circuit breaker limits based on the previous day’s closing level of the index.

Additionally, a pre-opening session of 15 minutes was mandated after trading resumed post the compulsory halt.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/igl410/article31070627.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THBUSENSEX,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/circuit-breakers-temper-market-frenzy/article31070628.ece
