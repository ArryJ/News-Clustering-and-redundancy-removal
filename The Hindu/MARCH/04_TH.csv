0,2020/03/04,WhatsApp launches Dark Mode for both iPhone and Android,"The users would notice a special dark gray background and off-white colour that lowers the brightness of the screen, cuts down the glare and improves contrast and readability, the company said.

Facebook-owned WhatsApp on Tuesday announced to roll out the much-awaited ‘Dark Mode’ feature on both iPhone and Android devices globally.

‘Dark Mode’ is designed to reduce eye strain in low-light environments and prevent those awkward moments that happen when your phone lights up the room.







The feature is being rolled out with the latest version of WhatsApp.

The users would notice a special dark gray background and off-white colour that lowers the brightness of the screen, cuts down the glare and improves contrast and readability, the company said.

“When designing dark mode, we spent time researching and experimenting with a focus on two particular areas: readability and information hierarchy.

“When choosing colours, we wanted to minimise eye fatigue and use colours that are closer to the system defaults on iPhone and Android, respectively,” said WhatsApp.

“We also wanted to help users easily focus their attention on each screen. We did this by using colour and other design elements to make sure the most important information stands out,” it added.

Users on Android 10 and iOS 13 can use Dark Mode by enabling it in system settings.

Users on Android 9 and below versions can go into WhatsApp settings, then chats, theme and select ‘Dark’.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/dkzoqm/article30500444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03NETWHATSAPP,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/whatsapp-launches-dark-mode-for-both-iphone-and-android/article30979102.ece
1,2020/03/04,Facebook tweaks Libra project amid pressure,"Several US senators have opposed Facebook’s digital coin, arguing that the social networking giant has been irresponsible with user data privacy.

Hit by regulators and political pressure, Facebook is reportedly planning to now offer digital versions of government-backed currencies, including the US dollar and the euro, apart from the cryptocurrency Libra.

According to a report in The Information on Tuesday, the social networking giant would also delay the roll out of its digital currency by several months.

Facebook Calibra wallet, originally slated to launch this summer, is now coming out in October, the report said.

The crypto wallet will also support other major currencies apart from Libra.

Facebook, however, denied the report that earlier stated that Calibra wallet will not offer Libra.

“Reporting that Facebook does not intend to offer the Libra currency in its Calibra wallet is entirely incorrect. Facebook remains fully committed to the project,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Verge.

Several US senators have opposed Facebook’s digital coin, arguing that the social networking giant has been irresponsible with user data privacy. They have even called the digital cryptocurrency Libra “delusional” and “dangerous”.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the Congress last October about Libra, defending the idea, but acknowledging the struggles left to overcome.

The Libra Association last year said that that over 1,500 entities indicated interest in joining the Libra project effort since the project was announced on June 18, 2019.

Facebook and 20 partner organisations formally joined the digital currency project during a meeting in Geneva in October.

Even as the world is grappling to contain the epidemic, with more than 3,000 deaths and over 90,000 cases across 76 countries, senior scientists at Australia’s national science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), have said the virus is mutating.

A man and his daughter were arrested on Tuesday from Pulwama’s Hakripora village for allegedly sheltering the suicide bomber who attacked a CRPF convoy last year in Pulwama leaving 40 jawans dead. Their house was used to shoot the last video by the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM).

4,2020/03/04,COVID-19 | Italy closes schools as death toll hits 107,"The nation of 60 million people has now recorded over 3,000 cases and only trails China in terms of total fatalities

Italy on Wednesday closed all schools and universities until March 15 as the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the Mediterranean country hit 107.

The measure is the most restrictive response to COVID-19 of any European nation and tougher than the closure of schools — but not universities — taken by fellow Group of Seven (G7) member Japan.

Italy reported 28 more deaths on Wednesday, the highest single day total to date. The nation of 60 million people has now recorded over 3,000 cases and only trails China in terms of total fatalities.

Other measures discussed by top ministers and reported by Italian media include what promises to be an unpopular plan to play all football matches without fans for a month.

Italy has borne the brunt in Europe of a disease that is now spreading across the world faster than it is in the central Chinese region where it was first detected late last year.

The problem for the Italian government is that existing restrictions — including a quarantine of 11 towns with 50,000 people in the north — have failed to stop the outbreak.

The overwhelming majority of the fatalities have occurred in Milan's Lombardy region and the neighbouring northern area around the cities of Bologna and Venice.

But 21 of the 22 regions have now had cases and infections are slowly reaching Italy's less wealthy and developed south.

The government reported the first death south of Rome on Wednesday. It came in the Puglia region that surrounds the city of Bari in the heel of the Italian boot on the map.

Top government minister spent hours huddling Wednesday to chart a way out of a health crisis that threatens to tip Italy's wheezing economy into recession and overwhelm hospitals.

Most of the steps being considered involve ways to avoid crowds and keep people from coming in contact with each other outdoors.

Crowd control

Media reports said people will be advised to stay at least a metre (three feet) apart and to avoid crowded places whenever possible.

The traditional greetings of kissing on the cheeks or shaking hands are strongly discouraged.

Exhibits and shows are set to be rescheduled — a measure that will be especially painful for Italy's already hard-hit hotel and restaurant industry.

Some of the government's more mundane and common-sense measures include instructions to cough and sneeze in a handkerchief to avoid hands coming in contact with “respiratory secretions”.

Italians will also be urged to avoid sharing bottles and not to drink from the same cups and glasses.

The crowd-control measures will most directly affect football matches and could cause the most resentment in the sports-mad nation.

Italy's Serie A has already been thrown into disarray by two weeks of postponements that have seen some clubs not play at all and others play multiple matches in a week.

Fans will even be prohibited from attending the training sessions of top teams such as Cristiano Ronaldo's Juventus in Turin.

The government will also recommend to those over 75 to stay indoors and to avoid public places. The advice extends to those who are at least 65 and suffer from other ailments.

A top civil protection official told AFP that most of those who have died in the past few days were in their 80s and 90s and were already suffering from other pathologies.

All these measures are meant to stay in place for a month and be reviewed and possibly fine-tuned after two weeks.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mi2lmu/article30985057.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ITALYVIRUSOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-italy-closes-schools-as-death-toll-hits-107/article30985059.ece
5,2020/03/04,One killed in clashes on Greece-Turkey border,"Stun grenades fired at migrants

Greek authorities fired tear gas and stun grenades on Wednesday morning to repulse a push by migrants to cross its land border from Turkey, as pressure continued along its frontier after Turkey said its own border with Europe was open to whoever wanted to cross.

Turkish authorities said one person was killed and five were wounded by fire coming from the Greek side — an assertion the Greek government strongly rejected as “fake news.”

The clashes were near the border village of Kastanies, along a border fence that covers much of the frontier not demarcated by the Evros river.

Turkey made good on a threat to open its borders and send migrants into Europe last week. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s action triggered days of violent clashes at the land border, where thousands of migrants and refugees have gathered.

Meanwhile, the European Union said will not give in to “blackmail” by Turkey and borders will remain closed to migrants despite Ankara’s threat to let them pass, France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday.

6,2020/03/04,Joe Biden wins 9 States in Super Tuesday race; Bloomberg drops out,"Bernie Sanders vows to continue the fight for candidacy; Mr. Bloomberg endorses Biden

Super Tuesday, when fourteen American States voted in the Democratic primaries, was a watershed moment in former Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s quest for the nomination, as he surpassed his progressive rival, Bernie Sanders by winning strongly in the south.

Also read | Biden sweeps South Carolina primary

The crowded democratic field has now been reshaped into a Biden vs. Sanders contest, and battle of identity for the Democratic party — between its centrist or moderate wing represented by the former Vice-President and its progressive wing led by the independent Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders.

Also read | Scripting an audacity of hope, the Sanders way

Tuesday, however, went to Mr. Biden, who won nine of the 14 States in contest. Buoyed by a win in South Carolina on Saturday and with endorsements from other Democrats, including Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who dropped out of the race in the last few days, Mr. Biden had won at least 418 delegates (so far) to the nominating convention, relative to Mr. Sanders’s count of 367 delegates.

Mr. Biden had a surprise win in Texas, the State with second most number of delegates, which Mr. Sanders was leading in, according to opinion polls before Super Tuesday. He also won Virginia, and North Carolina.

California, which has the most number of delegates (415), is expected to be won by Mr. Sanders, although by a narrower margin than first expected. Mr. Sanders has won 72 delegates relative to Mr. Biden’s 21, with just under 80% reporting, as per the Associated Press.

“You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,” Mr. Sanders said to a crowd in Vermont on Tuesday. “ What we need is a new politics that brings working class people into our political movement, which brings young people into our political movement…”

Mr. Biden had a surprise win in Texas, the second largest prize on Tuesday, a state where Mr. Sanders had been in the lead.

It was a disastrous night for progressive candidate, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who came in third in her home state of Massachusetts, which was won by Mr. Biden. Mr. Sanders came in second place. Mr. Sanders narrowly lost Massachusetts to Hilary Clinton in the 2016 primary; Ms. Clinton won the State by a large margin in the general election against U.S. President Donald Trump.

Progressive votes had thus far been split between Ms. Warren, who has won a total of 36 delegates and Mr. Sanders, with some criticising Ms. Warren for not dropping out of the race before Super Tuesday in order to consolidate support for Mr. Sanders, who was way ahead of her. Ms. warren performed poorly among black voters across States — and had a mediocre performance — just 33% among her core group, college-educated white women in Massachusetts, as per the New York Times.

Bloomberg exits race

Former New York Mayor, billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who had spent more than $687 million on his campaign so far (and about $ 550 million on ads), performed very poorly on Tuesday and decided to suspend his campaign, endorsing Mr. Biden. Mr. Bloomberg won 12 delegates on Tuesday as per some projections, winning American Samoa, but losing States like Virginia and North Carolina to his closest competitor, Mr. Biden.

“I’ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. After yesterday’s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden,” Mr. Bloomberg said in a statement.

Financial assistance from Mr. Bloomberg could provide a game-changing boost for Mr. Biden’s campaign, something Mr. Biden hinted on Wednesday morning.

“This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics. It’s about defeating Donald Trump, and with your help, we’re gonna do it,” Mr. Biden said in a tweet.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/o7o2tx/article30984395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-poll,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/joe-biden-wins-9-states-in-super-tuesday-race/article30984396.ece
7,2020/03/04,"U.S. launches strikes on Taliban, calls for halt to ‘needless attacks’","The militant group had mounted attacks on Afghan forces

The United States on Wednesday carried out its first air strike on Taliban fighters in Afghanistan since the two sides signed a troop withdrawal agreement on Saturday.

A U.S. forces spokesman confirmed the incident in southern Helmand province, hours after President Donald Trump spoke by phone with chief Taliban negotiator Mullah Baradar Akhund on Tuesday, the first known conversation between a U.S. leader and a top Taliban official.

Also read | A big, bad deal: On U.S.-Taliban agreement

The Taliban fighters “were actively attacking an (Afghan National Security Forces) checkpoint. This was a defensive strike to disrupt the attack,” said Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for the U.S. Forces in Afghanistan in a tweet.

He said Washington was committed to peace but would defend Afghan forces if needed. “Taliban leadership promised the (international) community they would reduce violence and not increase attacks. We call on the Taliban to stop needless attacks and uphold their commitments,” he said.

The strike was the first by the U.S. against the Taliban in 11 days, when a violence reduction deal had begun between the sides in the lead up to Saturday’s pact.

The Taliban had decided on Monday to resume normal operations against Afghan forces, though sources have said they will continue to hold back on attacks on foreign forces.

The Taliban has declined to confirm or deny responsibility for any of the attacks. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said in a Tweet that ”according to the plan (the Taliban) is implementing all parts of the agreement one after another in order to keep the fighting reduced.”

A Taliban senior commander in Helmand who declined to be named said that a drone had targeted their position.

“As far as I know we didn’t suffer any human losses but we are working on it and sent our team to the area,” he told Reuters, adding that the group’s senior leadership in Afghanistan had called an emergency meeting to discuss what he described as a “major violation” of the agreement.

“THINGS COULD SPIRAL”

Experts said the public agreement was vague on details around ongoing violence in the country, but that the air strike and comments from U.S. officials suggested the United States had a plan to ensure reduced violence against Afghan forces and civilians.

“It is significant. I don’t think it signals the collapse of the whole U.S.-Taliban agreement...(but) you can easily see how things could spiral,” said Andrew Watkins, a senior analyst covering Afghanistan at International Crisis Group.

A spokesman for Helmand’s provincial governor said the Taliban had attacked a security checkpoint in Washer district - a different district to the one in which the U.S. carried out its air strike - on Tuesday evening, killing two police officers.

An Interior Ministry spokesman, Nasrat Rahimi, said the Taliban had conducted 30 attacks in last 24 hours, killing four civilians and 11 security personnel. Seventeen militants were also killed, he said.

The weekend agreement envisages a full withdrawal of all U.S. and coalition forces within 14 months, dependent on security guarantees by the Taliban, but faces a number of hurdles as the United States tries to shepherd the Taliban and Afghan government towards talks.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hd1cy2/article30984281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Afghan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-launches-strikes-on-taliban-calls-for-halt-to-needless-attacks/article30984282.ece
8,2020/03/04,Malaysia police questions Mahathir’s daughter over protest,"Several peaceful protests, with crowds of no more than a few hundred people, took place in Kuala Lumpur following the weekend decision to appoint Muhyiddin Yassin as the Prime Minister

Malaysian police questioned ex-premier Mahathir Mohamad's daughter and 18 other activists on Wednesday over several small, peaceful protests triggered by the elderly leader losing power and a corruption-tainted party's return.

The reformist “Pact of Hope” alliance, which took power in a historic victory two years ago, collapsed last week and 94-year-old Prime Minister Mahathir resigned. He then sought to return as premier but unexpectedly lost out to Muhyiddin Yassin, who is backed by the scandal-mired United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), which had been ousted in 2018.

Several peaceful protests, with crowds of no more than a few hundred people, took place in Kuala Lumpur following the weekend decision to appoint Mr. Muhyiddin Prime Minister. But under Malaysian law, it is illegal to hold a protest without first getting police permission, and on Wednesday a group of activists who took part were called in for questioning.

Mr. Mahathir’s daughter, Marina, participated in a rally on Sunday. “The new government has only been in two days and all this is happening,” Ms. Marina said.

“This reminds us of more than two years ago, when so many of us had to undergo this,” the 62-year-old, who is a leading women's campaigner activist, told AFP.

Activist Fadiah Nadwa Fikri, who was questioned for taking part in two protests, added: “We experienced this before and now we're seeing the same thing unfolding.”

The long-ruling UMNO-led regime ejected from power in 2018 was frequently accused of using heavy-handed tactics to curb free speech and the right to protest.

Mr. Mahathir's alliance, which included leader-in-waiting Anwar Ibrahim, sought to reform draconian laws, but made only small steps during its two years in office.

His allies have challenged Mr. Muhyiddin's legitimacy, saying he did not win an election and does not have majority support from MPs, which is necessary to become premier.

Mr. Mahathir wants to bring a vote of no-confidence in Mr. Muhyiddin's leadership when parliament sits again. But his plan suffered a blow Wednesday when the legislature's return was delayed from March 9 to May 18.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/avfg18/article30984058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Mahathir,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysia-police-questions-mahathirs-daughter-over-protest/article30984059.ece

But the number of the dead could be higher, according to a tally reported by state news agency IRNA.

Data gathered by the agency from medical universities across Iran as of Wednesday night show at least 126 have died, as it lists the toll in Tehran and Gilan -- two of the worst-hit provinces -- as “unknown”.

Iran has already suspended major cultural and sporting events and reduced working hours across the country, which is one of the worst hit after China.

“Schools and universities will be closed until the end” of the current Iranian year, Health Minister Saeed Namaki said in a televised press conference.

The Iranian year ends on March 19 and national holidays then last until early April.

“People should not consider this as an opportunity to go travelling,” the minister said. “They should stay home and take our warnings seriously.

“This virus is highly contagious. It is a serious matter, do not joke about it.”

The Islamic republic also reported 591 additional confirmed cases of the COVID-19 illness, bringing the total to 3,513 infected.

“Until today, samples have been taken of 23,327 suspected cases, only 3,513 of which have been confirmed,” said ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour.

Nepal Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli successfully underwent his second kidney transplant surgery at a hospital in Kathmandu on Wednesday.

The 68-year-old Prime Minister’s condition was stable and kept under medical supervision at a post-operative ward in the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) in Kathmandu, his Press Advisor Surya Thapa said.

“Oli underwent a renal transplant today. The surgery has been successful,” said Dr. Arun Sayami from TUTH. Mr. Oli’s niece Samikshya Sangraula donated one of her kidneys to the Prime Minister.

The conditions of Mr. Oli and the kidney donor are normal, doctors said. A team of doctors, led by Dr. Prem Raj Gyawali, a consultant urologist and kidney transplant surgeon performed the renal transplant, which took five hours to complete.

Mr. Oli, who is also the chairman of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, was hospitalised on Monday.

He underwent dialysis on Tuesday to remove toxins ahead of the transplant. This was Mr. Oli’s second kidney transplant. The first one was performed in India in 2007, after both his kidneys failed.

He has been visiting hospitals abroad for health check-up ever since. Mr. Oli also underwent an appendicitis surgery in November last year.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/drp15y/article24212789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21-ATUL-OLISVISIT-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nepal-pm-oli-undergoes-second-kidney-transplant/article30981829.ece
13,2020/03/04,Malaysia’s new PM delays Parliament session and no-confidence vote,"Lower house Speaker Mohamad Ariff Mohamad Yusof said in a statement on Wednesday that law-makers will reconvene on May 18 instead of March 9 as originally scheduled.

Malaysia’s new leader has postponed the next session of Parliament by more than two months, effectively delaying plans by Mahathir Mohamad’s former ruling alliance to seek a no-confidence vote against him.

Lower house Speaker Mohamad Ariff Mohamad Yusof said in a statement on Wednesday that law-makers will reconvene on May 18 instead of March 9 as originally scheduled. He said the decision was based on Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s order, but no reason was given for the postponement.

Muhyiddin, 72, was sworn in on Sunday as Malaysia’s eighth Prime Minister after his surprise weekend appointment by the king capped a week of political turmoil.

Muhyiddin led his Bersatu party out of the governing Alliance of Hope, depriving it of a majority and causing its collapse less than two years after its historic victory in 2018 ousted a corruption-tainted coalition that had ruled for 61 years.

Bersatu joined hands with the same coalition that it ousted, along with several smaller parties, to form a Malay-majority government. Mahathir, 94, resigned to protest Bersatu’s plan to work with the former government.

Mahathir tried to make a comeback, but it was too late, as the king appointed Muhyiddin, whom he deemed had the support of a majority of lawmakers.

But Mahathir said he had majority backing to serve as Prime Minister for a third time. He has called for an urgent vote in Parliament to test Muhyiddin’s claim of majority support, warning that any delay could see his supporters being inducted to support the government of the day.

There was no immediate response from Mahathir’s camp on the delayed resumption of Parliament. Many Malaysians are angered by what they see as a betrayal of their vote for a change in 2018 elections, with small protest rallies held over the weekend to “reject the traitors.”

Muhyiddin, a nationalistic politician who once famously quipped he was Malay first and Malaysian second, appealed for support in an address to the nation on Monday. He denied he was a traitor and promised to form a corrupt-free Cabinet despite bringing back to power the United Malays National Organization. Several UMNO leaders, including ex-Prime Minister Najib Razak, are on trial on corruption charges.

Muhyiddin’s government also includes a hard-line Islamic party, sparking fears of greater Islamization and more pro-Malay policies. Ethnic Malays account for 60% of Malaysia’s 32 million people, with large Chinese and Indian minorities.

Muhyiddin and Mahathir were former members of UMNO when they formed Bersatu in 2016 amid anger over a massive corruption scandal involving the 1MDB state investment fund. Muhyiddin, a long-time politician, was appointed Deputy Prime Minister when Najib took power in 2009, but was sacked in 2015 after he criticised Najib’s handling of the 1MDB scandal.

Bersatu teamed up with the Alliance of Hope with a deal that Mahathir would eventually hand over power to his former rival Anwar Ibrahim. Mahathir has said he felt betrayed by Muhyiddin, accusing him of scheming with UMNO for a long time.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7rgga2/article30949795.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUHYIDDINYASSIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/malaysias-new-pm-delays-parliament-session-and-no-confidence-vote/article30981626.ece
14,2020/03/04,French parliament clears path for controversial pension reform,"The law passed shortly after midnight after two no-confidence votes introduced by the opposition failed against Mr. Macron’s centrist majority

France’s lower house of parliament approved a hotly debated overhaul of the country’s byzantine pensions system early Wednesday, clearing a major hurdle for one of President Emmanuel Macron’s signature reforms.

The law passed shortly after midnight after two no-confidence votes introduced by the opposition failed against Mr. Macron’s centrist majority.

The attempt to topple the government came after it employed a rare constitutional measure to cut short a debate that had become bogged down in a morass of opposition amendments, effectively forcing through the bill.

Trade unions and opposition parties slammed the move as anti-democratic but their calls for fresh protests against a bill that triggered the longest French transport strike in decades fell largely on deaf ears.

Critics say the introduction of a single, points-based system will force people to work well beyond the official retirement age of 62, or face lower pensions.

The government argues that abolishing the country’s 42 separate pension regimes, which offer early retirement and other benefits mainly to public-sector workers, will be fairer and end years of deficits.

Prime Minister Edouard Philippe hailed the text as a victory for “social justice”, saying that “those who defend the status quo... too often are just talking nonsense.”

The text now goes to the Senate, where it is also expected to face opposition, before returning to the National Assembly for final approval.

If passed, the reform will be phased in gradually over the coming years for people born since 1975 but will not affect the pensions of those already nearing retirement age.

Mr. Macron’s overhaul is the most extensive in a series of pension reforms enacted by governments on both the left and right in recent years, aiming to end chronic budget shortfalls as people live longer.

A government commission estimated last year that the deficit could reach as much as 17 billion euros ($ 19 billion) by 2025 if no changes are made.

Yet many details of the reform, including how much a point will be worth when people retire, have yet to be determined.

Many people remain sceptical of the new system, with 56% of voters in an Ifop poll published on February 13 saying they opposed a points-based system.

The government has promised to negotiate with unions on how to finance the new system, but it has already warned that if no deal is reached people will have to work beyond 62, one of the lowest retirement ages in the EU.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cbzale/article30981450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRANCE-PROTESTSPENSIONS-DEBATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/french-parliament-clears-path-for-controversial-pension-reform/article30981451.ece
15,2020/03/04,Bye-bye handshakes: how COVID-19 is changing global habits,"All around the world people are changing their daily habits at work, at home and in worship

Say no to a handshake, refuse kisses on the cheeks and definitely avoid hugging. Instead, a direct gaze or maybe a gesture with the hands.

All around the world people are changing their daily habits at work, at home and in worship to reduce the risk of contracting the coronavirus and prevent it from spreading any further.

Here is a look at how habits are changing around the world due to the coronavirus, which has killed nearly 3,000 worldwide.

CHINA

In Beijing, the capital of the country where the outbreak began, red hoardings tell people not to shake hands but to join their own hands together in a sign of greeting.

Loudspeakers tell people to make the traditional gong shou gesture — a fist in the opposite palm — to say hello.

FRANCE

Newspapers have been filled with advice over how to replace handshaking — a daily formality for the French at work and kissing on the cheek, a regular greeting habit in France even between people who have only just met.

Lifestyle expert Philippe Lichtfus, who has been widely cited in the media, insists that handshakes are a relatively recent development in human history that began in the Middle Ages.

He says simply looking into a person's eyes can suffice as a greeting.

BRAZIL

The Brazilian health ministry has recommended that citizens not share the metal straws traditionally used to consume the caffeine-rich South American drink mate, also known as chimarrao.

And a kiss — even if it is not on the mouth — is meanwhile totally advised against.

GERMANY

In a sign of the times, Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer rebuffed Chancellor Angela Merkel's attempt to shake hands with him on Monday, smiling and keeping both his hands to himself.

They both laughed and Merkel threw her hand up in the air before taking a seat.

SPAIN

The outbreak could also hit one of Spain's most cherished traditions — the kissing of sculptures of the Virgin Mary in the week leading up to Easter.

With just a month to go before the week starts, the ritual could be banned. “It is one of the measures that is on the table,” said national health official Fernando Simon.

During the holy week, the faithful queue up to kiss the hands or feet of sculptures of Mary and the saints, seeking their protection.

ROMANIA

Romania's Martisor festival marks the beginning of spring when talismanic strings and flowers are handed out, often from men to women.

But the government has passed on a message to people urging them to hand over the flowers and talismans without the accompanying kiss. “Let's give the flowers but not the kiss,” said Nelu Tataru, state secretary at the health ministry.

POLAND

In Poland, one of Europe's most Catholic countries, the faithful are allowed to take “spiritual communion” instead of consuming the communal bread — or the host can be taken in the hands rather than the mouth.

The faithful are also asked not to dip their hands in the holy water when going in and out of the church and instead make the sign of the cross.

IRAN

Is the footshake the new handshake?

In Iran, a video has gone viral showing three friends meeting, hands in their pockets and two of whom are wearing masks, tapping their feet against each other as a greeting.

A similar video in Lebanon shows singer Ragheb Alama and comedian Michel Abou Sleiman tapping their feet against each other while making kissing noises with their mouths.

UAE

The United Arab Emirates, as well as Qatar, are advising citizens to stop the traditional “nose to nose” greeting. The UAE also said that people shouldn't shake hands anymore or kiss. Greet each other “by waving only”, it said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rmvije/article30980021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI252020000173B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bye-bye-handshakes-how-coronavirus-is-changing-global-habits/article30980022.ece

17,2020/03/04,U.S. Presidential Election 2020 | Biden scores early wins over Sanders on Super Tuesday,"A total of 1,357 delegates were at stake on Tuesday — a third of the nationwide total

Joe Biden notched up startling wins over leftist rival Bernie Sanders in the Democrats' Super Tuesday contest to challenge President Donald Trump, with a torrent of projected victories showing his surprising muscle after what had appeared to be a failing campaign.

But despite early disappointments Sanders was still expected to rack up large numbers of delegates in by far the biggest states of the night, Texas and California, where polls were due to close at 0400 GMT.

With delegates in 14 states up for grabs, Biden was projected to win in Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Arkansas and even Minnesota — a state where Sanders had been expected to win handily.

Also read: U.S. Presidential Election 2020: What are the Democratic presidential primaries all about?

The 78-year-old Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist with a fervent voter base, who aims to reshape America's economy, was projected to win as expected in his home state of Vermont, Colorado and Utah.

In a defiant speech, Sanders tore into Trump, calling him ""the most dangerous president in the history of this country."" But he also tore into Biden for having voted in favor of the invasion of Iraq and painting him as tarnished by billionaire contributors. ""We're taking on the political establishment,"" he said. ""You cannot beat Trump with the same-old, same-old kind of politics.""

But for Biden, 77, the indications were that he was on for a big night in his bid to bring American politics back to the center after four years of Trump's rightwing populism.

""We are very much alive,"" he told a crowd in Los Angeles. ""Make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.""

A key takeaway from Biden's lengthening list of wins was the strong support for the former vice president of Barack Obama from African Americans — a vital piece in any Democratic presidential candidate's coalition.

Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, 78, and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren were the other big names on the ballot.

But despite spending record amounts of his own money on advertising, billionaire media entrepreneur Bloomberg appeared to be headed for an ugly night — despite a consolation win in tiny American Samoa in the Pacific.

Stop the Sanders campaign

The 14 nominating contests across the country gave the dwindling field of Democratic hopefuls a giant potential haul of delegates in their marathon struggle to win the nomination — and begin campaigning in earnest against Trump.

Many in the Democratic Party are desperate to stop Sanders' strong push to win that delegate race, saying the senator will be destroyed in a general election where Trump has signaled he will brand him a socialist bent on ending the American way of life.

Biden was practically counted out after a stumbling early campaign, but began to rebound with a landslide win in South Carolina last Saturday.

That was followed by the coordinated decisions of two other moderate candidates — Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar — to withdraw and endorse their former rival.

Bloomberg faces multiple calls from within the Democratic Party also to get out of the race and not split the centrist vote. In a statement, Bloomberg's campaign insisted he was still competing. But it added: ""Our number one priority remains defeating Donald Trump in November."" Commenting on Bloomberg's feeble Virginia results, veteran political analyst Larry Sabato asked: ""A hint to say bye-bye?""

Sanders fans convinced

Biden is making his third bid for the White House after failed runs in 1988 and 2008. He argues that he can bring a return to ""decency"" after the tumultuous, scandal-plagued Trump era.

Sanders' fans are convinced that only he can take on Trump, who also defied his party's establishment and more moderate wing four years ago to claim a surprise victory against Democratic heavyweight Hillary Clinton.

""We need energy. We need excitement. I think our campaign is that campaign,"" said Sanders.

Supporter Jamison Hanning, a 45-year-old plastics industry technician, said he was ""pretty confident"" despite the Biden pushback. ""I mean it is just people in the establishment being afraid of things being shaken up,"" he said.

Sanders went into Super Tuesday hoping to gain a near insurmountable delegate lead, perhaps delivering a knock-out blow well ahead of the party convention in Milwaukee in July.

A total of 1,357 delegates were at stake on Tuesday — a third of the nationwide total. A candidate needs 1,991 delegates to win the nomination outright. Democrats will also be looking for turnout and other signs of enthusiasm in a country deeply divided by Trump. Certainly huge turnout in Virginia indicated excitement ahead of November, with nearly double the voters as in the Democratic primary there four years ago.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5bhxgy/article30978960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020JOEBIDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-election-2020-biden-scores-early-wins-over-sanders-on-super-tuesday/article30978964.ece
18,2020/03/04,"COVID-19: China reports fall in cases, South Korea death toll hits 32","South Korea has seen a rapid rise in infections in recent days

China on March 4 reported 38 more deaths from the new coronavirus but a fall in fresh cases for a third consecutive day. The death toll nationwide is now 2,981, the National Health Commission said, with more than 80,200 people infected in total.

There were 115 new cases in central Hubei province — the epicentre where the virus first emerged in December last year — and only four elsewhere in the country.

South Korea has seen a rapid rise in infections in recent days as authorities carry out checks on more than 260,000 people associated with the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, a religious sect often condemned as a cult that is now linked to more than half the cases. More than 4,000 cases have now been confirmed in southern city of Daegu — where the outbreak among Shincheonji members began with a 61-year-old woman, who developed symptoms on February 10 but attended at least four worship services in the city.

Some 2,300 Daegu patients —some of them with severe symptoms, others with either mild ones or none at all — are waiting to be admitted to medical facilities, vice health minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters.

Scores of events in the country — from K-pop concerts to sports seasons — have been cancelled or postponed over the contagion, with school and kindergarten breaks extended by three weeks nationwide.

All daycare centres are also closed until Sunday, and the government is contemplating whether to keep them closed for longer, Kim said.

The central bank has warned of a contraction in the first quarter for the world's 12th-largest economy, noting the epidemic will hit both consumption and exports.

A man in the Spanish region of Valencia has died from coronavirus, marking the country’s first death from the outbreak, a local health official said on Tuesday.

Tests carried out post-mortem showed the man, who died on February 13, was killed by the virus, regional health chief Ana Barcelo told reporters.

News of the death came shortly after Spain’s Health Ministry announced on its Twitter page that several sporting events would be held behind closed doors, while medical conferences will be cancelled in an effort to limit the spread of the virus.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday warned of a global shortage and price gouging for protective equipment to fight the fast-spreading coronavirus and asked companies and governments to increase production by 40% as the death toll from the respiratory illness mounted.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates on Tuesday in an emergency move to try to prevent a global recession and the World Bank announced $12 billion to help countries fight the coronavirus, which has taken a heavy toll on air travel, tourism and other industries, threatening global economic growth prospects.

Also read: The SARS-CoV-2 is mutating, say scientists

The virus continued to spread in South Korea, Japan, Europe, Iran and the United States, and several countries reported their first confirmed cases, taking the total to some 80 nations hit with the flu-like illness that can lead to pneumonia.

Despite the Fed’s attempt to stem the economic fallout from the coronavirus, U.S. stock indexes closed down about 3%, safe-haven gold rose 3% and analysts and investors questioned whether the rate cut will be enough if the virus continues to spread.

U.S. lawmakers were considering spending as much as $9 billion to contain local spread of the virus.

In Iran, doctors and nurses lack supplies and 77 people have died, one of the highest numbers outside China. The United Arab Emirates announced it was closing all schools for four weeks.

The death toll in Italy, Europe’s hardest-hit country, jumped to 79 on Tuesday and Italian officials are considering expanding the area under quarantine. France reported its fourth coronavirus death, while Indonesia, Ukraine, Argentina and Chile reported their first coronavirus cases.

About 3.4% of confirmed cases of COVID-19 have died, far above seasonal flu’s fatality rate of under 1%, but the virus can be contained, the WHO chief said on Tuesday.

“To summarise, COVID-19 spreads less efficiently than flu, transmission does not appear to be driven by people who are not sick, it causes more severe illness than flu, there are not yet any vaccines or therapeutics, and it can be contained,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva.

Health officials have said the death rate is 2% to 4% depending on the country and may be much lower if there are thousands of unreported mild cases of the disease.

Since the coronavirus outbreak, prices of surgical masks have increased sixfold, N95 respirators have tripled in cost and protective gowns cost twice as much, the WHO said.

It estimates healthcare workers each month will need 89 million masks, 76 million gloves and 1.6 million pairs of goggles.

The coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has spread around the world, with more new cases now appearing outside China than inside.

There are almost 91,000 cases globally of which more than 80,000 are in China. China’s death toll was 2,946, with more than 166 fatalities elsewhere.

In a unanimous decision, the Fed said it was cutting rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%.

Finance ministers from the G7 group of rich countries were ready to take action, including fiscal measures where appropriate, Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said. Central banks would continue to support price stability and economic growth.

Aggressive containment

In the United States, there are now over 100 people in at least a dozen states with the coronavirus and nine deaths, all in the Seattle area.

Amid criticism of Americans not being able to get tested for coronavirus unless they met certain limited criteria, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Tuesday that anyone can now get tested with a doctor’s order under new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

New York state reported its second case, a man in his 50s who works in Manhattan and has been hospitalized.

The public transportation agency in New York, the most densely populated major U.S. city of more than 8 million, said on Twitter it was deploying “enhanced sanitizing procedures” for stations, train cars, buses and certain vehicles.

China has seen coronavirus cases fall sharply, with 129 in the last 24 hours the lowest reported since Jan. 20.

With the world’s second largest economy struggling to get back on track, China is increasingly concerned about the virus being brought back into the country by citizens returning from new hotspots elsewhere.

Travellers entering Beijing from South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy would have to be quarantined for 14 days, a city official said. Shanghai has introduced a similar order.

The worst outbreak outside China is in South Korea, where President Moon Jae-in declared war on the virus, ordering additional hospital beds and more masks as cases rose by 600 to nearly 5,000, with 34 deaths.

WHO officials also expressed concerns about the situation in Iran, saying doctors lacked respirators and ventilators needed for patients with severe cases.

WHO emergency programme head Michael Ryan said the need in Iran was “more acute” than for other countries.

While the case numbers in Iran appear to be bad, he said, ”things tend to look worse before getting better.”

The International Olympic Committee on Tuesday said the summer games in Tokyo set to begin on July 24 were still expected to happen despite Japan having nearly 1,000 coronavirus cases and 12 deaths.

22,2020/03/04,"Trump says he spoke to a Taliban leader, had ‘good talk’","The event makes him the first U.S. President believed to ever speak directly with the militant group that harbored al-Qaida before the 9/11 attacks and is responsible for the deaths of thousands of U.S. troops

President Donald Trump confirmed on Tuesday that he spoke on the phone to a Taliban leader, making him the first U.S. President believed to ever speak directly with the militant group that harbored al-Qaida before the 9/11 attacks and is responsible for the deaths of thousands of U.S. troops in nearly 19 years of fighting in Afghanistan.

“We had a very good conversation with the leader of the Taliban today, and they’re looking to get this ended, and we’re looking to get it ended. I think we all have a very common interest,” Trump said. “We had, actually, a very good talk with the leader of the Taliban.”

Tuesday’s call, which the Taliban said lasted 35 minutes, came days after the United States and the Taliban signed an agreement calling for the withdrawal of American troops — allowing Trump to make progress on a key campaign pledge to extract the U.S. from what he calls “endless wars” and paving the way for all-Afghan talks to begin on Tuesday.

Trump suggested the phone call was not his first. Asked if Tuesday was his first conversation with a leader of the Taliban, Trump said, “I don’t want to say that.”

Earlier, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid tweeted that the president had spoken on the phone with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a co-founder of the Taliban and head of their political office in Qatar.

“The relationship is very good that I have with the mullah,” Trump said. “We had a good long conversation today and, you know, they want to cease the violence. They’d like to cease violence also.”

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo witnessed the agreement, which was signed last Saturday in Doha, Qatar, by chief negotiators from the two sides. According to the deal, all 13,000 U.S. troops will leave Afghanistan within 14 months if the Taliban meet their obligations to America. Those promises are tied to fighting terrorism, preventing Afghanistan from becoming a haven for terrorists, denouncing terrorist groups, severing past links with the likes of al-Qaida and helping fight the Islamic State group affiliate.

It also envisioned talks between Afghans on both sides of the conflict starting March 10, most likely in Oslo, Norway. But so far there’s no confirmation that important next step will take place. The U.S. withdrawal is not tied to Afghanistan’s warring sides figuring out how to talk to each other, let alone coming to an agreement on what peace among them will look like.

Already there are hurdles. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has refused to release up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners, which the agreement said would happen before the start of the so-called intra-Afghan negotiations next week. The Ghani administration claims those releases will be part of negotiations. The Taliban are to release up to 1,000 Afghan government and military captives.

Trump said it’s still unclear what the Afghans will do when and if they sit with the Taliban and attempt to draft a peaceful political future for the nation. “The country really has to get it ended. We’ve been there for 20 years. Other presidents have tried and they were unsuccessful,” he said.

In addition to the tweet, the Afghan Taliban also released a statement, saying the phone call took place shortly after 9-30 a.m. EST. SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors communications from militant organizations, said the Taliban statement claimed the call was held in the presence of a number of members of the Taliban negotiating committee and Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. envoy who negotiated the deal.

According to the statement, the phone conversation was about how both sides will implement the agreement. Baradar assured Trump that if the United States honored the agreement, then the U.S. and the Taliban will have “positive bilateral relations,” the statement said.

The statement said the Taliban leader told Trump- “Mr. President! Take determined actions in regards to the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan and do not allow anyone to take actions that violate the terms of the agreement thus embroiling you even further in this prolonged war.”

The White House provided no additional details about what was said on the call.

In the past, people have wrongly believed that President Ronald Reagan had a meeting with the Taliban. In 1983, Reagan hosted five “Afghan freedom fighters” in the Oval Office. At the time, the U.S. was backing these Afghan fighters battling the Soviet Union. The Taliban was not formed until the 1990s.

In the 1980s, the U.S. was among those who encouraged hundreds of Arab fighters to travel to Afghanistan to fight alongside the Afghan mujahedeen, or holy warriors, against the Soviet Union’s forces there. Today, many of those fighters make up the Taliban leadership, while others are in power in the U.S.-backed Afghan government.

As the war came to a close in 1988, many of the Arab fighters united to follow the wealthy Saudi leader Osama bin Laden to create al-Qaida, which orchestrated the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2w3074/article30978343.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-says-he-spoke-to-a-taliban-leader-had-good-talk/article30978345.ece
23,2020/03/04,"Resurgent Biden projected to win Virginia, Sanders takes Vermont on Super Tuesday","Edison Research and television networks quickly projected the split results in the first two states to close their polls on Super Tuesday

Joe Biden was projected to take Virginia and front-runner Bernie Sanders was declared the winner in his home state of Vermont as polls closed in those two states on Tuesday, the biggest day of voting in the Democratic presidential nominating race.

Edison Research and television networks quickly projected the split results in the first two states to close their polls on Super Tuesday, when Americans in 14 states voted for a Democratic challenger to Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election.

A resurgent Biden, former President Barack Obama's vice president, has enjoyed a burst of momentum since his blowout win in South Carolina on Saturday, with a flood of prominent party officials and former rivals endorsing his candidacy.

Biden is hoping to muscle aside upstart Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, and consolidate support from moderates in Tuesday's voting, turning the race into a one-on-one contest against Sanders.

Opinion polls have shown Biden gaining on Sanders, a democratic socialist and independent U.S. senator from Vermont who hopes to take a huge step toward winning the nomination on Tuesday. More than one-third of the delegates who will pick the eventual nominee in July are up for grabs on Super Tuesday.

Early exit polls by Edison Research showed relatively few voters in biggest voting state California and second-biggest Texas, about two in 10, made up their minds in the last few days, which could minimize Biden's recent momentum.

But in Virginia and Massachusetts, about half of voters decided recently while one third of voters in North Carolina decided in the last few days, the polls showed.

A majority of voters in the Super Tuesday states said they were mostly looking for a candidate who can beat Trump, instead of someone who shares their values, the exit polls said.

Biden is trying to build a bridge between progressive Democrats' desire for big structural change and more moderate Democrats yearning for a candidate who will be able to win over enough independents and Republicans to oust Trump.

FRESH MOMENTUM

That effort gained fresh momentum on the eve of Tuesday's voting as moderate presidential rivals Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, endorsed Biden after withdrawing from the race.

Bloomberg remains a wild card as he joins the competition for the first time. The moderate skipped the first four contests and spent more than $500 million of his own money to bombard Super Tuesday and later voting states with ads, but has seen his poll numbers slip after a poor first debate.

Asked by a reporter in Miami if he thought he risked spoiling Bidens chances of winning the nomination, Bloomberg responded: You think Im going to siphon (votes) from him? Hes siphoning them from me.”

Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was briefly the front-runner in the race last year, also remains in the hunt and hopes to score a victory in her home state of Massachusetts. Opinion polls show her trailing in other states.

The pace of the Democratic race begins to accelerate after Super Tuesday, with 11 more states voting by the end of March. By then, nearly two-thirds of the delegates will have been allotted.

Sanders headed into Tuesday with 60 delegates to Biden's 54 in the state-by-state nominating fight. Sanders managed a virtual tie with Buttigieg in Iowa and wins in New Hampshire and Nevada.

Besides leading in polls in California, Sanders also is ahead of Biden by a smaller margin in polls in Texas. Sanders' strength with Hispanics should pay dividends in that state, where Latinos comprise one-third of the Democratic electorate.

Biden, whose South Carolina win affirmed his popularity with black voters, hopes to win five states where African Americans make up at least a quarter of the Democratic electorate: Alabama, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Arkansas.

Other states voting on Tuesday are Colorado, Maine, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Utah. The U.S. territory of American Samoa was holding a caucus contest, and Democrats living abroad began voting in a primary set to run until March 10.

The first polls will close in Vermont and Virginia at 7 p.m. EST (midnight GMT). The last will close in California at 8 p.m. PST (0400 GMT on Wednesday).

The next contests, on March 10, will be in Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington state.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g9fs70/article30978258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-POLITICS-VOTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/resurgent-biden-projected-to-win-virginia-sanders-takes-vermont-on-super-tuesday/article30978259.ece
24,2020/03/04,"Super Tuesday voting so far free of meddling, U.S. officials say","Fourteen states are holding presidential primary elections on Tuesday, with a total of one-third of the delegates for the Democratic nomination at stake

The Super Tuesday primary elections were so far free of any signs of interference, said national security professionals who gathered in Northern Virginia in an unprecedented monitoring effort to counter cyberattacks and foreign disinformation.

“On the specifics of today, we have not seen any acute increase in any misinformation,” said Christopher Krebs, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency of the Department of Homeland Security.

Fourteen states are holding presidential primary elections on Tuesday, with a total of one-third of the delegates for the Democratic nomination at stake.

Since U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, the U.S. government has introduced measures to combat hacking and foreign propaganda activities designed to affect the vote.

Moscow has denied the allegations.

“I asked the question of what type of activity are we seeing and why aren't we seeing more, and it's because of the hardened systems,” said Homeland Security acting Secretary Chad Wolf. ”It's important to pause and take credit for some of the work we've done.”

Election security experts say that while the government has made improvements, many vulnerabilities still exist.

Representatives from the Homeland Security Department, FBI, National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command were positioned at the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to rapidly respond to any attacks on Tuesday's presidential primaries.

State and local election officials spread across the country were connected to the nerve center in case of suspicious cyber incidents.

In a joint statement on Monday, the heads of each participating agency warned of sharp consequences for foreign actors that attempt to meddle in the 2020 election.

The level of coordination and communication between the federal government and state, local and private sector partners is stronger than it's ever been, the statement read.

Ben Spear, head of the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center (EI-ISAC), a contractor for CISA, said that all 50 states had installed monitoring software on their systems since 2016 to detect cyberattacks.

“We're seeing significant engagement from state and local (officials), said Spear, noting the differences between the 2020 and 2016 primaries.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6auzin/article30978171.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-ELECTIONCYBER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/super-tuesday-voting-so-far-free-of-meddling-us-officials-say/article30978172.ece

26,2020/03/04,U.N. nuclear watchdog admonishes Iran for denying access to two sites,"The International Atomic Energy Agency planned to issue a second report in addition to its regular quarterly update on Iran’s nuclear activities

The U.N. watchdog policing Iran’s troubled nuclear deal with major powers admonished Tehran on Tuesday for failing to answer its questions about past nuclear activities at three sites and for denying it access to two of them.

The IAEA planned to issue a second report in addition to its regular quarterly update on Iran’s nuclear activities, rebuking Iran for less than full cooperation in general and for failing to grant U.N. inspectors access to one or more sites of interest.

The regular report showed Iran’s stockpile of low-enriched uranium nearly tripling since November to more than a tonne, as Tehran continues to breach key limits of its steadily eroding nuclear deal in response to renewed U.S. sanctions against it since Washington pulled out of the accord in May 2018.

The extraordinary second report delved into the International Atomic Energy Agency’s open questions and Iran’s denial of access to sites which two senior diplomats said are believed to have been active in the early 2000s.

“I judged it necessary to produce a second report because I thought the situation is serious enough to merit such a move on my part,” new IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, who took office in December, told Reuters in an interview in Paris.

The second confidential IAEA report to member states seen by Reuters said Iran has not provided access to the agency to two locations ... and not engaged in substantive discussions to clarify agency questions related to possible undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities.

“We have insisted and despite all our efforts we have not been able to get that, so the situation requires on my part such a step because what this means is that Iran is curtailing the ability of the agency to do its work,” he said, adding that he hoped Tehran would reverse course after the IAEA’s board meets next week in Vienna.

What exactly is thought to have happened at the three sites, none of which the IAEA has visited before, is unclear.

They are also different to the site in Tehran to which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu drew attention in 2018, calling it a “secret atomic warehouse”, where the IAEA later found traces of uranium.

Discussions with Iran aimed at explaining those traces of uranium that was processed - but not enriched - are ongoing, despite the agency previously encouraging Iran to do more.

Sanitizing

The second report said the IAEA’s open questions include whether natural uranium was used at one of the three sites, one that the IAEA has yet to say it wants to visit.

At one of the other two the agency has seen activities “from early July 2019 onwards that were consistent with efforts to sanitize part of the location”, it said.

The term “sanitize” is often used to denote construction or demolition work intended to remove traces of nuclear material.

Diplomats who tipped off Reuters about the second report said the agency was looking at sites which - like the Tehran one where uranium particles were found - were mentioned in a trove of data on Iran’s past nuclear activities that Israel calls the ”atomic archive”, which it says its agents seized in Iran.

A diplomatic source said one of the sites was Marivan. The source also said that the IAEA was trying to corroborate a possible past military project.

Since long before the deal the IAEA has had information suggesting that “large-scale high-explosive experiments”, involving high-precision detonation systems suitable for the core of a nuclear bomb, were conducted in the region of Marivan, at least one of which was in 2003. The archive appears to contain information supporting or expanding on that.

U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe the Islamic Republic had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003, long before the 2015 deal.

That is also roughly the time at which an exiled Iranian opposition group exposed the existence of Iran’s underground uranium enrichment complex at Natanz. The revelation raised international alarm about Tehran’s covert nuclear activities, which it later declared to the IAEA.

Tuesday’s second report also said Iran had informed the IAEA that it “will not recognize any allegation on past activities and does not consider itself obliged to respond to such allegations”.

While the 2015 deal drew a line under Iran’s past atomic activities, the IAEA’s non-proliferation mandate must also account for all nuclear material and activities. If previously unknown items come to light, it investigates.

“I am simply asking that they comply with their obligations,” Grossi said.

The deal, which lifted international sanctions against Tehran in exchange for limits on its uranium enrichment and other nuclear activities, is aimed at keeping Tehran at least a year away from accumulating enough fissile material for an atomic bomb if it sought one.

Iran denies ever having had a nuclear arms programme and says it would never seek to build an atomic bomb.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/z4bxip/article30977927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAN-NUCLEARIAEA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-nuclear-watchdog-admonishes-iran-for-denying-access-to-two-sites/article30977928.ece

28,2020/03/04,CISCO Denies Building Firewall to Restrict Internet in J&K,"Cisco strongly supports free expression and open communication on the Internet, says spokesperson

American technology company, Cisco Systems, has denied Indian media reports that it is helping the government build a firewall to restrict fixed line internet access to restricted websites including social media sites from Jammu and Kashmir once broadband connectivity is restored in the Union Territory.

“Cisco denies reports from India regarding Cisco involvement in restricting access to social media websites. Cisco strongly supports free expression and open communication on the Internet, and our policies and practices are well-established in this area,” a Cisco spokesperson told The Hindu, which had reached out to the company following the reports.

29,2020/03/04,"Trump campaign sues Washington Post over opinion pieces, after suing NY Times","Trump's campaign is seeking millions of dollars in damages in both lawsuits

U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election campaign sued the Washington Post for libel on Tuesday over two opinion pieces that it said suggested improper ties between the campaign and Russia, North Korea or both.

The campaign filed its lawsuit six days after filing a separate libel lawsuit against the New York Times, over an opinion piece it said falsely suggested a quid pro quo between Russian officials and Trump's 2016 campaign.

Both lawsuits escalate the Republican president's long-running battle with news media he believes demonstrate bias against him, a list also including CNN and MSNBC and which he frequently brands “fake news.”

Trump's campaign is seeking millions of dollars in damages in both lawsuits.

The Post did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Its owner is Amazon.com Inc's billionaire founder Jeff Bezos.

Tuesday's complaint focused on alleged false and defamatory statements contained in opinions published last June 13 by Greg Sargent and June 20 by Paul Waldman, who both write for the Post's Plum Line blog.

The campaign objected to what it called Sargent's statement that former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, in his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, concluded that Trump's campaign “tried to conspire with” a “sweeping and systemic” attack by Russia against that election.

It said Mueller's report, released last April 18, actually concluded there was “no conspiracy” between the campaign and the Russian government, and that no U.S. person intentionally coordinated with Russian efforts to interfere with the election.

The campaign also objected to Waldman's statement “who knows what sort of aid Russia and North Korea will give to the Trump campaign, now that he has invited them to offer their assistance.”

It said no one associated with the campaign or the White House ever invited those countries to help the campaign in 2019 or 2020, and no one has reported any contact between the campaign and North Korea concerning any U.S. election.

The campaign said the Post was “well aware” the challenged statements were untrue when published, and said the pieces were part of its “systematic pattern of bias” against the campaign, and designed to ultimately cause its failure.

Sargent's piece was titled “Trump just invited another Russian attack. Mitch McConnell is making one more likely,” referring to the Republican Senate majority leader.

Waldman's piece was titled “Trump: I can win reelection with just my base.”

Trump is seeking re-election on Nov. 3. He sometimes attacks news media at campaign rallies, where his comments often generate applause and his supporters sometimes jeer journalists.

30,2020/03/04,"Tornadoes wreak havoc on Tennessee, leaving at least 22 dead","The death toll may rise given the number of people who remain missing statewide, said Governor William Lee, during a morning news briefing

A cluster of powerful tornadoes ravaged Nashville and other parts of Tennessee on Tuesday, killing at least 22 people, reducing homes and businesses to splinters and leaving tens of thousands of people without electricity.

The death toll may rise given the number of people who remain missing statewide, said Governor William Lee, during a morning news briefing.

Lee toured neighborhoods of the city known as the capital of country music, as rescue teams went door to door, searching damaged structures for trapped or injured residents. Later in a Twitter post, he described the damage as “surreal.”

Kathy Martin, 50, who lives in North Nashville, was roused from sleep early in the morning when a large tree ripped into her home's roof and crashed into her bedroom.

“My screens were flying off and there was a big rumble. Then I heard a big pop and it was over,” she said as she dropped belongings and medication off at the Centennial Sportsplex, a sports center serving as a shelter for the displaced. “It scared the life out of me.”

The National Weather Service said there were eight reported tornadoes that touched down in Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky but it was uncertain how many plowed through Nashville.

At least 30 people were injured and about 48 buildings were destroyed in Nashville, with many more damaged, Fire Department Director Chief William Swann said.

Tennessee was one 14 states holding primary elections on Super Tuesday. Despite the widespread destruction, polling sites at schools and elsewhere were mostly open for voting, officials said.

“We want people to exercise their rights and get out there and vote,” Lee said.

As the storm strafed central Nashville, the state capital, lightning illuminated the darkened sky, video posted on Twitter showed. Daybreak revealed dozens of leveled houses and businesses in the city of 691,000, which has become one of the fastest growing in the United States.

Greg Poulson, 61, a homeless man who lives in an encampment with about 85 other people, said wind gusts lifted him slightly off the ground as he ran underneath a bridge.

“I had a tree fall on my tent,” Poulson said. “The storm dropped right on top of us. We were ground zero.”

Crushed vehicles, piles of debris and broken power lines littered streets blocked by rescue vehicles. Residents carried away belongings from ravaged homes.

Charlotte Cooper, a French teacher at a Nashville Classical Charter School, said she felt lucky a twister had skipped over her house, which suffered cracked windows and a downed fence.

“It's like a war zone,” she said as she surveyed the damage around her neighborhood.

Super tuesday

Apart from the public buildings set to be used for polling, schools, district offices and courts were closed due to tornado damage.

The governor said he spoke to the White House about federal assistance and he planned to assess the damage in a helicopter. President Donald Trump said that he will go to Tennessee on Friday.

The twister knocked down power lines, and one utility pole dangled horizontally in the street in the Donelson area, home to country music's most famous concert stage, the Grand Ole Opry, news pictures showed.

Nashville Electric, the city's public utility, said http://bit.ly/38dQBMo there were more than 47,000 customers without power, with reported damage to four substations, 15 primary distribution lines, and multiple power poles and lines.

John C. Tune Airport, about 8 miles from downtown Nashville, ”sustained significant damage” and several hangars were destroyed, the airport said on its website.

31,2020/03/04,‘China made great sacrifices to curb spread of COVID-19’,"For China, the first fight is against COVID-19, the other is economic revival, said Consul General of China in Mumbai, Tang Guocai

The spread of COVID-19 could have been worse had it not been for scientific quarantine in China and sacrifices made by Chinese people, said Consul General of China in Mumbai, Tang Guocai, here on Tuesday. He said the impact was contained relatively and the Chinese economy was stable.

“For China, the first fight is against COVID-19, the other is economic revival. The country has made great sacrifices to contain the virus,” said Mr. Tang, referring to the complete lockdown of Wuhan city, the epicentre of the outbreak. Mr. Tang, who was speaking at a discussion organised by the Observer Research Foundation in collaboration with the Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China, said India and China were both “super populations” and thus they also had “super responsibility”.

Sumit Mallick, Chief Information Commissioner of Maharashtra, said one should worry but keep things in perspective to avoid panic. “China locked down an entire city and set a new benchmark in quarantine. While Wuhan is smaller in comparison, can you imagine Mumbai being locked down even for a day?” he asked, adding, “Imagine the kind of stress levels of people living in Wuhan,” he said, adding that China had also responded speedily by cracking the genetic code of the virus and passing it on to the world which helped in testing suspected cases. “By the end of December, they knew that a new type of virus was being seen. By January 7, they had cracked the genetic code and passed it on. That was extremely fast and the Chinese deserve praise,” he said.

According to Mr. Mallick, the outbreak of COVID-19 called for focussing on public health systems in countries and having a global outlook.

The medical community emphasised on hand washing and hygiene. State’s epidemiologist Pradip Awate said that even today, COVID-19 was a riddle for the scientific community. “We are screening people at the level of entry to the country at airports. Some cases may show symptoms after the incubation period and therefore we are in touch with travellers on telephone,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/z2c9jk/article30976650.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BMCONSULGENERAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-made-great-sacrifices-to-curb-spread-of-covid-19/article30976651.ece

33,2020/03/04,‘2020 will be the year of mobile sneak attacks’,"According to McAfee Threat Report 2020, hidden mobile apps resulted in approximately 50% of all malicious threats in 2019

Last year, hackers targeted consumers with a wide variety of methods, from backdoors to mining cryptocurrencies. In this year’s Threat Report ‘Mobile Malware is Playing Hide and Steal’, McAfee has revealed that hackers have expanded the ways of hiding their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and remove, which makes it seem like 2020 will be the year of mobile sneak attacks.

“Mobile devices hold the key to our lives – both corporate and personal,” says Venkat Krishnapur, Vice-President of Engineering and Managing Director, McAfee India. “Unfortunately, they are also amongst the easiest attack vectors for cybercriminals because, consumer awareness levels towards security of their devices and apps is low. Hidden apps have emerged as the most active mobile threat category and it’s highly advisable that consumers stay vigilant with regards to where they download applications from, what they click and also ensure they use the right security software on their devices, to enable detection and protection of their digital lives.”

“There exists a growing trend for many apps to remain hidden, stealing precious resources and important data from the device that acts as the remote control to consumers digital world,” adds Raj Samani, McAfee Fellow and Chief Scientist.

Threat for gamers

It is recommended that gamers be vigilant of activities in gamer chats apps and cheat videos. Hackers are taking advantage of the popularity of gaming by distributing their malicious apps via links in the aforementioned avenues by creating their own content containing links to fake apps, ultimately spoofing consumers.

These apps masquerade as genuine with icons that closely mimic those of the real apps but serve unwanted ads and collect user data. McAfee researchers uncovered that popular apps like FaceApp, Spotify, and Call of Duty all have fake versions trying to prey on unsuspecting consumers, especially younger users.

This mobile malware — which takes advantage of the accessibility features in Android to create accounts, download apps, and post reviews using names and emails configured on the victim’s device — is distributed through social media, gaming platforms, malvertising, and gamer chat apps, and fake warnings are used to get the user to activate accessibility services, enabling the full range of the malware’s capabilities.

Given Android is installed on over 2.5 billion devices across the globe, this is great cause for concern.

Commuting epicentre

There has also been a unique approach to steal sensitive data through legitimate transit apps. For example, a series of South Korean transit apps, were compromised with a fake library and plugin that could exfiltrate confidential files, called MalBus. The attack was hidden in a legit South Korean transit app by hacking the original developer’s Google Play account, proving attacks are happening on a creator level, too.

The series provides a range of information for each region of South Korea, such as bus stop locations, route maps, and schedule times for more than 5 years. MalBus represents a different attack method as hackers went after the account of a legitimate developer of a popular app with a solid reputation.

What should we do?

According to a March 3 blog post on the McAfee website titled ‘Is Mobile Malware Playing Hide and Steal on Your Device?’ by Alan LeFort, Vice President of Consumer Strategy & Cloud segment, McAfee, “consumers have developed expectations of how devices can enhance our everyday lives — from online banking transactions to handling work correspondence on the go.”

LeFort offers some tips on how to optimally protect your systems:

- Do your research. While some malicious apps do make it through the app store screening process, the majority of attack downloads appear to be coming from social media, fake ads, and other unofficial app sources. Before downloading an app to your device, do some quick research about the source and developer.

- Read app reviews with a critical eye. Reviews and rankings are still a good method of determining whether an app is legitimate. However, watch out for reviews that reuse simple or repetitive phrases, as this could be a sign of a fraudulent review.

- Update, update, update. Developers are actively working to identify and address security issues. Frequently update your operating systems and apps so that they have the latest fixes and security protections.

- Use a VPN. A virtual private network, or , allows you to send and receive data across a public network, but it encrypts your information so others cannot read it. This can prevent hackers from spying on your internet activity, therefore protecting your privacy.

- Keep tabs on your accounts. Use ID monitoring tools to be aware of changes or actions that you did not make. These may have been caused by malware and could indicate that your phone or account has been compromised.

- Defend your devices with security software. Comprehensive security software across all devices continues to be a strong defensive measure to protect your data and privacy from online threats.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/83vw78/article30980296.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/cyber-44444481920,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/2020-will-be-the-year-of-mobile-sneak-attacks/article30980237.ece
34,2020/03/04,Vietnamese song ‘Jealous Coronavirus’ created to spread awareness on COVID-19 goes viral,"The animated music video was conceptualised by the Vietnamese Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health, in collaboration with musicians Khac Hung, Min, and Erik

With the coronavirus (COVID-19) scare rampaging across the world, health departments in various countries are taking measures to ensure that infection can be curbed.

But now, the Vietnamese Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health has come up with an unique way to ask citizens to be safe — and it has gone viral since — with Ghen Cô Vy, the ‘Washing Hand’ song.

Translated to an English version called Jealous Coronavirus, the animated video portrays the virus as someone who’s trying to come between a couple. At the beginning of the video, the couple are fighting and at the end — by when several suggestions and tips have been given to viewers to beat the virus — they reunite together.

The three-minute video also explains how the infection first broke out in its epicentre, Wuhan, and how exactly it’s spreading to different countries across the world.

“Where is it from? Its hometown is Wuhan. All was calm, then came a sudden breakout,” read the subtitles to the video, which is being shared extensively on social media not just for its simple and concise messaging, but also its catchy tune.

“Let’s wash our hands. Rub rub rub rub them. Don’t put your hands on eyes, nose and mouth and limit going to crowded places. Fight back against corona!” goes the video.

Jealous Coronavirus has been conceptualised by the Vietnamese Institute of Occupational and Environmental Health in collaboration with musicians Khac Hung, Min, and Erik. Reads the description, “Through this project, we aim to empower and strengthen trust in the community, so that we can join hands to combat COVID-19 (aka nCoV-2019). In this critical moment of fighting the virus, we hope the song will ignite our spirits and reduce stress for the frontline fighters of this war: the team of experts, physicians, health workers and millions of other workers who are in the frontline of exposure and daily struggle with this disease.""

They added, “Let our community take the initiative in implementing preventive habits as recommended by health experts, and let us spread goodness and kindness to win the disease together.”",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hda43y/article30981269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coronaaa,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/vietnamese-song-jealous-coronavirus-created-to-spead-awareness-on-covid-19-goes-viral/article30981270.ece
35,2020/03/04,"After memes, CBSE now releases ‘exam anthem’ for students","Hoping to motivate students, CBSE has released a board exam anthem based on Emiway’s ‘Machayenge’

Look who is vamping up its Gen-Z connect. As board exams for Class X and XII students across India are underway, CBSE’s new ‘exam anthem’ is doing the rounds in student-teacher WhatsApp groups.

Though admittedly, it’s mostly enthusiastic teachers forwarding the song to wary students.

The song, on YouTube, samples rapper Emiway’s ‘Machayenge’ and changes its lyrics to (hold your breath) ‘Padhenge’ (We will study).

In the video, as purple bars ebb and rise during the chorus beats, the square CBSE logo — that most of us associate with the Maths textbooks — thumps into view. The surprisingly thoughtful lyrics remind students that marks are not the only measure for success, and that there are many careers to choose from, including dance, teaching and design.

Students however, in all cynicism, seem to suspect this video is the aftermath of the Physics paper, which many claim was one of the toughest in recent years — there is even a Change.org petition demanding lenient checking.

Despite students snickering at what they call a ‘boomer’ attempt to be cool, CBSE has been trying its best to motivate through the Gen-Z language of memes. A scroll through their Twitter this February looks much like an aunt trying desperately to connect with adolescent nephews and getting only sarcasm in response. But then, it’s exam time and stress is high.

Incidentally, the music industry seems to be taking the student audience seriously. In December 2019, Sony Music released a student anthem by Naezy and Dub Sharma, called ‘Let’s Crack It’ which garnered not only some 15 million views, but the most elusive of all: the respect of a teen.

We hope you reach there too, CBSE. Keep trying, we’re sure that one meme to win them all is not far away.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/kge2fy/article30981638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CBSE12THCLASSEXAM,https://www.thehindu.com/society/cbse-releases-exam-anthem-for-students/article30981640.ece

38,2020/03/04,Equitas bank gears up to go public,"Issue proceeds to be used to augment tier I capital

Having received the nod from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for its initial public offering (IPO), Equitas Small Finance Bank is gearing up to go public as soon as possible, said a top executive. “As of now, we don’t have any deadline for the IPO. We are working on going public as quickly as possible,” said P.N. Vasudevan, MD and CEO of the bank. The IPO comprises fresh issue of ₹550 crore and an offer-for-sale of eight crore equity shares.

The offer price and date will be decided by ESFBL and promoters selling the shares in consultation with book running lead managers in accordance with the book building process and red herring prospectus. JM Financial, Edelweiss Financial Services and IIFL Securities are the book running lead managers to the issue.

The proceeds of the fresh issue would be used to augment the bank’s tier-I capital base to meet the future capital requirements.

Earlier, while granting an in-principle approval for the bank, the RBI had asked ESFBL to get the entity listed within three years (by September 4, 2019) and reduce promoters’ stake to 40%.

ESFBL has 1,077 branches in 15 States and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Equitas Holdings Ltd. (EHL). The parent company approached the SEBI with a reverse merger proposal.

Since, the regulator did not approve the proposal, EHL and ESFBL boards approved a scheme of arrangement wherein ESFBL would capitalise its free reserves and issue shares to the shareholders of EHL without cash consideration. As the deadline for listing was nearing, ESFBL sought an extension of the same. On September 4, the RBI declined to extend the same.

Later, ESFBL decided to go public and filed a red herring prospectus on December 16 and it was approved on February 3.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/equitas-bank-gears-up-to-go-public/article30984239.ece
39,2020/03/04,Telcos still owe Centre ₹1.30 lakh cr. in AGR dues,"This is 11% of the total estimated dues

The Centre on Wednesday said it had till now received only ₹15,896.51 crore from telecom firms as payment towards their adjusted gross revenue-related dues.

This is about 11% of the total estimated dues of ₹1,46,336.98 crore, leaving ₹1,30,440.47 crore still to be paid ahead of the next Supreme Court hearing on the issue on March 17.

Replying to a query on whether the government proposed to take any action over non-compliance of order on payment of dues, Minister of State for Communications Sanjay Dhotre said the government had directed the licensees to make the payments in accordance with the October 24, 2019, Supreme Court order.

“As per the licence agreement, the government takes action against licencees, including telecom service providers, over non-compliance of the Supreme Court order dated October 24, 2019, on payment of dues to the Department of Telecommunication,” he said in a written reply to Lok Sabha.

Asked if the government intended to propose a plan for future developments in the telecom sector, keeping in mind the huge fees required to be paid by the companies, he said there was no such plan at present. On a query over speculation about Vodafone Idea shutting down, he said, “No such information is available with the government.”

As per the data shared by the Minister, Vodafone Idea has paid ₹3,500 crore as against its estimated liabilities of ₹53,038.60 crore, Reliance Communication paid ₹3.96 crore as against its estimated liabilities of ₹21,135.64 crore, and Reliance Jio has paid ₹195.18 crore, which is in excess of its estimated AGR dues of ₹60.52 crore.

For Bharti Airtel (including Telenor), the Minister said a payment of ₹10,000 crore was made as against estimated liabilities of ₹27,740.36 crore. However, this does not reflect the additional payment of ₹8,004 crore by the company on February 29. Likewise, for Tata Group, the government said it had received a payment of ₹2,197.37 crore as against estimated liabilities of ₹11,625.92 crore. The group had on March 3 said that it had made an additional payment of ₹2,000 crore to the DoT towards dues related to adjusted gross revenue.

State-owned BSNL and MTNL, which owe the government ₹4,989.46 crore and ₹3,122 crore, respectively, have not made any payments towards their liabilities.

The government further noted that the due amounts may be revised once AGR figures were finalised and assessments done accordingly, and subject to the C&AG Audit/Special Audit.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/telcos-still-owe-centre130-lakh-cr-in-agr-dues/article30984228.ece

41,2020/03/04,SC order on cryptocurrency will offer only temporary relief,"Government’s draft law proposes to ban private currencies

Even as virtual currency investors and businesses welcomed the Supreme Court’s order on cryptocurrency, the relief for such players may be only temporary given that the Centre, in a draft law, has proposed to ban all private cryptocurrencies.

“... Our main objective is to create a dialogue with policymakers and develop a comprehensive framework for crypto assets in India paving the way for innovation,” said, Sohail Merchant, CEO, Pocketbits.in, and member of IAMAI’s Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Committee. “As an industry body, we look forward to a more open dialogue with the government.” IAMAI was among entities that had approached the Supreme Court in 2018 over the RBI circular prohibiting regulated entities from “providing any service in relation to virtual currencies, including those of transfer or receipt of money in accounts relating to the purchase or sale of virtual currencies.”

Welcoming the order, industry body Nasscom tweeted, “We believe that banning #tech is not the solution, a risk-based framework must be developed to regulate and monitor cryptocurrencies and tokens.”

Noting that the government’s draft framework for regulating the cryptocurrencies proposes to ban all cryptocurrencies outright except a state-issued one, Rachit Sharma, DGM, Taxmann, said the Supreme Court’s order could be a temporary relief for the investors and intermediaries.

He added the Centre may introduce the bill in the Parliament to permanently ban the cryptocurrencies and to set up the basic infrastructure required to issue state-owned cryptocurrency and the digital rupee.

“Until then, all intermediaries and banks, which were forced to shut down platforms providing the trading of cryptocurrencies, are free to operate in India,” Mr. Sharma said.

G.V. Anand Bhushan, partner, Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co., added the challenge ahead will be to strike a balance between innovation and the need to regulate these newer technologies which are not always used for lawful activities.

L. Viswanathan, partner, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said the RBI may reconsider its approach to cryptocurrency and come up with a calibrated framework that deals with the reality of these technological advancements, given that even central banks across the world were issuing their own cryptocurrencies.

“We are quite excited about the ban being lifted, which is a much-awaited relief for us and the entire crypto community. It’s such a morale booster and will definitely help us bring back the high-volume traders who were concerned about the tips involved in our P2P transaction system, and have been unable to transact small amounts....we are confident that this verdict would give rise to a greater ecosystem in a country where innovation has always had a place, and rope in new investors, better support for blockchain-based projects, and eventually, create more jobs in India” said Gaurav Dahake, CEO, Bitbns, a cryptocurreny exchange.

Likewise, Zac Cheah, CEO, Pundi X said, “The Apex Court of India lifting the ban on crypto only reinforces the fact that crypto and blockchain are the technologies of the future... India is the second largest user of Pundi X’s blockchain wallet... allowing cryptocurrency transactions will increase our user base and will bring more and more consumers into the fold of digital payments.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/srf2ps/article30984155.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THBUCRYPTOCURRENCY,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sc-order-on-cryptocurrency-will-offer-only-temporary-relief/article30984157.ece

43,2020/03/04,"Government detaches GAIL, OIL and other PSUs from AGR case","The DoT had sought ₹1.83 lakh crore from GAIL and ₹48,489 crore from OIL by including their revenues from oil and gas business in calculating dues for leasing out surplus bandwidth capacity to third parties.

The government has detached gas utility GAIL India, explorer Oil India and other public sector undertakings (PSUs) from a Supreme Court order that had led to ₹1.47 lakh crore being sought from telecom firms such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea in past dues, the Lok Sabha was informed on Wednesday.

Following the October 24 order of the Supreme Court asking inclusion of non-telecom revenues for calculating statutory dues such as license fee and spectrum charges of telecom firms, the Department of Telecommunications has sought a cumulative ₹2.7 lakh crore from GAIL and other non-telecom PSUs.

Also Read Why is the telecom sector under stress?

The demand was challenged by State-owned firms. “Supreme Court has detached the public sector undertakings from the AGR judgment dated October 24, 2019, and directed them to seek relief from an appropriate forum,” Minister of State for Communications Sanjay Dhotre said in a written reply to a question in the Lower House of Parliament.

The DoT had sought ₹1.83 lakh crore from GAIL and ₹48,489 crore from OIL by including their revenues from oil and gas business in calculating dues for leasing out surplus bandwidth capacity to third parties. Power Grid Corp was slapped with ₹21,953.65 crore liability and Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Ltd faced ₹15,019.97 crore demand. RailTel and Delhi Metro too faced similar demands.

“Public sector undertakings such as GAIL, Oil India, etc., represented to Department of Telecom that the AGR judgment is not applicable on them and therefore they do not owe any dues to the Department of Telecom,” Mr. Dhotre said.

The challenge to such demand was heard by the apex court last month.

“After the Supreme Court order dated February 14, 2020, the government abides by the orders of Supreme Court,” he said.

On February 14, the Supreme Court had pulled up the DoT for not enforcing its October 24 order that gave telcos three months’ time to pay dues. Hours later, the DoT sent notices to Airtel and Vodafone Idea asking them to clear dues immediately.

To a separate question, Mr. Dhotre said the government has received ₹15,896.5 crore payment from telecom companies towards adjusted gross revenues (AGR) liabilities and ₹1,30,440.4 crore remained to be paid.

This number, however, does not seem to reflect the latest tranche of payment made by Bharti Airtel on February 29.

Detailing out payments made by telecom companies to the DoT towards statutory dues, Mr. Dhotre informed that against the provisional total dues of ₹1,46,336.9 crore, payment to the tune of ₹15,896.5 crore has been received.

Bharti Airtel paid ₹10,000 crore, with ₹27,740 crore balance remaining, he said, adding Vodafone Idea has paid ₹3,500 crore and ₹49,538 crore remained due.

Similarly, Tata Group paid ₹2,197.3 crore, and ₹11,625 crore remained due.

OIL, the nation’s second-biggest State-owned oil producer, holds a National Long Distance (NLD) Service Licence with primary objective of monitoring and operation of its pipeline network.

The surplus bandwidth capacity available with the company was leased out to the telecom operators/other users, on which the company regularly paid the applicable license fee to the telecom department (DoT).

But, after the October 24 Supreme Court ruling for including non-telecom revenues for calculating dues, the DoT included all revenues from oil and gas to seek ₹48,489 crore from the company for the period from 2007-08 to 2018-19.

In case of GAIL, which held a IP-II licence, the DoT assessed ₹1,83,076 crore as outstanding after including interest and penalty computed on the entire revenue of the company.

PowerGrid, which holds NLD and Internet Service Provider (ISP) licences, was asked to pay ₹21,953.65 crore (including interest and penalty) for FY 2012-13 to FY 2017-18 by adding revenue related to power transmission and consultancy as ‘miscellaneous income’ in adjusted gross revenue, company sources said, adding the firm will approach the Telecommunications Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) in next few days.

Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilizers & Chemicals Limited, which had a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) and a Category ‘A’ ISP, was asked to pay ₹15,019.97 crore for the financial year 2005-06 to 2018-19.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/3du3xi/article30981979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-GAIL-INDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/government-detaches-gail-oil-and-other-psus-from-agr-case/article30981945.ece

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday dismissed the pleas of debt-ridden IL&FS auditors -- Deloitte Haskins & Sells and KPMG arm BSR & Associates -- challenging their impleadment in the case involving alleged fraud in IFIN, a subsidiary of IL&FS.

A two-member NCLAT bench led by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya dismissed the pleas of auditors and other independent directors.

The appellate tribunal, however, granted a relief to both auditors and other independent directors by allowing the operation of its earlier interim order passed on July 29, 2019 for two weeks.

On July 29, the NCLAT stayed the order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to implead the auditors and the independent directors of IL&FS.

Earlier on July 23, the NCLT had allowed the plea of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) to implead the auditors and independent directors of IFIN.

“On the request of the counsel, we allow (that) interim order dated July 29 would continue till another two weeks,” the bench said.

The MCA had asked the NCLT to freeze the assets of the former auditors in the case involving alleged fraud in IFIN.

While, commenting on the development, Deloitte India spokesperson said: ""We will review the written order before determining our further course of action, which may include an appeal.”

Auditors cannot be treated as part of the management which is responsible for managing the affairs of the company and therefore should not be charged, the spokesperson said.

The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on March 4 asked the fair trade regulator Competition Commission of India (CCI) to initiate again the probe against e-commerce major Flipkart for an alleged use of its dominant position.

A three-member bench of the NCLAT headed by Chairman Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya has set aside the earlier order passed by the CCI in this regard. Earlier, the CCI had absolved Flipkart of unfair practices using its dominant position.

47,2020/03/04,Earthquakes in India at three-year high in 2019,"The Indian subcontinent has suffered some of the deadliest earthquakes globally, with more than 60% of its land area prone to shaking of intensity VII and above

A total of 768 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 and above were located by the National Seismological Network from 2017 to January 31, 2020 according to a response to a question in the Rajya Sabha this week.

There were 226 earthquakes in 2017, 203 in 2018, and 309 earthquakes in 2019. Earthquakes of magnitude 4 and above nearly doubled from 78 in 2018 to 159 in 2019, the response from the Union Earth Sciences Ministry revealed.

India has been grouped into four seismic zones, that is, Zone II, III, IV and V. Zone V is considered to be the most seismically active, while Zone II is the least so.

The Indian subcontinent has suffered some of the deadliest earthquakes globally, with more than 60% of its land area prone to shaking of intensity VII and above on the Modified Mercalli Intensity scale.

Extremely vulnerable

The Himalayan belt is particularly susceptible to earthquakes exceeding 8.0 magnitude, with Jammu and Kashmir considered extremely vulnerable. The Indian plate consists of India and Pakistan and the vast Eurasian tectonic plates that comprise Europe, Russia and most of the Middle East. The Himalayas are a result of the collision of these plates, and because the Indian plate moves northwards into the Eurasian plate a few centimetres every year, this has led to a build-up of a lot of strain, that scientists say, has not been adequately released. A study published in the journal Nature Communications, in 2019, says that moderate earthquakes, that is less than 7 magnitude, may in fact be adding strain and priming the region for a massive quake greater than 8.5 magnitude. Though such a quake is imminent, scientists are not able to say when such a quake is likely.

Active faults

There are over 66 active faults in India, with the Himalayan belt, extending for 2,400 km, itself dissected by 15 major active faults. The Indo-Gangetic and Brahmaputra Plains have 16 tectonically active faults, while Peninsular India is marked with around 30 neo-tectonic faults.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cfontb/article30985079.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EARTHQUAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/earthquakes-in-india-at-three-year-high-in-2019/article30984925.ece

49,2020/03/04,"COVID-19 | Ram Nath Kovind, Narendra Modi to avoid Holi gatherings","Amit Shah’s rally likely to be put off; govt. dealing with the situation proactively, says Javadekar

India currently has only 28 known cases of COVID-19, but the political class has taken the pandemic seriously. President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday that they would not attend any gathering to mark Holi (March 10). Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s rally in Hyderabad, scheduled for March 15, is likely to be postponed.

Mr. Kovind wrote on Twitter: “With alertness and safeguards, we all can help contain the outbreak of COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. In a precautionary measure, the Rashtrapati Bhavan will not hold the traditional Holi gatherings.”

The tweet followed Mr. Modi’s own, declaring his intention to keep away from Holi events.

“Experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. Hence, this year I have decided not to participate in any Holi Milan programme,” he said. BJP president J.P. Nadda also said that he would not celebrate Holi or hold any Holi Milan function.

Mr. Shah has reportedly postponed his rally in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act because of the outbreak of the disease.

‘6 lakh people screened’

Meanwhile, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said over six lakh people had been screened for COVID-19 at 21 airports, and asserted that the government was dealing with the situation proactively.

While the virology institute in Pune was fit for conducting tests for coronavirus, the government has now set up 15 more labs and is in the process of establishing 19 additional centres, he said.

However, it was Lok Sabha member (Independent) from Amravati Navneet Rana, who brought the disease into focus in Parliament. She attended the session on Wednesday by wearing a mask, pointing out that Parliament is a crowded area. She said she had purchased the mask for ₹125 and the price should be lowered for the benefit of the people.

50,2020/03/04,Supreme Court directs Sajjan Kumar to appear before AIIMS board,"A Bench comprising Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant directed Kumar to appear before the Board at 10.30 a.m.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, serving life sentence in a case related to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, to appear before an AIIMS Board on Thursday to determine whether he needs to be hospitalised.

SC refuses interim relief to Sajjan Kumar in 1984 anti-Sikh riots case

A Bench comprising Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant directed Kumar to appear before the Board at 10.30 a.m.

The Bench was hearing a bail application filed by Kumar on the grounds of his medical condition.

“It appears that there is a certificate by Dr. Randhir Sud, Chairman, Institute of Digestive & Hepatobiliary Sciences, Medanta-The Medicity, to the effect that Sajjan Kumar, who is the appellant, needs to be examined in order to rule out major illnesses and that he needs institutional care,” the court observed.

It noted the submission of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta that Kumar was due for a medical examination at AIIMS according to the earlier report of AIIMS dated, December 10, 2019.

“We, accordingly, direct that Kumar be produced before the AIIMS Board on March 5, 2020, at 10.30 a.m. After examination the AIIMS Board shall decide whether hospitalisation is necessary and whether such hospitalisation is necessary in a particular hospital. They may also determine the duration for which the hospitalisation may be necessary,” the Bench said.

It further directed that a report be submitted to the court within a period of one week.

“In the meanwhile, if the AIIMS Board consider it necessary to hospitalise Kumar, they may do so after recording reasons,” the court said.

The Bench had on February 14 refused to grant interim bail to Kumar and said it would hear his plea during the summer break.

Kumar, who sought bail on health grounds, was awarded life imprisonment by the Delhi High Court on December 17, 2018, in the case.

The top court had on November 6 last year directed that the former Congress leader be examined by a panel of AIIMS doctors and a report be submitted to it on his health conditions.

On August 5, last year, the apex court said it would hear Kumar’s bail plea in May 2020 as it was not an “ordinary case” and required detailed hearing before any order was passed.

Kumar resigned from the Congress after he was convicted by the High Court.

The case in which he was convicted and sentenced relates to the killing of five Sikhs in Delhi Cantonment’s Raj Nagar Part-I area of southwest Delhi on November 1-2 in 1984, and burning down of a gurdwara in Raj Nagar Part-II.

Anti-Sikh riots had broken out after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on October 31, 1984, by her two Sikh bodyguards.

Kumar has also challenged in the apex court the Delhi High Court’s verdict of December 17 last year that awarded him life imprisonment for the “remainder of his natural life” in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.

The High Court had convicted him for the offences of criminal conspiracy and abetment in commission of crimes of murder, promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of communal harmony and defiling and destruction of a gurdwara.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4ku9ed/article30984440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5TH-SAJJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-directs-sajjan-kumar-to-appear-before-aiims-board/article30984441.ece

Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister P.K. Mishra on Wednesday chaired a crucial meeting called to discuss ways to combat the deadly COVID-19, where it was decided to introduce universal screening at all international airports of the country.

The meeting was attended by the Cabinet Secretary, Foreign Secretary, Secretaries of Ministries of Health, Civil Aviation, Information and Broadcasting, Shipping, Tourism, Chairman (Airport Authority of India) and Secretary (Border Management), MHA.

Officials from defence forces, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), NITI Aayog and the Prime Minister’s Office also attended.

Two major changes have been made to further enhance the government’s level of preparedness. These include introduction of universal screening at all international airports and sea-ports through use of thermal imagery equipment and mandatory filling of declaration forms of places visited by tourists and travellers returning from abroad.

It was also decided to rapidly implement opening of proper testing, isolation and quarantine facilities down to the district level, in partnership with State governments.

Coordination with Health Ministry

Ministries such as MHA, MoD, Railways and Labour would work with the Ministry of Health through the use of their facilities and hospitals, the meeting decided.

While efforts to contain the spread were appreciated, it was decided to enhance effectiveness of the steps taken by adopting a pan-government approach, in partnership with the States.

The meeting took note of the confusion among the people over lack of proper knowledge of the virus. The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is entrusted with disseminating information in a timely manner, including relevant advisories and ‘dos and don’ts’.

“The Ministry of Health briefed the meeting on the positive impact of a 24-hour medical helpline, operational across the country since January 23 with 10 dedicated telephone lines. These facilities have received over 6,000 phone calls,” said a government release.

The participation of communities and local bodies was also stressed in the meeting to combat the public health challenge posed by the virus.

Earlier on Monday, PM Modi tweeted: “Experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. Hence, this year I have decided not to participate in any Holi Milan programme.” On Tuesday, he urged people not to panic.

Wednesday’s was the latest in a series of stock-taking meetings at the PMO, with the first held on January 25.

The first case in Delhi was detected on Monday. Six suspected cases are also detected in Agra, who came in contact with the person from Delhi found to be infected. As of now, 28 cases of the virus have been reported across India including the Italian nationals who have now been quarantined.

The Rajya Sabha was adjourned within minutes of convening on Wednesday as Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu pushed the debate on Delhi riots for March 11, a day after Holi. The Opposition parties accused the government of delaying the debate because of its active role in Delhi riots.

Leader of the Opposition and Congress member Ghulam Nabi Azad, Trinamool Congress Parliamentary Party leader Derek O’ Brien and Samajwadi Party floor leader Ramgopal Yadav had filed motions under Rule 267 to suspend all business to debate the riots. But Mr. Naidu refused to admit the notices.

“I will be discussing with the Leader of the House, the Leader of the Opposition and others and will decide the time and the rule under which this issue has to be taken up. We will take it up on 11th after the Holi is over peacefully,” the Chairman said, leading to vociferous protests from opposition benches. A few TMC members even trooped into the well of the House.

Parliament will have a two-day Holi break early next week and resume functioning on March 11.

Reprimands members

Mr. Naidu adjourned the House after reprimanding the members, saying there were 16 Zero Hour mentions, including one on spread of coronavirus, but the Opposition had decided to not allow any business.

Speaking outside Parliament, Mr. Azad said, “We have told the government clearly that whenever the House functions it has to start with a debate on Delhi riots.” Mr. Derek O’Brien said Parliament was now functioning as a back office of the BJP. “This is a shame that in both Houses Mo-Sha [Modi-Shah] have given their lackeys directions that they will not have any discussion,” the TMC leader said.

Communist Party of India’s Parliamentary Party leader Binoy Viswam said the fact that Parliament was evading discussion clearly showed the BJP’s role in Delhi violence. “The UN human rights body and many countries have expressed concern on events in Delhi but the Indian Parliament has so far failed to do so.

55,2020/03/04,No dilution in India’s support to Palestinian cause: UN committee on Palestine,"Participants in a 4-member delegation of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable rights of Palestinian People said that during their discussions with Minister S. Jaishankar, the government had reiterated its stand on the issue.

India has remained “steadfast” in its support for Palestinian rights and has consistently voted in favour of Palestine at the United Nations on “15 key resolutions” said members of a key UN body, who called for New Delhi to play an “enhanced” role in the search for a solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict. Participants in a four-member delegation of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable rights of the Palestinian People said that during their discussions with External Affairs minister S. Jaishankar, the government had reiterated its traditional stand on the issue.

“We would like countries like India that have good relations with both Israel and Palestine, and are also attached to multilateral principles, to play a bigger role in the resolution of the issue,” Cheikh Niang, Chairman of the committee, who visited Delhi this week told reporters. Mr. Niang explained that part of the reason for the first such country visit by the panel was that India is expected to become a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for 2021-22.

When asked about India’s recent votes that appeared to support Israel, including one at the UN’s ECOSOC in June 2019 which ended the consultative status for a Palestinian NGO that Israel claimed had terror links, the committee members said those actions were not reflective of India’s stand on the resolution of the Israel-Palestine conflict.

They pointed to several other votes by India, including the UN General Assembly vote that had sharply criticised the United States for recognising Jerusalem as the Israeli capital in December 2017. India had also voted in favour of another UNGA resolution “deploring the use of excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate force by Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians” in June 2018.

“The best way to test India’s commitment is the way India votes,” Mr. Niang told The Hindu. “India has consistently voted in favour of those resolutions that promote the two-state solution with a Palestinian claim to East Jerusalem. We have not seen any weakening of the position, and we reinforced this during our meeting [with the MEA].”

The delegation, which included Mr. Niang, a UN representative from Senegal, committee members from Indonesia and Malaysia, and a diplomat-observer from the State of Palestine Majed Bamya, said that they had spoken to the government about enhancing India’s political and diplomatic support to talks, as well as development aid and cooperation for institution building in Palestine. In particular, they discussed the recent election campaign in Israel, where PM Benjamin Netanyahu focused on increasing Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories, as well as on the “Deal of the century” proposed by the U.S. President for the “Middle East”, which favours Israeli demands on division of the land.

“It is in India’s national interests to abide by the support [to the Palestinian cause] it has been steadfast on, despite Israeli claims to the contrary,” Mr. Bamya said. “Peace based on two-state solution is much needed in the face of international proposals that are in breach of these principles, and cannot be forged between Israel and a third country [U.S.], but can only come from Israel-Palestine talks, which India also supports,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/myac3r/article30983835.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5th-niang,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-dilution-in-indias-support-to-palestinian-cause-un-committee-on-palestine/article30983836.ece

The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions on Wednesday informed the Rajya Sabha that 320 government officials had been given premature retirement since July 2014. The Ministry said as on February 27, 2020, provisions of the Fundamental Rules FR 56(j)/similar rules had been invoked against 163 Group ‘A’ officers, including the all-India services officers and 157 Group ‘B’ officers, from July 2014 till January this year.

The information is based on the updated data provided by various Ministries, departments, cadre controlling authorities on the Probity Portal operated by the Department of Personnel and Training.

The rules are applicable to Group ‘A’ and ‘B’ officials, or those posted in substantive, quasi-permanent or temporary capacity, who had entered government service before 35 years and are at least 50 years old. In any other case, the minimum age is 55 years.

57,2020/03/04,Insolvency and Bankruptcy bill discriminates against homebuyers: MPs,"Three panel members file dissent note

The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, 2019, is discriminatory as it doesn’t treat home buyers at par with other financial creditors and violates a Supreme Court ruling on the issue, three members noted in dissent notes filed by them to the report on the bill tabled by the Standing Committee on Finance, headed by BJP leader Jayant Sinha, in Parliament on Wednesday.

The bill has introduced a new clause that sets a threshold of a minimum 100 homebuyers or 10% of total homebuyers in a project, whichever is less, as a requirement to jointly take the developer to an insolvency court. This means that an individual homebuyer, who is a financial creditor, cannot file an insolvency application.

Also read| Cabinet okays amendments to bankruptcy code

Out of the committee’s 32 members, three MPs including Congress MP Manish Tewari, CPI(M) member T. K. Rangarajan and the BJP’s Rajeev Chandrasekhar filed dissent notes. Mr. Tewari accused the chairman, Mr. Sinha, of not recording the committee’s sentiment that this clause should be dropped. “The draft report of the Standing Committee had proposed the same but due to opposition from within, it is being now deleted from the final report,” Mr. Tewari asserted.

Mr. Rangarajan in his two-page dissent note noted that the proposed bill denies homebuyers of their relevant rights. “The entire amendment is completely illogical and is against the very principle of the Insolvency Code to treat incipient sickness,” Mr. Rangarajan said. He also observed that no relief had been offered to homebuyers from repayment of bank loans if the developer failed to deliver. He also wondered how was a homebuyer expected to calculate the 10% threshold, if there was no law to mandate display of the list of buyers on a web portal.

Both the Opposition members of the panel accused the government of coming under pressure from the builders’ lobby.

In his dissent note, Mr. Tewari said that the law undermines the Supreme Court ruling that gave rights to homebuyers “by turning an individual remedy into a class action”. “It ignores the ticket size of a homebuyer’s investment into a real estate project and reduces him to a numerical as opposed to a creditor”. The amendment violated the right of millions of voiceless homebuyers who found their life savings ripped and misappropriated by unscrupulous builders and real estate developers, the Congress MP asserted.

The BJP’s Mr. Chandrasekhar said that the demand of homebuyers to be treated at par with financial creditors was a justified demand. The new law was, thus, a case of “distortion of the principle of equal rights guaranteed under the Constitution,” Mr. Chandrasekhar argued.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/73fjfa/article30983638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06TEWARI-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ibc-bill-discriminates-against-homebuyers/article30983639.ece
58,2020/03/04,"E-waste recycling has doubled, says Centre","A recycling rate of 10% in 2017-18 has risen to a little over 20% in 2018-19

The government said it more than doubled the electronic waste (e-waste) it recycled in 2018-19 over 2017-18, according to a response to a question in the Rajya Sabha this week.

In 2017, the Centre brought into effect the E-waste Rules, which require companies that make or sell electronic equipment to collect a certain percentage of e-waste generated from their goods once they have reached their “end-of-life”.

In 2017-2018, the companies were supposed to have collected 10%. This would rise to 70% by 2023. But doing this would require these firms to work with licensed e-waste recyclers and ensure that all e-waste is safely disposed.

Data provided

The approximate estimated generation of e-waste in FY 2017-2018 for electrical and electronic equipment based on the sales data of 244 producers was 7,08,445 tonnes of which 69,414 tonnes were recycled, whereas in FY 2018-2019, based on the sales data of 1,168 companies, the e-waste generation estimate was 7,71,215 tonnes of which 1,64,663 tonnes were recycled. This translates to a 10% recycling rate in 2017-18 rising to a little over 20% in 2018-19.

The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) requires producers to set up e-waste exchange facilities to facilitate collection and recycling, and assigning specific responsibility to bulk consumers of electronic products for safe disposal. State governments have been entrusted with the responsibility for earmarking industrial space for e-waste dismantling and recycling facilities; to undertake industrial skill development; and to establish measures for protecting the health and safety of workers engaged in the dismantling and recycling facilities for e-waste.

Higher estimates

The e-waste produced in India as per the data provided by the government is lower than estimates by international agencies. According to the Global E-Waste Monitor 2017, India generates about 2 million tonnes (MT) of e-waste annually and ranks fifth among e-waste producing countries, after the US, China, Japan and Germany.

Most of India’s e-waste is recycled by the informal sector and under hazardous conditions. A report by the Union Environment Ministry in 2018 found that many of India’s e-waste recyclers weren’t recycling waste at all. While some were storing it in hazardous conditions, many didn't even have the capacity to handle such waste.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/c7ygrl/article30148498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/e-waste,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e-waste-recycling-has-doubled-says-centre/article30983383.ece

61,2020/03/04,Delhi violence 2020: Supreme Court asks Harsh Mander to not participate in hearing,"The activist was accused of making disparaging remarks about the Court in a public speech

The Supreme Court on Wednesday stopped activist Harsh Mander from participating in a hearing on a batch of petitions seeking immediate registration of FIRs against leaders who instigated communal violence in Delhi with their hate speeches.

Mr. Mander was accused of making disparaging remarks about the Supreme Court in a public speech.

The Delhi Police said it had transcripts made from the video of the speech. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the police, said Mr. Mander was seen “instigating people” and goading people that “ultimate justice” can be got only on the streets rather than from the Supreme Court or Parliament.

Advocate Karuna Nandy, for Mr. Mander, said the allegations were false. There was no prior notice given to their side before such allegations were levelled in court. She sought a copy of the transcripts so that a proper reply could be filed by Mr. Mander against the accusations.

In fact, it was a judge on the Bench, Justice B.R. Gavai, who first referred to the alleged speech made by Mr. Mander. Mr. Mehta immediately picked up the issue and said it raised a “pertinent” issue.

“If this is what you [Mander] feel about the Supreme Court, then we have to decide what to do with you,” Chief Justice of India Bobde sternly addressed Ms. Nandy.

She was asked to sit down and not participate in the hearing until the issue regarding Mr. Mander’s remarks were sorted out. The court went on to hear in detail the petition filed separately by Delhi riots victims, represented by senior advocate Colin Gonsalves.

Later in the day, the Delhi Police filed an affidavit terming his speech as “seriously contemptuous” as it makes “derogatory remarks” against the Supreme Court before a “huge gathering of people”. The affidavit refers to a May 2, 2019 order passed by the Supreme Court in connection with an Assam NRC case to allege that Mr. Mander “is known for his contemptuous stand and bringing the judiciary as an institution and individual judges to disrepute. Mr. Mander would be filing his response to these allegations.

It was Mr. Mander’s petition that led the Delhi High Court to assemble at midnight recently and order the Delhi Police to ensure the safe passage and medical treatment for riot victims. Mr. Mehta criticised that order.

During the hearing on Wednesday, Mr. Mehta’s reply to a question from the CJI about the registration of FIRs against those behind the hate speeches was greeted with loud guffaws from some lawyers in the courtroom.

“We will stop this proceedings... This is a court and not a place for mocking people just because they are on the other side,” Chief Justice Bobde said.

Mr. Mehta recounted how two Delhi High Court judges were heckled by some lawyers who shouted ‘shame, shame’ at them during the Jamia violence hearing.

In turn, Mr. Gonsalves, who represented Mr. Mander earlier in the Delhi High Court, recounted the picture of students lying in the hospital with “broken bones and bandaged heads, which were the prize of police action”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/vudj48/article30982884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Harsh-Mander-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-violence-2020-supreme-court-asks-harsh-mander-to-not-participate-in-hearing/article30982867.ece

The Direct Tax Vivad se Vishwas Bill that seeks to expedite resolution of pending tax disputes was passed by the Lok Sabha on Wednesday even as normal proceedings in both houses of Parliament remain paralysed for the third day in a row over the Opposition’s demand for an immediate discussion on the Delhi riots.

Earlier, Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi informed that the government would debate the issue in the Lower House on March 11, a day after Holi, and in the Rajya Sabha on March 12.

As soon as the day’s proceedings started, Congress members in the Lok Sabha trooped into the well of the house raising slogans and demanded an immediate discussion on the Delhi riots.

Even as two questions were taken up during the Question Hour, Opposition MPs were heard shouting slogans including ‘Modi sarkar shame shame’, ‘Pradhan mantri jawab do (Prime Minister give an answer)’.

Congress members also persisted with their demand for the resignation of Home minister Amit Shah, with a few of them displaying posters in the well, forcing the Chair to adjourn the House until noon.

In the Rajya Sabha, Chairman Venkaiah Naidu adjourned the house for the day soon after 11 a.m., as MPs of Congress, Trinamool, Left, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party were up on their feet to protest the Chair’s decision to hold the debate on Delhi riots after Holi.

When the Lok Sabha reconvened at noon, it was adjourned for a second time until 2 p.m. as the Opposition members remained unrelenting.

“Why should we wait until Holi when there is Holi being played with human blood,” asked Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury. “We won’t stop agitating until the government agrees to our demand of an immediate discussion,” he added.

When the lower house met at 2 p.m., the government managed to get the tax disputes resolution bill — Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Bill, 2020 — passed amid the din raised by protesting Opposition members and introduced another bill related to education.

The tax disputes resolution bill states that as many as 4.83 lakh tax disputes are pending in various appellate fora such as Commissioner (Appeals), Income Tax Appelate Tribunal, High Courts and Supreme Court and as much as ₹9.5 lakh crore is locked in these disputes.

Under the proposed scheme, a taxpayer would be required to pay only the amount of the disputed taxes and will get complete waiver of interest and penalty provided the amount is paid by March 31.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gez6sq/article30982645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-PARLIAMENT-MAR4-PTI-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ls-approves-tax-resolution-bill-as-disruptions-continue/article30982646.ece

The chief minister said the taskforce will comprise all stakeholders concerned, adding that that the AAP government has taken various measures to contain the outbreak of the virus.

“We have one confirmed case in Delhi till now and the patient has been admitted to Safdarjung Hospital. He is a resident of Mayur Vihar, who had travelled first from Italy to Budapest and then from Vienna to Delhi.

“We have identified 88 people who he came in contact with after coming back to India. We are trying to conduct screening on all those 88 identified people,” he said.

“We are concerned about situation but no need to panic. We are doing whatever we can to control the coronavirus from spreading... members of all the important departments in Delhi, state officials, and police officials have been included in the task force,” he said.

A coronavirus testing lab will be set up at the Lady Hardinge Hospital and also at the LNJP Hospital if necessary, Mr. Kejriwal said.

He also said that there is no shortage of masks.

Municipal corporations in Delhi are contacting and screening tourists from four countries where most cases of the infection have come to light. The screening is being done at hotels and guesthouses in the city, he said.

Isolation wards in 19 government and six private hospitals are being readied in case of need, Mr. Kejriwal stated.

He said that thermal scanning of all the passengers landing from abroad is being conducted on the airports and referring them to RML hospital in case any symptoms are observed.

Until now, 1,16,579 patients have been screened at the airport.

“The government has developed the capacity to handle an influx of patients in around 19 Delhi government hospitals and six private hospitals... Isolation beds and isolation wards are being created to provide adequate treatment,” the chief minister said.

He said that school children also need to be made aware of coronavirus and steps to prevent the disease from spreading.

“A meeting was also held with the education department where the need to spread awareness regarding coronavirus was necessitated. The state-level task force will meet at regular intervals to discuss the responsibilities of various departments and the work undertaken,” he said.

Asked about alleged blackmarketing of masks and hand sanitizers in wake of coronavirus, Mr. Kejriwal said his government will look into this and take all necessary steps to prevent it.

Mr. Kejriwal said he hoped the people of Delhi would support the government to control the outbreak of the disease just as the AAP dispensation was able to control dengue.

“The passengers who had come from Italy were staying in Surya hotel, but we have also traced and identified the people who had come in contact with those passengers and they have been kept in isolation,” he said.

Around 13-14 rooms of the hotel have been sealed to ensure that they are properly sanitized before putting into use, he said.

“The same steps have been taken in the Grand Hotel, where they stayed afterward. The passengers are currently in Chhawla ITBP camp and we are preparing to transfer them to Safdarjung Hospital for treatment as they have been found positive.” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qml5xl/article30982669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARVINDKEJRIWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/screening-88-people-who-came-in-contact-with-delhi-coronavirus-patient-arvind-kejriwal/article30982670.ece

65,2020/03/04,Supreme Court asks High Court to list Delhi riots cases on March 6,"Supreme Court says High Court delay in hearing the pleas ‘unjustified’.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it was “unjustified” on the part of the Delhi High Court to delay hearing the pleas for arrest and prosecution of leaders who instigated the communal rampage in the National Capital and directed the High Court to list the petitions on Friday (March 6).

Less than a week ago, the High Court adjourned to April 13 the hearing of petitions seeking immediate registration of FIRs against those who egged mobs on with their hate speeches. It had seemed to agree with the government that the “atmosphere was not conducive” for action.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde said April 13 was too far away. It requested Delhi High Court Chief Justice D.N. Patel to decide the petitions “as expeditiously as possible”.

With this, the Supreme Court signed off the case, saying it did not want to “assume jurisdiction” over the petitions when the High Court was already on the job.

In parting, the CJI wished the High Court to explore the possibility of finding a “peaceful resolution” to pleas made by victims to prosecute the instigators.

Read: Editorial | A test of governance

The CJI even suggested that victims, represented by senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, put up names of their leaders before the High Court in order to initiate a peace parley with the other side and the ruling BJP. This is when victims had made specific allegations against BJP leaders Kapil Mishra, Anurag Thakur, Parvesh Verma and Abhay Verma of instigating violence. Mr. Thakur is a Minister of State for Finance.

“We want to see if peace is possible,” Chief Justice Bobde reasoned.

At one point during the hearing, before the decision to revert the petitions to the High Court was made, Chief Justice Bobde took on Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi Police.

When Mr. Mehta submitted that the situation in Delhi was presently calm, the CJI asked why FIRs could not be registered immediately.

Also read | Strict action should be taken against those involved in Delhi riots: Anurag Thakur

“You had earlier said the atmosphere is not conducive… If it is calm now, there will not be a problem to register the FIRs” the CJI asked Mr. Mehta.

SG’s contention

The top law officer countered that the registration of FIRs and arrest of leaders of communities may lead to a flare-up.

The CJI persisted, saying “there may not be a flare-up if the police arrest leaders from both sides… FIRs, after all, do not prejudice anybody's rights. Registration of an FIR does what to a man? Nothing!”

The third judge on the Bench, Justice Surya Kant, agreed with the CJI. “Registration of FIR helps the police,” he said.

Mr. Mehta submitted, “But there may be an aggravation on both sides too. There were speeches from both sides… It should be left to us to act at the appropriate time… Permit us to take the decision”. He said 468 FIRs had been filed against rioters.

Chief Justice Bobde appeared to then agree with Mr. Mehta’s logic that leaders’ arrest may lead to renewal of violence.

“We also have some experience of riots. Sometimes, there may be a flare-up when leaders are arrested. You know what happened in the Bombay riots... When Shakha Pramukhs were arrested, it flared up. Bombay riots were worse than this,” Chief Justice Bobde turned and told Mr. Gonsalves, before passing the petitions to the High Court.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/egsxj2/article30679238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Supreme-Court,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-asks-high-court-to-list-delhi-riots-cases-on-march-6/article30982103.ece

The CPI(M) on Wednesday demanded that the government detaches the census operations from the National Population Register (NPR) process.

In a statement, the party said that given the opposition by several Chief Ministers over the NPR process, it is necessary to separate the collection of data for the census operation from the announced NPR enumeration.

“The Census operations are constitutionally mandated to be conducted every decade, while the NPR figures in the rules framed under the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2003. Hence, legally they should not be clubbed together.

The government on Wednesday launched the second phase of Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), which has a total outlay of ₹1,40,881 crore and is aimed at ensuring effective solid and liquid waste management in every panchayat.

SBM (G) Phase-II will focus on sustaining the gains made in the first phase of the programme in the past five years in terms of toilet access and usage, and will ensure that no one is left behind, Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said.

He said the programme will be implemented from 2020-2021 to 2024-2025 in a mission mode with a total outlay of ₹1,40,881 crore.

“Phase II will ensure that effective solid and liquid waste management (SLWM) is instituted in every gram panchayat of the country,” Mr. Shekhawat told reporters after the launch at the National Dissemination and Consultation Workshop on SBM (G) Phase-II.

“This will be a novel model of convergence among different verticals of financing. Of this, ₹52,497 crore will be allocated from the budget of department of drinking water and sanitation. The remaining amount will be dovetailed from the funds being released under the 15th finance commission, MGNREGS and revenue generation models particularly for SLWM,” he said.

On February 19, the cabinet approved the second phase of the Swachh Bharat Mission, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pet project focussed on sustainability of ODF and management of solid and liquid waste.

Since the launch of the mission in 2014, over 10 crore toilets have been built in rural areas, Mr. Shekhawat said, adding, “over 5.9 lakh villages in 699 districts of 35 states/UTs have declared themselves open defecation free (ODF).”

The SLWM component of “ODF Plus” will be monitored on the basis of output-outcome indicators for four key areas: management of plastic wastes, bio-degradable solid wastes (including animal wastes), greywater and fecal sludge, he said.

The SBM-II will continue to generate employment and provide impetus to the rural economy through construction of household and community toilets as well as infrastructure for SLWM like compost pits, soak pits, waste stabilisation ponds and material recovery facilities, he said.

As part of the National Dissemination and Consultation Workshop on SBM (G) Phase-II, a survey report on the impact of the mission on convenience, safety and self respect of women in rural India was released.

The report claimed 93% women feel safer from assault by not going out in the open to defecate, 91% women save up to one hour of their day earlier spent on walking to defecation sites and 88% women are proud to own a toilet.

The Delhi government on Wednesday moved a city court seeking fresh date for the execution of four Nirbhaya case convicts.

President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the mercy petition of Pawan Kumar Gupta, one of the four men facing the gallows in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, a Home Ministry official said earlier in the day.

The trial court had on February 17 issued fresh date for execution of death warrants for March 3 at 6 am for the four convicts — Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) — in the case.

President Ram Nath Kovind on Wednesday rejected the mercy petition of Pawan Kumar Gupta, one of the four men on death row in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.

Gupta was the last to file the mercy plea, the petitions of the other three convicts had been rejected earlier by the President.

Later, the Delhi government moved a city court seeking a fresh date for the execution of the four convicts.

According to Delhi Prison Rules, a 14-day period has to be given to a death row convict after the dismissal of a clemency plea before the prisoner can be hanged. All the four men are to be hanged together.

The Delhi government told Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana that “all legal remedies of the convicts have been exhausted and nothing survives now”.

The judge then directed the convicts to file their response by Thursday even as the lawyer for the prosecution said no notice was required.

While issuing the notice, the court said principles of natural justice are part of Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution and the sacrosanct principle of Audi alteram partem (listen to the other side) cannot be ignored.

The hanging of Mukesh Kumar Singh, 32, Vinay Sharma, 26, and Akshay Kumar Singh, 31, besides Gupta, 25, was previously scheduled for March 3. It was deferred for the third time in six weeks by the court on Monday.

The first date of execution — January 22 — fixed on January 7 was postponed by the court to February 1. But on January 31, the court indefinitely postponed the hanging. On February 17, the court again issued fresh date for execution of death warrants for March 3 at 6 a.m.

Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused. Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar jail days after the trial began in the case.

74,2020/03/04,M.P. crisis is Congress’s internal issue: State BJP chief,"‘Their own party leaders are blackmailing the Kamal Nath government over Rajya Sabha berths’, he says

Amid reports of a midnight shift and ‘’rescue’’ of some Madhya Pradesh Congress, non-Congress and non-BJP MLAs from a hotel in Gurugram, State BJP chief and Lok Sabha member from Khajhuraho Vishnu Dutt Sharma said it was an internal issue of the Congress.

Mr. Sharma told The Hindu that his party was only “watching” the developments and not behind these moves. “It is the Congress’s own internal politics that has led to this situation. Chief Minister Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Digvijaya Singh are playing their own games over the coming Rajya Sabha elections. It is convenient to blame the BJP,” he said.

“If you look at the comments on record by Congress leaders in the State in the last few months, including Sajjan Singh Verma, who said a ‘kitchen cabinet’ was running the government; or Ajay Singh, who said nobody was listening to party leaders; or Scindia himself, who has threatened to hit the streets against Kamal Nath government, it’s all clear. Their own party leaders are blackmailing the Kamal Nath government over Rajya Sabha berths,” he said.

To reports that some MLAs may have been moved to the BJP-ruled Karnataka, Mr. Sharma reiterated that the party knew nothing about it. “It’s a free country, people can go where they want, we are not moving anyone”.

75,2020/03/04,Supreme Court sets aside RBI ban on cryptocurrency transactions,"Top court finds prohibitive circular too disproportionate

The Supreme Court on March 4 set aside an April 6, 2018, circular of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) prohibiting banks and entities regulated by it from providing services in relation to virtual currencies (VCs).

“Till date, RBI has not come out with a stand that any of the entities regulated by it namely, nationalised banks/scheduled commercial banks/cooperative banks/NBFCs, have suffered any loss or adverse effect directly or indirectly, on account of VC exchanges,” a Bench comprising Justices Rohinton Nariman, Aniruddha Bose and V. Ramasubramanian observed in a 180-page judgment.

Also Read SC order on cryptocurrency will offer only temporary relief

Justice Ramasubramanian, who authored the ruling, found the RBI circular “disproportionate” with an otherwise consistent stand taken by the central bank that VCs were not prohibited in the country. Besides, the court found that the RBI did not consider the availability of alternatives before issuing the circular.

Again, the April circular was issued despite the fact that the central bank could not quote a single instance when VC exchanges “actually impacted entities regulated by RBI”. VCs are digital currencies in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of the currency units and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.

Besides, the apex court referred to the Centre’s failure to introduce an official digital Rupee despite two draft bills and several committees. “When the Government of India is unable to take a call despite several committees coming up with several proposals including two draft Bills, both of which advocated exactly opposite positions, it is not possible for us to hold that the impugned measure (April 6, 2018 circular) is proportionate,” Justice Ramasubramanian wrote.

The court expanded on how the Centre had been toying with plans for an official digital currency.

On November 2, 2017, the Centre constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee, which initially recommended the ‘Crypto-token Regulation Bill of 2018’. This Bill found a complete ban on VCs an “extreme tool” and suggested regulatory measures. At that point, the committee was even fine with the idea of allowing the sale and purchase of digital crypto assets at recognised exchanges.

The Supreme Court noted how the same committee did a “volte-face” in just two years.

From a permissive draft bill, the Inter-Ministerial Committee went on to recommend a “total ban” on private cryptocurrencies through a proposed legislation called ‘Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Act’ in February 2019. This proposed law contemplated the creation of a digital rupee as official currency and a legal tender by the central government in consultation with RBI.

The court said that had this law come through, there would be an official digital currency. The Centre and the RBI would have had monopoly over its creation and circulation.

“But that situation had not arisen. The position as on date is that VCs are not banned, but the trading in VCs and the functioning of VC exchanges are sent to comatose by the April 6 circular by disconnecting their lifeline namely, the interface with the regular banking sector,” Justice Ramasubramanian explained.

The nature of warfare has changed, with ﻿geostrategic realities being altered without a shot being fired and China’s island reclamation in the South China Sea is a prime example, Chief of the Army Staff Gen. Manoj Naravane said on Wednesday.

Referring to the Balakot air strike as an example, he said military escalation could be managed if played with skill.

“China’s dominance and its taking over of the islands in the South China Sea is a prime example of this. With small incremental steps, none of which by themselves were serious enough to warrant any action or reaction, but cumulatively they achieved their aim without firing a shot,” he said, adding geostrategic spaces were being constricted without altering the state of peace.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday decided to form a fund under the aegis of her party, Trinamool Congress, to help victims and their families of what she termed as “genocide” in Delhi.

Ms. Banerjee had announced the setting up of the fund on Monday during the launch of ‘Banglar Gorbo Mamata’ (Bengal’s pride Mamata), the TMC’s mass outreach campaign.

Ms. Banerjee was the first contributor to the fund. She gave ₹ 5 lakh from royalty received for the books she has authored and her pension from Parliament.

82,2020/03/04,Centre working on exclusive body for river-linking projects,"National Interlinking of Rivers Authority will oversee projects, generate funds

The Central government is working on the establishment of an exclusive body to implement projects for linking rivers.

To be called the National Interlinking of Rivers Authority (NIRA), the proposed body is expected to take up both inter-State and intra-State projects. It will also make arrangements for generating up funds, internally and externally.

Also read | The impact of the river linking project

An official of the National Water Development Agency (NWDA), which is responsible for the formulation of proposals of the linking of rivers, said an updated draft Cabinet note has been circulated to other Ministries in the Central government. On receipt of comments, the note will be finalised by the Ministry of Jal Shakti and sent to the Union Cabinet for approval.

‘No specific timeline’

The proposal for an apex body on river linking has been under discussion for the past 18 months. However, the official said that as of now, no specific timeline has been determined for the constitution of the Authority. Also, the earlier idea of framing a Bill, envisaging the creation of the NIRA, is not being pursued now.

The subject of establishment of the Authority was discussed at the last meeting of the Special Committee on Inter-Linking of Rivers (ILR) last week in New Delhi. Headed by Union Minister of Jal Shakti Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, the panel includes Irrigation or Water Resources Ministers and Secretaries of States. Since its formation, the Committee has held 17 meetings.

It is being assisted by a Task Force for ILR, which is a committee of experts essentially drawn from the Jal Shakti Ministry, Central Water Commission and the NWDA.

A Tamil Nadu government official said the Centre has not yet shared with States details regarding the new body though it has conveyed to them that it is planning to have an implementation agency for ILR projects.

Once approved, the projects will be pursued as national projects, wherein the Centre will absorb 90% of the cost and the States concerned the rest.

He said being home to an important naval establishment, they would wish to explore collaborations in defence technologies. Visakhapatnam is among 12 cities in India identified by Canada as having potential for heavy investments in various areas.

“We are very strong on the technology front, clean fuel, dairy, IT and communications. This is only a beginning of our ties with the city and we hope to have more interactive programmes to explore opportunities of mutual interest in future,” he said.

Mr. Borle, who looks after science, technology and innovation, said Visakhapatnam being the ninth richest city in India with a GDP growth $150 billion, has a bright future.

‘Student-friendly ambience’

“Visakhapatnam is also a port city which renders it favourable for driving businesses from across the country and around the world. Fishing and various heavy industries like petroleum, steel plants, etc. have flourished in the city as a result. Subsequently, industries involving heavy machineries generate a lot of toxic residue and our vision and leadership in clean technology coupled with Visakhapatnam’s industrial acumen has the potential to culminate into a cleaner and enhanced industrial blueprint for the future.”

Mr. Borle said as many as 1.9 million people of Indian origin had settled down in Canada, accounting for 6% of its total population. The number of Indian students had increased to 2,00000, he said adding Canada had turned into a favourite destination for higher education for many Indian students due to conducive climate, employment opportunities and affordable living conditions.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dzrxjp/article30982074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05VJPAGE5CONSUL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/canada-identifies-vizag-as-key-city-for-investments/article30982075.ece
90,2020/03/04,Largest walkathon for industrial safety in Sri City sets a record,"All units in the industrial hub completed a decade of zero accident operations by December 2019

Sri City, the largest functional industrial hub in the State, found a place in the India Book of Records for conducting, what is believed to be the largest walkathon, laying stress on industrial safety.

Attended by a whopping 5,867 participants - ranging from senior managers to workers representing the industry - the event on Wednesday was conducted by Sri City management, in association with HR Forum, the various industrial units and the State government, stressing upon the importance of industrial safety. In over a decade of its formation, Sri City had not registered a single incident wherein compromise of industrial safety led to fatalities.

In unison

Much before the day broke, the participants gathered in rows and blocks, as is the norm stipulated by the record feat organisers. At 7, Sri City Founder and Managing Director Ravindra Sannareddy, Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories Sivakumar Reddy, Development Commissioner Muthu Raj and Deputy Superintendent of Police B.H. Vimala Kumari waved the flag in unison, signalling the start of the walkathon.

The participants carried placards and shouted slogans on safety, drawing the attention of those in the workplace. At the end of the walkathon that covered a distance of 4 km, Vivek Nair, jury from the India Book of Records, declared it the largest rally for industrial safety, breaking the previous record with 4,000 participants covering a distance of 3 km. Mr. Sannareddy expressed overwhelming delight at so many participants coming together for a cause.

“All Sri City units deserve a pat for completing a decade of zero accident operations by Dec 2019”, said Mr. Sivakumar Reddy.

91,2020/03/04,Naidu urges CM Jagan to file a SLP in SC over 34% BC quota in local body polls,"Assures that TDP would support such a move

Telugu Desam Party (TDP) president Nara Chandrababu Naidu has urged Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy to file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court to reinstate the 34 per cent quota for Backward Classes (BCs) in the local body polls and assured that the TDP would support such a move.

In a letter addressed to the CM ahead of the Budget Session, Mr. Naidu said as per the AP Panchayat Raj Act 1994, section 15, clause 2, BCs have been provided 34 per cent reservation in Sarpanch posts, 34 per cent in Mandal Parishads under section 152, Clause 1 (A), 34 per cent in ZPTCs under section 180, clause 1 (A).

Flays State for not contesting SC decision

“The provision of 34 per cent reservations to BCs has helped many BC leaders to achieve social and political advancement. Further, the Supreme Court has upheld the then State Government’s decision to have 60.55 per cent reservations for BCs in 2013-14. We condemn the decision of the State Government not to contest the decision of Supreme Court scrapping the 34 per cent reservation and going ahead with 24 per cent quota for BCs. We also oppose the move to take an unilateral decision without consulting the BC groups and opposition parties,” Mr. Naidu said.

Against this backdrop, “We urge the State Government to file a SLP immediately in the Supreme Court,’’ said Mr. Naidu.

95,2020/03/04,‘No reduction in number of bank branches in Kadapa’,"Besides 380 outlets, there are 724 business correspondents in the district: Union Minister

There is no reduction in the number of bank branches in Kadapa, an Aspirational District, Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur informed the Rajya Sabha on Tuesday.

Answering an unstarred question raised by YSRC Parliamentary Party Leader V. Vijaya Sai Reddy, the Union Minister said that banking outlets were one of the key pillars for interventions related to financial inclusion.

The RBI had granted general permission to domestic scheduled commercial banks (excluding regional rural banks) to open outlets, that is, fixed point service delivery units, manned by either bank staff or its business correspondents (BCs) at any place in the country without seeking prior approval, subject to a few conditions. The Union Minister informed that the number of bank branches in Kadapa district fell from 378 in 2017 to 373 in 2018, and again increased to 380 in 2019. “So, there is no reduction of numbers now,” he added.

Quoting figures given by the SLBC convener, the Minister said that besides the 380 branches, there were 724 BCs extending services to the public in the district.

In a novel initiative, the police department decided to reach out to the orphaned and destitute people living on the streets and provide them shelter and a decent living.

After two similar initiatives, Superintendent of Police (Tirupati Urban) A. Ramesh Reddy once again went out on a walk to reach out to the footpath dwellers in front of SVR Ruia Government General Hospital and interacted with them on Tuesday.

On finding out that many of them had either been thrown out or parted ways from their family members, the police roped in Amma Vodi Seva Sangham, a voluntary organisation, to get their heads and beards shaven and also gave them a bath. New clothing and food was provided to them on the spot.

“Nobody is an orphan by birth, it is the circumstance that makes one so,” Mr. Reddy said, urging the denizens to reach out to such destitute people in their midst. “We could be one of them in future, if we do not spread human values,” he said.

On the news being spread like wild fire in the social media about NCOV, Mr. Reddy paid a visit to the Ruia hospital for studying the ground situation.

103,2020/03/04,Two detained after PU paper becomes public in Karnataka,"The II PU physics question paper going viral on social media, an hour after the exam commenced from Shanteshwara College in Indi taluk on Wednesday, made the district administration and the police swing into action, resulting in the detention of a student and a person who took a photograph of the question paper, while the exam was ongoing, and circulated it.

However, since the paper was circulated after the commencement of the examination, the Department of Pre-University Education has ruled out a paper leak. The administration has also issued a direction to suspend the supervisor on the charge of dereliction of duty.

As the issue became viral, Deputy Commissioner of Vijayapura Y.S. Patil and Superintendent of Police Anupam Agarwal rushed to Shanteshwara College for further inquiry. Mr. Patil said the incident could not be treated as a paper leak. “Since the paper became public about an hour after the exam began, it is not considered a paper leak. Therefore, re-examination will not be held,” he said.

Confirming that they had received instructions from the Primary and Secondary Education Minister himself to take necessary action on the incident, Mr. Patil told presspersons that they found out that Murugendra Hiremath, a student, and Bageppa Sagar, who took the photograph of the question paper, were involved in the act. Consequently, they were detained.

Suspension

Elaborating on the incident at a joint press conference with Mr. Agarwal, Mr. Patil said that Mr. Sagar had jumped the compound wall of the college to reach the exam hall, where Mr. Hiremath was writing the exam. “He asked the student to hold the question paper for taking pictures, which he later circulated,” he said. He said that since the exam supervisor, M.D. Narayankar, was also found guilty of dereliction of duty, the college authorities have been instructed to suspend her.

“During the exam, malpractice was noticed and seven students were debarred in the same institution and 13 were warned,” he said.

Mr. Agarwal said that the two persons, who have been detained, were being questioned further. The accused have been booked under Section 24(A)(examination malpractice) of the Karnataka Education Act, he said.

105,2020/03/04,Congress MPs walk out of meeting on Kannada,"They object to RSS reference in memorandum on plans to promote the language

Congress MPs from Karnataka on Wednesday walked out of a meeting of the Kannada Development Authority (KDA), objecting to a RSS resolution mentioned in a memorandum submitted to the Union government.

The KDA prepared the memorandum on the State government’s key proposals to promote Kannada in education and employment. The meeting was organised at Union Minister D. V. Sadananda Gowda’s residence. It was attended by MPs of both the BJP and the Congress from Karnataka. Union Minister Suresh Angadi, also from Karnataka, was present.

Rajeev Gowda, a Congress member of the Rajya Sabha, said his party was upset at the use of a private organisation as a reference in the memorandum. “The entire memorandum has the reference of official documents supporting each proposal, but one document, related to a RSS resolution, was not required at all,” he said.

The resolution was adopted by the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha of the RSS in March 2018. It says primary education should be in Indian languages alone.

The Congress members put forth their objections, but no convincing response was given by KDA chairman T.S. Nagabharana.

“The KDA had never referred to any private organisation earlier. There are many organisations working for the protection and promotion of Kannada. The RSS works for promoting Hindi and Sanskrit. This shows the intention of the government,” former KDA chairman Hanumanthaiah said.

Mr. Gowda said the KDA and the Ministers agreed that the two pages would be removed from the memorandum, but the Congress MPs walked out as a mark of protest.

The KDA, however, defended the inclusion of the RSS resolution, pointing out that it called for promoting all Indian languages.

Mr. Nagabharana said the content of the resolution was about the “need to protect and promote Indian languages” and there was nothing wrong in using it as a reference. “English may be a working language, but the State languages and the mother tongue need to be promoted in order to protect our culture and tradition,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/congress-mps-walk-out-of-meeting-in-new-delhi/article30984946.ece
106,2020/03/04,I am baffled by personal attack and saddened by BSY’s silence: Doreswamy,"""The Constitution gives every citizen the right to criticize the government,"" he says

Freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy has been the target of attacks from several BJP leaders over the past week, starting with former Union Minister Basanagounda Patil Yatnal, who called him a “fake freedom fighter” who behaved like a “Pakistan agent.” Despite demands from the Opposition, the BJP leader has refused to apologise for his comments.

The Hindu caught up with Mr. Doreswamy to solicit his views on the furore. Excerpts from the interview:

You have been the target of several BJP leaders in the past week. How do you respond?

I am baffled as to why suddenly I have become the target of such a vicious personal attack, questioning my work and commitment of the last several decades. They are trying to paint me as an offender, but I am at a loss to understand my offence. I am more deeply saddened by the silence of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa. He knows me very well over the past several decades and is a senior person in public life in the State, and yet he has been silent.

Why do you think you are being attacked?

I don’t know the answer to that question. But I see this attack as part of a larger design to discredit and attack any critique of this regime. Many people have suffered far worse, being jailed or even killed. As far as I am concerned, [my] taking an active role in the recent anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in the State may have been a trigger... Some BJP leaders have pointed out that I once gave a call to “finish Modi”. I was speaking to the media on the eve of the 2018 Assembly elections in the State, and my call was to defeat Modi. Colloquially, finish does not only mean kill. I accept that the choice of word could have been better, but anyone who knows me will know that I never am a votary for violence. As regards to calling V.D. Savarkar a “coward”, I even today wonder why a revolutionary leader like him apologised to the British and later stayed away from the national movement.

You have even been called anti-national.

We need to differentiate between the government, the State, and the nation. The Constitution gives every citizen the right to criticize the government. I have definitely opposed the policies of this regime and have called for its defeat, and I will continue to do so. A few BJP leaders have been calling me anti-national since I shared the stage with the young leaders Kanhaiya Kumar, Umar Khalid and others. I see them as youth fighting for the future of this country.

Several BJP leaders have accused you of being partisan and anti-BJP, and said that your criticism of the incumbent regime stems from an ideological bias.

It is true that I am ideologically opposed to the BJP and I believe there can be no compromise on secularism and pluralism. But beyond our ideological differences, I have had many friends in RSS-BJP and had cordial relations with them. They know what my ideology is and I know theirs. But this is what they are destroying now, leading to extreme polarisation of society. Opposition in a democracy also needs to be civil.

However, I have not been partisan. Post-Independence, I distanced myself from the Congress too. When Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency in 1975, I wrote a letter to her saying the British were more magnanimous than her. I called her a dictator and was arrested as a result. Since then, whenever I have felt the government has erred, I have spoken out, participated in Gandhian democratic struggles. I was part of the India Against Corruption movement when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was in power. I also led several movements when Siddaramaiah and H.D. Kumaraswamy were Chief Ministers of the state.

107,2020/03/04,Historic convocation likely by April-end,"The centenary convocation of the University of Mysore is expected to be held by April-end.

Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar is waiting for the Parliament budget session to conclude to meet the officials at the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) to confirm dates as the university had extended an invitation to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be the chief guest and deliver the convocation address. The budget session will last till April 3.

The University has been waiting for a word from the PMO on the dates. There have been instances of convocations held even in May. The university is expected to take its decision based on the reply from the PMO.

The VC had met the PM last year to request him to participate in the centenary convocation and presented a coffee table book on the 100 years of the university.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/historic-convocation-likely-by-april-end/article30984338.ece
108,2020/03/04,UoM’s 100th convocation: gold medals to have ‘special’ engraving,"Logo designed by Pramoda Devi Wadiyar to be embossed on one side of the medals

It’s going to a proud moment for those receiving their degrees and gold medals at the 100th convocation of the University of Mysore this year. For, the medals to be presented will have the engraving of the centenary logo specially designed by Pramoda Devi Wadiyar of the erstwhile royal family. The university had requested Ms. Wadiyar, a designer by passion, to craft the logo suiting the historic moment and the glorious past of the university.

The logo was unveiled recently at the Crawford Hall, setting the ball rolling for the big occasion. The university has resolved to get an engraving of the logo done on each medal (on one side).

The certificates given to the students will also have the centenary convocation logo printed on them in addition to the university logo. The logo has been designed with the university motto ‘Nahi Jnanena Sadrusham’ and a graduation cap. The logo says ‘Shathamanada Gatikotsava 1920-2020’, with the first convocation held in 1920.

Incidentally, Ms. Wadiyar had designed the logo for the centenary celebrations of the university which took place in 2016.

Vice-Chancellor G. Hemantha Kumar told The Hindu: “The medals will be special this year as they shall have the bold imprint of the centenary convocation logo. This will be different from the engraving on the medals that had been presented in the earlier years with the embossed logo of the university.”

One side of the medal will have the logo and other side will have details such as name of the student, course and the name of the medal (on whose name it has been instituted).

A series of programmes had been planned throughout 2020 for commemorating the significant convocation as the occasion is reckoned to be a milestone with only a few universities in the country reaching this phase.

Prof. Kumar said the details on the lecture series proposed for the occasion will be announced soon and lectures will go on till the end of this year.

The university is finalising the names of the academicians and scientists who are going to be invited to deliver lectures at the “100th convocation lecture series”.

The University has also proposed to honour the vice-chancellors produced by it. Many from this university had held the VC’s post of other universities and they would be felicitated in recognition of their services.

The VC said an Open Day of the Manasagangotri campus has been planned in November this year. The people of Mysuru, especially schoolchildren and college students, can visit any of the labs/departments to know more about the university.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/88463h/article30984285.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MYSLOGO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uoms-100th-convocation-gold-medals-to-have-special-engraving/article30984286.ece
109,2020/03/04,COVID-19: Two from Kodagu are in good health,"Both had returned from China recently and are under home-quarantine as a precautionary measure

The Kodagu health authorities on Wednesday clarified that the two persons from Kodagu who had returned from China recently had been asymptomatic and showing no symptoms of Covid-19 (2019 novel Coronavirus). They are under home-quarantine since over 20 days after their return.

While refusing to divulge details on the persons, Kodagu District Health Officer Mohan said the two persons were under constant observation since their return and both have cleared the incubation period for the disease without any symptoms.

“Our health teams are monitoring them and both are doing fine till date. Both need not require any treatment.”

Dr. Mohan said the two persons, who are supposed to continue to remain in the quarantine for another week as a precaution, had been asked to inform the Health Department in case they had to go out on some emergency. “If they go out of town, the respective health teams in that respective place would be asked to monitor them,” the DHO added.

In Mandya

Five COVID-19 isolation wards with all emergency facilities have been kept ready at Mandya Institute of Medical Sciences (MIMS) hospital to handle the virus cases, Additional Deputy Commissioner T. Yogesh has said. He convened a meeting with the officials of Health and other departments concerned at his office here on Wednesday.

The Department of Health and Family Welfare and other departments should take measures to educate the people pertaining to COVID-19. The authorities concerned should distribute pamphlets and other publicity materials, and conduct public meetings in rural areas to educate the people, Mr. Yogesh said.

District vigilance officer B.S. Balakrishna, MIMS superintendent M.R. Harish and others were present.

In Shivamogga

Deputy Commissioner K.B. Sivakumar has said that precautions have been taken in the district to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19. Speaking at a meeting held on Wednesday to review the preparations to contain the possible spread of the disease, he said that no positive case has been reported in the district so far. He warned of stern action against persons who spread false information on the disease.

He said that persons from the district who had recently visited the countries where positive cases have been reported have been kept under observation. If any person who has returned after a foreign visit is suffering from acute fever, cold and cough, medical treatment should be availed immediately, he said.

Mr. Sivakumar directed the officials of Public Instruction and Health and Family Welfare departments to conduct sessions in schools on the proper method of washing the hands and on maintaining personal hygiene.

Rajesh Suragihalli, District Health Officer, told the meeting that an exclusive isolation ward with six beds has been set up at McGann Hospital, a government hospital attached to Shivamogga Institute of Medical Sciences, to handle cases. An ample stock of medicines to treat the disease has also been maintained, he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kkm6zk/article30984265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MANDYAWARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-two-from-kodagu-are-in-good-health/article30984266.ece
110,2020/03/04,Secure building plan approval online,"Mysuru City Corporation gets ready for online payment of property tax from April 1

The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) on Wednesday eased the procedure of securing building plan approval which will be now done online.

The facility was launched by the Mayor, Tasneem, at the MCC office and the new system is expected to usher in more transparency and eliminate corruption. Once the documents are uploaded the building plan approval will be issued within a month, the authorities said.

The website to visit is www.mrc.gov.in which will open up the home page of Karnataka Municipal Data Society wherein the user will have to click on the citizens’ online services.

Easier procedure

Gurudutt Hegde, Commissioner, MCC, said the facility has eased the procedure to apply and procure the licence for the end-user but there is no substitute to physical verification etc., which will be conducted by the officials.

The MCC is also bracing for online payment of property tax from April 1 and almost 60 per cent of the work pertaining to it was over. Mr. Hegde said the available property records are being digitised and they are confident of the online launch on April 1 which happens to be the beginning of the new financial year.

There are nearly 1.87 lakh properties in Mysuru the records of which have to be scanned and digitised. The MCC plans to go online with the existing records and submissions made by the property owners under the SAS (Self-Assessment Scheme) system. In the second phase, a fresh property survey will be undertaken to check the veracity of the claims made by the property owners with respect to the quality of the construction. If there are differences they would be entered in the records and the difference amount would be incorporated in the property tax calculation.

Subsequently, the MCC will also go for geo-mapping of the property all of which will take nearly an year. “To start with we want to introduce the online property tax payment system for the benefit of the end user’’, said the MCC Commissioner.

The online system is in vogue in most city corporations and even smaller towns in the State but Mysuru was lagging behind and efforts to introduce the system did not bear fruit. Property tax is the single most important source of revenue for the MCC to provide civic amenities but it has fallen short of the revenue target. Going online and digitising property records is expected to bring more properties in the tax net and shore up MCC’s revenue.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2kxzl1/article30984224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MYSMCC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/secure-building-plan-approval-online/article30984225.ece
111,2020/03/04,Patil questions funds given to BJP workers,"Questioning the government over sanctioning of funds in the name of BJP workers and officebearers by the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, Leader of Opposition in the Council S.R. Patil on Wednesday accused the department of irregularities in allocation of ₹223 crore for flood relief.

Pointing at the funds allocated in the name of Yadgir BJP secretary, Raitha Morcha leader and other party workers, the Congress leader said if the funds had been allocated to a legislator or members of zilla panchayat or taluk panchayat, it would not have created problem. “Funds have been allotted to former legislators R. Shankar and H. Vishwanath (who shifted to the BJP recently),” he said. Mr. Patil said that he had written to the Chief Secretary highlighting the issues and an inquiry had been ordered. “But the inquiry officer has not called me nor do I know the fate of the inquiry. Money has been misappropriated. We would have no problem if money was spent in the flood-affected areas.”

Replying to his allegation, Muzrai Minister and Leader of the House Srinivas Poojary said such disbursals have happened during the Congress regime too. “People ask for funds for development in their areas and funds are allocated. It does not mean the funds go to the individual. Due diligence is done.”

Googal trouble

If the search engine Google helps you navigate your road trips, its namesake, spelt as Googal, a village, has connectivity issues. The village in Devadurga taluk of Raichur is hard to reach as a stretch of the road connecting Devadurga and Googal, and Googal and Sankeshwarahala is in bad shape. Raising the issue in the council, Congress member Basavaraj Patil Itagi said he had raised the issue of bad roads connecting Googal several times over the last four years but to no avail. “Schoolchildren find it difficult to commute as craters have formed on the roads. PWD officials are not maintaining the road citing the tendering of work, which has not been taken up. Public Works Minister Govind Karjol, in his reply, said the earlier tender had been terminated and a fresh one has been invited. “Work will start soon,” he said.

‘Speak in Kannada or translate speech’

When BJP member Lehar Singh started reading his statement on Covid-19, Congress leaders, including Leader of the Opposition S.R. Patil and former Minister H.M. Revanna, took objection to it. “Some of us on this side cannot understand English. Either he should speak in Kannada or arrangement should be made to translate the speech into Kannada. He (Mr. Singh) has been with us for long, he should speak in Kannada,” Mr. Patil said. Chairman Prathap Chandra Shetty enquired with Mr. Singh whether he knew Kannada. Responding to the chairman, Mr. Singh said he can speak Kannada and proceeded to speak in the language.

Documentary on Constitution

Chairman of Legislative Council Prathap chandra Shetty, in his opening remarks on the discussion on the Constitution, said work on the Kannada translation of the 10-episode documentary made by Shyam Benegal on the making of Constitution, is close to completion. Mr. Benegal’s work was commissioned by the Rajya Sabha. The work on translation started during the 60th year of Legislature here. “We will finish the translation soon and I want to create an opportunity for all legislators and students to watch the episodes. It’s an easier way to understand the Constitution, which is the basis of our democracy,” Mr. Shetty added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/patil-questions-funds-given-to-bjp-workers/article30984102.ece
112,2020/03/04,Safari at Kabini backwaters is just a click away,"Forest Department launches online booking facility on Nagarahole Tiger Reserve website

The hassle of booking a safari at the Kabini backwaters from Damanakatte is a thing of the past. For, the Forest Department has launched the online booking facility on the Nagarahole Tiger Reserve website (www.nagaraholetigerreserve.com).

Though the online booking facility was in vogue since the last few weeks, authorities said it was a soft launch more like a trial to secure feedback on the ease of navigating and to iron out any technical glitches.

Mahesh Kumar, Director, Nagarahole Tiger Reserve, said initially there were some complaints pertaining to payment gateway with errors reflected while making online payment.

“The technical team working on the site has informed us that the glitches have been rectified. But we want to ensure that the errors do not crop up again and the visitors have a hassle-free experience in getting their safari or room bookings confirmed. So we will continue to take feedback for some more time,” said Mahesh Kumar.

On logging into the official website, the visitor has to navigate to the booking section and provide relevant details as sought in the drop-down menu. The date and timings of the safari has to be selected before confirming the same and making the payment. The same document number as entered on the website during online booking has to be produced at the time of actual safari.

While a few more technical glitches could emerge before they are ironed out, the online facility has come as a relief to wildlife enthusiasts and tourists. In the absence of such a facility all these years, the only option left was to drive to H.D. Kote and take the road leading to Antharsanthe and wait for the early morning safari that starts at 6 a.m. This meant that the tourists had to leave Mysuru by 4.30 a.m. And if one were to be unlucky and there was a rush, which is normally the case, then one had to wait for the 3 p.m. safari and stand in queue again in the afternoon.

Complaints

But there were also complaints of irregularities in safari booking – especially in the Kabini backwaters – and the allegation was that the private resorts would block the seats depriving walk-in tourists of a chance. With limited vehicles, the local staff would be at their wits end to cope with the rush. The online booking facility is expected to make reservations more transparent.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9jpzug/article30983962.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGKABINISAFARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/safari-at-kabini-backwaters-is-just-a-click-away/article30983963.ece

115,2020/03/04,Celebrating the power of women,"‘Power Walk’ held as part of Women’s Day celebrations

Around 350 railway employees participated in the ‘Power Walk’, which was organised by the Hubballi division of South Western Railway (SWR) on Wednesday as part of the forthcoming International Women’s Day.

Women bike riders and cyclists, officers, staff, schoolchildren, and Scouts and Guides participated in the walk.

The participants raised slogans on women empowerment and capabilities of women.

Congratulating women on the occasion, Mr. Malkhede said that in Indian Railways, a campaign on International Women’s Day was being observed from March 1 to 10.

The theme for the current year was “Each for equal”, which signified that collectively each one of us could help create a gender equal world, he said.

“Indian society has high respect towards women. They are working on a par with men. In Hubballi division, around 69 women are working as track women. Women are also working in carriage and wagon workshop and are doing maintenance works efficiently. They are contributing to the progress of this nation,” he said.

116,2020/03/04,‘We want to be worthy of the uniform we wear’,"First batch of women recruits to the Army talks about their 61-week rigorous training and determination to be the best

Young women in khaki uniforms and bright red caps march proudly in a straight line oblivious to the scorching heat at the CMP Centre and School in Bengaluru.

These young women have been recruited as the first female soldiers who will be inducted into the Army in April 2021 after undergoing a rigorous 61-week training. There are 100 recruits — aged between 17 and 21 — who will be part of the Corps of Military Police. While many have convinced their families to allow them into this traditional male bastion, there are some who come from a military background and are following in the footsteps of their fathers.

Ahead of International Women’s Day on March 8, the Army opened it doors to the media to interact with the new recruits.

Bheemakka M. Chavhan, 19, from Madikoppa village, Dharwad district, whose parents are daily wage workers, said that her entire village got together to felicitate her before she came here for training. She dropped out of a B.Com course and has no regrets. “Within weeks, I have learned about the importance of discipline, punctuality, and how to optimise every minute,” she said.

Just seven weeks into their training, the recruits know better than to let their guard down. They hold their heads high and shoulders upright after completing marching.

Anitha K., 21, from Tamil Nadu is aware of the importance of being in the first batch of female recruits. “We are the ones who shoulder the responsibility of being a good example for the next few batches,” she said.

The 61-week programme is similar to that of their male counterparts and includes basic military, weapons, maintenance and signals training, among others. They also have to undergo a gender sensitisation programme.

Prashantha M.S., an instructor for the drill square test practice, said that the female recruits grasp concepts more quickly than men. “The morale among the first batch of female trainees is very high,” he said.

Eighteen-year-old Pooja from Bhiwani district in Haryana, who dropped out of a B.Sc. course, said that it took a lot of convincing before her family, especially father, to allow her to join the Army. “I have watched films set in the nation’s border districts and have been awe of those who serve in the Army. I hope that one day I will make my country proud from the front line,” she said.

When asked what has changed since the time she got into training, Pooja instantly points to her hair: “I had hair till my waist. I cried when I had to cut it but now I’m glad I did as it would have been difficult to manage.” Some like Deepika from Haryana have taken inspiration to join the Army from within the family. Her father is a retired Army personnel. As she reassembles her gun, she said: “Every day we are trying to make ourselves worthy of the uniform we wear.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/90pg3i/article30983917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGARMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/we-want-to-be-worthy-of-the-uniform-we-wear/article30983919.ece
117,2020/03/04,Cong. withdraws from protest after meeting Vala,"A Congress delegation led by Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah called on Governor Vajubhai R. Vala at Raj Bhavan and urged him to initiate expulsion of BJP member Basanagouda Patil Yatnal from the Assembly for his “misconduct by issuing a statement showing utter disrespect and disregard to freedom struggle and freedom fighters”, particularly H.S. Doreswamy.

The letter pointed out that on Tuesday, Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri had rejected the Congress’ notice seeking permission to discuss the statement made by the BJP MLA. This was a reversal of the earlier stand that a discussion would be allowed if a notice was given, the letter stated, adding that they were therefore approaching the Governor who is a Constitutional authority.

After this submission, the Congress on Wednesday withdrew its protest and participated in the debate on Constitution of India. The last two days saw protests and impasse in the Assembly over Mr. Yatnal’s controversial remarks.

Doreswamy by BJP spokesperson and MLC N. Ravi Kumar to the Ethics Committee headed by the deputy chairman.

Following this, the Opposition members, who had continued dharna in the well of House demanding an apology from Mr. Kumar, withdrew their protest.

Earlier, although Mr. Kumar was given an opportunity to clarify his stand and apologise for his remark that Mr. Doreswamy should be “ashamed of his views on Prime Minister Narendra Modi”, he insisted that he would not apologise “to a person who had called V.D. Savarkar a coward”.

At this point, Opposition leader S.R. Patil submitted his plea seeking that the issue be referred to the Ethics Committee of the House. “I will examine the issue and consider referring it to the Ethics Committee,” Mr. Shetty said in response.

Opposing the chairman’s decision, BJP leader Kota Srinivas Poojary insisted that the issue should not be referred to the committee. He was seconded by other BJP members.

119,2020/03/04,Talk of changing Constitution is meaningless: CM,"‘It is elaborate, flexible and has solutions to problems that arise in day-to-day life’

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Wednesday expressed a strong view against those seeking to change the Constitution of the country.

Participating in the debate on Constitution in the Legislative Assembly, he said: “The talk of changing the Constitution is meaningless. It’s not possible for anyone to change this great book.” He reiterated that the Constitution is supreme.

The debate resumed in the Assembly after two days of impasse over the controversial remarks of BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal on freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy.

‘Distinct, flexible’

Mr. Yediyurappa said: “The Indian Constitution is very distinct as it is elaborate, flexible and has solutions to problems that arise in day-to-day life. It has also shown us the way in times of crisis.” Substantiating his view, he said India had never faced a situation like the U.S. had in 2000 when the country did not have clarity on the counting of votes for Presidential polls.

Mr. Yediyurappa also used the occasion to argue that the ongoing protests over CAA and NRC in different parts of the country were unwarranted. “Those opposing CAA should know that the legislation has got the endorsement of Parliament.”

On each other’s toes

Earlier in the day, members of the ruling and Opposition parties said that three organs of the government — Legislature, Executive and Judiciary — had not lived up to the spirit of the Constitution as they had encroached the powers of each other.

After Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri delivered his 40-page address on “Our Constitution, Our Pride” in the House on Tuesday amidst a protest by the Opposition Congress, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy on Wednesday initiated the debate and said the legislature has failed to meet the expectations of the people as legislators’ “greed for power, money and authority” had increased over the years. “We are losing respect and reputation bestowed by the Constitution,” he said.

The three organs of the government want to become executing authorities without understanding the powers and responsibilities given by the Constitution. “Have we done our job as legislators?” Mr. Madhuswamy asked.

The country has not been able to realise Mahatma Gandhi’s dream of transforming Indian villages as Gram Swaraj and villagers have been treated as second-class citizens, the Minister said.

Expensive elections

H.K. Patil of the Congress said the level of corruption had increased owing to high expenditure in elections. “About 63% of the people get their work done in the government offices by paying bribes,” he said. The governments has declined to undertake electoral reforms to crackdown electoral malpractices, he said.

The governments, irrespective of parties, have blatantly misused anti-corruption bodies such as Central Bureau of Investigation and Income Tax department for political advantages, he added.

M.P. Rajiv of the BJP recalled the history of the Indian Constitution making and said he had distributed 40,000 copies of the Preamble of the Constitution to students of his Kudachi constituency.

During the debate, Priayank Kharge and Ramesh Kumar from the Congress, Bandeppa Kashempur and K.L.

121,2020/03/04,"Ahead of State Budget, Bagalkot has two demands","With Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa presenting the State Budget on Thursday, Bagalkot district has two major demands.

These are the allocation of adequate funds for the Upper Krishna Project (UKP) for relief and rehabilitation of people losing land after the increase in the height of the Almatti dam, and adequate funds for improving tourism in the district.

After the decision of the government to increase the height of the Almatti dam from 519 to 524 metres under the third phase of the UKP, nearly 19 villages of Bagalkot district are expected to get submerged into the Krishna backwaters.

These people have been demanding compensation for their land and rehabilitation of their villages.

Chief Minister, B.S. Yediyurappa himself had announced of earmarking ₹20,000 crore in the budget for UPK.

Since Bagalkot has some of the best known ancient monuments built during the Chalukyan era, it has been a pending demand for allocating funds to improve the tourism sector.

In the last budget, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy announced ₹25 crore for the development of Badami, the constituency represented by former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah.

While these are two major demands, the announcements of the previous budget have also not taken shape till date. For instance, the government announced a government medical college in Bagalkot, but till date, no development taken place in this regard.

In the last budget, Mr. Kumaraswamy had announced ₹300 crore Kerur lift irrigation project, but even this project is limping, according to sources.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ahead-of-state-budget-bagalkot-has-two-demands/article30982133.ece

129,2020/03/04,FASTag collection stays at 41%,"Motorists reluctant to switch over to prepaid toll despite campaigns

Toll collection through FASTag at the Pampampallam, Ponnarimangalam, Paliyekkara and Kumbalam toll plazas in the State under the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) is only 41% despite efforts to popularise the prepaid tags among motorists.

Reluctance on the part of motorists to switch over to the automatic toll payment system has come in for surprise as vehicles without FASTags are charged twice the normal rate at these toll gates. Also, those returning within 24 hours have to pay only one-and-a-half times the toll for two-way journey if the payment is via FASTag. A reason cited by motorists is that they are not frequent travellers in these routes.

The exemptions granted by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to the Paliyekkara toll plaza in Thrissur and the Kumbalam toll plaza in Ernakulam will end on March 14.

“We are expecting 75% compliance in the next two months,” a top NHAI official told The Hindu.

Invalid tags due to failure to activate them, blacklisted tags due to lack of money in the bank account and ignorance among motorists on how to fix the tags are cited as the other reasons for the low compliance level.

Mandatory

Although FASTag has been made mandatory for both private and commercial four-wheelers since December 2017, during inspections authorities check only if the tag is pasted and not if they are activated. A vehicle with an inactivated tag gets blacklisted once it enters the toll plaza and leads to traffic snarls. FASTags are also blacklisted if the linked bank account/prepaid wallet does not have enough balance.

Only the customer care wing of the bank in which the account is maintained can help solve the issue. Removal of the blacklisted tag is time consuming. Erring vehicles are allowed to move along the toll plaza after collecting the toll in cash.

Varying rates

Though the FASTag costs only ₹25, different banks charge different rates for issuing the tag, as refundable security deposit and for first recharge, creating hurdles in the switch to the tag.

An activated FASTtag works on the Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, sources said. The tag should be fixed on the windscreen on the back of the rear view mirror.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/u2yf6m/article30985003.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tv-toll-plazacol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fastag-collection-stays-at-41/article30985004.ece

The district administration has come up with a special service to make this examination season tension-free for students and parents.

With board examinations being around the corner, student councillors and agencies such as Chidline have a tough time dealing with the calls from overstressed students and parents. Many parents opt to take leave from their jobs for providing moral support to their children. But students say that their round-the-clock monitoring only adds to the pressure.

Take short breaks

Students are told to control the use of television and the Internet. Be attentive and systematic. Prepare notes on important points. Take short breaks and sleep well. Avoid unhealthy entertainment. Avoid food that is tough to digest. Add vegetables and fruits in the diet. Drink lots of water. Take medical support in case of any illness.

Parents should be careful in ensuring proper food habits, drinking water, and rest for children. They should prepare examination kits with hall ticket and pen box.

Parents should not exert pressure on children. Never compare them with other children. Motivate them and improve their confidence.

Never intimidate them about consequences if they get low marks.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vientu/article30984919.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tv-exam-stresscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ensuring-stress-free-exam-time/article30984920.ece
132,2020/03/04,Kerala Oppn. demands steps to tackle potential drought,"Measures to conserve water and dig wells, says Minister

The opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) on Wednesday demanded urgent measures for tackling a potential drought situation in the State during the summer. Raising the issue in the Assembly during the Question Hour, UDF MLAs also wanted the Government to urgently settle pending bills of Kerala Water Authority (KWA) contractors who have refused to carry out work.

Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty said storage in the Irrigation Department dams were higher compared to last year. He added that his Department has initiated measures to settle the pending bills.

Rise in temperature

In a written reply to a related question, the Minister quoted an IMD advisory which warned that the day temperatures in Kerala could rise by 0.5 to one degree celsius during March and April.

Steps have been taken to conserve water, dig well and repair pump sets in KWA plants ahead of the summer, the Minister said. To ensure water availability during the summer months, the Water Resources Department has also completed the construction of 30 temporary check dams across the State, the Minister said.

In order to address the water shortage in Ernakulam district, the department has given administrative sanction for works worth ₹80 lakh for establishing tanker water vending points, he said. While a rise in temperature could exacerbate a drought, the State can overcome it if it gets adequate summer rainfall, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-oppn-demands-steps-to-tackle-potential-drought/article30984777.ece
133,2020/03/04,A prescription for curbing sale of spurious Ayurvedic drugs,"Demand for regulatory mechanism and licensing system

The demand to have a uniform regulatory mechanism and licensing system for the sale of Ayurvedic drugs has come up again in the wake of reports that substandard and adulterated products of manufacturers from outside the State are being distributed here through multilevel marketing.

A senior official in the office of the Deputy Drugs Controller (Ayurveda), Kerala, told The Hindu on Wednesday that a proposal had been sent to the Union Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy. The Deputy Drugs Controller is also the State-level authority to give licence to Ayurvedic drug manufacturers. The licences are given only if the drugs are made following the classical formulations as being described in Ayurveda texts or if they are patented or proprietary medicines.

Quality of drugs

The official, however, pointed out that the department was unable to either check the quality of the drugs being manufactured outside the State or take action against those companies.

Also, retail pharmacies need not get licence to sell Ayurvedic medicines right now as there is no mechanism to regulate around 25,000 such shops across the State.

M.M. Sanal Kumar, president of Kozhikode-based Kerala Ayurvedic Cooperative Society Ltd., claimed that there was no way to check if adulteration had happened either at the wholesale or retail level. “Ayurvedic drugs are coming in large numbers from States such as Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. Anyone can set up a shop to sell them if they have a licence from the respective local body and a Goods and Services Tax receipt,” he added. Though big companies such as Arya Vaidya Sala, Kottakkal, have a mechanism to pick their retail shops, small players do not have any such thing.

The Ayurveda drug inspectors need not check the quality of medicines being sold through shops as their mandatory duty is only to ensure quality at the manufacturing level. The official pointed out that they might resort to it only if there were complaints. As there are only seven drug inspectors all over the State, even that is unthinkable now, he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-prescription-for-curbing-sale-of-spurious-ayurvedic-drugs/article30984764.ece

137,2020/03/04,Tales from tea-seller couple’s journeys,"The 149-page book of the globe-trotting seniors will hit the stands soon

For them, globe-trotting is not an unaffordable luxury but a way of life well attainable with a little planning.

Known as the tea-seller couple, 70-year-old Vijayan and his 69-year-old wife Mohana, married nearly half-a-century ago, has visited 25 countries in the last 12 years.

And now they have chosen to share tales from all those memorable journeys in the book Chaaya Vittu Vijayanteyum Mohanayudeyum Loka Sancharangal, which is set to hit the stands later this month.

“We couldn't cover all the countries in the book but had to drop a few,” said Mr. Vijayan with a tinge of disappointment.

The idea of a book took root in the couple three years ago when they were invited to an event of a travel publication. Since writing was not their forte, having given up education quite early, they have chosen to get it written by someone else.

“The content for the book was narrated to the author in around 15 sessions spread over two months during which I shared the many sights etched in my memory about those journeys,” said Mr. Vijayan.

“The book is almost ready, just the photographs need to be sourced. We are looking at publishing it by month end,” said V.C. Thomas, publisher of the book. The book running into 149 pages will be priced at ₹199. The couple had been back from a trip to Australia and New Zealand only in November and have now chosen to take a break before planning the next trip.

Since they started their globe-trotting spree in 2007, the couple has been saving ₹300 a day from the proceeds of their tea shop near Salim Rajan Road.

That along with the contributions from benevolent people helped them undertake their dream journeys.

But now they have run up a debt of around ₹4 lakh and are determined to clear it. However, that does not mean that they have given up on their penchant for travelling.

Once those debts are cleared, they would be setting out yet again, with a trip to East European block firmly in their radar.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hykeci/article30984683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv05teasellerscou,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tales-from-tea-seller-couples-journeys/article30984678.ece
138,2020/03/04,Govt. aiding tax evasion in gold: Oppn.,"Isaac says he plans to place tax enforcers in jewellery shops to monitor sales

The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition on Wednesday blamed Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac for an estimated ₹2,700-crore shortfall in GST (Goods and Services Tax) revenue from the gold business.

UDF legislators, led by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, staged a walkout of the Assembly after accusing Dr. Isaac of having allowed big-time tax dodgers in the jewellery trade go scot-free even as State revenue collection dipped. Congress legislator V.D. Satheeshan sought leave of the House to discuss the ‘dubious hesitance’ on the part of State GST enforcers to collect tax from gold sellers. By a conservative estimate, the gold business in Kerala owes the treasury at least ₹3,000 crore annually. But the ‘tax defaulters’ have contributed less than ₹300 crore.

He said the government remained a mute witness as the tax evaders robbed the State of its due.

It rarely conducted searches, seized contraband gold or audited gold sales. The exponential increase in bullion price has not reflected in tax collection despite Kerala having the highest per capita spending on gold.

Isaac’s assurance

Dr. Isaac said he planned to place tax enforcers in jewellery shops to monitor sales to make a sample tax assessment. Tax enforcers have inspected 75 jewellery shops and are trying to make sense of their production and sales records, most of it hidden in cloud accounts, he said.

Many jewellers fraudulently claim input credit to evade GST. Kerala wants e-invoicing and e-way bills, not delivery challans, for gold transactions.

It has pressed its case in the GST Council, Dr. Isaac said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-aiding-tax-evasion-in-gold-oppn/article30984663.ece
139,2020/03/04,Cry for Plan B for mitigation of COVID-19,"State strengthens surveillance for containment of virus transmission amid new cases emerging in the country

As the number of COVID-19 cases steadily spikes in the country, Kerala has strengthened surveillance and monitoring in the fervent hope that containment of virus transmission is still possible if the State continues to screen and quarantine people aggressively as when the first three cases were reported in the State recently.

Public health experts, however, point out that the world has more or less accepted now that the containment of the virus is an illusion and that even while attempting containment aggressively, the State should have a Plan B which focusses on mitigation.

“We need not give up containment measures (intensive surveillance, identifying cases, quarantining people, etc). Mitigation would mean that we accept that the virus is unstoppable and that community spread is inevitable and hence do our best to mitigate its effect on people. We should be amping up infection control measures in hospitals, reviewing our capabilities and skills for providing critical care to people who might need it,” a public health specialist said.

“There might not be any evidence of ongoing community transmission till we suddenly find patient clusters as it happened in the Washington State in the U.S. Cases went undetected because most of the people would have had very mild or non-specific symptoms,” he pointed out.

Kerala might have been successful with its aggressive surveillance, arduous contact tracing and quarantine strategies in the initial phase when the threat perception was narrowed to people or travellers with some link to China. That situation has changed drastically now and at a time when the nation is waking up to the possibility of domestic spread of COVID-19, more attention should be paid to imposing upon people the importance of social distancing, avoiding unnecessary public gatherings and religious congregations and avoiding unnecessary travel, both within and outside the country.

China measures

“We cannot adapt the draconian measures that China might have taken in an attempt to contain or limit the transmission but what we can do is focus on educating the public that simple preventive measures can go a long way in reducing transmission.

Our advisories issued earlier to the general public still stand, but we need to reinforce the message on maintaining utmost respiratory hygiene, frequent hand-washing, avoiding unnecessary physical contact – touching one’s face, shaking hands and fist bumps, hugs, etc. – through an intense and very visual IEC (information, education, communication) campaign,” says R. Aravind, head of Infectious Diseases, Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram.

A 60-year-old commuter died and hundreds were left stranded for over five hours in the State capital on Wednesday when employees of the Kerala State Transport Corporation (KSRTC) went on a flash strike demanding release of three personnel of the transport undertaking taken into custody by the police.

Surendran, who was waiting at the East Fort bus station from 12 noon for proceeding to his house fainted and collapsed around 2.30 p.m. As traffic was blocked, the ambulance taking him to the General Hospital got delayed on the way. He was declared dead on arrival.

Hundreds of commuters, including those returning from hospitals, were put to hardship as the flash strike that began at the KSRTC’s East Fort bus station spread to Thampanoor and other depots crippling services.

The strike started after the Fort police took into custody KSRTC assistant transport officer N.K. Sam Lopez, inspector B. Rajendran and driver K. Suresh Kumar from East Fort. Mr. Lopez and others questioned the crew of private stage carriers operating in the Trikannapuram- Maruthurkadavau sector for devotees visiting the Attukal temple.

141,2020/03/04,Banking Bill sets alarm bells ringing for State coop. sector,"Centre aiming to wrest absolute control of cooperative banks

The Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill 2020 mooted by the Centre has set alarm bells ringing for the State’s cooperative sector that accounts for nearly 50% of the banking transactions in the national cooperative sector.

Banking sector sources told The Hindu that the Centre was aiming to wrest absolute control of Kerala’s cooperative banks ranging from primary cooperatives to the apex bank that have deposits of about ₹1 lakh crore and total transactions to nearly ₹2 lakh crore.

The cooperative banking sector is the pivot in disbursing social welfare pensions amounting to roughly about ₹8,000 crore annually and has made meaningful interventions in housing as well as a slew of other welfare schemes for the indigent and marginalised sections.

The welfare schemes and other such initiatives are being run on the strength of the functional autonomy being enjoyed by the sector. By bringing the sector under the tight leash of the Reserve Bank of India, it would have to seek the permission of the apex bank for continuing such schemes and exploring fresh pastures. This is feared to seriously debilitate the cooperative sector that has extensive reach all over the State.

The Bill seeks to constrict the functioning of societies and it would even impinge on the execution of the second phase of the housing scheme it implemented for those who have been rendered homeless in the flood. As many as 2,000 houses have been completed for ₹75 crore and the construction of 2,000 more houses is set to be launched soon.

The Central government bid to strip the income tax benefit being enjoyed by the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies and the move to impose a 2% tax at source on societies that have cash withdrawals more than ₹1 crore a year from banks have drawn flak.

Such moves are being construed as part of the political agenda of the Centre to bring the cooperative sector under its absolute control. This would give sufficient financial leeway for the Centre, but would deprive the State’s cooperative sector of the functional freedom to support the marginalised farmers, traders and such other sections, sources said.

Cooperation Minister Kadakampally Surendran has called a meeting of stakeholders on Thursday to explore the legal options for addressing the issue.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/banking-bill-sets-alarm-bells-ringing-for-state-coop-sector/article30983072.ece
142,2020/03/04,State needs Plan B for mitigation of COVID-19,"State strengthens surveillance and monitoring for containment of virus transmission

As the number of COVID-19 cases steadily spikes in the country, Kerala has strengthened surveillance and monitoring in the fervent hope that containment of virus transmission is still possible if the State continues to screen and quarantine people aggressively as when the first three cases were reported in the State recently.

Public health experts, however, point out that the world has more or less accepted now that the containment of the virus is an illusion and that even while attempting containment aggressively, the State should have a Plan B which focusses on mitigation.

“We need not give up containment measures (intensive surveillance, identifying cases, quarantining people, etc). Mitigation would mean that we accept that the virus is unstoppable and that community spread is inevitable and hence do our best to mitigate its effect on people. We should be amping up infection control measures in hospitals, reviewing our capabilities and skills for providing critical care to people who might need it,” a public health specialist said.

Lack of symptoms

“There might not be any evidence of ongoing community transmission till we suddenly find patient clusters as it happened in the Washington State in the U.S. Cases went undetected because most of the people would have had very mild or non-specific symptoms,” he pointed out.

Kerala might have been successful with its aggressive surveillance, arduous contact tracing and quarantine strategies in the initial phase when the threat perception was narrowed to people or travellers with some link to China. That situation has changed drastically now and at a time when the nation is waking up to the possibility of domestic spread of COVID-19, more attention should be paid to imposing upon people the importance of social distancing, avoiding unnecessary public gatherings and religious congregations and avoiding unnecessary travel, both within and outside the country.

China measures

“We cannot adapt the draconian measures that China might have taken in an attempt to contain or limit the transmission but what we can do is focus on educating the public that simple preventive measures can go a long way in reducing transmission. Our advisories issued earlier to the general public still stand, but we need to reinforce the message on maintaining utmost respiratory hygiene, frequent hand-washing, avoiding unnecessary physical contact – touching one’s face, shaking hands and fist bumps, hugs, etc. – through an intense and very visual IEC (information, education, communication) campaign,” says R. Aravind, head of Infectious Diseases, Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram.

Senior health officials are also worried that there could be a mass exodus of Keralites from West Asia and that as the population profile changes, imposing and ensuring proper home quarantine measures could prove to be tricky. Officials are also worried that there could be mass demand for testing, which might not be easily met.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-needs-plan-b-for-mitigation-of-covid-19/article30982997.ece
143,2020/03/04,"Back on home soil, Haridasan recounts tale of torture","Hairdresser was accused of theft and abused by his employer

After days of torture and suffering in an alien country, S. Haridasan finally reunited with his family at Pallippad, near Haripad, on Wednesday morning.

Being in confinement and not knowing if he would ever secure release, the father of two says he is happy to be back home.

Haridasan, 47, a hairdresser, went to Malaysia four years ago seeking better fortunes.

However, his world turned upside down on January 28, 2020 when the employer discovered some money in his bag.

Burns, bruises, and cuts — his body reveals a painful story of what happened at the hands of his employer.

The ordeal

Haridasan says he used to receive commission fee. “I put the amount received in the last eight months in a bag. After alleging the money was stolen by me, the owner began to hit me using a piece of wood. Once the log broke into pieces, he slapped me. They took away my mobile phone, passport, and bag,” he told The Hindu.

“It didn’t stop there,” Haridasan remembers as he was later taken to a secluded place and subjected to extreme physical and mental abuse for several days. “My employer threatened to kill me. He hit and prodded me continuously with a heated iron rod. I suffered burns all over my body. I begged him to spare me but to no avail. A couple of days later the odour of my putrescent flesh started to fill the room. I was given ointment and medicines four days after the initial trashing. For 18 days, I remained there without even being able to wear a dress,” he says.

After reaching home, he sought medical assistance at Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha. Doctors have advised him complete rest for two weeks.

Haridasan’s fate became known to the world after his wife, Rajasree, filed complaints with the Department of Non-Residents Keralites Affairs (NoRKA), and the police, among others.

Malayali associations

The authorities acted swiftly and contacted the Indian Embassy in Malaysia to help secure his early release. The family thanked the Malayali associations in Malaysia and authorities for intervening and bringing him back.

145,2020/03/04,State award for three women entrepreneurs,"Chief Minister to give away awards on March 7

Sruthi Shibulal, Poornima Indrajith, and Sheila James have been selected for the Outstanding Woman Entrepreneur of Kerala Award for 2020.

The three women have been selected for the honour in recognition of their prominent contributions in their chosen area that have inspired other women too, Minister for Women and Child Development K.K. Shylaja said here on Tuesday.

Women’s Day

Chief Minister Pinrayi Vijayan will give away the woman entreprenuer awards at the State-level launch of the International Women’s Day celebrations at the Nishagandhi auditorium in Thiruvananthapuram at 4 p.m. on March 7.

Shruti Shibulal is one of the few women to have entered the large-scale hospitality sector. The young entrepreneur has created a niche for herself with her Tamara Leisure Experiences Pvt. Ltd. She also has concerns in the State.

‘Save the loom’

Actor, television anchor, and entrepreneur, Poornima Indrajith’s Pranaah label garnered a lot of attention with her. During the recent floods, Ms. Poornima launched a collective, ‘Save the loom’, to support weavers hit by the disaster.

Sheila James was the trailblazer in the textile design arena three decades ago. Her Czarina Boutique has become the go-to place for generations of women in the State capital.

Ms. Shiela James has also worked to promote artisans from other parts of the country and have striven to improve the lot of weavers in the post-flood scenario in State.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ftjd05/article30976117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tv-awardsbw,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-award-for-three-women-entrepreneurs/article30976120.ece
146,2020/03/04,COVID-19: State goes on high alert again,"Surveillance to curb possible community transmission to be tightened

With COVID-19 being confirmed in other parts of the country, Kerala will once again go into a heightened state of alert and tighten all surveillance activities to detect any possible community transmission of the virus.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja, addressing mediapersons here on Tuesday, said that while there was no ground for panic, “responsible behaviour” was called for from the general public, travellers and others coming to the State so that the opportunities for the community transmission of the virus is minimised.

Kerala, which had identified and treated the first COVID-19 cases to be reported in India, successfully managed those cases, ensuring that there was absolutely no secondary spread of the disease. But with COVID-19 now spreading across 60 countries and domestic transmission within India becoming a reality, the threat perception of the State has changed drastically.

Airport surveillance will be strengthened and made round the clock, with people being deployed in three shifts. However, even travel within India now poses a certain risk and hence the general public should strictly follow the guidelines and advisories being issued by the Health Department and share all travel-related information voluntarily with the authorities, the Minister said. Isolation wards in hospitals will be maintained and the hospital staff have also been put on alert.

Second phase

The State’s second phase strategies for maintaining vigil and surveillance over COVID-19 have been planned and would soon be put into practice.

However, it is crucial that international and domestic travellers coming to the State cooperate with the health authorities and submit themselves to the quarantine regulations of the State if advised so, Ms. Shylaja said.

With COVID-19 being reported from other parts of the country on Tuesday, the Centre discussed the new situation with all States through a videoconference.

Kerala’s containment of its COVID-19 cases is appreciated and, in fact, the rest of the country is looking to Kerala to guide them through the situation.

Two States have already approached the Health Department for necessary support and guidance, Ms. Shylaja said. The health advisories that the State had prepared for various target audiences — those in isolation, home quarantine, families of those under surveillance and the general public — have been shared on public domains. While avoiding mass gatherings is a protocol followed by all nations to prevent silent transmission of the disease in the community, at present, there is no need to extend this protocol to the conduct of Attukal Pongala, she added.

At present, the State has 411 persons under surveillance, with 388 persons observing self-quarantine in their houses and 12 persons in isolation in hospitals.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/347mf/article30976071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tv-quote-shylajacol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-state-goes-on-high-alert-again/article30976072.ece

150,2020/03/04,Saudi Arabia’s first film festival postponed due to fears over coronavirus outbreak,"The coronavirus outbreak has spring and summer festival authories around the globe on tenterhooks, with several cancelled for now

The baby of the international film festival circuit, the Red Sea International Film Festival (RSIFF), will take a while longer to be born. Saudi Arabia’s first ever film festival, that was to be held in Old Town Jeddah from March 12-20, now stands postponed due to concerns over the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak. The news came on Tuesday, just a few hours after the cancellation of the Doha Film Institute’s coveted mentoring event, Qumra, in Doha, Qatar. Tuesday was also when the Thessaloniki Documentary Film Festival announced deferment, just days before the event was to have launched on March 5 to run through March 15.

In view of a major outbreak in Iran, the postponement of the Fajr International Film Festival, that was initially slated for April 16-24, was announced on Wednesday. Mid-February, one of the oldest Asian festivals, the Hong Kong International Film Festival, previously scheduled for late March-early April, announced its rescheduling to summer.

Spring, summer fests

The winter events like the Sundance and Rotterdam film festivals may have remained relatively unaffected, but concerns around the coronavirus started gaining ground at the Berlinale in February, where an advisory on precautions was brought out. Now, as with the rest of the world, the high profile spring and summer film festivals appear to have been badly hit by SARS-CoV-2, more so given the fast-moving, unpredictable, day-to-day changes in the situation.

While Hillary Rodham Clinton still features in the list of major speakers, a number of companies, including Twitter and Facebook, have cancelled plans for the edgy South by South West (SXSW) festival, which is to take place March 13-22 at Austin, Texas. While the festival has issued an attendee safety advisory, one of the residents has launched a petition on change.org, urging cancellation of the SXSW in light of SARS-CoV-2. Whether the event will carry on regardless or not is anyone’s guess for now.

‘Safety, well-being’

Meanwhile, in an official announcement, the festival director of RSIFF, Mahmoud Sabbagh, said that the difficult decision of postponement was taken while being mindful of the current global health emergency, “our primary consideration being the safety and well-being of our guests, staff and audiences”. “We remain optimistic, passionate, and committed to what this event means for Saudi Arabia, the Arab world, and the global film community, and hope you can share in this outlook — despite the trying short-term situation,” he said.

“Due to the current global alert regarding the COVID-19 outbreak, the decision comes as part of the Institute’s contribution to manage and reduce the risk of further spread of the virus. This was a very difficult decision, and although Qumra is an important event for our community and industry delegates, their safety and well-being remains our first priority. In order to reduce the risks to our guests in light of increasing global concerns over COVID-19, we are taking precautionary measures to proactively manage potential risks,” said the Doha Film Institute’s statement.

Rescheduling

While Thessaloniki is looking at end May/beginning June for possible new dates, most of the postponed 2020 editions of the festivals are yet to work out a feasible alternative. The rescheduling will have to take cognisance of the choc-a-block festival calendar in which getting a suitable window can be a Herculean task. Also the festivals will have to figure whether their current line-up of films will still hold water a few months down the line, and if the celebrity guests would still be available at another date. The RSIFF jury was being headed by filmmaker Oliver Stone and Spike Lee was scheduled to take a masterclass at the festival, while Claire Denis was to be one of the mentors at Qumra.

Meanwhile the coronavirus’ shadow is already looming large over the biggest of them all, the Cannes Film Festival. Hours after news of the first COVID-19 case in Cannes broke out on February 28, a spokesperson told Variety magazine that while it was still premature to express assumptions on an event scheduled in two months and a half, the festival was “monitoring carefully the developments and the latest guidelines provided by the local, national and international authorities” and “is in direct link with the Alpes-Maritimes’ administrative office”.

Eyes on Cannes

“In due course and depending on the occurrences, the Festival de Cannes will naturally take all the necessary measures, aiming at ensuring the protection of all attendees and preserving their health during the event in Cannes, under the responsibility of public authorities, in particular the State and the City of Cannes,” the spokesperson told Variety. The festival had been watchful and vigilant while going on in the face of the SARS epidemic in 2003.

151,2020/03/04,Sanjay Mishra on his next film 'Kaamyaab': 'This is the story of my industry – which I live and breathe',"The veteran actor talks about playing the quintessential character actor in his latest, dealing with grief and the art of listening

A strong breeze passes through the outside seating of the eighth floor at the Red Chillies Entertainment office in Santa Cruz. Actor Sanjay Mishra jokingly asks if I’m allergic to cigarettes before starting to light one. But a gust of wind thwarts his attempts. With the cigarette lit and perched between his fingers, he sits back in a chair, setting the tone for an interview in Hindi that’s relaxed, free-wheeling, and clearly being guided by a story teller.

This week, the actor will be seen in Hardik Mehta’s Kaamyaab – a story about a 65-year-old bit-part actor, played by Mishra, returning from retirement to do his 500th role. “Sudheer is a bad actor,” Mishra says about his character, suddenly breaking into a cackle – acting out the caricature of an evil villain laughing, “He plays those mediocre, stereotyped roles.” Mishra adds that Sudheer, who saw popularity in the 70s and 80s has to relearn his space in contemporary Indian cinema. “He struggles with that. Ek bujhte hue diye ko vaapas se jalane ki koshish hai – Kaamyaab (It’s an attempt to rekindle a dimming lamp).”

Closer home

For Mishra, playing Sudheer was a no-brainer, “Because this is the story of my industry – which I live and breathe. This is my own story.” Mishra himself has often been a face within ensemble casts. The National School of Drama graduate found immense popularity with his comedic roles in ensemble films – whether on the sitcom Office Office (2001) as Shukla, in Rohit Shetty’s Golmaal series, or Indra Kumar’s Dhamaal (2007). But he proved to be just as comfortable in serious roles – like the conservative father in Masaan (2015) – and also as a protagonist – whether as Bauji, the patriarch of a joint family in Rajat Kapoor’s Ankhon Dekhi (2014), or a blind farmer in Kadvi Hawa (2017). But Mishra is no stranger to being labelled a “character actor”.

“It’s not the audiences [who slot actors this way], it’s the makers,” he says, “These [labels] came up in the 70s and 80s when a kind of film was popular – with one hero and one heroine who fell in love.” But Mishra adds that he’s both relieved and excited to see cinema change increasingly – to focus on being content-oriented and pivoting around more layered characters instead of formulae. He points to Kaamyaab as an example.

Pause life

While Sudheer in the film gets wrapped up in numbers, I ask Mishra how many films he has done, and he says simply, “I don’t count the rotis I eat, nor do I do work by counting [my roles], but someone had mentioned to me, 173.’” Despite the years being packed with releases, Mishra ensures he takes a pause frequently. It’s a habit that may have found its roots over a decade ago when Mishra had to recover from the sudden passing of his father, around the release of the comedy Aloo Chaat (2009).

“I wanted to leave everything,” he says about the time, “I had gone blank – there was a vacuum in my life. I had been cast in that role,” he says explaining that he had recently recovered from a difficult illness when he lost his father unexpectedly. Mishra remembers asking his father’s friend at the funeral, “When did the casting change?”

The actor then withdrew to Rishikesh and worked in a dhaba, before his family and director Rohit Shetty asked him to return to the life he had left. But Mishra still ensures he takes frequent breaks, “To find that emptiness. It’s important to pause for a minute and just think about who you are, where you’ve reached, where you’re headed. Think about those around you.” He often seeks out unknown faces who don’t know him either, and has uninhibited conversations with strangers.

Characters that resonate

It’s this trait of listening that makes him feel close to Bauji, his character in Ankhon Dekhi, “Because he says listen, look, learn,” since Bauji chooses to only believe in what he sees, and nothing else. With genuine conviction he adds Sudheer to this list of characters that resonate with him deeply.

Wrapping up, the actor rattles off a long list of films he’ll soon be seen in – Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2, Gwalior, Death on a Sunday, 108 Limited, Colour Black, and Holy Cow. On how he singles out his projects, Mishra says, “There’s no thinking behind it. Whichever feels close to the heart – every film [becomes] a turning point for me.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/uq5zjg/article30983758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kaamyaab-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sanjay-mishra-on-his-next-film-kaamyaab-this-is-the-story-of-my-industry-which-i-live-and-breathe/article30983759.ece
152,2020/03/04,Aaditi Pohankar’s Netflix series ‘She’ is about a female constable taking on a drug cartel,"The crime thriller is helmed by Imtiaz Ali, and directed by Arif Ali and Avinash Das

Aaditi Pohankar says Netflix’s upcoming series She is a powerful story about a female constable, who is on a quest to finding her identity.

The Netflix series showcases the journey of a female constable discovering her power as a woman while taking down a drug cartel. The trailer of the series was released on Wednesday.

She revolves around Bhumika Pardesi, a Mumbai police constable who is sent on the streets as an undercover prostitute to take down the drug lord, and somehow, gets caught in the dangerous crossfire.

Aaditi will be seen in the lead role of Bhumika.

“She is a powerful story about a female constable who is made to go undercover to bring down a drug cartel,” Aaditi said.

“In the line of duty, my character Bhumika discovers herself — her sexuality and her own power in the truest sense. This role has definitely been one of the most challenging and complex one that I have played so far. I’m thankful that Imtiaz chose me to bring this amazing character to life,” she added.

It also stars Vijay Verma as Sasya, Vishwas Kini as Jason Fernandes amongst others.

153,2020/03/04,Hrithik Roshan: ‘I’m looking at the entire world for a good script’,"The actor discusses his new-found desire to push the boundaries of learning as he looks up to move West, to Hollywood, in search of new opportunities

I couldn’t brush my teeth properly in seven minutes. Yet that is all the time Bollywood actor Hrithik Roshan could spare for an interaction.

The star, last seen in the action film War, had flown to Chennai to launch Rado’s True Square design watches at Express Avenue. I get to meet Hrithik an hour before he sets off to the venue, at Taj Connemara. As his entourage guides the way into a large hall, I come across the man posing for cameras against a black backdrop; he is sporting an unbuttoned denim jacket that reveals a white, round neck vest which he has paired with jeans and a pair of white shoes.

Striving for excellence

Now Hrithik, for those who keenly follow his social media accounts, is well aware of his status as a style icon. So, naturally, when I grab a chair and sit next to him, I had to remark that it takes someone of his stature to carry off plain denim so fashionably well in 2020. He smiles. “I don’t know, man. I really don’t know fashion. I just wear whatever my stylist picks and see if I’m comfortable with it. If I am, then I go with it,” he says. That can’t be true. “I want to be a fashion student. I want to learn. It needs work and time. It is not easy. I’m picking up things here and there.” Perhaps that explains the pictures of him in a towel, which he shared a couple of days ago and for which he cited Ranveer Singh as inspiration.

Into his seventh year as the face of Rado, the actor says that the watches have helped him “articulate” some aspects of his character.

Learning curve Hrithik Roshan likes being a part of ensemble films. “I like the experience. I think all the films that I have done which were two-hero subjects or ensemble films are what I cherish the most... like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, even War with Tiger [Shroff]. It is because you work with good people and you are less alone, as opposed to being alone on the boat and having to row it across the river by yourself,” he laughs, and adds: “You have company and you share the responsibility as well.”

Yet it has taken him over two decades, since making his debut as lead actor in Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000), to realise the possibilities of evolving. The actor confides that he prefers to have less filters about him. “I have a new-found joy in being a little more unfiltered... little reckless too, perhaps, as opposed to becoming the kind of person that you know will be liked,” he laughs, and adds: “As actors, you tend to do that. You filter all the negatives out to fit yourself and retain the things that you know have been proven to work, and [make you feel] loved.”

One way of him trying to make a change for himself is by pushing his boundaries. Which is why the actor recently signed up with The Gersh Agency, a talent firm based in Beverly Hills, California.

“To be honest, I’m looking at the entire world for a good script. [I want] to be in an environment where I would get to learn something new... one that would challenge me, would make me want to wake up and be wide-eyed... you know, like a student. That is how I want to be on the [film] set. I detest the fact that I could be on a set this day and be the one everyone looks up to,” he says.

An interesting comment, I observe, and Hrithik corrects it a bit. “I don’t detest it but I think it really mars my personal growth. I want to learn. Hopefully, with Gersh, or with Hollywood, I may get those chances. I look for them even here and those are the kind of films I end up doing,” he adds.

The star asserts that it cannot be misconstrued as Hrithik assuming that he has hit a ceiling in Bollywood. “I’m just looking at the potential. There is a probability that if I’m with people in a new environment, and who have been in the business for far more years than our industry has even existed... there are more chances of me being even more wide-eyed. It is not that I want to be a Hollywood star. That’s not my aim at all. I’m just looking for a good script,” he notes.

On safe ground

Since last year’s War, which took the best opening of the star’s career, Hrithik has been on a sort of break, “reading scripts and watching a lot of films”. But he is also getting ready to film Krrish 4, the third film in the superhero spin-off of his 2003 hit Koi... Mil Gaya, though he does not divulge any details. “We are just working on it right now,” he smiles. The actor has been known to push his fitness to a superhuman level when filming the franchise. He has also hurt himself in the process of filming stunts for his films. Such freak injuries could be a thing of the past for Hrithik, who last underwent a surgery for subdural haematoma that he sustained in a fly-boarding stunt sequence while filming Bang Bang! (2014).

“I’ve put myself in harm’s way a lot of times for films like Krrish and Dhoom 2. But there is complete safety now. The technology is so wonderful that you never really need to put yourself at risk. You just need to have a certain level of fitness, which is what I’m aspiring for,” he says.

Being fit, though, means more for the actor. “It means to be the best version of myself. [Fitness] for me is not really about the biceps and the six pack abs. It is really about living a life that is wholesome. Fitness is the best way to get to that point,” he concludes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dwue6/article30981357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPHRITHIK1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hrithik-roshan-im-looking-at-the-entire-world-for-a-good-script/article30981359.ece
154,2020/03/04,Sidharth Malhotra to star in Hindi remake of Arun Vijay’s ‘Thadam’,"The murder-mystery will be directed by debutant Vardhan Ketkar, and is jointly produced by Bhushan Kumar and Murad Khetani

Actor Sidharth Malhotra will star in the Hindi remake of Tamil hit Thadam, the makers announced Wednesday.

The yet-to-be-titled action thriller will hit the theatres on November 20.

To be directed by debutant Vardhan Ketkar, the movie is jointly produced by Bhushan Kumar and Murad Khetani.

Sidharth, who will once again be seen in a double role, said he was looking forward to working on the film.

“Double trouble! Excited to be a part of this ultimate entertaining thriller, in association with @itsbhushankumar, @MuradKhetani and #VardhanKetkar. See you at the movies on 20th November, 2020,” the Marjaavaan star wrote on Twitter.

This is Sidharth’s third film in which he will be seen in a dual role after A Gentleman (2017) and his upcoming release Shershaah, based on the life of Kargil hero Captain Vikram Batra.

Starring Arun Vijay in the lead, 2019’s Thadam is a murder mystery. Things get interesting when the murder accused is found to have a lookalike. The Tamil film also starred Tanya Hope, Smruthi Venkat, and Vidya Pradeep.

Bhushan, who is collaborating with Murad for a fourth time, said working with the co-producer is always a fun experience.

“We both share the same love and passion for films and hence our collaborations have always been successful. When Murad bhai mentioned about ‘Thadam’ and post reading the hindi script, it was an instant yes from my side. It was an unanimous choice to get Sidharth on board as a lead and he will surprise the audiences in this film. Vardhan has worked with one of the best directors in the industry and he is apt to lead this project,” the producer said.

Murad said he watched Thadam when it released and loved the film, which is based on real incidents.

“So much so that I approached the Tamil makers and immediately bought the rights for the Hindi remake of the film. Sidharth Malhotra was my first choice and when I approached him, he instantly agreed to come on board. I share a wonderful relationship with ‘Bhushanji’, after the success of ‘Kabir Singh’, this is our fourth collaboration with T-Series including ‘Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2’, Sandeep Vanga’s next and now ‘Thadam’,” he added.

Actors Alia Bhatt, Katrina Kaif, Anushka Sharma, among others have joined hands for a special track for Irrfan Khan-Radhika Madan starrer Angrezi Medium.

Irrfan, the protagonist of Angrezi Medium, who was diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumour in 2018, is undergoing treatment and won’t be available for promotions.

The three Bollywood actors, along with Janhvi Kapoor, Kriti Sanon, Kiara Advani, and Ananya Panday, rallied around Radhika in the music video Kudi Nu Nachan De, which celebrates women.

The song, sung by Vishal Dadlani, was launched on Wednesday.

Homi Adajania, director of the film, said he was overwhelmed with the gesture by all these actors.

“The Angrezi Medium journey has been unlike anything I’ve experienced. It’s been made with so much love and positivity and this video takes the spirit ahead. It’s a glimpse of what love and positivity looks like. These are beautiful people who gave us time with little notice, selflessly pitched in and I love them for this,” Homi said in a statement here.

Katrina said everyone in the film industry should stand by each other.

“Irrfan and Homi are two of my most favourite people, so when he called me there was no question of me not stepping in. I feel that when we can be there for someone, we should. That’s how it should be in our industry,” she said.

“Irrfan sir has given all of us so much and we want to see him back soon and in the best health possible,” Janhvi said.

Alia said when she listened to “Kudi Nu...”, the song made her want to fly and dance.

“That’s how meaningful it is. It’s a really cool song,” Alia said.

“When Homi sent me the song, it was on loop and it still is. This song is going to make everyone super happy,” Anushka added.

Producer Dinesh Vijan said such gestures make the world a better place.

156,2020/03/04,Ready to woo the big screen,"Television host Pradeep Machiraju says that his quest to be an all-rounder drives him to do his best

He is the Superstar of the small screen and was recently voted as the most desirable man by a daily. This is just another pat on the back for Pradeep Machiraju. In fact, it is an offshoot of the efforts he takes to look good on television. “I spend time with my stylist and pick my colours and clothes. Most youngsters follow television trends and some of them might even want to look like you, so I go with the complete package,” says the TV host, who is making his big-screen début with 30 Rojullo Preminchatam Yela that is releasing shortly.

On what made him shift gears, Pradeep says, “I’ve always wanted to be an all-rounder. I grabbed the offer when director Munna told me about 30 Days lo Preminchatam Yela.” Pradeep insists that he will pick subjects that are ‘different’.

In 30 Days lo... he plays two characters. “It talks about some people who are in a situation where they have to work it out in 30 days. In other words, what if the same love story that happened in the past, repeats itself in 2020?”

Turning TV host was a natural choice for an extrovert like him. “In the entertainment industry, the fame comes with a sense of responsibility, it becomes a serious job. After Engineering, I was sure I wanted to do something in a creative field and looked for work for a year. I attended events and got a job as an RJ. My parents were very supportive. Being an RJ is not about talking whatever comes to your mind. There is a decent amount of research to be done and a message has to be passed in an entertaining way without sounding preachy. You get to be a friend to so many unknown faces and I did it for two years.”

Television stint

Pradeep moved to television at a time when Suma, Jhansi, Udaya Bhanu, Ohmkar and Prabhakar were popular names. He resolved to be himself and addressed people according to their age groups.

The household comedy Gadasari Attha Sogasari kodallu worked and he picked up a few awards and got the confidence to create a new style for himself. People began following him and he also took to hosting TV shows. Even now, he freelances for TV and never runs out of work. How did he succeed at creating a brand of his own? “I only wanted to be comfortable watching the show with my parents because during that time, some shows turned into an embarrassing watch for families. Every person has his/her preferences when it comes to TV shows, and we shouldn’t get judgemental. These shows have their own fan following. The television industry today is very good; they are particular about quality,” shares Pradeep who turned producer for talk show Konchem Touch Lo Unte Cheptha which became a huge success.

He states from his experience, “Every show is a different story. Be it housewives, senior citizens or the younger generation, I don’t want to disappoint them. I produced Konchem...as I was willing to take the risk; we have a tie up with channels. I finished four seasons of it and simultaneously began working for other channels. My days are packed but I enjoy it.”

30 Rojullo Preminchatam Yela is going through final mixing. Pradeep, despite his experience, is anxious and wonders how the public will receive him on the big screen. “Audience spend money to come to theatres. I wish I live up to their expectations,” he sums up.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/rdj1gv/article30979667.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym05-pradeep,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pradeep-machiraju-talks-about-his-debut-movie-30-rojullo-preminchatam-yela/article30979671.ece
157,2020/03/04,Discussions on for implementation of Cauvery-Godavari river linking scheme: Palaniswamy,"“The interlinking of Cauvery-Godavari is my dream project and once implemented, the State will get approximately 200 tmc of water”

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi.K.Palaniswami on Wednesday said that he has written to his counterpart in Andhra Pradesh to discuss the implementation of the Cauvery-Godavari river interlinking project.

“The interlinking of Cauvery-Godavari is my dream project and once implemented, the State will get approximately 200 tmc of water,” he said in Salem.

Works for preparing the Detailed Project Report was progressing and Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have come together for implementing the project.

“I spoke with the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and requested for his appointment to discuss regarding the project. As a first step, today [Wednesday] two Ministers, D. Jayakumar and S.P. Velumani, have been sent to Andhra Pradesh to meet the Chief Minister and give my letter,” Mr Palaniswami said adding that he has also sought an appointment with the Telangana Chief Minister.

Once the project is implemented, water would be drawn from both banks of Cauvery river from Mettur to Tiruchi through lift irrigation for 50 kilometres and it would carried to dry areas. The Centre has informed that the project would be implemented at a cost of ₹64,000 crore, he said.

Mr.Palaniswami laid the foundation stone for the ₹565 crore Sarbanga lift irrigation project on the banks of Mettupatti lake in Eruppalli panchayat in the presence of Ministers and AIADMK legislators. About 100 dry lakes in the Sarbanga basin would be filled with surplus water from Mettur dam and it would in turn improve groundwater level in the area.

Mr.Palaniswami added that the Mettur surplus water scheme would be completed in 11 months and lakes under the project would be seen filled up to the brim in 12th month. Addressing the event, Mr. Palaniswami appreciated government officers for their dedicated work which has helped in completion of various development projects within the stipulated time.

Talking about the Kudimaramathu scheme, Mr.Palaniswami said that Opposition leader M.K.Stalin was making false allegations about irregularities in its implementation.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/yjaz4b/article30981635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EPS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/discussions-on-for-implementation-of-cauvery-godavari-river-linking-scheme-cm/article30981636.ece
158,2020/03/04,"Class XI public exams begin in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry","Students wrote the Language exam on Wednesday; on Friday they will write the English paper

Nearly 8.32 lakh candidates began their class XI (plus one) public exams across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Wednesday, with the language paper.

The School Education department had announced in 2017 that class XI students from State board schools would have to take up public exams as well.

S. Nithya, a student in Chennai, said that barring a few one-mark questions which seemed confusing, the Tamil paper was a simple one. Students who took up the French paper too said that it was straightforward.

The exam started at 10 a.m. and students were given three hours as well as an additional fifteen minutes to read the question paper.

“While the plus one portions used to be skipped by both students and teachers in the past, making the final exam a public exam has ensured the students learn the plus one syllabus now. While there might have been some initial apprehension about how to tackle the exams, students taking up the exams now are largely stress-free and much more confident,” said R. Visalakshi, president, Tamil Nadu Private Schools Association.

While students of classes 10 and 12 this year will be taking up the board exams in the new syllabus, students of class 11 took the board exams in the new syllabus last year.

160,2020/03/04,HC’s first all-women Full Bench to hear crucial case today,"The Chief Justice of Madras High Court Amreshwar Pratap Sahi has made the oncoming International Women’s Day this year a memorable event for the 157-year-old institution by constituting its first-ever all-women Full Bench (comprising three judges) to answer a reference made to it by a division bench (comprising two judges).

Interestingly, the reference to the Full Bench consisting of Justices Pushpa Sathyanarayana, Anita Sumanth and P.T. Asha, who shall hold their first hearing together on Wednesday, was made by the first Division Bench led by the Chief Justice himself sitting along with Justice Subramonium Prasad on Monday.

About a year ago, the Madras High Court had the distinction of having had the highest number of 11 women judges. Pursuant to the retirement of two, now nine among the 55 sitting judges are women. Most of them got elevated to the Bench during the tenure of former Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul (now a Supreme Court judge). The High Court had already reached the distinction of having had an all-women Division Bench during the tenure of former Chief Justice Indira Banerjee (also a Supreme Court judge now). Women judges also outnumbered men in a Full Bench when Justice T.S. Sivagnanam sat along with Justices V. Bhavani Subbaroyan and Asha last year.

Maiden sitting of the all-women Full Bench on Wednesday would decide a crucial question of law — whether unaided private educational institutions in the State could be treated to be an ‘establishment’ under Section 1(5) of the Employees State Insurance Act of 1948 so that the provisions of the legislation could be made applicable to them.

The Full Bench would also be answering as to whether the State government had discriminated between private unaided educational institutions on the one hand and Government-aided educational institutions on the other by issuing a notification for application of the ESI Act only to the former and not to the latter.

The first Division Bench led by the Chief Justice had framed these questions on a batch of cases filed by a huge number of private unaided educational institutions in the State and referred them to the Full Bench for an authoritative pronouncement.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yj7rnp/article30976515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MadrasHighCourtvg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hcs-first-all-women-full-bench-to-hear-crucial-case-today/article30976489.ece
161,2020/03/04,SC directs CBI to probe use of toxic chemicals in green crackers,"Apex court orders show-cause notice to manufacturers

The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to probe whether several firecracker manufacturers, mainly based in Sivakasi, were violating an apex court ban on the use of toxic chemicals like barium nitrate in the production of ‘green crackers’.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde took a stern view of the issue when senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan stated that these manufacturers were openly flouting the court’s order. The Bench ordered the manufacturers, numbering at least six, to show cause why they should not be punished for contempt of the Supreme Court.

In what may be the initiation of criminal proceedings along with the contempt action, the court directed the CBI to file its probe report in the next six months and posted the matter for hearing after eight weeks.

“Certain violations of our order banning certain chemicals from fireworks. According to senior counsel, many of our respondents (manufacturers) are using them in various products...If these allegations are true, they would be guilty of contempt. Issue notice. Show cause why they should not be proceeded (sic) for contempt,” the court said.

At a hearing on March 5 last year, the court asked the Centre to file a response to objections raised against the use of chemical components like barium nitrate and Potassium Nitrate in the formulation of green crackers.

Mr. Sankaranarayanan, representing three toddlers who filed a writ petition on the toxic effects of firecrackers, has been consistently arguing that the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests should examine the samples of green crackers which contain “conventional formulations” with Barium Nitrate and Potassium Nitrate as oxidizers. The senior advocate submitted that these two components were among the several toxic ingredients, which the Supreme Court had red-flagged.

On October 23, 2018, the apex court struck a balance between the interests of the firecracker industry and the right to public health by allowing licensed traders to manufacture and sell ‘green’ and reduced-emission or ‘improved’ crackers, while banning those that were loud and toxic to humans, animals and the environment.

The production of green crackers, the court said, had to be done in consultation with CSIR-National Environmental Engineering Research Institute. The Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation had to approve the product.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/67uarl/article30976466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04INDEXSUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sc-directs-cbi-to-probe-use-of-toxic-chemicals-in-green-crackers/article30976467.ece
162,2020/03/04,Cong. upset with DMK for ‘unilaterally’ announcing Rajya Sabha candidates,"They had earlier agreed to give us an RS seat: TNCC leader

A section of leaders in the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee is upset over the DMK ‘unilaterally’ announcing its candidates for three Rajya Sabha seats. The national party was already miffed over not being given adequate representation in the recently-concluded rural local body polls.

A senior TNCC leader claimed that the DMK had earlier agreed to give a Rajya Sabha berth to the party. “When the Congress pitched Dr. Manmohan Singh’s candidature for the Rajya Sabha from Tamil Nadu last time around, the DMK said we should have asked earlier. During the seat sharing [talks] for the Lok Sabha polls, when we sought more seats, we were promised one seat in the Rajya Sabha. That promise was for the current Assembly’s tenure. We do not know what will happen in the next Assembly election, as it is likely to be a close contest,” he said.

“Plus or minus, one RS seat is not a big issue. But look at how they treated us in the local bodies and how the AIADMK is treating its allies. In fact, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami is on a stronger footing now than he was three years ago, and he has the State machinery to support him when the elections come. If Mr. Rajinikanth takes the political plunge and wins 15-20 seats, he might turn out to be the kingmaker,” another leader said. “The DMK must realise that the Congress has a presence in every district,” he said, adding, “Even 2,000-3,000 votes might make a difference in close contests in the Assembly election.”

The Congress leaders felt the cadre were disillusioned with the DMK over its handling of their party’s demands. “If a cadre is demoralised, he won’t work even if the leadership asks him to. So, who will lose if you (DMK) affect the alliance?” a party leader asked.

The national party wants the Dravidian major to ‘introspect’, ensure there is cohesiveness in the alliance and take into account the support extended by the Congress to the DMK regime in the past.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cong-upset-with-dmk-for-unilaterally-announcing-rajya-sabha-candidates/article30976402.ece
163,2020/03/04,Stalin slams ASI’s plan to take over temples in T.N.,"‘Move aimed at imposing Sanskrit culture on T.N.’

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Tuesday took exception to Union Minister of State for Tourism and Culture (Independent Charge) Prahlad Singh Patel’s proposal to add important sites, including ancient places of worship that are currently under the State government’s control, to the list of centrally protected monuments.

In a statement issued in Chennai, he said the temples in Tamil Nadu were under the control of the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department, and ancient structures were protected by the State Archaeology department.

“At a time when the existing monuments under the control of the Archaeological Survey of India in Tamil Nadu remain neglected, the proposal to bring more monuments from the State list under its control is unjust,” he said.

Mr. Stalin alleged that the proposal of the MoS was shaped by the motive to impose the ‘Sanskrit culture’ on Tamil Nadu.

He said it was highly condemnable that the AIADMK government had not raised any objections to the proposal.

PMK founder S. Ramadoss said the transfer of administrative powers over historic Hindu temples in Tamil Nadu to ASI will hurt the sentiments of Tamils.

164,2020/03/04,"Kangayam cattle urine, dung yield rich dividends","Farmers find them useful for drip irrigation and as an insecticide

Farmers make a beeline to the Kangayam Cattle Research Station, run by the Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS), in Sathyamangalam early every morning. The purpose of the visit is to buy some high-quality cow urine, cow dung and milk.

“Farmers involved in floriculture in Sathyamangalam are using the urine and they tell us that the yield has increased,” said A.V. Omprakash, Director Centre for Animal Production Studies, explaining that native breeds should be approached as a multi-purpose economic model than depend on them for just milk produce.

There are 50 animals in the research station and every day it sells 300 litres of urine, at ₹ 1 a litre.

“Farmers mix the urine with the water used for drip irrigation instead of chemicals to remove the clog. Moreover, the urine fulfils the nitrogen requirement of plants,” said Dr Omprakash.

There is a also a heavy demand for dung — both wet and dry — and the research station has started commercially producing panchakavya, which can be used for drip irrigation and as an insecticide.

Before the advent of mechanisation in the agriculture sector, cattle remained the mainstay of farmers and sustained their lives. They were used for ploughing and pulling carts and their dung and urine used as manure while milk nourished children and adults alike. But mechanisation of agricultural practices almost rendered native cows and bulls irrelevant. What further aggravated the situation for the native breeds is introduction of high-yielding breeds of cattle through artificial insemination programme.

According to a breed survey in 2013 the population size of Kangayam cattle was 80,000. A survey in 2007 found that the Bargur cattle population had come down to 2,529. As per the 2013 survey, there were around 21,000 Pulikulam cattle.

Sensing the need to step in, Tanuvas and the Tamil Nadu government launched programmes to protect five native breeds of cattle — Kangayam, Umblachery, Pulikulam, Alambadi and Bargur. The Centre also recently unveiled a programme to research on indigenous breeds.

“Local breeds or native cattle kept as herds and moving from one place to another in search of pasture escape being bred artificially with the semen of other exotic breeds. We have already collected sperm cells (semen) of these native breeds and preserved them as a conservation measure,” said Dr. Om Prakash. While the revival of interest in jallikattu in recent years has offered a new lease of life to Pulikulam and Kangayam breeds, other breeds are not so fortunate, since their milk yield is too low to be maintained for dairy.

“Fortunately, we found some native breeds of cattle yielding considerable amount of milk and it is high time to tap their potential through selective breeding and scientific management,” said SMK Karthickeyan, professor and head of Animal Genetics and Breeding, Madras Veterinary College.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/b2y65b/article30976381.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03CATTLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kangayam-cattle-urine-dung-yield-rich-dividends/article30976382.ece
165,2020/03/04,‘Adapting to situations is part of an athlete’s routine’,"Abhinav Bindra optimistic of a good haul by the Indian shooters at Tokyo

Former World and Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra emphasised that adapting to situations and preparing well for competitions was part of an athlete’s routine, and that the current uncertainty caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus, was an added challenge before the Tokyo Olympics.

“Those who accept the challenge and adapt well, will be successful’’, said Bindra. Addressing the media at the launch of the sixth ABTP (Abhinav Bindra Targeting Performance) Centre in collaboration with Daivam Wellness, Bindra said that the International Olympic Committee (IOC) was monitoring the situation and would take appropriate measures. He sought patience when queried about the possibility of the Olympics getting postponed, and goaded the athletes to prepare their best.

Expressing high hopes about India winning more medals than the six it had won in London in 2012, Bindra was particularly optimistic about a good haul by the Indian shooters as they go to Tokyo as favourites.

“On paper, we can definitely go past the six medals won in London. So many athletes who have qualified for the Olympics, have won at the highest level. Our shooters will be favourites. They can win multiple medals. It will be interesting to see how potential translates into medals’’, observed Bindra.

“Am sure our shooters will be well prepared. Some of the young shooters have the experience of competing in the Youth Olympics’’, said Bindra, as he pointed out the experience of the big stage, especially for the young athletes.

Saying that he was delighted with the collaboration, Bindra stressed that he believed “in the holistic well being of the human being.’’

Looking back

Looking back at his sports career, Bindra recalled that he did have a fair share of injuries and did not deal with them effectively at times.

“The life of an athlete is unique and short. They will be injured. Our focus is to get the athlete back into action quickly. Generally, we treat the symptoms, and don’t go to the root cause of the problem. We do now’’, he said.

The Founder and Medical Director of Daivam Wellness, Dr. Alok Chopra, said that the approach was to make the person strong by tackling lifestyle, nutrition, environment and mental attitude, so as to make the person deal with anything that affects good health.

Holistic healing

The Founder and CEO of Daivam Wellness, Sanjay Sachdeva, also highlighted the “holistic healing’’ system, by strengthening the human body, both physically and mentally.

On his part Bindra said that it was important to utilise the technology and knowledge both for athletes and normal persons, to benefit all.

“Some of our centres are more focused towards athletes because of their location. It is important to make it available for non-athletes and normal persons. Some centres cater to 90% normal people, and 10% athletes. It helps to achieve commercial feasibility by catering to a larger population’’, he said.

After it started in Mohali, the ABTP has been set up in Bengaluru, Pune, Bhubaneswar and Delhi.

“Through Daivam, we have found a partner that not only complements the work we do, but also helps the benefit of holistic physical excellence reach Gurugram residents from all walks of life’’, Bindra said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/n19k9h/article30984368.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05Bindra,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/adapting-to-situations-is-part-of-an-athletes-routine/article30984369.ece

168,2020/03/04,TVS Racing to take part in ARRC,"TVS Racing, the factory racing team of TVS Motor Company, will take part in the Asia Road Racing Championship (ARRC) 2020.

169,2020/03/04,"Salom Electric, Amara Raja in manufacturing pact","Launch of production will have to wait in view of travel restrictions for COVID-19

Power solutions maker Salom Electric (Xiamen) Co that has its roots in Taiwan and factories in China, Brazil and Indonesia, has decided to manufacture a range of its products at the Amara Raja Electronics facility in Chittoor, Andhra Pradesh.

The launch of the production, however, is unlikely sometime soon as the cross training for which travel from and to China is required could not be undertaken in view of the coronavirus outbreak.

“The original schedule was second quarter of this year. We might be delayed by some months because of some events in China,” Leo Yaus, President of Salom Americas and India, said here on Wednesday.

Cross training requiring teams from China travelling to India and those from the country going to China was not possible in view of travel restrictions, he said, expecting production of Salom products at Chittoor to begin by the third quarter.

Salom, which has already set up an LLP entity in India, expects to invest ₹100 crore in India. The pace of the investment will be driven by the opportunities, he told the media here on Wednesday.

As a part of the manufacturing and supply partnership, Amara Raja Electronics, a unit of Amara Raja Group, will make a wide range of Salom power products, including external power supplies, battery chargers, wall plug-in power supplies, car chargers, vehicle power adapters, power banks, wireless chargers, and associated products overtime. The products will be shipped to Salom’s global clientele in India and abroad.

Amara Raja Electronics Managing Director Vikramadithya Gourineni said the partnership with Salom would bring in more revenues for the company.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/salom-electric-amara-raja-in-manufacturing-pact/article30984918.ece
170,2020/03/04,Time to harness full potential of moduga tree,"The flame of the forest supports nearly 100 species of birds for feeding, roosting and nesting

As flowering of the modugu tree, also known as palash or the flame of the forest (Butea monosperma), started in these parts, the value of the tree, both in terms of its potential in generating economic activity and its role in the ecosystem, have come into focus.

On the economic front, the tree produces lac and its leaves can be used to make eco-friendly plates while it supports nearly 100 species of birds for feeding, roosting and nesting, making it one of the keystone species in the local ecosystem.

Economic aspect

The economic potential of the tree, lakhs of them are scattered over the undulating terrain of undivided Adilabad district, was not realised ever.

The only efforts that came were in 2004 under the then Velugu programme meant to alleviate rural poverty, when tribals were given training in making lac, and another attempt to train tribals in making leaf plates was taken up a year back.

“We are not objecting to pruning of modugu trees in the forests if it is meant for economic activity by tribals,” revealed Adilabad Forest Divisional Officer V. Chandra Shekhara Rao as he talked of tribals getting help from his department in relevant aspect. “We will also take up an experimental awareness programme in one tribal village asking them not to fell modugu trees as they are an important component of nature,” he added. The flowering of palash happens in February which is when the lean season for birds starts, and ends in mid-April.

A whole lot of birds feed on the nectar that is available in the keel-shaped lower petals of the bright orange flowers, not to talk of honey bees depending upon the Butea flowers to make honey.

The role of the Butea in the ecosystem was studied in detail by Gajanan A. Wagh, Hayat Qureshi, Nikhil Borode and Shubham Wagh of Shri Shivaji Science College, Amaravati, Maharashtra. Their study was published in the form of a paper, Study of avifauna associated with Palash (Butea monosperma) in Pohara-Malkhed reserve forest, Amaravati district, Maharashtra, in the International Journal in Basic and Applied Research in September 2018.

The study, which has come up with an exhaustive list of birds associated with the modugu tree, is relevant to old united Adilabad district in Telangana as that part in Maharashtra has similar type of dry deciduous forests and its biodiversity. Like in these parts, the palash is a dominant species in the forest there too.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2fcvc8/article30984890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY05MODUGU1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/time-to-harness-full-potential-of-moduga-tree/article30984893.ece
171,2020/03/04,COVID-19 scare grips Telangana,"All eyes are on the results of the two samples that will be announced on March 5.

The coronavirus scare gripped Telangana on March 4 as the attention of the entire State was on the COVID-19 status of two persons, including a software employee with travel history to Italy, whose samples were tested at the Gandhi Hospital.

Though messages of a software employee testing positive for COVID-19 spread on social media platforms faster than any virus, one will have to wait till March 5 for official confirmation on whether the samples tested positive or negative.

Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender said the department had sent the two samples to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune for more clarity. These two are among the 47 samples tested at the ICMR’s laboratory at Gandhi Hospital, Musheerabad, on Tuesday, The remaining 45 tested negative.

As per protocol, if a sample collected from a person in the State tests negative, it is announced by the State Health department. In case a sample tests positive for COVID-19, the sample has to be sent to NIV-Pune for confirmation. If it tests positive again, the announcement is made by the Central government. The process was followed to declare the first positive case from Telangana.

Before the Health Minister or other officials got into damage control mode, the messages on social media set off fear and trepidation among software employees in Hitech city, the hub of I-T operations in Hyderabad.

At least four companies in the I-T hub evacuated employees from their offices. An 11-storey building in Mindspace IT Park was evacuated following messages that an employee working there tested positive for the virus. The employee, a woman, has travel history to Italy. Employees of another company in Purva Summit, where her husband works, were also evacuated.

Principal Secretary of I-T and Industries Jayesh Ranjan confirmed the developments at a joint press conference with Cyberabad Police Commissioner V.C. Sajjanar, and Director of public Health G. Srinivas Rao.

Mr. Ranjan appealed to all I-T companies not to take such decisions without consulting the government.

Mr. Sajjanar was appointed nodal officer. Directions were passed to I-T companies to inform him in case if they plan to shut their operations or decide to direct their employees to work from home.

“The entire building no 20 in Raheja IT Park is being sanitised and operations will be normal from Thursday,” Mr. Ranjan told reporters.

The companies were suggested to temporarily disable biometric attendance system, group meetings at conference halls. Instead, they were asked to use technology to hold meetings as there is a high risk of the virus spreading.

The Health Minister tried to infuse hope stating that four family members of the COVID-19 positive patient from Hyderabad, who lived under the same roof, tested negative for the virus.

172,2020/03/04,11 needles found in boys pelvic region,"Boy’s aunt inserted the needles with intention of killing him

Eleven surgical needles were found on the lower body of a three-year-old child in Veepangandla village of Wanaparthy district. When the boy’s parents noticed needles poking out of his back, they rushed him to a hospital, where doctors took an X-ray and found needles in his body, which were later removed.

Speaking to The Hindu a senior police officer said the boy’s aunty Aliveluamma inserted surgical needles on his buttocks and thighs to kill him, with an ulterior motive of grabbing the 1.5 acre agricultural land belonging to the boy’s father.

“Initially, doctors of a private hospital managed to take out some needles, which could be seen protruding from his backside. Later, he was shifted to Government hospital in Wanaparthy, where doctors performed surgery and removed a few needles. They are yet to remove two more,” the officer said.

Police said the boy was unwell for the past five to six months, and everytime he cried, the parents used to take him to a local hospital, where doctors prescribed medicines. But on Sunday, his mother found a needle poking out of his buttocks and rushed him to a private hospital.

The victim’s parents are farm labourers and whenever they go out for work, Aliveluamma used to take care of him.

“Our investigation revealed that Aliveluamma hatched a conspiracy to kill the boy so that she will inherit the agricultural of her brother,” police said.

A case was registered and police are likely to arrest Aliveluamma on Thursday.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/11-needles-found-in-boys-pelvic-region/article30984846.ece
173,2020/03/04,"No need to be scared, says Collector","No suspected case of COVID-19 reported from Nizamabad: Narayana Reddy

Collector C. Narayana Reddy here on Wednesday made it clear that there was no coronavirus in the district, and hence people need not be worried about it. The resident of Yellareddipally who arrived from a Gulf country and referred to Gandhi Hospital was diagnosed COVID-19 negative, he said.

At a press conference, he said that as a precautionary measure an isolation ward was opened at the Government General Hospital to examine, admit and treat persons suffering with COVID-19 symptoms. Balaraju alias Rajaiah of Yellareddipally in Indalwai mandal was declared free of COVID-19 symptoms and discharged from the hospital this evening, he said. He said that there was only one per cent possibility for coronavirus in the district and that too can be checked with some small precautionary measures. All facilities with necessary staff were provided at the isolation ward and if need be, doctors and paramedics would be summoned on emergency basis, he added.

There was an urgent need for enlightening people on the COVID-19 as it could easily be combated if awareness is created. The medical and health department will create awareness and department of education would issue a circular to schools and educational institutions with suitable instructions.

Mr. Narayana Reddy wanted people to get examined by doctors even if they were down with cough and fever. Suspicious cases would have to be kept in a separate room and students should not be sent to schools. People were told to maintain personal hygiene, drink warm water and avoid cold places. “Stay away from crowds and better postpone tours and travels,” he said.

A 25-bed Isolation Ward exclusively to treat COVID-19 affected patients has been set up at the MGM Hospital here.

Panchayat Raj Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao went on a surprise visit and held a review meeting with the hospital authorities. He inspected the Isolation Ward, general wards and the entire premises. Expressing displeasure at the poor sanitation, he wanted the officials to remove the contractor and appoint a new agency for maintaining sanitation.

Warangal East MLA N Narender, Mayor G. Prakash, Municipal Commissioner Pamela Satpathy, Urban District Collector Rajiv Gandhi Hanmanthu, and others accompanied the minister.

During the review, the minister wanted the hospital staff to be available round-the-clock and create awareness among the patients arriving at the hospital in panic. He also advised the media to report responsibly allaying fears among the people about the deadly virus.

‘No need for panic’

“The State government is fully geared up to meet any exigency. The Chief Minister had sanctioned ₹ 100 crore for additional equipment and infrastructure. There is no need for any panic as of now,” Mr Dayakar Rao assured.

The minister appealed to the public to maintain personal hygiene, and keep their surroundings clean to prevent spread of diseases of any kind. He instructed the Mayor and Municipal Commissioner to oversee sanitation in the city. He also wanted the MLA Mr. Narender to oversee sanitation in the MGM Hospital premises.

175,2020/03/04,The vulnerability of Gandhi Hospital,"With thousands of patients and their attendants present, it is not the right choice to house an isolation ward

Police personnel are deployed at Gandhi Hospital only when there is possible law and order situation. Such as, attendants attacking doctors, protests by various sections of the hospital etc. Though there was no law and order situation at the tertiary care hospital on Tuesday, police were seen staying put near the main building.

Patients and their attendants were seen moving around with different types of masks. Some wrapped towels, scarves, hand kerchiefs around their nose and mouth. The COVID-19 patient, a 24-year-old software engineer, has been admitted in an ICU located in the second floor of the hospital’s Emergency Block.

Entry into the main building is restricted to ‘coronavirus suspects’ who are directed to the Isolation Ward located in seventh floor. On Tuesday, many people suspecting that they have the virus, visited the isolation ward and gave their samples for tests.

Considering that there are thousands of patients and their attendants, sources in the hospital said that COVID-19 ICU has to be shifted from Gandhi Hospital. “Despite our repeated requests, attendants do not move away from the ICU as other In-Patient wards too are located in the same building. It would be wise to shift the facility to a remote corner of some other hospital where not many people visit,” sources said.

In fact, Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender on Tuesday afternoon announced that a hospital will be earmarked exclusively for COVID treatment. During discussions, it was mentioned that if any of the patients suffer from multi-organ failure they would need services of multiple medical specialists, who are available at Gandhi Hospital. “A final decision on this will be taken in two days,” sources said.

176,2020/03/04,Gender and the workplace,"An ongoing CII survey seeks to improve the work environment for women

An ongoing survey — titled “Women on Work” — seeks to find out how the workplace and allied spaces and their culture can be made better for women employees. Conducted by the National Committee on Women Empowerment and Indian Women Network of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), it invites women to respond to a set of questions at www.surveymonkey.com/r/CII-WoWSurvey

At the end of the exercise, the answers will be collated with the objective of offering insights that would help shape workplace policies and programmes for women.

Questions are based on six different areas — the impact of gender on career; experience of sexual abuse; gender-related facilities; safety and security for working women in a city; the impact of family and children on career; and a career break.

Phase I of the survey has been covered, and some of the collated responses run counter to popular perceptions.

Bhairavi Jani, chairperson, CII National Committee on Women Empowerment & Indian Women Network, says that 56% of our respondents said that gender had no impact on career.

Bhairavi adds that most of us would actually expect fewer people to make such a statement.

Close to 26% of respondents say gender plays a role when it comes to whether someone is entrusted with challenging tasks.

Feeling unrepresented in promotions; getting the desired salary and benefits and a good support system at work were among the questions that the survey sought to find answers to.

On the subject of sexual harassment at workplace, Bhairavi says 11% said it existed.

The survey shows that married women showed more boldness in filing complaints.

“This only shows that we need to work with companies to empower women with the correct knowledge, so that they have greater confidence,” she says.

There were more respondents who wanted more and better washrooms at the workplace than those who chose crèches.

“For us, the big learning is that we need to create diagnostic tools, which we are launching on March 8, for companies to assess themselves in terms of their gender-related policies,” says Bhairavi, a data scientist by profession.

“Our vision is to co-create an eco-system for women to live up to their full economic potential. We want to do this through advocacy, knowledge creation and on ground intervention that promote equal opportunity for women to participate, grow and flourish,” she says.

A varied group

Close to 2,700 women took part in the first phase of the survey.

Bhairavi says the team is happy with the sample, as it represents good age and geographical variance, including position and sectors.

“This survey will be kept open for some more time. Meanwhile, we are launching another set of questions to get the views of both men and women,” says Bhairavi. With the support of its member companies, CII will be working with policy makers to bring about more solutions.

Lighting up Gurugram

Good street lights do have a role to play in helping women make an assessment about how safe they are in their work commute, and this factor can even influence whether they want to continue with a company or not.

Based on the inputs from the survey, the CII team has been in a discussion with Safetipin, a social enterprise that runs a personal safety app, to find out how street light infrastructure can be improved in Gurugram.

177,2020/03/04,"2022 Punjab polls | No question of change in seat-sharing arrangement with BJP, says Sukhbir Singh Badal","Akali chief says all issues with BJP resolved, they will jointly contest Punjab polls

Shiromani Akali Dal chief and former Punjab Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal, in an exclusive interview with The Hindu, dismissed the possibility of any change in the seat-sharing arrangement with ally BJP in the 2022 Assembly polls amid a rising demand by the latter's State leaders for a bigger share of seats. In the 2017 polls, the Akalis contested 94 seats and the BJP 23. Excerpts:

Relations between the Akali Dal and BJP have been under strain,as witnessed during the Delhi and Haryana Assembly polls. Will this impact your alliance in Punjab ahead of the 2022 Assembly polls?

There were some issues but now everything has been sorted out. We will fight the next Assembly polls in alliance. We will fight the polls on the same [seat-sharing] formula that we have had since the beginning. There’s not going to be a single more seat or less seat. There’s no question.

The Akali Dal recently saw a few Taksali [senior] leaders revolting. Is the party facing an internal crises? How are you preparing for the 2022 Assembly elections?

There’s no crises in the party. The leaders who have left, it’s basically retirement [for them]. When people retire and go that doesn’t mean it’s a crisis. Their exit won’t impact the party.

We are fully prepared [for elections]. In 2017 Assembly polls also when we lost, we [SAD-BJP] were number two in the vote share. The Congress had 38% vote share, we had close to 31% votes. And now after the Congress has been in power for three years, the people have seen this government’s poor performance. In our rallies and mass programmes, people tell us about their sufferings due to the indifferent attitude of the government. People are now comparing Parkash Singh Badal government’s work with the State's overall development.

Your party has been accused of remaining silent on the communal violence in Delhi.

We have not been silent. From day one we are very clear that it is very unfortunate... It’s the government which is responsible for maintaining law and order. They have to ensure the guilty are put behind bars. We know how it feels. In 1984 [referring to the anti-Sikh riots] thousands of our brothers and sisters were killed. We have been fighting the cases for 30 years now. I don’t want such a situation to happen again. Irrespective of the position, whosoever is guilty should be put behind bars. Our MP Naresh Gujral had written to the Home Minister [Amit Shah] about inaction and apathy of Delhi police during the violence. If an MP talks to somebody and still there’s no response, what do you think would be the effect of a common man’s word? This clearly shows the attitude of the police at that time.

The Opposition parties have accused the Akali Dal of doublespeak on Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

We have stuck to the same stand on CAA since the beginning. We fought for CAA because we have thousands of Hindus, Sikhs and people from the Sindhi community who have come to India from Pakistan in the last 15-20 years. We support the Act as far as it grants protection to the Sikhs and several other communities, but the Act should not exclude Muslims because then it falls short of being inclusive and secular. I said in Parliament why are you excluding the name of Muslims. If there’s nobody from the community, it’s fine. But you can’t say exclude so and so... We are a small minority in the whole thing [government] but we have clearly put forward our views on what we stand for inside Parliament and outside as well.

The apprehension being raised by those opposing the CAA is that it is a step towards creating a ‘Hindu Rashtra’. Do you agree?

I can’t comment on this at the moment because a lot of politics has gone into it. What the intention was and what has come out afterwa-rds... everyone has jumped into it. Once the dust settles, we will get to know what the exact picture is.

How do you assess the Congress government’s performance in Punjab?

Even a child in Punjab can answer this question. People want to punish the ruling Congress as the government has set new records in neglect of the State’s development. He [Captain Amarinder Singh] is the most incompetent Chief Minister that Punjab has ever had.

Name one promise which they [Congress] have delivered... Capt. Amarinder has put forth the claim of ‘breaking the back of the drug mafia’. The truth is that he has broken the back of Punjabis. People are so fed up with him that they want to get rid of him as soon as possible. Today, the drug mafia is being patronised by Congress leaders. The Chief Minister promised that he would waive the complete debts of all farmers, but after assuming power he backed out on this promise. They promised something, have done something else and are now involved only in cover-up.

After the Aam Aadmi Party’s resounding victory in the Delhi Assembly polls, do you think it will pose you a greater challenge in the 2022 Punjab polls?

The situation in Delhi is very different from Punjab... In Delhi, the fight was between AAP and BJP... the Congress let all its vote go to AAP and due to this they [AAP] won. The Punjab Assembly polls will see a direct fight between the Akali Dal and the Congress. AAP will be third in the contest.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7c79ys/article30984716.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE04-SUKHBIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-question-of-change-in-seat-sharing/article30984717.ece
178,2020/03/04,‘Media using COVID-19 to divert attention from Delhi violence’,"Don’t make people panicky about the disease: Mamata

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday alleged that a section of the media was playing up the spread of COVID-19 to divert public attention from the Delhi violence.

The Trinamool Congress chairperson was addressing a rally at Buniyaadpur in Dakshin Dinajpur district of north Bengal.

“Today, a lot of people are shouting corona, corona... a bit too much. Yes certainly it is a disease, and the entire world is concerned about it. But do not make people panicky,” she said.

“Some channels are playing it up in an effort to make people forget the incidents of Delhi. Do report when it occurs. We don’t want it to spread. We don’t want a single person to be infected in Bengal. But do remember all those who died in Delhi, did not die of coronavirus, dengue, encephalitis or swine flu,” she said.

Had those people in Delhi “died of the virus, we would have at least known they died due to a dreaded disease to which there is no remedy or cure”, she said.

The Chief Minister said the BJP government at the Centre did not “express any remorse or say sorry” about the deaths in Delhi. “Instead, the party is bringing a rally here and saying goli maro... keep in mind, Bengal is not Delhi,” she said.

‘Don’t distort my words’

Ms. Banerjee also clarified her remarks about “Bangladeshis” on Tuesday, warning the media of legal action if her words were distorted. “After 1947, when people came to India as refugees, there was a Liaquat-Nehru Pact. According to that, those who came to India are Indian citizens,” she said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7p7867/article30984695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE04-MAMATA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/media-using-covid-19-to-divert-attention-from-delhi-violence/article30984696.ece

A privilege motion was moved against Shiromani Akali Dal MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu on Wednesday in the Punjab Assembly for his “unacceptable” and “condemnable” behaviour.

Unruly scenes

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Brahm Mohindra, who moved the motion against the MLA, urged Speaker Rana K.P. Singh to take appropriate action after unruly scenes were witnessed in the House as Pawan Kumar Tinu allegedly made some objectionable remark against Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal.

Several Congress MLAs were upset at Mr. Tinu as he, while showing a placard, approached close to the seat of Mr. Badal and allegedly made some remark which made the Minister react angrily.

Outside the House, the SAD condemned what it termed as “insult and humiliation” meted out to Mr. Tinu.

The SAD leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, said “a Dalit legislator had been attacked by the Congress Ministers and legislators in this fashion purely because he had dared to ask the Finance Minister why grants for Dalits were not released and why the SC scholarship scheme had been stopped”.

181,2020/03/04,Whistle-blower releases clips showing ‘deal’ bid,"BJP leader Narottam Mishra, who is in the videos, questions their veracity

Amid the charge by the Congress in Madhya Pradesh against the BJP of conspiring to topple its government by buying over MLAs, whistle-blower Anand Rai on Wednesday released a string of videos purportedly showing a former BJP Minister attempting to strike a deal with a Congress MLA and explaining to him how the government would be subverted.

Credited for uncovering the Vyapam scam in the State, Mr. Rai released the sting operation titled ‘Horsetrading BJP exposed’, shot over months along with some Congress MLA associates, and backed Congress MP Digvijaya Singh’s allegation on Monday that former BJP Minister Narottam Mishra offered MLAs of the Kamal Nath government ₹25-53 crore to cross over. Dr. Rai claimed Mr. Mishra offered ₹100 crore and ministerial posts to MLAs.

In one of the videos, reportedly shot on January 28 last year at the Madhya Pradesh Bhavan in New Delhi, and released on social media, Mr. Mishra is seen telling Dr. Rai, who is seated next to Congress MLA from Manawar Hiralal Alawa: “There are two-three [MLAs] with you, as per my knowledge, there are three-four with me, they are with the Congress only. If you agree, we will talk to the Governor, straight away end it, and within 24 hours they will take oath.”

‘Nothing new in this’

Questioning the veracity of the sting operation, Mr. Mishra told The Hindu, “Is he [Dr. Rai] an MLA or an MP? Why would anyone buy anyone from him? Has he been made to sit to buy and sell? He has been pulling off such things for a long time now to stay in the news.

182,2020/03/04,2 youths thrashed for ‘cow slaughter’ in U.P.,"Bulandshahr police say it was a brawl between two groups

Footage of two youths being thrashed by a group of at least seven persons in Uttar Pradesh’s Bulandshahr district for alleged cow slaughter went viral on social media on Wednesday.

While the two alleged that they were accused of cow slaughter by the assaulters, who allegedly used communal slurs against them, police said an old case of harassment was behind the incident .

A case had been registered under charges of attempt to murder, rioting, criminal intimidation and kidnapping for murder against five persons and another unidentified person. The FIR identifies the five accused as Shivam, Satyaveer, Sachin, Badal and Dinesh Pandit.

In a video that has gone viral, the youths, one of them bare-chested, are seen being punched, kicked and hit with a stick by some men at an undisclosed location next to a car bearing a Delhi number plate. The victims can be heard begging for mercy.

In another video, a youth, identifying himself as Umar, says a group intercepted their two-wheeler and pulled them over while they were going to a cold storage. They used communal slurs and referred to the violence in Delhi while abusing and threatening them with dire consequences.

“They had hammers, axe and knives. They also threatened to throw acid on us,” he states.

In a cryptic sentence, he says they were targeted for cow slaughter. “Shouldn't we have blood on our hands [if we indulged in cow slaughter],” he asks.

The other victim was identified as Rahil Gazi.

It is not clear who shot the two videos.

The police said on Twitter that the incident took place in the Sikandrabad area near the Yadav Farmhouse on Khurja road on March 2.

‘Abducted at gunpoint’

In a police complaint, Umar's brother Mehervan says the two youths were going to get carrots from a cold storage in their four-wheeler when the assaulters intercepted them. They were kidnapped at gunpoint, taken to a forest and beaten up with rods and sticks with the intent to kill, alleges Mehervan.

183,2020/03/04,COVID-19: 7 Rajasthan districts on alert,"Italian couple, who tested positive for coronavirus, shifted to isolation ward

Seven districts in Rajasthan were put on high alert after a 69-year-old Italian tourist and his wife tested positive for COVID-19. The State has also cancelled the Dhulandi Mahotsava in Jaipur and Kapda Phaad Holi in Pushkar next week in view of the advisory against large gatherings at public places.

The couple were shifted to the isolation ward in Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital here. Health Department officials were trailing the route taken by Italian travellers from February 21 to 28.

Medical and Health Minister Raghu Sharma said in the Assembly that at least 215 persons had come in contact with the Italian nationals during their stay in hotels and visit to tourist places. Fourteen Italians, who were also in their group, have tested positive after their arrival in New Delhi.

Mr. Sharma said the swab samples had been taken from 93 persons, and 52 tested positive and the reports on 41 were pending. Nine persons with a travel history were sent to the isolation hospital of the Rajasthan University of Health Sciences here, though they did not show any symptom.

The Italian tourists visited various places in Jhunjhunu, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur and Udaipur districts before reaching Jaipur on February 28. Udaipur hotel rooms where they had stayed were closed, while the hotel staff at all other places disinfected the rooms and cleaned the corridors, lifts, doors, handles, telephones, tables and chairs.The State government has constituted rapid response teams in all medical colleges for epidemic investigation and screening of all who came in contact with the Italian tourists. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot convened a high-level meeting at his residence to monitor the situation.

Mr. Sharma said the tourist guides, helpers, hotel staff members, bus driver and cleaner who had served or came in close contact with the group would be home-quarantined for 14 days.

184,2020/03/04,"Infant deaths: Gujarat CM has no right to continue, says Congress","Maximum number of deaths from Amit Shah’s constituency, it says.

Launching a scathing attack on the BJP government in Gujarat over the death of over 15,000 infants during treatment at new-born care units across the State in the past two years, the Congress on Wednesday demanded Chief Minister Vijay Rupani’s resignation over the issue.

NHRC tells Rajasthan to explain Kota deaths

“15,013 infants died. Every day 20 infants are dying. The maximum number of infant deaths — 4,322 — in Ahmedabad. This is Amit Shah’s parliamentary constituency. Will the cries of babies be heard? Will anyone raise questions? Will the TV media show courage?” asked Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala in a tweet.

The data on new-born mortality was given out by Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, also the Health Minister, on Tuesday to questions raised by Congress lawmakers in Gujarat. Mr. Patel had said 15,013 of the 1.06 lakh infants admitted to the units during 2018 and 2019 had died during treatment.

Congress MP Amee Yajnik and senior Congress leader from Gujarat Shaktisinh Gohil told reporters outside Parliament that guidelines were issued to the units like keeping two new-borns three metres apart to prevent infection but those were violated.

“But when we visited these centres, we saw babies being put next to each other,” Mr. Gohil said. “The secondmost deaths are reported from Rajkot from where the Chief Minister is elected. He has no right to stay on in the post and should resign.”

Over 100 infants die in two Jodhpur hospitals

Mr. Gohil also hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Shah for not showing ‘sensitivity’ towards the issue.

“When you talk about Gujarat’s social indicators, when you talk about the health system, you see that utmost insensitivity is shown towards them. Over 15,000 infant deaths, the responsibility also lies with the State government to haul up these hospitals, to haul up these healthcare facilities,” Ms. Yajnik said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4dnuqd/article30891000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23SURJEWALA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/infant-deaths-gujarat-cm-has-no-right-to-continue-says-congress/article30984105.ece

Congress MLA Nurul Huda on Wednesday said in the Assam Assembly that the vandalising of a mosque in Baksa district on March 1 night was pre-planned and followed a pattern of attacks on Muslims in areas under the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC).

Non-Muslims living around the Kalapani Anchalik Mosque on Tuesday gifted copies of the Koran after a peace committee meeting to ease tension.

“The attack on the mosque and burning of copies of the holy Koran followed the murder of some minority leaders in BTC.

“Why should we remain silent to the organised attacks?” Mr. Huda said.

186,2020/03/04,Mizo group slams Chakma NGOs for letter to PM,"Memorandum attributed ‘unabated influx of foreigners’ and illegal activities to open border with Myanmar

The Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP, Mizo Students’ Union) has slammed Chakma political leaders and NGOs for writing to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, complaining about victimisation through an allegedly illegal National Register of Citizens (NRC), and demanding that the Mizoram-Myanmar border be sealed.

Also Read Ground Zero | Being Bru in Mizoram

Mizoram and Myanmar share a 404km-long border and an agreement between the two countries allows people in border villages to travel up 16 km in each other’s territory from the border without any documents.

The Chakma organisations attributed “unabated influx of foreigners”, smuggling of drugs, arms and other illegal activities to the open border.

‘Creating rift’

The MZP said the memorandum by the Chakmas to Mr. Modi was aimed at creating a rift between the people of Mizoram and Myanmar. “Chakma NGOs should stay within their limits,” MZP leader Peter Chhangte said.

The Mizos are ethnically related to the Chins of Myanmar, unlike the Chakmas, many of whom are seen as infiltrators from Bangladesh.

The Mizoram-Bangladesh border is 318km long.

In their memorandum to the Prime Minister on March 2, the Chakma groups said the Mizoram government was targeting their community by conducting an “illegal” NRC in Lunglei district. The State government has been conducting the NRC drive without the sanction of either the Centre or the Supreme Court, which monitored the exercise in Assam, they said.

Additional questions

They also pointed out that the forms issued by the local authorities for the registering citizens had five questions more than Assam’s NRC, which included religion, place of birth and name of village last settled in. The villagers were also asked to provide food, accommodation and translators for the officials who conducted the exercise.

193,2020/03/04,COVID-19 being hyped to divert attention from Delhi riots: Mamata Banerjee,"The West Bengal CM said people who died in Delhi did not die due to ‘coronavirus, dengue or swine flu’.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday alleged that a section of the media was playing up the spread of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) to deflect public attention from the Delhi riots.

Addressing a rally at Buniyaadpur in Dakshin Dinajpur district of north Bengal the Trinamool Congress chairperson accused the media of ‘playing up’ the outbreak of COVID-19.

“Today, a lot of people are shouting corona, corona, a bit too much. Yes, certainly it is a disease, and the entire world is concerned about it. But do not make people panicky,” she said.

Ms. Banerjee said that the people who died in Delhi did not die due to “coronavirus, dengue or swine flu”.

“Some channels are playing it up in an effort to make people forget the incidents of Delhi. Do report when it occurs. We don’t want it to spread. We don’t want a single person to be infected in Bengal by the disease. But do remember, all those who died in Delhi did not die of coronavirus, dengue, encephalitis or swine flu,” she added.

The Chief Minister said had those people in Delhi “died of the virus we would have at least known they died due to a dreaded disease for which there is no remedy or cure”.

She reiterated that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre had not “expressed any remorse or said sorry” about the deaths of so many people in Delhi. “Instead of that they are organising a rally here and saying ‘goli maaro...’ [They should] keep in mind that Bengal is not Delhi,” she said.

Clarifies remark

Ms. Banerjee also clarified the remarks she had made about “Bangladeshis” on Tuesday and warned the media that she would take legal action if her words were distorted.

“After 1947, when people came as refugees to India, there was a Liaquat-Nehru Pact. According to that, those who came to India as refugees are Indian citizens,” she said, referring to the understanding signed in 1950 by the then Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and his Pakistani counterpart Liaquat Ali Khan.

Ms. Banerjee also cited The India-Bangladesh Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Peace signed in 1972 between Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her Bangladesh counterpart Mujibur Rahman after the creation of Bangladesh.

“I have only spoken in that light. Have I said anything wrong?,” she said, threatening legal action if her words were distorted.

194,2020/03/04,"In midnight drama, Congress ‘rescues’ Madhya Pradesh MLAs","Claims it rescued 6 legislators held hostage by the party in Haryana

In a dramatic turn of events past Tuesday midnight, the Congress claimed it had “rescued” a group of Madhya Pradesh lawmakers from a five-star hotel in Manesar (Haryana) who were reportedly “held hostage” by the BJP to topple the Kamal Nath-led Congress government in M.P.

On Wednesday evening, a special plane carrying six MLAs from the Congress, BSP and SP arrived in Bhopal along with Madhya Pradesh Finance Minister Tarun Bhanot.

Chief Minister Kamal Nath said the BJP was making repeated attempts to destabilise the government. “With the money power of the mafia, it has been planning to come to power in an undemocratic way. Land mafia, organised crime mafia and spurious drugs mafia had all flourished under the 15-year rule of the BJP. Freeing Madhya Pradesh from them didn’t go down well with the BJP.”

Mr. Kamal Nath said the BJP had “murdered” democratic and constitutional principles in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Haryana and Goa. It now wanted to do that in Madhya Pradesh.

“We have full confidence in our MLAs, and don’t doubt their allegiance and honesty. Black money earned through corruption and scams has come out in the open, and BJP’s conspiracies will come to naught,” he said.

Senior leader from the State Jyotiraditya Scindia told The Hindu that there was no threat to the Congress government in the State. “It is all under control and we are all together,” he said.

Former Chief Minister and BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan, however, denied the charge and said the Kamal Nath government was riddled with internal contradictions.

The episode comes a day after former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh accused the BJP of luring its legislators with bribes and said a former BJP Minister had ferried suspended BSP MLA Rambai Parihar, who supports the government, to New Delhi.

The Congress, which holds 114 Assembly seats, claims this is the fourth failed attempt by the BJP, which has 107 seats, to subvert its government that was elected in December 2018, and is supported by all the four independents, a suspended and a sitting BSP MLA and the lone SP MLA.

On establishing contact with two of the MLAs, including Ms. Parihar, Mr. Singh’s son Jaivardhan Singh and MP Higher Education Minister Jitu Patwari reached the hotel in Haryana past midnight, where they were refused entry allegedly by policemen in civil dress. They managed to bring back four Congress, one BSP and an SP MLA. But by then, three Congress and an independent MLA had already been ferried to Bengaluru, said State Congress media in-charge Shobha Oza.

“They’ve not returned yet. The leadership is in touch with them, and the situation is under control,” she said.

The alleged attempt comes ahead of the Rajya Sabha vacancies in the State next month. Of the three vacancies, Congress and BJP are assured of one seat each with 58 first preference votes. The fight is for the third seat where the Congress has a clear edge if none cross votes.

Slamming the BJP, Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala tweeted: “To trample the Constitution is now the BJP’s character. Where they cant form a coalition, they start pulling down governments. They simply cant accept that they have been given a mandate to keep away from power.

The striking Bihar contractual teachers are to get respectable increase in their salary but their demand for pay parity with permanent teachers would not be met in the wake of Supreme Court’s order, said Deputy Chief Minister and senior State BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi.

Over 3.5 lakh contractual teachers are on strike since February 17 demanding pay parity with about 80, 000 permanent teachers in Bihar. Their eight-point charter of demands includes reverting to old pension schemes.

The strike has severely affected functioning of the schools as most of them are locked. The evaluation of answer sheets of Class 12 examinations held recently and the conduct of Class X board examinations have been severely affected.

“We’ll make a respectable increase in their (striking teachers) salary…Chief Minister Nitish Kumar already has announced this and it was the NDA government which had earlier increased their salary,” Mr. Modi announced in the State council on Tuesday while responding to a debate on the third supplementary Budget for 2019-20.

The striking teachers would not get salary parity with permanent teachers in the wake of the Supreme Court order in this matter, he said.

FIR filed against many teachers

Hundreds of striking teachers had been suspended in different districts such as Begusarai, Gopalgunj, Kaimur, Patna and others. Some of them have also been dismissed on the charge of “indiscipline” and FIR too has been lodged against several of them.

However, the striking teachers said, “until our demands are met, we’ll not return to our work…its better to starve to death while on strike than to resuming our duty”. The strike call has been given by the Bihar Rajya Shikshak Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti, a joint platform of 26 school teachers associations.

“Teachers have a democratic right to protest and the government cannot snatch our rights to protest,” said the members of striking teachers associations while, adding “we’ll also not participate in the upcoming National Population Register exercise said to begin in the State in the month of May”.

Several Opposition leaders have been raising the issue of striking teachers in the Assembly and council for several days while requesting the government to meet their demand in the “interest of education of students which has been hampered severally due to the strike”.

“According to a rough estimate, over 50,000 schools are locked for the last two-weeks and students are sitting at home…who will take responsibility for this, if not government,” asked the Opposition leaders.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/293fms/article30979395.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUSHILMODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/striking-bihar-teachers-to-get-salary-increment-but-not-pay-parity-says-deputy-cm-sushil-modi/article30979396.ece

The city-based Maharashtra Institute of Technology’s World Peace University (MIT-WPU) has issued a circular “cautioning” writers submitting articles or papers to ensure their content does not appear to be against the government or “any statutory authorities”.

The circular, which has been accessed by The Hindu, says that only articles approved by the vice chancellor would be sent for publication. “It is the responsibility of the writer to ensure that the content [is] factually correct, does not hurt the sentiment of readers and it does not sound being against the government or any statutory authorities,” reads the circular.

Speaking to The Hindu, Dr. Prashant Dave, registrar, MIT-WPU, categorically refuted suggestions of the circular forcing writers to toe a pro-government line, stating that while expressing an opinion was a fundamental right of the writer, such an opinion could be misconstrued by outsiders as being the opinion of the organisation.

“This notification is purely a cautionary circular … While the author of any article or a paper has complete freedom to express his or her opinion even if it goes against the government, we urge that they base their arguments on sound evidence. Governments come and go and the purpose of this circular is certainly not to discourage writers and articles from expressing their opinions, merely that they express opinions supplemented by sound arguments,” he said.

Dr. Dave also denied suggestions that the circular was necessitated because of previous incidents where articles advocating an anti-government stance had been submitted for publication.

The circular goes on to say that the content must “not trigger any controversy of political, social or religious nature” and should be purely academic and unbiased in nature. It then says that before publishing articles, the writer must submit them “through the Dean/ Pro-Vice-Chancellor to the V-C and that only those approved by the latter would be sent for publication”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/n4oca9/article30976731.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04bmcampus,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/varsity-cautions-writers-not-to-submit-anti-govt-articles/article30976732.ece

“No proposal has come to me regarding Muslim reservation. We will check its validity once it comes to us. We have not taken any decision yet on it,” Mr. Thackeray told reporters on the sidelines of ongoing Budget session. His remarks come days after Minority Affairs Minister Nawab Malik said in the Council that the State will set aside 5% quota for Muslims in education.

“I also urge those who are creating a ruckus on the issue to save your energy and use it when the issue comes up for discussion. The issue has not come up yet. The Shiv Sena has not yet clarified its position on this. Let us see, when the proposal comes up. We will then decide,” he added.

Ayodhya visit

Mr. Thackeray said he was going to Ayodhya on March 7 to offer prayers to Lord Ram. “I have faith and therefore, I am heading for a darshan. Where’s the question of politics in having a glimpse of god? Where is politics in it? The doors of god don’t get shut just because you formed an alliance with the Congress or some other party. God is god and belongs to everyone. I will go [to Ayodhya],” he said, adding that, those who want to come, will come. “Gods doors are not closed for anyone,” he said.

On his wife Rashmi Thackeray’s appointment as editor of party mouthpiece Saamana, Mr. Thackeray said he had to quit as editor after the chief ministership unexpectedly came to him. “Saamana, Shiv Sena and Thackeray can’t be separated. We are one family. With Rashmi becoming editor, there were speculations if the language of the paper will change. I want to tell that the language will remain the same. Editorial responsibility will continue to be handled by Sanjay Raut,” he said.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said it would not be possible to take contractual government employees on the payroll.

He was responding to a question by Kiran Pawaskar (NCP) in the Legislative Council on the State’s stand on the issue. Mr. Pawar went on to explain that the State’s gross income, including borrowings, is ₹4 lakh crore, of which ₹1.51 lakh crore is spent on salaries and pensions.

This amount includes ₹1.15 lakh crore disbursed toward salaries of existing employees and ₹36,368 crore toward funds.

“I agree that everyone here feels that contractual staff should have the same benefits as permanent employees but over the next few years, there will be the Eighth Pay Commission, and then the Ninth Pay Commission, and it will cost the State exchequer money it will not be able to afford.”

Listing the number of employees on the State payroll, Mr. Pawar said there were 5.5 lakh employees of the State, another nine lakh employees of aided institutes, 7.5 lakh old pensioners and 2.78 lakh new pensioners.

He explained that in 2005, the Central government decided to do away with the old pension scheme, wherein 10% of an employee’s pension was deducted from his salary, and 10% was put in by the State. However, as per the new policy, the State government has to chip in with 14%, Mr. Pawar said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/cx65l2/article30976673.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BMHEALTHWORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/employees-on-contract-cant-be-made-permanent-deputy-cm/article30976674.ece

The Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI) in Pune is registered under the Companies Act, 2013, as a non-profit government company for research, policy advocacy and training for socio-economic and educational development of Maratha, Maratha-Kunbi, Kunbi-Maratha, Kunbi communities and the families dependent on agriculture.

The previous government started it on the lines of the Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Research and Training Institute aimed at providing opportunities to the youth from the scheduled caste community.

After allegations of irregularities, the State government had appointed a committee under Relief and Rehabilitation secretary Kishor Raje-Nimbalkar to conduct an inquiry.

It was the first official investigation announced by the Maha Vikas Aghadi government into the functioning of the previous government.

Some of the irregularities included violations in purchasing cars, unauthorised hiring of staff, the managing director’s failure to inform the government that the chairman had resigned, and irregularities in purchase of books.

On Tuesday, member Satish Chavan raised a calling attention motion in the Council on Tuesday asking why no action has been taken against the accused despite a report listing a series of irregularities.

In his response, Mr. Wadettiwar said, “A committee under the additional chief secretary will go through the report and submit its recommendations in 10 days. No student will be deprived of his scholarship. Besides, we are filling posts. We will have three permanent posts for SARTHI.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sarthi-probe-panel-report-in-10-days/article30976645.ece
207,2020/03/04,Couple tortured in Maharashtra to force them to withdraw rape complaint,"Woman, husband stripped, beaten up by 8 including her brother, brothers-in-law

The Ahmednagar police late on Monday registered a case against eight people for allegedly stripping and mercilessly beating up a husband and wife last month. A video clip of the disturbing incident surfaced recently.

According to the police, the gruesome incident, which was recorded by one of the miscreants, occurred sometime last month near Ahmednagar civil hospital, with the wrongdoers allegedly trying to intimidate the couple to withdraw a rape complaint filed by the woman against them in 2016.

The police said the miscreants include the woman’s brother, her two brothers-in-law and two others pretending to be policemen.

Drugged, abducted

The husband and wife were apparently returning from the hospital in an autorickshaw late last month when they were given an inhalation drug by a person who was seated next to them and abducted.

The victims, in their complaint to the police, said they were taken to a room and confined there. The miscreants then allegedly threatened the couple to withdraw the complaint filed against them by the woman accusing them of gang-raping her in 2016.

The couple were then stripped and hung upside down, while repeatedly being thrashed with belts.

“After seeing the clip, we have registered a case of attempt to murder, criminal intimidation and other offences under sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act against eight people,” said an official from Ahmednagar’s Tofkhana police station.

The victims told the police they were also doused with petrol by the miscreants, who warned them that they would pay with their lives unless they retracted the 2016 complaint.

‘No faith in police’

Meanwhile, speaking to a vernacular channel, the couple said they had no faith in the Ahmednagar police, who had delayed registering the woman’s rape complaint in 2016. They demanded that the case be handed over to the State Criminal Investigation Department.

Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis of the Bharatiya Janata Party raised the matter in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday.

State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said a woman IPS officer would be appointed to investigate the case and the probe would be completed within a month’s time.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/iqhvwj/article30976569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4bmthrashing,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/couple-tortured-to-force-them-to-withdraw-rape-complaint/article30976570.ece
208,2020/03/04,"COVID-19 | Ready to tackle situation, says A.P. Deputy CM","The Deputy Chief Minister said not a single COVID-19 case was registered in the State

Andhra Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister A.K.K. Srinivas said here on Tuesday that there was no impact of the deadly novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the State but the health machinery was on full alert to handle the situation.

Rapid response teams, comprising a microbiologist, physicians, epidemiologist and paramedical staff, have been kept ready in each district and all precautionary measures put in place. The respective district collectors would be the nodal officers, he said.

Addressing a press conference at the Secretariat, along with Special Chief Secretary (Health) K.S. Jawahar Reddy, the Deputy Chief Minister said not a single COVID-19 case was registered in the State.

“We have sent blood samples of 11 people for examination in Pune but not one tested positive. More than 263 passengers, who came (by flight) from various foreign countries over the past few days, were screened for the deadly virus”, he said.

Of the 263 passengers, 50 were kept under home quarantine while two were admitted to hospital. Observation of the rest was completed and they were found to be normal, he added.

As many as 1,125 people, who arrived over the past few days by ships at Visakhapatnam, Gangavaram, Krishnapatnam, Kakinada and Ravva seaports, were also tested but not one case tested positive, he added.

The deputy chief minister said 448 isolation ward beds have been kept ready to handle the virus cases.

Referring to reports that 17 passengers from Andhra Pradesh travelled with the virus-hit software professional from Bengaluru to Hyderabad, the deputy chief minister said they were trying to get the details.

“If any such passenger is found, we are ready to conduct necessary medical tests. A state-level call centre has also been opened in Vijayawada for assistance and advice on COVID-19,” he said.

The state was coordinating with the Centre to handle the virus cases, if any, and a team from the state would also be attending a training programme in New Delhi on March 6.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-ready-to-tackle-situation-says-ap-deputy-cm/article30976499.ece
209,2020/03/04,Kiranjeet fails dope test,"Long-distance runner provisionally suspended by World Athletics

Long-distance runner Kiranjeet Kaur, who won the Tata Steel Kolkata 25K among the Indians, has tested positive for a banned substance and has been provisionally suspended by World Athletics.

210,2020/03/04,Athletics Federation of India raises the bar for men,"Federation explains that it has not gone soft on women

A close study of the Athletics Federation of India's entry standards for this year's National championships throws up an interesting picture. The federation has raised the bar in five men’s events. It has pushed up the standard in just the discus throw for women.

AFI secretary C.K. Valson, however, explained that the national body had not gone out of its way to make life easier for women.

“No... the women’s standards are already high. So, we did not touch it,” Valson told The Hindu on Monday.

Low standards

“In the men’s section, our standards were low earlier, so we wanted to raise them to get the best. We want people to challenge it.”

Incidentally, the qualification in the men's 3000m steeple chase has been made tougher by 20 seconds — from 9:50s to 9:30s — while it has been raised to 68m (increase of three metres) in men's javelin.

Was it the Avinash Sable and Neeraj Chopra effect? Sable was on a national record-breaking spree last year and had entered the Doha World championships final and made the cut for this year's Tokyo Olympics.

The 2018 Commonwealth and Asian Games javelin champion Chopra inspired many in the country to go past 80m.

“Yes, you can say it’s a sort of Sable effect in steeple chase. Though his standard is very high when compared to the others, the fact that we have raised it means more people are doing better than before,” said Valson.

Based on Olympic mark

He explained that the entry standards were fixed based on the Olympic standards.

“Suppose we have the Olympic standard as 9.9s (in the men's 100m), if we don't raise the entry standard to 11s for our nationals, it won't be okay. That is the concept we normally follow,” he said.

The men’s 200, 400 and 800m are the other events where the qualification marks have been raised but the federation has surprisingly lowered the entry levels in the men’s shot put (from 15.50m to 15m) and discus (from 45.50m to 45).

“The reason is, we should have at least 18 to 20 athletes doing that event. If you notice, many would not have reached 15.50m in national competitions last year. We fix a standard so that we can have at least 15 athletes; otherwise I will be running a competition with just 10 people,” explained Valson, who is also the Competitions Director for Asian athletics.",athletics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/vp1an5/article30975182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03SABLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/athletics-federation-of-india-raises-the-bar-for-men/article30975183.ece
211,2020/03/04,Rutuja and Ankita win it for India,"Rutuja Bhosale and Ankita Raina helped India take a 2-0 lead over Uzbekistan in the second league match of the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania group-1 women’s tennis tournament here on Wednesday.

Rutuja fought her way past Akgul Amanmuradova 2-6, 6-2, 7-5 in the first rubber, and Ankita recovered from a tough situation to overwhelm Sabina Sharipova 7-5, 6-1 in the second rubber, after having trailed 3-5 in the first set.

This was the much anticipated win for India after the 0-3 loss to top seed China in the first tie on Tuesday. Ankita had played a vibrant three-set thriller against World No. 29 Wang Qiang in the tie against China.

Having won the tie, India opted to field Sowjanya Bavisetti and Riya Bhatia for the doubles, and preserved former World No. 1 doubles star Sania Mirza for the tougher matches ahead.

China continued to assert its strength as it beat Indonesia 3-0, while Chinese Taipei beat Korea 2-1, thanks to the decisive doubles victory through Hao-Ching Chan and Yung-Jan Chan.

212,2020/03/04,CSK has helped me tackle difficult times: Dhoni,"Gearing up for a return to competitive cricket with the IPL, Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni credited his franchise for making him a better player and helping him tackle some difficult situations both on and off the field.

Dhoni, who has been on a sabbatical since India’s semifinal exit from the ODI World Cup last year, on Monday received a rousing reception at the the MA Chidambaram Stadium here during his first training session with CSK ahead of the event beginning March 29.

“...CSK has helped me improve in everything, whether it was being a human being or being a cricketer, handling situations that are tough both in and out of the field and how to be humble once you are doing well,” Dhoni was quoted as saying on a Star Sports show.

His ardent CSK fans fondly call him ‘Thala’, and the 38-year-old said the love and respect he has got from them is special. “‘Thala’ basically means brother, so for me it’s more the abstract of the fans, the love and affection towards me is the reflection of that,” he said.

“Whenever I am in Chennai or down South they never call me by my name, they address me as ‘Thala’ and the moment someone calls me ‘Thala’ they are showing their love and respect but at the same time he is a CSK fan.”

Ex-India batsman and former national team batting coach Sanjay Bangar said the break Dhoni had taken could help him reinvent himself.

“It is tough to find rhythm initially but it can also be a huge advantage. When you are playing international cricket, the amount of pressure you are under, you sort of getting into a tunnel vision with regard to various responsibility and the needs of the team.

“So from a player perspective, if he has taken a break for 6-7 months, he has a good chance to rediscover, refresh and reinvent.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/aseert/article30984355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05DHONI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/csk-has-helped-me-tackle-difficult-times-dhoni/article30984356.ece
213,2020/03/04,Arun Lal — the man behind Bengal’s march,"His rigorous coaching methods, which came in for criticism, now stands vindicated.

Coach Arun Lal, the hard task-master who oversaw Bengal’s magical journey in the Ranji Trophy this season, says there is no magic formula and there is no substitute for hard work.

In fact, hard work was the magic mantra that scripted the revival of Bengal. The side found itself in a soup every now and then but found a way to fight back.

“It’s the team which matters, individuals don’t,” Lal kept saying. Six debutants, including 31-year-old seamer Nilkantha Das, got to serve Bengal even as the established ones contributed as well.

The Vision 2020 programme — which extended its sphere to include the Ranji players — helped.

Foundation

The foundation of the turnaround was laid in the pre-season. Since July 25, the players have gone through rigorous training to be ready for bigger challenges.

Lal shared how Bishan Bedi once put the Punjab team through a back-breaking pre-season. “He made the guys run. Even if someone threw up, then he said, ‘Okay, now do another round.’ The 200-odd boys came down to 120 and eventually to 40.”

Lal added, “When I made these boys run for 25 rounds, there was a lot of criticism.” He ignored the write-ups in the press which mocked the idea by asking whether the Bengal cricketers would be competing in the Olympics. The 64-year-old’s method is now vindicated.

A St. Stephen’s College alumnus brought up in Delhi, Lal — a former India opener and a member of the Bengal side that won the Ranji Trophy 30 years ago. Lal, who overcame cancer, is an extremely positive person, combining intelligence and ruthlessness in coaching.

Former captain Manoj Tiwary acknowledges Lal’s contribution.

“Lal sir is very upright and speaks from the heart. He keeps everyone under pressure.”

Bowling consultant Ranadeb Bose adds, “Lalji has not been talking about winning Ranji Trophy, he has been talking about doing our job well.”

Even in the absence of Ashoke Dinda and Mohammed Shami, the lesser-known pacers showed discipline and worked like a team. As a bowling unit, Bengal has given away a maximum of 250 runs in an innings only once.

Ishan Porel (22 wickets) raised his performance, Mukesh (30) showed maturity, Akash Deep (30) made an impact in his debut season and Nilkantha was exceptional within his limits.

When the top-order batting failed on several instances, the middle order rose to the occasion. Anustup Mjumdar (641 runs) and Shahbaz Ahmed (493 runs, 30 wickets) produced some match-winning performances. Tiwary (672) also played his part in crucial moments.

Ahead of the final against Saurashtra, Lal said, “We have got a fabulous group of boys. Yet we are below our potential.

“God helps the opposition when we get everything right.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/jjbq14/article30984273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05BENGAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/arun-lal-the-man-behind-bengals-march/article30984274.ece

217,2020/03/04,Tackling Poonam will be the key: Knight,"England captain says the Indian is a massive threat and an improved bowler since the last World Cup

England captain Heather Knight feels tackling spinners, particularly the in-form Poonam Yadav, will be crucial to her side’s chances of upstaging an unbeaten India in the semifinals of the Women’s T20 World Cup here on Thursday.

“We’ve practised for her a lot, I thought we played her outstandingly in the last T20 World Cup and that was due to the preparation we had,” Knight said.

“We don’t have (assistant coach) Ali Maiden anymore, who bowled brilliant leg-spin, but we’ve got a few coaches who have bowled it brilliantly and we’ve been really clear on how we’re going to do things against her.”

Poonam’s ability to deceive on Australian pitches has forced Knight to take note ahead of their crunch match.

“She’s a massive threat for them and is an improved bowler since the last World Cup, so for us to be successful, we’re going to have to play her and all their spinners well.

218,2020/03/04,Unadkat fires Saurashtra into final,"Rattles Gujarat with an incisive spell, accounts for big wickets of Parthiv and Gandhi

A lanky pacer from Porbandar, birthplace of the Mahatma, put the brakes on a memorable march of a Patel and a Gandhi to help Saurashtra emerge on the winning side of the Gujarat Derby and book a place in the Ranji Trophy final for the second season in succession.

Jaydev Unadkat’s (7/56) twin strikes rattled Gujarat early on, leaving the visiting side tottering at 19 for three, after starting the last day’s play at 7/1 in quest of 327. Captain Parthiv Patel (93, 148b, 13x4) was in trouble of running out of partners even before lunch when at 63 for five Chirag Gandhi (96, 139b, 16x4) joined him.

The duo’s 158-run partnership was threatening the home side and its vocal supporters, when Unadkat came back with a dream spell to script a memorable 92-run win at the SCA stadium. The victory margin, though, doesn’t really reflect proceedings on a tense Tuesday.

While Saurashtra couldn’t have asked for a better start than the four scalps in the morning, it knew the game was alive until veteran Parthiv was at the crease. Gujarat, on the other hand, hoped for its captain to stage an encore of the 2016-17 final when Parthiv’s 143 anchored a similar chase of 313 against Mumbai at Indore.

With the ball softening, conditions turning batting-friendly and Unadkat taking a break, Parthiv and Gandhi started milking the medium-pacers. By tea time, Gujarat had raced to 205 for five, having added 101 in 26 overs after lunch.

With 122 required off 36 overs and the new ball due in 16 overs, it was time to start the countdown for Gujarat. But Unadkat, having bowled 1,500-plus deliveries this season before the start of play, came back for a lethal spell (4.2-2-22-4) to finish the game off in less than an hour.

He took the ball right on resumption and went for 13 runs, with Gandhi and Parthiv entering the 90s, in his first over. In the next, he got rid of the two Patels — Parthiv (nicked to first slip with one that moved away) and Axar (low return catch) — to all but seal the game. With Dharmendrasinh Jadeja getting rid of Roosh Kalaria in the next over, Unadkat came back to coerce Gandhi into chopping one back on to his stumps.

It was fitting that Unadkat’s seventh victim — last-man Arzan Nagwaswalla caught by Harvik Desai in the slips — signalled the end of the match, paving way for the pumped-up left-arm pacer’s wild burst of celebration.

The scores: Saurashtra — 1st innings: 304.

Gujarat — 1st innings: 252.

Saurashtra - 2nd innings: 274.

Gujarat — 2nd innings: Samit Gohel c Desai b Unadkat 5, Priyank Panchal c Dharmendrasinh 0, Bhargav Merai lbw b Mankad 14, Dhruv Raval c & b Unadkat 5, Parthiv Patel c Desai b Unadkat 93, Rujul Bhatt c Jackson b Jani 1, Chirag Gandhi b Unadkat 96, Axar Patel c & b Unadkat 0, Roosh Kalaria c Barot b Dharmendrasinh 1, Chintan Gaja (not out) 4, Arzan Nagwaswalla c Desai b Unadkat 4; Extras (b-1, lb-7, nb-1, w-2): 11; Total (in 72.2 overs): 234.

219,2020/03/04,Nobody does it better than the Kiwis,"A smorgasbord of seamers ambushed India in conditions that assisted swing and on pitches that offered bounce

Much like Carly Simon’s chart-buster ‘Nobody Does It Better’ from the James Bond superhit, the Spy Who Loved Me, nobody pulls off a strategy better than New Zealand on the cricket field.

The seamers dismantled the ‘strong’ Indian batting. And here the New Zealand think-tank of skipper Kane Williamson and coach Gary Stead went back to an old Kiwi attribute — planning and execution.

Yes, nobody does it better!

Bowlers win matches and Willamson’s smorgasbord of seamers, diverse with different strengths, ambushed India in conditions that assisted swing and on pitches that offered bounce and seam movement.

Sorting out Kohli

Just look at the manner New Zealand sorted out Virat Kohli in the series. They had seen videos of the Indian captain, knew he could be vulnerable to deliveries that move either way from the third or fourth stump, and plotted his downfall.

Kohli had run into problems against Southee in the past. So the experienced right-armer was employed against the Indian skipper and he ruthlessly exploited the chink by pitching the ball up and forcing Kohli to play the ball.

Kohli kept dragging his front foot across off-stump and succumbed to deliveries leaving him or darting in. But the icing on the cake for the Kiwis was how they got Colin de Grandhomme, with his medium-paced swing, to scalp Kohli in the second innings at Christchurch.

Dropping his guard

The plan was the same but Kohli, aware of the Southee threat, might just have dropped his guard a tad against Grandhomme. But then the ball seamed in, and Kohli was gone.

The Kiwis bowled in partnerships. Cheteshwar Pujara has an issue with deliveries nipping back; his defence had been pierced in the past.

And Trent Boult, among the finest left-armers in the business, went round the wicket to swing the ball into him. Pujara, after his conquests in Australia, walked back a defeated man after Boult cleaned him up in the second innings at the Hagley Oval.

The Jamieson factor

And the Kiwis, with cricketing nous, disrupted the footwork of the Indian batsmen. There was Kyle Jamieson, all of 6’8, pushing the batsmen on to the back-foot with his extra bounce.

And after getting the batsmen to travel back with his lift, Jamieson struck with his fuller length deliveries; the batsmen pegged back by bounce, were caught at the crease.

According to Kiwi sources, as soon as Jamieson troubled India in the ODI series with his line, lift and movement, a decision was made to play him in the eleven against India. His batting was a bonus.

And Jamieson’s four and five-wicket hauls in the Indian first innings at both Wellington and Christchurch opened the Tests for New Zealand. The breach had been made.

All angles covered

New Zealand’s right and left-arm seamers were all brilliant in a key aspect. Using the crease and creating the angles. And on the field, the brilliant Williamson had the angles covered.

Indeed, the combination of accurate bowling from both ends and flexible and quickly changing fields with aggressive intent — there were men in the cordon, at short-legs, and fielders for the miscued drives and hooks, created the pressure.

The Kiwi pacemen also psyched out the Indian batsmen with short-pitched bowling in the first Test. The short stuff’s key exponent Neil Wagner was missing in Wellington but Boult and Southee contained and struck with lifting deliveries from different angles. The Indian batsmen went into a shell.

Hook, line & sinker

So much so that the Indians decided to hook and pull everything thrown at them in the second Test where the surface was quicker than in Wellington.

They fell hook line and sinker into the Kiwi trap. Though the shot fetched the Indians some runs, it let them down at critical moments of the game; Hanuma Vihari and Pujara, in the first, and Prithvi Shaw and Ajinkya Rahane, in the second, being key examples.

And Williamson might have been humming the Carly Simon song!",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ns88o3/article30982905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05RAHANE1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nobody-does-it-better-than-the-kiwis/article30982906.ece

222,2020/03/04,Women’s T20 World Cup | ICC declines request for semifinal reserve day,"In case either or both the semifinal matches in Sydney on Thursday are washed out, India and South Africa will qualify for Sunday’s final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground having finished on top of their respective groups.

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has turned down Cricket Australia’s request to have a reserve day for the semifinals of the ongoing Women’s T20 World Cup here on Thursday.

India take on England while hosts Australia will play South Africa in the two semifinals here on Thursday but the forecast of rain throughout the afternoon threatens to jeopardise both fixtures.

Cricket Australia chief Kevin Roberts on Wednesday revealed that the apex body declined the request under tournament rules.

“We’ve asked the question (on a reserve day),” Cricket Australia chief Kevin Roberts was quoted as saying on the radio station ‘SEN’.

“It’s not part of the playing conditions and we respect that. We’re optimistic based on the drainage at the SCG combined with a weather forecast that is not perfect but not terrible either,” he added.

According to the rules laid out by the ICC for the tournament, there must be at least a 20 overs match with both sides playing 10 overs each.

“We’re really hopeful and planning for different scenarios tomorrow night but the important thing is getting our team ready to play a 10 over match, a 12 over match, an 18 over match or whatever it happens to be if it’s not a full 20-over contest,” Roberts said.

“It gives you cause to reflect and think about how you might improve things in the future but going into a tournament with a given set of playing conditions and rules, I don’t think it’s time to tinker with (the rules) as much as with an Australian hat I might love that,” he added.

ICC defends decision

However, an ICC spokesperson defended the decision, according to media reports, stating that adding a reserve day would extend the duration of T20 World Cup which is supposed to be “short and sharp”.

“The ICC T20 World Cups are short sharp events where reserve days are factored in for the final. Allowing for any other reserve days would have extended the length of the event, which isn’t feasible,” he said.

“There is a clear and fair alternative should there be no play in any of the semi-finals with the winner of the group progressing.”

In case either or both the semifinal matches are washed out, India and South Africa will qualify for Sunday’s final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground having finished on top of their respective groups.

On Tuesday, the final group B games were washed out with the match between South Africa and West Indies being abandoned without even a ball being bowled.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/yz3749/article30980832.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SCGK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/womens-t20-world-cup-icc-declines-request-for-semifinal-reserve-day/article30980833.ece
223,2020/03/04,"ICC Women’s T20 World Cup | In-form India takes on England in semis, seeks first final spot","In the earlier seven editions, India have never reached the final but this time, they have emerged as serious title contenders after a string of superlative performances.

India, firm title contenders after a sensational unbeaten run in the group stages, will have to ensure a solid all-round performance to get the better of formidable England in the semifinals of the ICC women’s T20 World Cup here on Thursday.

India have been the best side so far and they would be seeking their maiden final appearance in the showpiece’s history with a win over England on Thursday.

In the earlier seven editions, India have never reached the final but this time, they have emerged as serious title contenders after a string of superlative performances.

They began with a win over defending champions Australia and since then have gathered strength with every match, beating Bangladesh, New Zealand and Sri Lanka to top group A with eight points from four matches.

The Indians are in red-hot form, but history favours England as they have won all the five matches played between the two sides in this tournament.

The last time the two teams met in a T20 World Cup, England won by eight wickets in the semifinals in West Indies.

Before that, India lost in 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2016 editions - all in the group stages.

“After losing the last semifinal, as a team we realised we have to work as a unit, and right now you will see that our team is working as a unit and we are not reliant on just one or two players,” India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said, referring to the semifinals loss in 2018.

Seven players in this Indian team played in that semifinal and they would be looking to turn the tables on the English this time.

The Indians will also take confidence from the win against England in the tri-series in Australia ahead of this World Cup.

Strong Indian top order

On form, most of the Indians are in top form with teenage sensation Shafali Verma being the leading batter, having scored 161 runs in four innings, which has seen her rise to top spot in the ICC women’s T20 rankings.

With a batting average of 40.25, the 16-year-old is on the third spot among leading run-getters in the tournament, followed by England’s Natalie Sciver (202) and Heather Knight (193).

One-down Jemimah Rodrigues is also in good touch and has made useful contributions though she has not scored big so far, with 34 being her highest.

The middle order has also stepped up whenever needed with Veda Krishnamurthy, Shikha Pandey and Radha Yadav making their presence felt in different matches.

The two most experienced players in skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and opener Smriti Mandhana have, however, not been living up to the expectations and the semifinals could be their big comeback.

In the bowling department, leg-spinner Poonam Yadav is on top of the tournament chart with nine wickets from four matches. She has been ably supported by Shikha Pandey (7 from 4 matches).

For England, who have qualified for the semifinals after finishing second in group B with three wins and one loss, batting has been their strength.

Natalie has plundered 202 runs with an average of 67.33, including three fifties, and the Indians will have to find a way to stop her in her tracks.

In the bowling department also, England have the likes of left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone (8 wickets) and pacer Anya Shrubsole (7 wickets) who are at second and third spot in the tournament chart.

224,2020/03/04,The Hundred-England: Equal prize money for men and women,"The total prize budget of £600,000 would be split 50-50 between the women’s and men’s competitions as part of the governing body’s commitment to making cricket a gender-balanced sport: England and Wales Cricket Board

English cricket’s new Hundred competition will feature equal prize money for the men’s and women’s competitions, tournament organisers the England and Wales Cricket Board announced on Wednesday.

The ECB said the total prize budget of £600,000 ($769,000, €689,000 euros) would be split fifty-fifty between the women’s and men’s competitions as part of the governing body’s “commitment to making cricket a gender-balanced sport”.

The Hundred is a new tournament consisting of eight city-based franchise sides, breaking away from England’s traditional county system.

Teams will bat for 100 balls each, with overs lasting for 10 balls and bowlers either bowling five or 10 balls consecutively.

All eight franchises will feature both men’s and women’s teams, with the two competitions running side by side.

“This is a great announcement for women’s sport,” said England captain Heather Knight, who will skipper the London Spirit in the Hundred.

“Women’s professional cricket is on an exciting journey and whilst there is still a way to go to realise gender-parity, this move from the Hundred is a significant step in the right direction,” added Knight, who has led England to the semi-finals of the ongoing women’s Twenty20 World Cup in Australia.

“We’re all really excited about playing in the new competition and hopefully inspiring more young girls and boys to pick up a bat and ball.”

Beth Barrett-Wild, the head of the Hundred’s women’s competition, said: “The ECB is committed to transforming women’s and girls’ cricket, from inspiring young girls to pick up a bat for the first time, through to establishing the women’s game as a professional career option.

“This announcement today represents one signal of intent towards that commitment,” she added.

The ECB are adamant the Hundred will attract a new audience vital to safeguarding cricket’s long-term future.

But critics have questioned the need for a fourth format in an already crowded men’s schedule featuring first-class, one-day and Twenty20 matches, while concerns have been voiced over the Hundred’s potentially damaging knock-on effects to the existing 18-team county set-up.

225,2020/03/04,Shafali has brought happiness and positivity to Indian team: skipper Harmanpreet Kaur,"The 16-year-old Verma has scored 161 runs at a stunning strike rate of 161 in Australia, setting the tone for India’s four Group A victories

Shafali Verma has not only lit up the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup with her explosive batting but the “naughty” teenager has also added immense happiness and positivity to the Indian team off the field, feels captain Harmanpreet Kaur.

The 16-year-old Verma has scored 161 runs at a stunning strike rate of 161 in Australia, setting the tone for India’s four Group A victories with fearless batting despite being in her first global tournament.

Ahead of Thursday’s semifinal showdown with England at the Sydney Cricket Ground, her captain acknowledged what the fresh-faced teenager has offered India behind the scenes.

“She’s very naughty, gets so much happiness and positivity to the team, always wants to enjoy it,” Kaur said.

“And when batting with her she’s motivating you and releasing pressure, that kind of player you need in your team. Whoever is playing, wants to play for the country and give their best, she’s enjoying playing for the team,” she added.

Kaur said since this Indian side has been together for a while, it has now built a conducive environment for youngsters like Verma to prosper.

“Now this team has been together for a long time, we learn a lot from each other, learn a lot of cricket. It makes it easier for players such as Shafali because when anybody enters the team, they see everyone is working together.

“They also feel nice and try to do what others are doing,”she said.

The skipper, herself known to be a power-hitter, has endured a poor start to the tournament by failing to reach double digit scores.

Kaur insisted that everyone in the team is being handed out their roles to ensure that the side continues to perform well.

“Right now, what we are trying to do, is give individual roles so that everyone can come and perform for the team. I didn’t perform with the bat but the team is doing well and we are enjoying that. That is more important for us.”

Verma has certainly been in form Down Under but there’s no getting away from India’s disappointing women’s T20 World Cup record against England.

They have never beaten Heather Knight’s side in the competition, a run which includes an eight-wicket defeat in the 2018 semifinals.

But India are riding a wave in Australia, with an opening-night victory over the hosts paving the way for a flawless group stage.

“After losing the last semifinal, as a team we realised that we have to work as a unit, and right now you will see that our team is working as a unit and we are not reliant on just one or two players,” Kaur said.

“We just need to keep doing the right things and just focus on the right things instead of worrying about the past. We cannot change that, we are looking positive and I hope we will play as a team and try to win,” she added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pp7edg/article30979899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHAFALIVERMA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/shafali-has-brought-happiness-and-positivity-to-indian-team-skipper-harmanpreet-kaur/article30979900.ece
226,2020/03/04,Teen sensation Shafali Verma rises to top in ICC women’s T20 rankings,"Verma and England spinner Sophie Ecclestone will go into the semifinals of the event as the top ranked batter and bowler respectively

Teenage Indian batting sensation Shafali Verma on Wednesday rose to the top spot in the ICC women’s T20 International rankings, riding on her stellar run at the ongoing World Cup here.

The 16-year-old Verma takes over from New Zealand’s Suzie Bates, who had been the top batter since October 2018 after wresting the spot from West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor.

However, Smriti Mandhana has slipped a couple of rungs to sixth in the latest list.

Verma and England spinner Sophie Ecclestone will go into the semifinals of the event as the top ranked batter and bowler respectively. India will take on England on Thursday.

Verma’s explosive batting at the top of the order saw her score 161 runs in four innings, including knocks of 47 and 46 against Sri Lanka and New Zealand. It helped her become only the second India batter after Mithali Raj to top the women’s T20I batting rankings, according to an ICC statement.

Ecclestone, who took eight wickets in four matches including a best of 3 for 7 against the West Indies, is the first England bowler to be number one since Anya Shrubsole in April 2016 and the first England spinner at the top since Danni Hazell in August 2015.

Among the Indian bowlers, Poonam Yadav is up four places to eighth after a good run in the World Cup.

Some valiant performances from Sri Lanka skipper Chamari Athapaththu have seen her move from 18th to 14th spot for batters.

England’s Nat Sciver is again in the top 10 and captain Heather Knight in the top 15 for the first time.

South Africa opener Laura Wolvaardt has advanced 23 places to 44th, while Pakistan’s Aliya Riaz has gained 24 places and is 48th while New Zealand’s Maddy Green is in the top 100 after advancing 28 slots.

In the bowlers’ list, leg-spinners Amelia Kerr of New Zealand (up two places to fourth) and Australia’s George Wareham (up nine places to 10th) have made significant gains in the latest rankings update.

Other bowlers to advance include new-ball bowler Diana Baig of Pakistan (up 34 places to 13th), Shashikala Siriwardena of Sri Lanka (up seven places to 14th), Anya Shrubsole of England (up five places to 17th), Dane van Niekerk of South Africa (up 12 places to joint-22nd) and Shikha Pandey of India (up 23 places to joint-22nd).

New Zealand captain Sophie Devine is now the sole No.1 all-rounder after coming into the tournament as a joint No.1 along with Australia all-rounder Ellyse Perry.

India’s Deepti Sharma has advanced nine places to seventh, the first time that she is among the top 10 in the all-rounders’ list after also moving up to 53rd among batters.

The BCCI has decided to halve the prize money for this year’s IPL champions and the runners-up as part of its cost-cutting measures for the upcoming edition.

In a circular sent to all IPL franchises, the BCCI has notified that instead of a whopping ₹20 crore, the IPL champion team will now receive ₹10 crore. The glitzy events gets underway on March 29.

“The financial rewards have been reworked as a part of the cost cutting measures. The champions will get ₹10 crore instead of ₹20 crore. The runners-up will get ₹6.25 crore from earlier ₹12.5 crore,” a BCCI notification, in possession of PTI, read.

The two losing qualifiers will now get ₹4.3 crore each.

“The franchises are all in good health. They also have multiple ways like sponsorships to bolster their income. Hence the decision on prize money taken,” a senior BCCI source said.

However, state associations hosting IPL games will get ₹1 crore with franchises and BCCI contributing ₹50 lakh each.

The Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) of the BCCI is set to interview five candidates for the two vacant posts in the senior selection committee on Wednesday.

While BCCI president Sourav Ganguly reiterated that the “new selection panel will pick the team for the South Africa series,” the five who will appear for the interview are L. Sivaramakrishnan, Sunil Joshi, Venkatesh Prasad, Harvinder Singh and Rajesh Chauhan.

The shortlist makes it evident that the BCCI has decided not to tinker with the zonal make-up of the selection panel.

Chairman M.S.K. Prasad (South Zone) and Gagan Khoda (Central) are the ones who will be replaced. According to the revised rulebook of the BCCI, the zonal format is not mandatory.

229,2020/03/04,"NZ vs IND Test series: India did not show intent, says Jeremy Coney","Coney remembers Kapil’s assault in WSC

It’s one of those unforgettable vignettes from the World Series Cricket down under in the early 80s.

Jeremy Coney waving a white handkerchief after India’s force of nature Kapil Dev had clobbered him for a blaze of sixes. “It was a mock surrender of sorts!” Coney told The Hindu, even as he laughed. A blithe spirit and a fine cricketer, Coney led New Zealand with success. Batting in tough conditions against some great pacemen of the 70s and 80s, Coney made 2668 runs from 52 Tests at 37.57. He was also a handy seamer with 81 international wickets; Coney made 1874 runs from 88 ODIs.

A major figure in New Zealand cricket, Coney recalled the WSC game where Kapil went after him. “I actually bowled the first seven overs, gave little away. Then, Kapil entered. I was again tossed the ball. And Kapil bludgeoned me.

“There were many sixes, including the one over the sightscreen and a flat shoulder-high six over cover. Then, came out the handkerchief!”

Talk to Coney about the reasons for India’s series defeat here and he observed, “There is more bounce in New Zealand pitches than in India, more seam movement and swing too. You need to make mental and technical adjustments.”

Coney added, “I was surprised by the manner Virat Kohli batted. He was dragging his front foot wider and wider. And he seemed to be going hard at the ball than waiting for it. Swing bothered him.”

The former New Zealand captain said the Indians did not show enough intent. He elaborated: “Intent is not just about playing shots. It’s about solid front-foot defence. It can be a sure-footed back-foot defence or a good ‘leave’ outside off.”

Coney was disappointed by India’s performance. “They are the No. 1-ranked Test team in the world and I expected more from them. They were undone by both movement and bounce. And the short-pitched deliveries bothered them.”

The 67-year-old Coney travelled back to his own days. And he spoke about playing the West Indian fast bowlers. “You could smell fear when playing them. It was there in the air around the team facing those fast bowlers. It used to be bizarre. There would be nobody in front of the batsman! All the fielders would be 40 yards back behind the stumps.”

“So as a batsman you thought you could get easy runs in front of the wicket. There were no fielders there. But you bat for an hour and look at the scoreboard and you would be three not out! They gave you nothing.”

230,2020/03/04,India was found wanting in testing conditions,"Ignore the hype merchants, this Indian team is no world beater in Tests

SENA is an acronym that takes the Indian team out of its comfort zone in Tests. It stands for South Africa, England, New Zealand and Australia.

Also read: ICC Test ranking: India retains top spot, Kohli remains second in batsmen's list

These countries represent the toughest challenge for India, the batsmen in particular.

The New Zealand tour completed a cycle of SENA campaigns for India, beginning with the tour of South Africa in 2017-18.

Since then, India has toured England, Australia and New Zealand for the Test series. And what’s the score? It’s 1-3 against Virat Kohli and his men.

Unsatisfactory record

For a team ranked No. 1 in Tests, this is an unsatisfactory record. Kohli’s team likes to believe it is one of the great sides in world cricket and the best Indian team ever. That’s far from the truth.

Clive Lloyd’s bunch of conquerors steam-rolled opposition away from home. Then Steve Waugh’s men were formidable on foreign soil.

Also read: Kohli loses top spot in ICC Test Player rankings

And let’s not forget Bradman’s Invincibles. This Indian team is not even close to those sides.

While it’s true that India competed hard in South Africa, it eventually went down 1-2. India lost critical moments in the first two Tests and that hurt the side.

Then, India travelled to England. It was trounced 1-4 in the Test series but the scoreline did not reflect the intensity of the contests. India was found wanting in end-game skills.

Hour of glory

Then arrived India’s hour of glory when the side won its first ever Test series — the verdict was 2-1 — in Australia last season. Steve Smith and David Warner were missing from the Aussie line-up. But you cannot hold that against the Indians.

Interesting read: Kohli irked after New Zealand journalist asks about his celebration of Williamson’s dismissal

In New Zealand, India was swept aside 0-2 without any fight. In conditions where the ball swung, seamed and bounced, the Indian batting, lacking footwork, unsure of the off-stump, and undone by short-pitched bowling, stood totally exposed.

The quality of the New Zealand bowling was high. The response from the Indian batsmen was poor, and, at times, pathetic.

Kohli fails to click

The skipper himself made 38 runs from four innings at 9.50. Kohli was not still at the crease as he awaited the ball — here you need to wait for the ball to come to you, play it late — and was dragging his front foot across.

Also read: NZ vs IND: Southee is Kohli’s weakness, says Hadlee

Kohli could not pick the direction of the swing. When the ball swung, Kohli, with his pad thrust forward, was in trouble.

The Indian batsmen would be embarrassed in the manner they got out to short-pitched deliveries. They did not get into good positions and were unsure whether to essay the hook or the pull or leave the lifters.

And they walked back to distressing dismissals; none more than Ajinkya Rahane’s hooking-into-the-stumps-act at the Hagley Oval.

World-class bowlers

New Zealand possessed a world-class right-left pair in Tim Southee and Trent Boult and a rising star in Kyle Jamieson with his height, bounce, off-stump line and subtle movement.

Against them, the Indian batsmen could not pace their innings. They were too slow against the accurate Kiwis at the Basin Reserve — the New Zealand seamers choked the batsmen before consuming them — and then decided to play the hook and the pull against almost every short ball at the Hagley Oval.

The move fetched some runs but eventually backfired. At a critical point on day one, Pujara, fatally, attempted to pull a sharply climbing delivery from the off-stump.

58 is the highest

That Mayank Agarwal’s 58 was the highest individual score for the Indians in the series tells the story. These are conditions where you need to be decisive whether going forward or back. The Indians were often caught at the crease. As for bowling, the Indian pacemen except Ishant Sharma bowled the wrong length in the first Test. Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami found some rhythm and control in the second Test but then the batsmen let them down.

231,2020/03/04,Minister reiterates 100 units free power to residential consumers,"Govt. also contemplating supplying electricity for four hours in the day to farmers

Energy Minister Nitin Raut in the Council on Tuesday reiterated that the government would give free electricity up to 100 units to residential consumers and that a committee had been formed to look into its feasibility.

Mr. Raut, who is from the Congress, had in February made this announcement. He had also directed his department to consider supplying power to farmers in the day, and the department was asked to submit a report within three months.

State Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat had also at that time said that the department had been asked to check the feasibility of the move.

However, this was opposed by Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar who also holds the finance portfolio. Mr. Pawar had said that people should not be given the habit of getting freebies.

NCP member Prakash Gajbhiye on Tuesday moved a calling attention motion on why Maharashtra had the costliest power tariff in the country.

Responding to this, Mr. Raut said, “It is true that Maharashtra has the costliest electricity tariff but there are technical reasons for that. I have already directed my department to check if free power up to 100 units can be given. Once that report comes in, we will definitely try to give this benefit to the people.”

Giving free power of 100 units is expected to cost the exchequer around ₹8,000 crore as there are around one crore users in the slab. With the State facing a fund crunch, and implementing a farm loan waiver, the announcement was questioned.

BJP member Parinay Fuke pointed out the perils of supplying power to farms only at night, which is the practice currently.

232,2020/03/04,JJ Hospital to get a cancer ward,"Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh on Tuesday accepted the suggestion of an MLC and said JJ Hospital would get a cancer ward.

People’s Republican Party member Jogendra Kawade moved a calling attention motion demanding to know whether 40 chemists had stopped supply of medicines to the State-run hospital over dues, whether State owed the chemists ₹60 crore, and whether this had impacted heart surgeries at the hospital.

Mr. Deshmukh responded, “Only about ₹29 crore was pending in dues a few months ago but most of it has been paid. The dues accrued because of some changes made by the previous government. I assure that such a shortage of stock will not happen again.”

However, he pointed out that it was not true that heart surgeries had been affected at the hospital and said more than 400 surgeries had been conducted every month till February.

Teachers Constituency’s member Vikram Kale then asked the minister if a cancer wing could be started at JJ Hospital.

To this, Mr. Deshmukh said, “The hospital is completing 150 years soon. I accept his suggestion. We will definitely work on this and bring out a policy as soon as possible.”",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/45y30n/article30976612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BMAMITDESHMUKH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/jj-hospital-to-get-a-cancer-ward/article30976577.ece
233,2020/03/04,Engineering exports expected to be slightly lower than last year,"‘Several opportunities to improve trade between India and Malaysia’

Engineering exports from the country this year is expected to be slightly lower than last financial year, Ravi Sehgal, Chairman of EEPC India, said here on Wednesday.

Mr. Sehgal told presspersons after the inaugural of International Engineering Sourcing Show that the exports would be about 80 billion $. The last quarter of a financial year would see exports going up usually. By December 2019, the industry had a feeling that the markets had expanded and demand was increasing. However, with COVID-19 affecting several countries, there had been a slowdown in orders. This had an impact for nearly a month. India would start getting more orders from April, he said.

Buyers, especially those in the US and EU, wanted to shift their sourcing, at least partially, from China and hence their reliance on India would go up. Some of the engineering verticals where the Indian companies had an advantage were engines, pumps, valves, and engines. “We are telling people to build capacities,” he said.

Regarding the sourcing expo, Mr. Sehgal said over 400 participants had showcased their products and representatives of 45 countries were visiting the event. The EEPC India had earlier estimated that about 530 overseas visitors would take part. About 20 to 30 had cancelled for various reasons. Nearly 50 people from China who had planned to visit had not. The three-day event would have seminars and B to B meetings. There were delegations from SAARC, CIS, and west Asian countries. Malaysia was the partner country and had a separate pavilion.

There were several opportunities to improve trade between India and Malaysia, said Azhar Taib, Deputy CEO of MARii. As part of the programme, MARii signed agreements with three institutions here.

‘Sense of insecurity’

The representation said the NPR could trigger a sense of insecurity among the minorities.

241,2020/03/04,Absence of neurologist at Erode GH puts differently abled to hardship,"They are forced to go to Salem or Coimbatore GHs to obtain disability certificate

In the absence of neurologist at the District Headquarters Hospital at Erode to issue disability certificate, differently abled persons are forced to travel to government hospitals in Salem and Coimbatore for obtaining the certificate, undergoing immense hardship.

There are about 56,000 differently-abled persons in the district who are covered under 21 types of disabilities as listed under the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. They need to obtain the disability certificate from a specialist doctor confirming the percentage of disability in them after which they are issued Unique Disability Identity Card (UDID) issued by the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities that comes under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. While other specialised doctors are available for assessing and issuing the certificate, persons with cerebral palsy, mental retardation and autism, who need to be certified by a neurologist, face hardship as the post remains vacant for over five years.

S. Durairaj, president, Erode District Differently Abled Welfare Association, told The Hindu that about 5 % of the differently abled needed to be certified by a neurologist so that they were eligible to receive assistance from both the Centre and the State government. Owing to the non-availability of the specialist in Erode GH, they need to travel to Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) or to Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital in Salem to meet the doctor and get the certificate.

“Persons with cerebral palsy cannot board buses and availing private taxi service is not affordable for them”, he said.

‘No action on petition’

The association had submitted a petition during the coordinating committee meeting held at the Collectorate three months ago, requesting that a neurologist be at least deputed from Salem or Coimbatore once a week for issuing the certificate. “So far, no action has been taken”, he said.

Joint Director of Health Services Gomathi was not available for comment.

243,2020/03/04,COVID-19 sparks demand for surgical masks,"Units in Coimbatore are looking at investing in machines and creating capacities

With COVID-19 spreading globally, the demand for disposable masks is up, resulting in a spike in prices of raw materials and the products.

Units that make these masks, including those in Coimbatore, are running to full capacity and many here are looking at investing in machines and creating capacities.

The common surgical masks come as two-ply or three-ply masks. While the price before January 14 ranged between 68 paise to ₹ 3 a piece, it is now ₹6 to ₹18 a piece. “This is purely based on the supply and demand,” says chairman of Indian Technical Textiles Association (ITTA) K.S. Sundararaman.

The disposable mask makers are spread across the country converting the non-woven fabric into masks. These are mostly in the cottage and MSME sector. Given the spike in demand, many are now trying to invest in machinery to make the masks. “I do not think it is prudent to invest as the demand may be a short-lived one,” he says.

The mask worn by healthcare professionals, who are handling COVID-19 affected people, is a special N95 mask that is manufactured by a couple of large-scale companies in the country.

The regular masks are usually worn by those who travel and the people living in the affected areas as a safety measure. The government had banned export of masks and recently lifted the ban partially. While the regular masks can be exported, the N95 ones cannot be exported, explain industry sources.

China has the capacity to produce nearly 119 million pieces a day (regular masks) while the capacity in India is for two million pieces a day. China’s demand exceeds its capacity, points out a source in the technical textiles sector. Several south east Asian countries and others that have more COVID-19 cases are buying the regular masks in large quantities from different sources, including those in India. Hence, there is a huge demand for these now.

“There are orders for even one crore pieces from some buyers,” says G. Thilagavathi, Head of the Department of the Textile Technology Department at PSG Institute of Technology. The Institute has a mask making facility at its incubation centre at the Centre of Excellence for Industrial Textiles. A mask has two different kinds of non-woven fabrics and loops to tie. The cost of spun bond fabric has seen 22 % hike in the last one-and-a-half months, the cost of meltblown fabric is up 30 % to 400 % and the even the cost of the nose wires increased more than 900 %, she says.

The demand is huge, especially for bulk orders though the cost of the masks itself is up. Many ask for exports, she adds. “Currently, there is no shortage in availability of the raw materials.

The prices are up because of the demand,” adds Anup Rakshit, Executive Director of ITTA.

The trend of high demand will, however, depend on the impact of the virus and how long it will continue, he says.

Speaking about the domestic demand for the masks, Mr. Sundararaman points out that several sectors, such as textile mills, usually provides the regular masks to its workers as a protection. Even these sectors are finding it difficult to get the masks, and if available, the prices are high.

“The quantity in the market is sold. The shortage will come in the non-woven fabric segment if the demand continues,” he adds.

The other technical textiles product that has demand potential because of COVID-19 is a special type of coverall.

The fabric for this is mostly imported now and may see a requirement increase if the number of those affected increases, the sources add.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/1b9mmm/article30976145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB04MASK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/covid-19-sparks-demand-for-surgical-masks/article30976146.ece

Coimbatore-based Arya Vaidya Pharmacy (AVP) will be one among the three sites in the country where a collaborative research project to evaluate the efficacy of Ayurvedic medicines on rheumatoid arthritis will be carried out.

Collaborative research project

P.R. Krishna Kumar, Chairman of AVP Research Foundation, made the announcement at a press conference here on Tuesday. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between AVP Research Foundation and the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS), a body under Ministry of AYUSH, on February 20 in Coimbatore, he said.

According to the MoU, the collaborative research project is titled “A double blind double dummy prospective randomised controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of classical Ayurveda management versus Methotrexate in Rheumatoid Arthritis (AMRA) Study.”

AVP will collaborate with the Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for Metabolic Disorders (RARIMD), Bengaluru, and Central Ayurveda Research Institute for Cancer (CARIC), Mumbai, institutions under CCRAS.

According to Mr. Kumar, this project will be based on the pilot study conducted by AVP, which was published in 2011 in the U.S-based Journal of Clinical Rheumatology. The study, conducted by the University of Washington, Seattle, with funding from the U.S.’s National Institutes of Health, compared the efficacy of Ayurvedic treatment with allopathic treatment.

For the project in Coimbatore, AVP’s K.G. Raveendran and Somit Kumar will be the treating physician and co-investigator respectively. Director of Clinical Research at Arthritis Association of South California (AASC) Daniel Furst designed the study and would be mentoring during its course, Mr. Kumar said.

A notification by the CCI said the discount scheme will be applicable for purchase of cotton pertaining to crop year 2018-19 for the sales made from March 3, 2020 to April 30, 2020.

Chairman of the Mills’ Association (SIMA) Ashwin Chandran said in a press release that with the intervention of Union Textile Minister Smriti Irani, the CCI is offering the volume-based bulk discounts, from 500 bales to 10,000 bales. The discount is in the range of ₹3,200 to ₹4,400 a candy of 355 kg.

With this, the price for the Fair Average Quality of cotton offered by the CCI will be close to the market price. The textile mills are likely to start procuring from the CCI now. Mr. Chandran expressed hope that, “The CCI would soon offer its current year MSP cotton at market prices at constant intervals till season end and facilitate stability of prices.”

The SIMA Chairman also appealed to the Union Government to include cotton yarn under the export benefits to make the Indian cotton yarn competitive in the global market. Cotton yarn exports from India dropped 30 % during 2019-2020 compared to the previous year. Increase in the yarn exports will stimulate demand for cotton, he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/volume-based-discount-for-cci-cotton-to-benefit-msme-mills/article30976066.ece

Heavy rain in the Nilgiris last year had damaged the houses of 17 tribal families residing in Chinna Kurumbadi near Burliar. Now the remaining residents, mostly elderly members of the Kurumba tribe have called upon the district administration to help them build new houses or provide funds to repair the existing ones.

The residents, most of whom work as daily wage labourers in nearby farms or coffee estates, said that last year’s rains in the Nilgiris had extensively damaged their houses. “Some of the rains led to small landslips, which led to some parts of our houses caving in,” said S. Radha, a resident of the village.

Being located along the highway, residents of the village said they were more prone to landslips during spells of rain, and also want the highways department to build an embankment or a retaining wall above their village to prevent landslips. “The floods of 2009 caused tremendous damage to villages nearby due to landslips. If no permanent steps are taken to prevent landslips our village too could be affected,” said R. Linga, another resident.

The residents claim that they have submitted petitions to the district administration asking for help so that their homes can be repaired.

251,2020/03/04,"Delhi riots burnt nation’s values, says Rahul Gandhi","‘Our strengths of brotherhood, unity and love have been destroyed... a loss for Bharat Mata’

The ruined remains of a school in riot-hit northeast Delhi symbolised the “burnt and destroyed” values of brotherhood, unity and love which were the strengths of India, Congress Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi said on Wednesday.

Strict action should be taken against those involved in Delhi riots: Anurag Thakur

Mr. Gandhi and a delegation, which consisted of senior Congress leaders K.C. Venugopal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, K. Suresh, Mukul Wasnik, Kumari Selja, Gaurav Gogoi and Randeep Surjewala, paid a brisk visit to the Arun Modern Public Senior Secondary School in the evening even as residents of the Mustafabad-Brijpuri area where it is located replaced damaged shutters outside shops. The Tricolour was visible on several damaged homes.

“When violence occurs in India, when violence occurs in the capital, India’s reputation in the eyes of the world takes a hit. What was India’s strength, what was our strength – brotherhood, unity and love – that has been burnt, that has been destroyed here,” he said after examining the school campus which was allegedly vandalised last Tuesday.

“This kind of politics not only translates into loss for this school, but for Hindustan and Bharat Mata. Our reputation in this world, which is very important for our future, that has been burnt here. That is why I am here,” he said further.

Near the school campus, the former Congress president spoke to some of the local residents who suffered losses in the violence. His cavalcade then moved towards the Shiv Vihar area, but turned back owing to security concerns expressed by the Delhi police officials.

“Two rapid response teams consisting of doctor, paramedical staff and public health specialist have been formed for awareness generation and screening of persons who visited coronavirus-affected countries after January 15 belonging to NDMC area,” a senior official of NDMC’s Health Department said.

“The Delhi government’s Health Department has given a list of 56 persons residing in NDMC area, who had visited the coronavirus-affected countries. The rapid response team has visited and screened 56 houses and none of the residents had signs and symptoms of COVID-19 infection. The status report has been shared with integrated disease surveillance programme unit of New Delhi district,” the official added.

NDMC area is home to political executives and senior bureaucrats, besides the iconic Parliament building, Rashtrapati Bhavan, diplomatic enclave and five-star hotels.

The civic body has also asked all hotels and guest houses in the area to send report regarding guests coming from coronavirus-affected countries or any person showing symptoms of fever or flu.

The move comes after a person who had dined at Hotel Hyatt in the national capital was tested positive for COVID-19.

254,2020/03/04,"Delhi violence | Hate and violence enemies of development, will not benefit ‘Bharat Mata’: Rahul Gandhi","Two separate delegations of Congress leaders visited different areas in northeast Delhi

Hate and violence are enemies of development and the divisiveness being spread will not benefit ‘Bharat Mata’, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said on Wednesday, as he led a delegation of party leaders to the riot-hit northeast Delhi.

Two separate delegations of Congress leaders visited different areas in northeast Delhi.

The delegation led by Mr. Gandhi included K.C. Venugopal, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, K. Suresh, Mukul Wasnik, Kumari Selja, Gaurav Gogoi and Randeep Surjewala.

This delegation visited a private school in the Brijpuri area of northeast Delhi that was vandalised and burnt during the riots.

Arun Modern Public Senior Secondary School, which is over 32 years old, suffered massive damage and the Congress delegation went around the gutted classrooms and surveyed the burnt busses.

Speaking to the media, Mr. Gandhi said, “This [school] is India’s future. Hate and violence has destroyed it. Nobody has benefited from this. Violence and hate are enemies of development.”

“India is being divided, burnt. This will not benefit Bharat Mata,” he said.

Mr. Gandhi along with the other leaders also visited a mosque near the school that was affected in the violence.

Sources said the Delhi police advised Mr. Gandhi not to go beyond the Brijpuri Nullah.

The other delegation, comprising mostly MPs, left in a bus from the Kerala House here and included Hibi Eden, Gurjeet Singh Aujla and Abdul Khaleque.

Their first stop was Chand Bagh where they met shopkeepers and asked them about the losses they suffered.

The Congress has demanded that the issue of the communal riots in Delhi be debated in Parliament and proceedings of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have been disrupted over the issue.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi last week had deputed a five-member team to visit the riot-affected areas of Delhi and submit a report to her after assessing the situation there.

256,2020/03/04,"Delhi violence ‘one-sided, well-planned’, says minorities panel","Report says extensive damage to Muslim houses, shops and workshops everywhere, but at Yamuna Vihar shops and houses belonging to both communities were affected

The Delhi Minorities Commission in its assessment report of events which unfolded recently in northeast Delhi has concluded that the violence which erupted was “one-sided, well-planned” and involved support from locals with maximum damage being done to shops and houses belonging to the minority community.

The Commission also said that compensation announced by the Delhi government was inadequate, considering the extent of damage caused due to the violence.

“We found extensive damage to Muslim houses, shops and workshops everywhere we went. We found that people were visiting their damaged houses for the first time since they fled on February 24-25 but since the houses and shops were badly damaged and debris lying, there was no question that they will be able to start living there any time soon,” the panel said.

The delegation, which included commission chairman Zafarul-Islam Khan, in its report also highlighted instances like those in Bhajanpura, where “Muslim-owned shops like a travel agency and motorcycle showroom were looted and torched while Hindu-owned shops were left untouched.”

Also read | Delhi violence a matter of great shame: Harsh Mander

The panel’s report also cites residents of Gali number 5 in Khajuri Khas claiming that the violence on February 23 began “shortly after the threat and ultimatum” by BJP leader Kapil Mishra.

“This ‘gali’ is a blind alley where 100 persons lived and they could not on their own flee from the main road. They left the place under police protection in the morning of February 25. In this ‘gali’, we found the house of BSF jawan Mohammad Anis which was badly damaged,” the panel said.

At Yamuna Vihar, however, the report states that shops and houses belonging to both communities were affected.

“On the one side of the road are Muslim houses and shops while on the other side are Hindu houses and shops. Both areas were affected by looting and burning. At a charred petrol pump, the owner Mahinder Aggrawal claimed that 30 vehicles were torched there,” the report states.

The panel also refers to testimonies by Raj Kumar, a driver with the Rajdhani School which was also burnt.

“Mr. Kumar told us that some 500 persons barged into his school around 6.30 p.m. on February 24. They wore helmets and hid their faces. They remained there for the next 24 hours and went away next evening after the arrival of police force in the area. They were young people who had arms and giant catapults which they used to throw petrol bombs from the school rooftops,” the report states.

Fact-finding committee

The Commission chairman said that a fact-finding committee would be formed which would include journalists, human rights activists and civil society members.

“We have said that the violence was one-sided as that’s what we felt from what people told us. They said that it was not possible for outsiders to pin-point shops and houses owned by Muslims. So there had to be insiders who we’re helping the outsiders,” said Mr. Khan.

Adding that the commission has urged Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to double the compensation, Mr. Khan said, “We have also asked the government to fix the compensation depending on the damage caused. For example, a person whose garage has been burnt cannot sustain with the compensation announced by the government. The damage caused might be more and money not enough.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/11xhd8/article30979853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NORTHEASTDELHIVIOLENCE-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-violence-one-sided-well-planned-says-minorities-panel/article30979785.ece

“The CJI’s lament that the highest court was not “equipped” to handle “pressure” and that it cannot prevent events that impinge on the citizens’ fundamental right to life, liberty and dignity, detracts from the highest court’s moral and constitutional authority.

The CJI is the highest judicial authority and cannot suggest helplessness in the discharge of duty, plainly cast upon the court by the Constitution, as the final arbiter between liberty of citizens and State power,” Mr. Kumar said in a statement.

259,2020/03/04,Insurance firm told to pay over $2 lakh compensation,"Claim rejected on grounds that ‘treatment arose out of pre-existing ailment’

A District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum here has directed an insurance company to compensate a policy holder by paying over $2 lakh for repudiating a claim on unjust grounds.

Directing the Bajaj Allianz General Insurance company to pay in the 2012 rates, the consumer panel said: “We are of the considered view that the policy in question was issued on the basis of physical condition of the deceased and he had been found physically fit and therefore, it cannot be said that any suppression or any earlier ailment had vitiated the contract of issuing policy to the deceased insured.”

“A contract of this nature cannot be termed bad and be terminated on ground of having obtained by fraud or can be declared as vitiated on facts which were not in existence on the day of contract,” the Bench observed.

The directions came when the consumer forum was hearing a plea moved by city residents Shalini and Gaurav Dar, nominees to the policy, who challenged the repudiation of the travel insurance policy.

In the complaint, it was contended that despite providing relevant documents, the insurance company rejected the claim on grounds that the “treatment of deceased arose out of pre-existing ailment” that was not included under the policy.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/insurance-firm-told-to-pay-over-2-lakh-compensation/article30976838.ece

The government has also made arrangements for distributing more than 3.5 lakh N95 masks, he said.

“Even though only one COVID-19 case has been notified in Delhi, people need to be cautious. The patient has been kept under observation in Safdarjung Hospital. His family has also been monitored,” Mr. Sisodia said.

He said that the COVID-19 virus testing facility is available only at 12 places across the country and the Delhi government is trying to arrange the facility as soon as possible.

“Two hospitals, including RML, have been transitioned into ideal hospitals within Delhi. Twenty five hospitals have been equipped to handle the influx of patients, including 19 Delhi government hospitals and six private hospitals.

262,2020/03/04,Anti-CAA march called off as police detain 185 students,"Govt. trying to silence protesters with violence just like Godse silenced Gandhiji: Umar Khalid

A march from Ramlila Maidan to Jantar Mantar called by Young India, a coalition of student organisations from across the country, against the CAA and the violence in north-east Delhi had to be called off after Delhi Police detained 185 students who gathered at the Ramlila Maidan. The organisers then asked the students to assemble at Jantar Mantar directly for the protest.

Addressing the gathering, activist Umar Khalid said that on February 29, a pro-CAA march was allowed in the heart of Delhi in which provocative slogans were raised, but a peaceful march by the youth was not allowed and students were being detained for raising their voice.

“The police is detaining and arresting those who are raising their voice against the government which shows the government’s real face and how scared they are of the anti-CAA movement. This shows that the Dadis of Shaheen Bagh have won as the government is trying to silence the protesters with violence just like Nathuram Godse silenced Gandhiji,” Mr. Khalid said.

He added that Prime Minister had “Nathuram Godse in his heart but Gandhiji on his tongue”. Mr. Khalid urged all those present at the rally not to welcome officers who come to their homes to collect data for the National Population Register and to continue to oppose the CAA.

Also addressing the gathering, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad called for the arrest of those who were responsible for the violence in north-east Delhi and urged the youth to continue their fight to save the Constitution and democratic values.

185 detained

Meanwhile, Delhi Police said that they have detained 185 people. “The permission for the march was rejected and duly communicated to the organisers. The protesters who came to Ramlila ground were detained swiftly and removed from there to Khatu Shyam Stadium, PS Hari Nagar and Rajiv Gandhi Stadium in Bawana,” said the police.

The police also stepped up the security at Jantar Mantar by frisking people and video graphed all those who entered there. Several students said that they were questioned as to why they were participating in the rally.

263,2020/03/04,Delhi govt. recommends rejection of Nirbhaya convict’s mercy plea,"Pawan Gupta had filed the petition before the President on Monday

The Delhi government on Tuesday informed the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), its recommendation for “rejection” of the mercy petition filed by Pawan Gupta, one of the convicts in the rape and murder case of Nirbhaya, a senior Delhi government official said.

The recommendation was sent to the MHA after approval of the same by Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain and Lt. Governor Anil Baijal. Gupta had filed the petition before the President on Monday.

“The Home Department recommended the rejection of the mercy petition and it was sent to the Minister and L-G, who approved the same. The recommendation for rejection was then sent to the MHA by the Home Department today [Tuesday],” the senior Delhi government official told The Hindu.

“The mercy petitions of the other three convicts were all rejected and the fourth one cannot be different. This will also be rejected by the President,” the official added.

Execution postponed

The four convicts were supposed to be hanged to death on Tuesday at 6 a.m. On Monday, hours before their execution, Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana put on hold their execution when informed that Gupta has moved a mercy petition before the President.

Even if the President rejects the mercy plea of the convict, the law laid down by the Supreme Court in its Shatrughan Chauhan judgment of 2014 requires the convict to be given 14 days time to set his affairs straight and “prepare” for the execution.

The municipal corporation has been carrying out an intensive cleaning drive in the violence-hit areas. Commissioner Dilraj Kaur has formed a special team of engineers to oversee the work.

The agency has also picked up a total of 700 metric tonnes of construction debris that was used by the mobs in the violence that lasted three days. To bring down dust levels the civic agency has also deployed water sprinkler machines in the area.

As acrid smell of smoke emanated from the gutted houses, Sub Divisional Magistrate Gaurav Yadav, who has been deployed here from Kanjhawala, made a call: “I want electricity in the area by the end of the day and I need the report on this within two hours”.

When some residents claimed that the security personnel deployed in the area had misbehaved with the locals, the official glanced towards the uniformed men and said: “No one will abuse or misbehave with people here. If I get to know that anyone has...”

A local then shared how the water supply is shut.

Mr. Yadav was on the phone again and could be heard saying: “I need water tankers in this area to serve about 300 people by Wednesday evening”.

He, however, told the residents that regular water supply may take some time to resume.

After attempting to solve the water and electricity problem, he moved on and asked the locals if they had any other issues.

266,2020/03/04,‘It was neighbour vs neighbour at Garhi Mendu’,"A lot of the violence was the handiwork of locals, say displaced Muslim families

Violence at many riot-affected areas in north-east Delhi was reportedly triggered by “outsiders”, but it was “neighbour versus neighbour at Garhi Mendu village”, said Muslim families displaced from the locality.

Hundreds of people who have taken shelter at a community centre in nearby Shri Ram Colony said that Hindu families whom they had lived next to for decades asked them to leave and never come back as violence engulfed the village located in the Khajoori Khas. They were, however, unsure about naming their neighbours in police complaints.

Local Muslim residents say the situation is still tense and panic surfaces at least twice every night around 2.30 a.m. and 5 a.m.

Mohammad Shafi, 67, had shifted to a new house in the area eight days before the riots erupted. “It was on Monday around 6.30 p.m. First, they damaged the Mubarak Masjid and then began attacking residents... I left with my family at 10 a.m. the next day. At 10.30 p.m. I got a call that my house and the factory below it are on fire... If the paramilitary had not come and we had not slipped away when they were deployed, it would have been us instead of the buildings,” he said.

Mehboob Hassan, 72, the Imam of a local mosque, was preparing for evening prayers on February 24 when he heard some stones being pelted at the building.

“I stepped outside and about 10-15 people caught me and started to beat me... they hit my head and kicked me,” he said. After managing to escape, Mr. Hassan tried to run towards his house but was caught by mobs twice and beaten up each time. When he finally got home, he collected his children and fled the village.

Fatima Begum got news that preparations were being made to attack Muslims in the area, when she and her children decided to flee.

“All I took with me was two blankets,” she said on Tuesday, having spent nearly a week in the same clothes. Her husband had stayed back to make sure that the goats and birds that the family kept were fed, but decided to leave a day later when mobs started burning vehicles. After the violence died down, people from the camp have been visiting the village on occasion to ensure that their livestock are fed.

Houses of several people who fled were looted and set alight. “In case a Muslim was living in a house rented from a Gujjar [reportedly the dominant community here] it was left alone. Only Muslim households were targeted,” said a resident of the area.

Some people were able to take stock of the houses in the company of the area SDM and police. The victims alleged that they faced hostility from the residents when they reached the village. “They were standing around in groups and staring us down,” said another man.

Shakeel Ahmed, 64, said: “They were local people... they broke open the door, pulled me out and beat me with sticks. They asked us to leave or they would cut us into pieces and said that our house belongs to them before setting it on fire. I fought back and took on at least two of them; if my knees were like they used to be when I was a little younger, I would have taken on all the four who attacked me.”

Most here say they can identify the people who were involved in the violence in the village, as compared to in other parts of riot hit North East Delhi where residents reported that “people from outside” had taken part. Accordingly, local authorities have been encouraging these people to register complaints taking the names of these people.

Following an internal meeting, those residing in the camp decided to prepare such a list which on Tuesday afternoon had names of at least 40 people who were allegedly involved in the violence. Alok Motan, with the North East Delhi Legal Services Authority, who is assisting the displaced and has taken statements from up to 30 victims of the riots at the Shastri Park police station said that a total of 10 FIRs had been filed so far however no names of alleged culprits have been mentioned. “The community there is unable to decide among themselves whether or not to put forward the names,” said Mr. Motan.

Mr. Motan also informed that a meeting was held between displaced persons and a pradhan of the village on Tuesday, where the area SHO, local administration were present to help mediate between the two communities. Mr. Motan who was part of the meeting said that it was decided that talks would be held between the communities to discuss rehabilitation and that ""miscreants"" would be spoken to.

Many of those here however argued that it was necessary for some justice to take place. Without which, the locals that carried out targeted attacks and arson would be emboldened they said. While those who were staying in houses on rent said that they wanted to move out of the area as soon as possible, others who owned land here and lived in the village for over 10 years said that they had no option but to go back and wanted to go back soon.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/j3uu49/article30976615.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4DEVILLAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/it-was-neighbour-vs-neighbour-at-garhi-mendu/article30976616.ece
267,2020/03/04,One more death in Delhi hospital,"Authorities say case is not related to riots; kin say otherwise

Another death was reported from Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital here on Tuesday but hospital authorities say that it is not related to the violence in northeast Delhi.

Meanwhile, health rights activists have said that GTB Hospital, which was the first hospital reached during the recent riots, “did not have a functional CT scan facility for the first two of days of violence”.

79 houses, 327 shops gutted during Delhi violence: Manish Sisodia

18-year-old Aqib died at GTB hospital on Monday. The body was handed over to the family on Tuesday. The family said that the youth was brought to the hospital last week with a head injury.

“He suffered a head injury in the violence when he went out to purchase clothes for his sister’s wedding. He was serious, was operated on twice, and passed away on Monday,” said his older brother Wasim. He added that Aquib worked as a daily wager and was caught unawares by the violence. Hospital staff said the death was not linked to the violence.

His father Iqramuddin, a resident of Bhagirathi Vihar in Mustafabad, has five children and owns a bangle shop. “The family was preparing for a wedding and now, we have lost my son in stone-throwing,” Mr. Iqramuddin said, after taking his son’s body.

Dr. Harjit Singh Bhatti, who was among the first volunteers to go into the Mustafabad area to help the victims of violence, said, “Gunshot victims who were brought to GTB Hospital for treatment got referred to other hospitals because GTB did not have a functioning CT scan. This is the irony of India’s healthcare, where there is no major difference between a small clinic or a tertiary care centre like GTB.”

“Around 30 patients were referred to the Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality Hospital because of this problem,” said another physician, who did not wish to be named.

When asked about the problem, Dr. Sunil Kumar, Medical Director, GTB Hospital said: “The CT scan was not working on the first two days of the violence but I made personal efforts to get it repaired on a war footing.”

The hospital catered to the largest patient load coming in due to the violence, and reported admission of 279 injured persons, with 34 presently admitted, and two in a critical condition. The hospital has also reported 39 deaths so far.

The hospital administration noted that an internal assessment has revealed the highest number of patients brought in for treatment were in the 20-35 years age group, followed by those in the 35-40 years age group. Of the 279 persons, 272 were male, six were female, and there was one unidentified charred body.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hp7cc/article30975530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4TH-HELP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/one-more-death-in-delhi-hospital/article30975532.ece
268,2020/03/04,"In Nikhil Vihar, Muslim families told to vacate homes by Holi","Group of 50 allegedly threatened families in colony that straddles Haryana, Delhi

Visibly shaken, a 34-year-old resident of Nikhil Vihar stands in front of her house with the nameplate that she was forced to tear out after around 50 men went around the locality — spread across Haryana and Delhi — threatening two dozen Muslim families to vacate their houses before Holi.

After receiving a complaint, the Haryana Police deployed personnel in the colony to maintain law and order.

Deputy Superintendent of Police (Badli) Ashok Kumar said that an FIR had been registered but the accused were yet to be identified.

“It was around 1 p.m. on February 29. Most of the men were out working. Only the women, children and the elderly were in their homes. They knocked violently on our door. When I stepped out they told me to leave with my family before Holi,” said Baby, holding up the nameplate that bears green crescent moons and the name of her husband Israr Saifi. The family has been staying at their present address for over seven years and claimed that they never faced any issues before because of their religion.

She said that the men, though not armed, were not willing to take no for an answer. “I was too scared to ask who they were. When they tried to pull out the nameplate, I offered to remove it on my own. I also painted over the religious chants that were inscribed in marble above the entrance,” said Baby.

Her neighbour, Sadia said she and her carpenter husband were out when the men, aged between 20-40 years, had come. “My in-laws and the children at home climbed up the terrace. The men kept banging violently at the door and pulled off a talisman tied at the entrance... but they did not barge into the house,” added the 30-year-old resident.

Police deployment

Noor Begum, who stays behind a temple, said the men told them to go back to their village. “After they left, I called up the Delhi Police control room, but was told that the area falls under Haryana. I then called up the Haryana Police. More than two dozen police vehicles and senior officers soon arrived. The Haryana Police personnel are now deployed round-the-clock,” said Noor.

She added that despite the riots in Delhi, they expected to be safe in Haryana.

A large chunk of the unauthorised colony falls in Haryana’s Jhajjar district, but a few houses are in Delhi.

“Of around 20 houses of Muslims in the colony, most of them fall in Haryana. Only 4-5 houses are in Delhi’s Najafgarh. While the Haryana Police stationed its personnel round-the-clock, the Delhi Police rider comes occasionally to take a round,” said Baby.

Despite heavy police presence, the Muslim families, mostly migrants from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, said they were living under constant fear of being attacked. Najma Khatoon, 46, a widow, said that she has not been able to sleep properly since Saturday.

“Half-a-dozen families have already fled saying they will not return before Holi. The others too have sent young women and children in the house to safer places. We have invested all our savings to buy these houses, we cannot afford to go. My husband suggested that we should go, but the dealer is offering only ₹2 lakh for the house which we bought for ₹4.50 lakh,” said a tearful Shahnaz, a resident.

The families claimed they had support from Hindu neighbours, also migrants, but little help from the locals.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dxgobx/article30976338.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03DELPRIYAHARYANAASHOK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/in-nikhil-vihar-muslim-families-told-to-vacate-homes-by-holi/article30976339.ece
269,2020/03/04,"No call from party leaders, says BJP worker whose factory was destroyed in riots","‘Action should be taken against leaders who made hate speeches’

“Modi ji ka naara Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas tha, Sabka Vinash nahin... Badbolepan se halaat bigadte hain, yeh hota hai (Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan was Everyone’s cooperation, everyone’s development, everyone’s confidence, not everyone’s destruction... babbling worsens the situation, this is what happens),” said Mohammad Atiq as he held up pictures of his destroyed undergarments factory in Karawal Nagar.

“I gave the BJP 16-17 years of my life... I used to be on first-name basis with its senior State leaders... But not one of them has called to inquire or console me after my factory was destroyed last Monday, along with that of my younger brother, just because of what our names are,” said Mr. Atiq, who leads the BJP’s minorities’ cell at Brahmpuri Mandal.

He said that he had worked hard to ensure that 700-800 people from the Muslim community in the area took up the party’s membership during a drive in the run-up to the Delhi Assembly elections.

Mr. Atiq said that he received a call from the owners of factories located near his unit was informed that his factory, and that of his brother, had been ransacked during the violence in Delhi.

“Rioters have no religion just like the babbling leaders across the political spectrum whose speeches had triggered a breakdown of trust between communities,” he said, adding: “On February 25, I got a call from a neighbour telling me that our factories had been destroyed... they told me not to come to Karawal Nagar even to assess the loss... I have not been able to gather the courage to go there. I am from Bihar and never felt as unsafe as I do here now.”

“My entire life savings was destroyed by rioters... Who were these people?... Rioters have no religion, but what is a fact is that whether it is [BJP leader] Kapil Mishra or Asaduddin [Owaisi], all kinds of hate speech which lead to a breakdown of brotherhood must be condemned,” he added.

A resident of Usmanpur, Mr. Atiq said he, like his Hindu neighbours, had been carrying out night vigils at the local temple in the Gau Gali to confront the fear and apprehensions related to their safety and that of their families for the last ten days.

Mr. Atiq said that if given a chance he would complain at the highest levels against the hate speeches delivered by leaders from his own party, which “got worse after the Delhi election results”.

“There is so much tension that people from both communities have not been able to sleep for the last 10 nights,” he said, adding: “What Kapil Mishra has said, which even the party is condemning, must be condemned. What has happened has happened and it is high time that both communities come together to rebuild lives.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dhdeix/article30979044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4DEATIQ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/no-call-from-party-leaders-says-bjp-worker-whose-factory-was-destroyed-in-riots/article30976329.ece
270,2020/03/04,Riot victims ‘dissatisfied’ with Delhi govt.’s relief measures,"We are getting food, water and clothes from our own people, say affected residents

Scores of riot victims who have shifted to Idgah ground in Mustafabad and other localities in the area said on Tuesday that they were not satisfied with the Delhi government’s relief measures.

Seher Bano, whose house was vandalised and looted, said she had to shift to Idgah ground as “I do not know where the relief camps set up by government are”.

“We are getting food, water and clothes from our own people. I have heard there is a process for compensation but I do not know the details. Politicians have not visited our area,” she added.

Several NGOs and private entities have set up helpdesks and kiosks for legal and medical aid in the area.

At Idgah ground, camps have been set up for victims to stay and get help with documents to be submitted for compensation. Tents for men and women along with children have been set up separately and volunteers were seen sitting with victims helping them with the paper work.

Aleem Khan, whose house in Shiv Vihar was reduced to ashes, said that he received immediate relief of ₹25,000 on Monday when the Sub Divisional Magistrate visited his house. “I am entitled to get ₹5 lakh but how is it enough? I was making my own house nearby and had ₹4 lakh kept in the house,” he claimed.

Sitting next to him was Mohammed Saleem. He had just submitted documents for his burnt electrical shop. “Arvind Kejriwal [Delhi Chief Minister] ne accha kaam kiya hai lekin ab kya kar rahe hain, pata nahin. Paise nahin mile hain abhi tak, pata nahin kitna time lagega (Kejriwal has done some good work but I do not know what he is doing now. I haven’t got the money yet. I don’t know how long it is going to take),” he said.

Most of the people at the camp said their priority was to save their houses and shops.

In the next camp, Arshad, a resident of Shiv Vihar, said he did not know who and what to trust. “People are telling me not to put a lock on my house to ensure that I get compensation... but I fear that my belongings may get stolen. No one is telling us what to do. I went to Karwal Nagar police station to file an FIR but they asked me to leave. Where are the government officials to help us?” he said.

Bismillah, a 70-year-old resident of Shiv Vihar, recalled that she was 18 when she got married and came to the locality. “I have lived in the same house for over 50 years and never saw anything like this. Our own neighbours, who ate at our house, betrayed us. I just want the government to make sure I die in my own house where I came first after marriage,” she cried.

Thirty-two-year-old Shaheen Bano, another resident of Shiv Vihar, said she is not entitled for relief from the Delhi government but wants authorities to ensure that she can safely reside in her rented house and not a relief camp.

“Humara paison ka nuksaan nahin hua, usse bada hua hai. Hum beghar ho gaye (Ours is not a loss of money but bigger than that. We are homeless)”.

Shaheen has three young daughters and was living in a house in Chaman Park. She was earlier staying at another house and has shifted twice.

“It has been a week now. I just want the government to tell us where should we go? What should we do? Should we go back to our villages? I want the government to provide us safety and security to return to our houses,” she said, adding that her Hindu landlord has asked her to come back but she is unsure.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hpjout/article30976321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4DERELIEF20,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/riot-victims-dissatisfied-with-delhi-govts-relief-measures/article30976322.ece
271,2020/03/04,Attaching to detachment,"The Gita offers practical guidance to all with regard to day-to-day problems while also explaining the esoteric philosophy of the Upanishads. Sravana or listening to Bhagavad Gita expositions has to be followed up by manana or retrospection of what has been heard and that too repeatedly to keep the mind fit, healthy and free of impurities, pointed out Srimati Sunanda in a discourse. It is similar to the time and effort that one spends regularly to exercise the body to be physically fit. One has to have constant check on the mind and see that it is alert and free of ill feelings.

Each one is responsible for his life and should learn to accept the circumstances of one’s birth and upbringing and not blame the world or others. Most of life’s problems faced by individuals can be linked to their attachment to people, places or objects. This attachment is wrongly perceived as love and many a time it results in hurt, mental anguish and disappointment. Attachment is only conditional love whereas detachment actually fosters the spirit of true love that does not alter under any situation or circumstance.

The turtle exemplifies pure love in the way it takes care of the young ones very devotedly but does not expect anything from them in return. There is no unhappiness in true sacrifice. But if one feels obliged for help from people it causes misery. It is important that one continues to function in the same situations but with a detached attitude, that is freeing oneself from expectations from the other end. This gives peace and satisfaction. Action done wholeheartedly and devotedly without attachment to results makes for perfection. We have to act in the world while doing our best and be detached as far as results are concerned. By dedicating all to God, one learns to accept things as they are with no regrets.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/attaching-to-detachment/article30977005.ece
272,2020/03/04,Major private hospitals permitted to provide treatment,"Now, Telangana government-run Gandhi Hospital is not the only place for people to undergo treatment for coronavirus. Health Minister Eatala Rajender said that they had permitted major private hospitals to provide treatment for COVID-19 if they had isolation wards and the ability to treat.

Till Wednesday afternoon, suspects and COVID positive patients were admitted only to Gandhi Hospital. Addressing a press conference on the State Medical and Health campus in Koti on Wednesday, he said they took approval from the Central government to make the exception of allowing private hospitals to provide treatment.

“The suspects need not come to Gandhi Hospital to give samples for tests. Their samples can be collected and sent to the hospital for tests,” Mr Rajender said, adding that the exception was made as there were some people ready to spend money to get treated.

Besides providing beds for isolation of patients, private teaching hospitals had volunteered to provide the treatment, he said.

The phone number ‘104’ is activated which can be used by people to clear any query about the virus. The Health Minister requested the Central government to provide additional H1N1 masks.

Control centre

A Command Control Centre of the Health department with the Health Minister as chairman would start functioning from the Health campus in Koti from Thursday. There would be five committees under it, each with a specific task.

They are Hospital management committee to monitor treatment, reports; Surveillance Committee; Information, Education and Communication (IEC) committee to spread awareness on the virus; Procurement committee for immediate purchase of medical resources; and another committee to provide training.

273,2020/03/04,COVID-19: Travel industry hits the roadblock,"If foreign travel has fallen by more than 50%, the domestic travel is down by 90%

While it is getting difficult to put a figure to check if the number of passengers coming out of airports had fallen drastically in view of the coronovirus scare — because of the unusual recalcitrance of the officials concerned — it is safe to conclude that the travel-tourism is in for a big nosedive like never before.

“We are expecting the worst. Probably this has not happened after World War II with unprecedented cancellation of tickets for both international and domestic travels. It really looks bleak,” confessed a travel agent, not wanting to be identified, as he was not authorised to do so, on Wednesday.

British Airways, Cathay Pacific and other international airlines are reported to have already cancelled flights with the drastic decline in passengers travelling towards Europe, with Italy totally shutting down. Travels towards South East Asian countries too has been effected with no takers to fly towards Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and the likes, explained travel agents in the city.

“Unless it is absolutely necessary very few are travelling towards United States and West Asia too with many choosing direct flights rather than transit with Dubai still the preferred halt despite cases being reported in that side of the globe,” said a veteran travel-tourism agency employee specialising in religious tours towards the Vatican. “Tourists are being advised not to come to churches there,” he says.

Apparently, travel-tourism agencies gear up for the busy summer season as soon as the Christmas-New Year holiday season ends and bookings happen in these months for travels in April and May. “We are usually busy during this time of the year with hectic bookings, but only save for applying for visas, we are twiddling thumbs expecting a major meltdown,” sighs another agent.

“If the foreign travel has fallen by more than 50%, the domestic travel is down by 90% with few wanting to go to even popular holiday destinations of Goa or Kerala,” he exclaims.

“We get passenger arrivals and departures of 45-day period only. We have also been advised not to talk about COVID-19 scan of passengers as only the designated health official of the Union government is authorised to provide details,” said a spokesperson of GMR Rajiv Gandhi International Airport.

274,2020/03/04,Speaker for adequate security arrangements for budget session,"Proceedings to start from Friday

Legislative Assembly Speaker Pocharam Srinivas Reddy has directed the Home Department to make adequate security arrangements for the smooth conduct of the forthcoming budget session of the Legislature starting March 6.

He directed the police officials to take steps to ensure that there is no scope for any unwarranted incidents as witnessed in other States during the budget session.

The Speaker, accompanied by Legislative Council chairman G. Sukhender Reddy, Legislative Affairs Minister V. Prashanth Reddy and Legislature Secretary V. Narasimha Charyulu, convened a meeting of senior police and State government officials to review the arrangements that are being made for the budget session on Wednesday.

Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy, Finance Secretary K. Ramakrishna Rao and other senior officials participated in the meeting. Mr. Srinivas Reddy formally inaugurated the new officers’ lounge in the Legislative Assembly on the occasion.

He wanted the conduct of Legislature proceedings in an effective manner to ensure that the State would become role model for others to follow. The officials concerned should see that there is effective coordination between different departments as well as the MLAs and MLCs so that the budget session is conducted smoothly.

The Telangana police in particular had earned reputation for taking steps for the smooth conduct of the session in the past and should continue the same spirit in ensuring that proceedings are conducted without any unwarranted developments.

The Legislative Affairs Minister reminded that Chief Minister and floor leader in the Assembly K. Chandrasekhar Rao is firm that the Legislature should be accountable to people, who would be watching the proceedings. As people would be waiting for redressal of their grievances and replies to their queries, the administration should be geared up to provide the same during the budget session. In this direction, the police officials should make adequate security arrangements while secretaries and heads of departments should coordinate among themselves, if need be through social media, to review the conduct of the budget session on regular basis.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/l1fk0c/article30984877.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY05POCHARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/speaker-for-adequate-security-arrangements-for-budget-session/article30984878.ece
275,2020/03/04,IT industry gears up to tackle COVID-19 scare,"Companies are checking work-from-home infra, on-site plans go for a toss

Owing to the COVID-19 scare, IT companies in the city are leaving no stone unturned to keep employees and businesses from getting affected.

From releasing frequent travel advisories or restrictions to cascading information on how to keep oneself safe; from preparing contingency plans and embarking on surveys to check work-from-home capabilities in case of an outbreak.

“The survey is to see that in case the problem grows bigger, our staff remains safe and business keeps going. As a part of this, we are checking whether employees who do not have infrastructure and equipment such as laptops, can work from home. We are assessing whether they have strong broadband connections and what can be done if they don’t have laptops,” said Vishal (name changed), a senior executive of a banking conglomerate with a significant presence in the city.

While business in India has largely remained insulated from the coronavirus outbreak in China, IT companies in Hyderabad are bracing for any eventuality, but are mindful of not creating any situation which could lead to panic.

According to Rahul Verma (name changed), a techie working with a global auditing firm in the Hitec City, plans of travel abroad, including for those wishing to work on-site, now require ‘additional approvals’ in the wake of a larger number of coronavirus cases being reported. “We received an email which has barred travel to Macau, Iran and South Korea. Of course, China and Hong Kong are off limits since January,” he said.

Mr Verma added that the emails sent to employees direct those who have even passed through these countries for professional or personal reasons, to work from home for a fortnight and keep an eye on their health. Employees have been instructed to defer all non-client travel as well.

A computer hardware giant too has put in place similar guidelines and restrictions. M.A. Rasheed, a senior manager who handles sales, said, “Any official travel has to be approved by senior management such as vice- presidents.

“Please do not send your children to school if they are feeling sick. If your child has a fever of over 98.6F, keep your child under your care at home until he/she is fever-free for 48 hours without the aid of any medication,” reads the message from a school in the city. Another school sent out a message: “Please send your child to school with protective surgical face mask / preferably N 95 mask.”

As the news about sanitisation operation of a building in the IT corridor spread, school authorities have begun to react with caution to deal with the crisis/panic. Just as schools in Hong Kong and S. Korea have done, some schools are preparing for the worst case scenario. “In case of any emergency shutdown, we will use technology to continue the schooling remotely from home and year-end assessments also will be taken care of,” said the email from a school in Bandlaguda.

Incidentally, while exams for Class X, XI and XII are in various stages of completion, the final exams for students of middle school and high school are yet to begin. Among the steps taken by schools included cancellation of academic year-end excursions.

According to State Education Department officials, precautionary measures and awareness sessions were conducted during assembly time in all the schools within 3 km radius of Mahendra Hills on Tuesday. Among the first identified case of COVID-19 is a resident of Mahendra Hills. According to reports, the Human Resources Development Ministry has asked Chief Secretaries of all States, and the Central Board of Secondary Education to spread awareness among students on basic protective measures against COVID-19. The CBSE has allowed students of classes X and XII to wear masks while writing exams and also bring sanitisers.

As availability of protective masks and hand sanitisers in the city became patchy, a rights activist demanded that they be distributed free to school children pursuing education in government schools. “The government should distribute safety masks freely to the government school children as they may not be able to afford them. The government should distribute it freely in all the government schools along with soap free of cost on warfooting,” said Achuta Rao, an activist.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dh52ym/article30984828.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY05CORONAVIRUSCOVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/schools-urge-parents-not-to-send-sick-kids/article30984829.ece
277,2020/03/04,Corporate hospitals see no new suspected COVID-19 cases,"Separate screening for patients with cold, cough symptoms; suspected cases being sent to the designated nodal hospitals for coronavirus cases

If one expected influx of patients with symptoms of cold, cough and fever at the corporate hospitals, two days after a software employee has been diagnosed with COVID-19 (coronavirus) in the city, it is not the scenario.

However, those visiting the hospitals from all walks of life for medical consultation or those accompanying them are increasingly wearing masks as a precautionary measure. An autorickshaw driver who himself is wearing a mask and picked up passengers from a corporate hospital in Jubilee Hills has a word of caution for them, “Don’t step out without wearing a mask”.

The coronavirus scare, however, has not sent any of the corporate hospitals into an overdrive as there are not that many people with symptoms of cold, cough approaching them. The only visible difference observed in a corporate hospital at Jubilee Hills is hand sanitiser bottles being placed everywhere and the security guards manning the entrance and exit doors and those at the reception counters offering few drops of hand sanitiser to every one entering or leaving the hospital. A family of three who came to the hospital said they did not have any symptoms, but were wearing the masks as a precaution.

The masks need not be worn by everyone. Those suffering from cold and cough alone need to wear them so that they don’t spread the virus through droplets. This is true even for common cold . “But with couple of cases of COVID-19 detected in the city, we as a matter of precaution are handing over masks to patients with cold and cough,” said a patient counsellor. Such persons are being sent to emergency with a separate counter to screen them, the Counsellor said.

At the emergency, the duty doctor said that based on their travel history, the medical protocol was being followed and their higher-ups were being informed for further advice. No separate isolation rooms were marked rather than the isolation room that had been functioning for the last several years at the emergency ward as per the Joint Commission International Accreditation Standards for Hospitals. A corporate hospital official said, “We follow WHO guidelines on coronavirus on what precautions to take, how to identify as well as government guidelines. Suspected cases of coronavirus are sent to the designated nodal hospitals for coronavirus cases.” The scene at outpatient block of a corporate hospital in Banjara Hills was also nothing unusual. However, separate counters were set up for people coming in with cold, cough and fever symptoms and to refer the suspected cases to nodal hospitals.

Awareness cell

A corporate hospital at Somajiguda set up COVID-19 awareness cell on the ground floor with pamphlets. A separate out-patient room has been allocated for screening of patients with flu symptoms and information is collected for such patients with travel history in the last three to four weeks. Suspected COVID-19 cases will be referred to Gandhi Hospital. So far no such cases were referred. Patients suffering from H1N1 (swine flu) and any other multi-drug resistant cases are admitted to 10-bed isolation ward as usual.

A Medical Director at a corporate hospital said that number of patients with normal flu has come down, this being the month of March. There is no recent significant spurt in cases. But for common flu or even for COVID-19, what is important is personal hygiene. Persons should follow spitting, sneezing and hand hygiene. They should cover their mouth when coughing or sneezing.

278,2020/03/04,Personal hygiene your safe bet: Tamilisai,"Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan in her capacity as a medical doctor has a simple advice for people to protect oneself from coronavirus or any virus, “Do Wash your hands frequently before consuming food, or touching any part of the face”.

Speaking to The Hindu, on the sidelines of International Women’s Day celebrations at Raj Bhavan, here on Wednesday, she emphasised personal hygiene.

Dr. Soundararajan also advised people with symptoms of cold and cough to keep distance, avoid going into crowds. If one experiences any symptoms of fever, cold and distress in breathing, one should not hesitate to go to the doctor even if it could be common cold.

It is not only droplets, virus may settle on surfaces at home, workplace or in public places and people have the habit of touching the surfaces and door knobs. The best precaution is, thus, washing hands and avoiding handshake. When one sneezes or coughs, they should use a tissue or handkerchief, she said.

The Governor said awareness on hand wash is poor in general. Recently on the ‘Hand Wash day’ that was celebrated, she visited some schools and found that children were eating food without washing hands. Thus general awareness on hygiene should be stepped up. It is better to restrict travelling abroad to countries at this point of time where many Covid-19 cases were detected.

Emphasising that there is no need to panic, the Governor said when Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao called on her at Raj Bhavan, she inquired about the coronavirus as one positive case was detected. The Chief Minister said all necessary steps were being taken. She said the Central and State governments were alert to the situation and taking all possible steps to check the spread of the virus.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/personal-hygiene-your-safe-bet-tamilisai/article30984752.ece
279,2020/03/04,COVID-19: Telangana stuck between glimmer of hope and grip of fear,"With results of two persons tested for SARS-CoV-2 expected today, city goes on high alert

It was a contest between a glimmer of hope and the grip of fear among people in Telangana on Wednesday. The news of the samples of the four family members of the person from Hyderabad — who is the first from the State to test positive for SARS-CoV2 (coronavirus) — testing negative came as a glimmer of hope. However, suspense on COVID-19 status (positive or negative) of two other samples from the city continues to worry people.

One of the two samples is that of a woman software employee working in a company in Hi-Tec City. She has travel history to Italy. Sources said she had reached the city towards the end of February. While messages circulated on social media that she had tested positive for the virus, official announcement on the result would be available by Thursday evening.

The other person is a sanitation worker at Apollo Hospitals who came in contact with the index (first positive) COVID-19 case.

Out of the 47 persons whose samples were tested at ICMR’s laboratory at Gandhi Hospital on Tuesday, 45 tested negative and they were discharged from the hospital. Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender said they sent the remaining two samples to the National Institute of Virology at Pune for clarity.

Meanwhile, the medical condition of the index case from Telangana was stable.

As per protocol, if a sample collected form a person in the State tests negative, it is announced by the State Health department. In case a sample tests positive, the sample has to be sent to NIV-Pune for confirmation. If it tests positive again, the announcement is made by the Central government. The process was followed in declaring the first positive case from Telangana.

On Wednesday, 36 persons with the symptoms of the virus were admitted to the Gandhi Hospital (32 suspects) and Fever Hospital (four suspects). When tests were conducted, 31 tested negative. Results of 43 more samples are awaited. All of them are kept under isolation at government hospitals. Besides, 55 others were kept under home isolation on Wednesday.

As lakhs of people in the State were gripped by anxiety, the Health Minister tried to infuse hope into them, stating that four family members of the index case had tested negative for the virus.

“If the family members who lived with him did not contract the infection, evacuation (of employees) from buildings is not a good step. This virus does not spread through air. There is chance of the virus spreading if an infected person coughs, sneezes and the droplets fall into others’ nose, mouth, eyes,” Mr Rajender said..

Not everyone who stayed in the same room or travelled in same bus or train as an infected person would contract the virus, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kf8idm/article30965863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03COVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/between-a-glimmer-of-hope-and-the-grip-of-fear/article30984513.ece
280,2020/03/04,It’s not easy path for successful women: Governor,"International Women’s Day celebrated at Raj Bhavan

Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan has congratulated all the women who made a mark in different fields as it is not an easy path and their accomplishments were result of commitment and dedication in their chosen area of work.

Enthusing and inspiring the huge crowd of women from different fields- judicial officers, doctors, lawyers, teachers, people’s representatives, civil servants, social workers, sports and media personalities- invited to attend the International Women’s Day celebrations at the Raj Bhavan lawns here on Wednesday, Governor said she was enjoying the day ‘as one among you’.

She said women who come out would have to fulfil many responsibilities first at home and face challenges unlike men. “Thus, I believe one successful woman is equal to 1,000 successful men. I am a Governor today but it is not an easy path i walked. Yet with commitment, women can achieve any thing they aspire for” she said.

Referring to the theme of the celebration, “Empower women, Empower Nation’ she said women achievers need not be extraordinary women but ordinary women doing their work in an extraordinary way.

Wishing women a happy and healthy International Women’s Day, she as a doctor and gynaecologist urged all women to take care of their health first, go for periodical health check-up and cancer screening and practice Yoga, to be fit. Her advice to women was not to compromise their happiness and enjoy every second their family and work. Stress could be avoided with planning the day ahead, she said.

She earlier gave away awards to 21 persons who excelled in various fields including social service, sports persons, folk artists, women farmers, ordinary rural women who became Youtube sensations, Yoga, literature. Most of them hailed from humble backgrounds and made their mark through their zeal and passion and compassion for others.

281,2020/03/04,"Consult before suspending operations, govt. tells IT firms","Companies told to temporarily disable biometric system and avoid group meetings

Hours after a few software companies in Mindspace K Raheja IT Park suspended their operations due to COVID-19 fear, Principal Secretary (IT and Industries) Jayesh Ranjan on Wednesday appealed to IT companies in the State capital not to take such decisions without consulting the government.

During a press conference held by him, Cyberabad Commissioner of Police VC Sajjanar, Director, Public Health Dr. G Srinivas Rao and representatives of several IT companies, the Principal Secretary said companies should not keep their offices closed or ask their employees to work from home.

Mr. Ranjan appointed Mr. Sajjanar nodal officer and directed IT companies to inform him if they have planned to shut their operations or decided to direct their employees to work from home.

Officials said that it was panic which was making the companies suspend their operation.

On Wednesday, four IT companies operating from K Raheja IT Park suspended their operations, since a woman employee, who works there, is now quarantined and is undergoing treatment in Gandhi Hospital. She recently returned from Italy and has shown the symptoms of COVID-19.

Nine companies have their work stations in building no 20 in K Raheja IT Park with over 7,500 employees.

“Today the entire building is being sanitised and operations will be normal from Thursday,” Mr. Ranjan said told reporters.

Further the officials have suggested that the companies temporarily disable the biometric attendance system and group meetings at the conference halls, and instead use technology to hold meeting, as there is a high-risk of spreading the virus.

The officials have also requested the companies not to send their employees abroad amid coronavirus outbreak. “You already have other platforms to interact with the colleagues and clients abroad. Don't put your employees’ life at risk,"" they said.

Unlike earlier, now passengers arriving from other countries at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport are being screened using thermal scanners.

Director, Public Health, Dr. Rao said people should use sanitisers, wash their hands frequently and self quatrain in case they are suffering from cold, cough and fever.

“The effect of the virus will last only 12 hours in a particular place used by the suspect. Only people having cold and cough should use face masks,” he said, adding that in case of any assistance related to COVID-19 citizens can dial 104.

Later, Commissioner Sajjanar requested people not to believe in rumours on the social media on COVID-19 outbreak in the city. “We are keeping vigil to crack down the social media mongers,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/consult-before-suspending-operations-it-firms-told/article30984125.ece
282,2020/03/04,"‘Keep hands away from nose, eyes’","Those susceptible advised to expose themselves to the sun for half an hour daily

Reports about novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection have pressed the panic button in the city, resulting in mass evacuation of masks and hand sanitisers from pharmacy shelves.

Wearing a mask and sterilising hands, nevertheless, cannot guarantee absolute immunity against the infection if one is not wary of where one’s palms are going, caution medical experts.

No, switching from handshake to folded palms too cannot trick the dreaded virus. The seemingly innocuous railings in malls, airports, Metro Rail, or hand supports in buses too could bring the hands in contact with the virus, and the person may get infected when the palm is used to rub eyes or nose. One should cautiously keep one’s hands away till they are sanitised, from nose and eyes, if one has been to any of these places.

Medical experts from the Telangana Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, while seeking to allay needless fears about the virus, cautioned that the aged, those suffering from cardiac problems, cancer patients, those on steroids, kidney patients, and asthmatics are more susceptible and should be more careful.

On account of its sheer size, the virus cannot penetrate even a cloth mask, hence panic buying of N 95 respirators may be stopped. The virus spreads orally through cough and sneeze of the infected person. It stays alive on any surface for 12 hours, and on clothes for nine hours.

While chicken or meat does not spread the infection as long as it is boiled well enough, those handling the meat at shops and slaughter houses should be careful, and wash their hands every now and then, cautioned V.Vishnun Rao, pulmonologist by profession and treasurer of the association.

Good news is that the virus does not survive in temperatures above 27 degrees Centigrade, and those susceptible should expose themselves to the sun for half an hour every day to prevent infection, Dr.Vishnun Rao said.

People already suffering from cold, cough and fever should take utmost precautions not to spread the infection, and if possible, isolate themselves till they are confirmed free of the virus.

Using elbow instead of palm as cover while coughing could go a long way in prevention, and sanitising hands every hour is recommended. Stay away from crowded places, functions, weddings, and reunions with foreign-returned friends, Dr.Vishnun Rao said, recommending working from home.

All private hospitals in the association have resolved to send anybody reporting with symptoms of virus to the designated government referral hospitals, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/keep-hands-away-from-nose-eyes/article30983511.ece
283,2020/03/04,Adopt multi-pronged strategy to check COVID-19: HC,"‘Educational institutions should publicise precautionary measures’

Instructing the State government to take all steps to contain proliferation of COVID-19 (Caronavirus), the Telangana High Court on Wednesday said the government should issue advisories to educational institutions to take precautionary measures.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, hearing a PIL plea seeking ban on Holy celebrations in the backdrop of rising COVID-19 cases, said the police department must be instructed to review permissions granted to huge public congregations. Permission should be given as less as possible to big gatherings since it involved the risk of spread of the virus due to mingling of people.

A 45-year-old social worker G. Siddha Lakshmi from Manikonda filed the PIL petition by moving lunch motion. She sought a direction to the government to prohibit celebration of Holi on Monday and Tuesday. Dry and water colours are sprinkled by revellers while celebrating the festival of colours and this escalates the possibility of quicker spreading of the virus, the petitioner contended. Ms. Lakshmi also said hygiene practices should be publicised to keep the virus at bay.

After hearing contentions of senior counsel Vedula Venkata Ramana appearing for the petitioner, the bench said the government should issue advisories immediately to all educational institutions to take precautionary measures to control COVID-19. It instructed the government to set up isolation wards and exclusive hospitals for persons with the symptoms.

The bench said advisories should be issued to all orphanages, shelter homes, old age homes and prisons on preventive and curative measures. Organisations and others planning to hold Holi festivities on a big scale must be persuaded to minimise the celebrations with the threat of COVID-19 spread looming large.

The government should hold a meeting with all stake-holders along with the Director General of Prisons to prepare an action plan to tackle the virus which was spreading its wings in the State. The bench instructed that no under-trial prisoner should be presented before the High Court or trial courts in the State. The lower courts were instructed not to pass any adverse orders against any accused if they did not appear before the court.

The bench asked members of the HC Bar Association and those of other courts in the State to impress upon their clients not to come to the courts unless there was a dire need. It said that masks would be provided at the reception of the HC free of cost.

Senior lawyer S. Niranjan Reddy was appointed Amicus Curiae in the PIL petition. Mr. Reddy said that two more instances of testing positive for the virus were reported in the State. He said that since hospitals were among vulnerable places to contact the virus, isolation wards were the need of the hour. He suggested that government follow guidelines issued by UK government to tackle the virus.

The matter would be heard again on Thursday.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/adopt-multi-pronged-strategy-to-check-covid-19-hc/article30983326.ece
284,2020/03/04,COVID-19 scare hits Hitec City,"Panic and fear gripped parts of Raheja Mindspace in the Hitec City here after information of an IT employee being tested positive for COVID-19 began doing the rounds on social media, leading to the evacuation of several hundred employees working in four companies in different buildings.

Screenshots of an email purportedly sent by DSM, a company with around 350 employees, located in Building no. 20 of Raheja Mindspace went viral on social media and were met with shock and then fear. Several hundred panic-stricken employees were seen streaming out of Building no. 20 on foot and two and four wheelers, as security and facilities personnel in protective face masks were seen directing them out. Around 2,000 employees from nine companies are said to have left the building.

Concern among IT professionals was palpable as a large number wore masks, or covered their faces either with handkerchiefs or scarves, or stoles.

“I reached the office around 10.30 a.m. and went to have tea nearby. When I returned, I saw people were rushing out of the building. It began around 11.15 a.m. It was more of an exodus than an evacuation. There was panic everywhere,” an employee of a tech giant working from the same building said.

As word of evacuation spread like wildfire, techies in other buildings too began making inquiries with their management. “WhatsApp groups were flooded with messages to check whether co-workers returned from any on-site visit or even if they had gone on vacation to other countries. All the people I know from other companies, even in Gachibowli were scared,” said M A Raheem, who works as an IT networking specialist for an Indian IT firm.

The DSM employee, tested positive, has a travel history to Italy and works with a team of 20. Government officials advised the team members to go into-self isolation.

In a separate development, the husband of the DSM employee works in Duff and Phelps, a company in Purva Summit. Employees of this company too were evacuated. Around the same time, several employees of telecommunications company Qualcomm too were evacuated. IT Secretary Jayesh Ranjan confirmed the developments at a joint press conference with Cyberabad Police Commissioner V C Sajjanar.

Employees working in the building made a beeline to get out with several of them wearing face masks. Staff working in the facility services and maintenance too were seen fogging or spraying inside and outside the buildings. Further, Building no. 20 is being disinfected and sanitised.

This summer, citizens can use air coolers to the fullest and yet expect a reduction in power bills with Orient Electric launching on Wednesday new generation coolers with inverter and ‘electronically commutated motor’ technology to save power with more efficiency.

Orient Electric’s managing director & chief executive officer Rakesh Khanna and business head Salil Kappoor, told a press conference that the latest range of air coolers will provide 45% power saving or up to ₹1,500 a year at an average and enables the life of the motor to be doubled. Besides, it has 25% less noise when compared to other branded counterparts and works on low voltage too.

“We are launching the products nationwide starting from Hyderabad as both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are top selling air cooler states across the country with 2.5 lakh/2lakh unit sales, respectively. Branded air coolers sale across the country is about 27-30 lakh annually and the numbers could be double in the unorganised sector,” they said.

Air coolers have been categorised into three - mass, mass-premium and premium with 54 models having capacity of 8-105 litres. Price range for inverter coolers is between ₹15,000-₹20,000, other range of air coolers prices begin from ₹5,190 and are equipped with auto fill function, anti-mosquito breeding, humidity control, etc.

Select models can be controlled by a mobile, wi-fi and voice control as they are IoT - Internet of Things, enabled. Orient Electric belongs to the $2.4 billion C.K. Birla Group and claims to have “40% of the premium market and healthy double digit growth in this segment”, according to Mr. Khanna.

Former Indian cricket captain M.S. Dhoni is the brand ambassador and commercials featuring him are scheduled to be on TV and various digital platforms. A contest to choose 11 favourite models will entail special prizes if the ‘team’ tallies with that of Dhoni. For details visit www.orientelectric.com, said Mr. Kappoor.

287,2020/03/04,Isolation Ward exclusively for COVID-19 suspects opened in Karimnagar District HQ Hospital,"Authorities were prepared to tackle granite buyers from China, but none came, and local businessmen too put off their travel plans to that country

Following instructions of the State government, the District Medical and Health Department had opened an exclusive COVID-19 Isolation Ward in the District Headquarters Hospital here.

All geared up

The Special Isolation Ward with nine beds is fully equipped for the treatment of suspected COVID-19 patients. Authorities have deployed a pulmonologist, a physician, a staff nurse, ANMs and others at the ward with adequate drugs, N95 masks, and regular masks.

Earlier, authorities were instructed to focus on granite buyers visiting the district granite industry from China, isolate them from society, put them in an isolation ward, collect their blood samples, and allow them to move only after testing negative.

However, since the outbreak of COVID-19 in January this year, buyers from China have stopped visiting the district due to restrictions and local businessmen too have stopped going to China.

Locals demand relocation

However, the location of COVID-19 Isolation Ward adjoining the Mother and Child Health Centre (MCHC) on the premises had become a big cause of concern among the hospital pattients as well as the MCHC.

Though there is no incidence of COVID-19 suspect cases reported in the district, patients suggested the medical authorities relocate the ward to the town’s outskirts in LMD Colony, or to the Housing Board Colony.

Telangana Health Department officials are gripped with anxiety as two out of 47 samples, in which viral load is reportedly high, are being sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, for further tests to confirm COVID-19.

Out of the 47 samples tested at the Gandhi Hospital here on Tuesday, 45 were found to be negative. “Results of the two remaining samples which were sent to NIV are expected on Thursday,” said Telangana’s Director of Public Health Dr. G. Srinivas Rao. Nodal Officer for Coronavirus Dr. G. Vijay Kumar said the viral load in the two samples was high.

289,2020/03/04,Hyderabad COVID-19 patient questioned on contacts,"45 people isolated at Gandhi Hospital, samples sent for tests

In his 24 years, perhaps Monday was the first time that this Hyderabad man was persistently asked by someone to give minute-by-minute details of who all he met, places he had been to, how much time he spent with them from the moment he stepped into Telangana.

Officials from the Telangana Health department were keen to know even micro details after his COVID-19 infection was confirmed. Officials found out the exact time at which he boarded the Bengaluru-Hyderabad bus, number of drivers and helpers in it and whether he had dinner with others on the way.

After confirmation on Monday afternoon that he tested positive for COVID-19, isolating and treating the young man was not the only priority for the officials in State Health department. The 88-odd people he was in close contact with after reaching Hyderabad have also been given top priority as they could become source of infection if they too are carrying the infection.

The techie who works for a software company in Bengaluru returned from Dubai to the city on February 20. He worked there for a day and reached Hyderabad on February 22 by a private bus.

Ground level staff, senior officials from the Health department took turns to speak to the COVID-19 patient for over 30 minutes each to know his travel history, places he visited and people he met. Wary of aggressiveness with which the virus spreads, officials spoke to him over phone. And the details he gave made officials and staff wide-eyed.

During the course of journey to Hyderabad and after reaching the city, he met at least 88 people including 27 bus passengers, family members, around 20 doctors and staff at Apollo Hospital, Secunderabad.

The youth said his father picked him up from the bus stop and drove straight to their home. After developing cough and sickness, he consulted family doctors. When the sickness did not subside, he consulted doctors at the corporate hospital as an out-patient, underwent tests and got admitted there later.

Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender said that out of the 88 people, 45 have been isolated at Gandhi Hospital and their swab samples were sent for tests.

‘Condition stable’

The Minister said the condition of the techie was stable and the process of tracking people he came in contact with was on.

“The health condition of the man has shown improvement since Monday,” he said.

292,2020/03/04,Govt. hospitals lack the critical equipment,"Lack of critical infrastructure at Telangana government hospitals, where COVID suspects could be isolated, is staring in the face of Health department officials. There is a definite need for more resources at Government General and Chest Hospital.

Though a Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) with 10 mechanical ventilators was inaugurated exactly a month ago, they cannot be put to use as Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) test equipment needed to use the machines is not provided. Besides, the hospital has only one old ambulance and lacks a CT Scan machine. At the over 24-bedded hospital, if more than three patients are in need of emergency cardiologist support or others, all of them cannot be taken in the same vehicle.

“Blood is drawn for ABG test to know if ventilator support is working. If this resource is not available, how are the ventilators supposed to be used?” sources questioned, adding that a new ambulance with ventilator support is needed as all patients at the Chest Hospital suffer from various forms of lung diseases.

Though other government hospitals are not identified for isolation of COVID suspects, there is an urgent need for infrastructure there too. 2D Echo machine, Cath lab, operation table for organ transplantations is needed at Osmania General Hospital.

Sources said that superintendents of all hospitals have placed requests which were cleared. “It might take a few months’ time to get the equipment such as CT Scan for Chest Hospital. Other requests too were cleared,” senior officials from the State Health department said.

293,2020/03/04,COVID-19 | Seven test negative in Hyderabad,"All eyes, however, are on the 36 people who came in close contact with infected techie whose swab samples were collected on Tuesday

Seven persons, whose swab samples were collected on Monday, have tested negative for coronavirus (COVID-19). However, all eyes are on the test results of the 36 people whose swab samples were collected on Tuesday to ascertain if they are infected with coronavirus. The 36 people include those among the 88 who came in close contact with the 24-year-old COVID-19 positive patient from Hyderabad.

The medical condition of the youngster who used to work in a software company in Bengaluru was learnt to have improved, compared to Monday. A few days ago, he was diagnosed with pneumonia. Usually, samples collected from the coronavirus suspects are tested at ICMR’s laboratory located in Gandhi Hospital, Musheerabad, Hyderabad. The results are known in a matter of few hours. National Institute of Virology, Pune will be consulted to confirm if the samples tested positive for COVID-19. Samples which tested positive will be announced thereafter.

Sources said that they have been under anxious wait to know the test results. If anyone tests positive, they have to further increase their tracking mechanism and surveillance measures. “We were expecting to know the test results by Tuesday early night. But we did not get to know yet. All are on high alert to know if anyone in close contact with the COVID patient tests positive,” sources said. It was learnt that officials have been wide awake till the late hours of Tuesday to know the status.

Officials have already started to gather information about the secondary contacts: people who came in contact with the 88 close contacts of the COVID-19 patients.

Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender said that in addition to Gandhi Hospital, Fever Hospital, Government General and Chest Hospital located in the city, they have identified Military Hospital in Secunderabad and TB Sanatorium in Vikarabad for isolation and treatment of COVID-suspects.

Besides, he said that they spoke to managements of private teaching hospitals to keep beds for the isolation of suspects. “On the whole, around 3,000 beds have been identified for COVID suspects. Private hospitals were directed to refer the suspects to us and not to provide treatment without informing us,” Mr. Rajender said.

Private hospitals’ managements were instructed to have separate Out-Patient counters for those suffering from cold, fever. Travel history of patients who went abroad is to be collected.

295,2020/03/04,Islanders demand 24-hour water supply,"Panchayat president leads protest in front of KWA office

Kadamakudy panchayat president Salini Babu is leading a sit-in in front of the Kerala Water Authority office for the past two days demanding more water to islanders. There was not enough water for over a week, she said. Demanding 24-hour water supply to all the seven islands, she said the Muppathadam project was conceived for Kadamakudy and a quantity of four million litres a day was projected for the island up to 2037. However, the island was not even getting one-fourth of the water produced, she said.

The island got water only from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., she said. A large quantity of water was getting diverted to Varapuzha panchayat from the same line, she added.

She said the supply to Kadamakudy should be separated to ensure 24-hour water supply.

Ms. Babu said that their demands also included increasing the capacity of pumps and appointing one more person at the Pizhala pumping station.

A KWA project had been under way for streamlining distribution for the past two years. However, in spite of extension of deadlines twice, the project had not been completed.

The panchayat was being forced to utilise the funds for water tanker supplies. The fund was kept aside for procuring water during drought, she said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/islanders-demand-24-hour-water-supply/article30976096.ece

The court asked the Collector to file a report in this regard on March 4.

The order was issued on a petition filed by office-bearers of the temple committee. According to them, the Collector had rejected their application seeking permission to conduct fireworks display on March 6 on the ground that there was no adequate space to keep the norm of 100-metre distance.

297,2020/03/04,"Brahmapuram dumping yard, an unmitigated disaster","The waste arriving at the plant daily had also increased exponentially from around 135 tonnes in 2008 to 383 tonnes in 2018

Councillors across party lines agreed that the Brahmapuram dumping yard was an unmitigated disaster. “The operation of the Brahmapuram yard, right from collection of waste to transporting and weighing, is unscientific. It has become a white elephant that is emptying our coffers, but solutions will have to be found,” said UDF councillor P.D. Martin, chairman, welfare standing committee.

“The Corporation should have encouraged and promoted the treatment of biodegradable waste at the source. The waste-to-energy plant cannot be seen as a remedy, when little has been done to reduce the volume of waste taken to Brahmapuram,” said Opposition councillor V.P. Chandran.

The waste arriving at the plant daily had also increased exponentially from around 135 tonnes in 2008 to 383 tonnes in 2018, Mr. Chandran said. This could have been avoided if managing waste at the source was encouraged by the corporation.

Plant nearly defunct

The waste treatment plant, which had a capacity of 250 tonnes per day, at the yard was in poor shape and was processing little waste, he said. For the nearly defunct waste management plant, the corporation was shelling out an average of ₹35 lakh per month at a rate of ₹550 per tonne of biodegradable waste, councillor C.K. Peter pointed out. Roughly 233 tonnes of biodegradable waste arrived at the plant daily, he said, quoting from figures available with the corporation, but there was no clarity on the amount of compost generated or sold.

Discussions at the State level had found that in-situ processing would not work for non-biodegradable waste, necessitating a centralised system like the waste-to-energy plant, Mayor Soumini Jain countered. While Brahmapuram remained a disaster, the waste-to-energy plant was plagued by delays and had made no progress in years, Congress councillor A.B. Sabu said.

The corporation was also paying large sums to rent lorries that transport waste – around ₹6.56 crore last year alone, Mr. Peter said. The cost of transporting had doubled from an amount of ₹3.25 crore in 2015, when rates were calculated per day instead of the current system of calculating by weight of waste transported.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/brahmapuram-dumping-yard-an-unmitigated-disaster/article30976081.ece
298,2020/03/04,Corporation fails to move an inch forward on Brahmapuram,"Proposals for biomining of non-biodegradable waste, creation of easy access roads for fire personnel, leachate plant stalled

Despite a meeting that ran into hours on Tuesday to exclusively discuss proposals related to the Brahmapuram dumping yard, the Kochi Corporation council could not arrive at any concrete decisions to resolve pressing issues, including that of recurring fires, at the site.

Councillors have, however, ensured that proposals to manage the mounting piles of waste remain ensnared in procedural hurdles for months. Biomining of legacy waste, which could rid the site of all non-biodegradable waste that has been accumulating since the yard began to be used in 2008 and has been catching fire, is unlikely to come to fruition during the term of the current corporation council.

Councillors refused to approve the rate of ₹597 per metre cube of waste quoted by the contractor on the grounds that the liability would be too large for the local body to bear. “The Corporation would have to shell out ₹24 crore to biomine the nearly 1 lakh tonnes of legacy waste at the site,” said Benedict Fernandez, LDF councillor. The proposal would now be examined by the Health and Finance Standing Committees after Opposition councillors said that it had not been scrutinised by the committees before it was placed before the council as per the norm.

Suggestions made by the Fire and Rescue Services Department to construct roads through the yard and ensure easy availability of water to fire engines are also unlikely to be implemented soon. With councillors objecting to the costs, proposals for road work worth ₹4.5 crore and digging a pond, at a cost of ₹21 lakh, from which fire engines can draw water, will be studied by the standing committees and placed before the council again for its approval.

Argument over agency

The proposal for a leachate treatment plant at the site has also been stalled with councillors bickering over the involvement of German agency GIZ in preparing the detailed project report and suggesting methods of treatment. The proposal will now be reconsidered by the Health Standing Committee. The agency had offered its know-how free of cost, Mayor Soumini Jain said, pointing out that the absence of a treatment plant had invited the ire of the National Green Tribunal and led to the tribunal slapping a fine of ₹1 crore on the civic body.

The only action that will be taken at Brahmapuram soon is the installation of fire hydrants with councillors approving the proposal worth ₹19 lakh.

Speaking to media persons after the meeting, Ms. Jain said the recent resignation of some standing committee chairpersons which necessitated a rejig of the committees, might have meant that some proposals were not placed before these committees. “Councillors should have been able to stand together to take quick decisions and avoid procedural delays,” she said, pointing out that the Corporation Secretary was on Tuesday required to explain to the Chief Secretary the delay in biomining legacy waste.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/q859sj/article30976068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04KIBRAHMAPURAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/corpn-fails-to-move-an-inch-forward-on-brahmapuram/article30976069.ece
299,2020/03/04,Social health intervention helps to control hypertension,"Volunteers bring about changes in lifestyle, food habits

Social health intervention seems to have worked wonders in 10 slums in Kochi where a group of women volunteers helped to bring about changes in the lifestyle and food habits of the people to achieve better control of hypertension.

The pilot project, taken up by the National Health Mission in association with the Kochi Corporation and Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences as part of “Unite for Healthy Ernakulam” mission, trained the women volunteers to care for groups of persons in 10 slums.

In six months, the intervention helped to improve control of hypertension among 39% of the patients compared with 21% at the start of the study which began in March 2019 and ended in September the same year.

The volunteers built such a rapport with the target groups that they could even gain entry into their kitchens and advise them on healthy ways of cooking for the family.

They also created awareness on the need for controlling blood pressure, adherence to the medical regimen, importance of diet, physical activity and the dangers of smoking.

High salt intake and poor adherence to medication were found to be a major hindrance to controlling blood pressure. The poor patients’ non-adherence to the medical regimen was due to lack of knowledge of its consequences and ignorance of their hypertension status.

Of the 4,578 persons who were the focus of the intervention, adults constituted 77% (3,521). Among those screened, 33% were new cases of hypertension.

The 43 volunteers from self help groups (SHGs) extended social and emotional support to the target groups to encourage behaviour changes and also provided linkages to primary health centres. The SHG members conducted peer group meetings every month which were attended by elected representatives as well as local opinion leaders.

Of the 231 slums in the city, 10 were chosen for the study while 10 other slums were designated as control areas where no intervention was made. The slums were chosen at random, including three in Mattancherry and Palluruthy, three in the core city areas of Thammanam, Palarivattom, and Thykoodam, and one in Thevara.

The volunteers were provided support to move into the community for a long-term management of chronic diseases.

Social intervention

The project was also a study among the population to know whether an intervention at the social level would help improve the health indices.

The women were to tackle the problem among the population where prevalence of cardiovascular diseases was reported to be the highest in Kerala with over 5,000 cases per one lakh population, and incidences of stroke were over 625 per one lakh population (studies published in Lancet Global Health).

Studies have also shown that one in three adults in the State has hypertension with 65,600 people dying of the disorder every year.

Research strategies

Dr. Mathews Numpelil, district programme manager of the NHM, and Dr. Rakesh P.S., Public Health Intervention Specialist, and the Community Medicine Department of the Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, devised the strategies of the research group. They highlighted the findings of the study at a press conference in the city on Tuesday.

Kochi Corporation Deputy Mayor K. R. Prem Kumar handed over the copy of the study results to District Panchayat president Dolly Kuriakose for possible replication of the work in the entire Ernakulam District Panchayat.

A copy was also handed over by District Medical Officer N.K. Kuttappan to Dr. Bipin Gopal, State Nodal Officer for Non-Communicable Diseases, for possible intervention in other parts of the State.

300,2020/03/04,James Taylor gets nostalgic,"One always looks forward to a new album by singer-songwriter James Taylor. So I was happy to hear that, he’d released American Standard, a collection of songs from the ‘Great American Songbook’ (a set of popular and enduring songs from the 1920s to the 1950s that were created for Broadway theatre, musical theatre, and Hollywood musical films), last month.

Among male vocalists, Taylor has one of the most distinct and pleasant voices. His has a unique timbre and an easy delivery style, emphasising on the diction of every word. In a career spanning 52 years, he’s sold over 100 million records, attracting a devoted following from those who like their songs simple, folksy and meaningful. ‘Sweet Baby James’, ‘Fire And Rain’, ‘Copperline’ and his rendition of Carole King's ‘You've Got A Friend’ are evidence of his brilliance.

Long overdue

The American singer, who will turn 72 on March 12, has not been prolific of late. In 2008, he released Covers, which had versions of popular songs like ‘Hound Dog’, ‘Suzanne’ and ‘On Broadway’. Five years ago, Before This World had his original songs. And now, after a long wait, we have American Standard.

Over the years, many singers have produced compilations of the standards - highly influential and popular songs written from the 1920s to the 1950s, and culled from Broadway, musical theatre, Hollywood musicals and recorded pop or jazz albums. Most standards were presented by old-timers like Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Nina Simone, Sammy Davis Jr, Dean Martin and other greats from that era.

After 1970, some of the most memorable records have been released by Willie Nelson, Linda Ronstadt, Ray Charles, Harry Nilsson, Bryan Ferry of Roxy Music, Diana Krall and Michael Buble. In 2014, Lady Gaga collaborated with veteran artiste Tony Bennett on the album Cheek To Cheek.

Rod Stewart released 67 standards over five volumes, and if his early attempts were admired, the later ones were criticised for being too formula-driven. Though George Michael had some good renditions in Songs From The Last Century, the album didn’t quite match his image. The attempts by Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan attracted criticism, as nobody associated their singing styles with those classics.

In form

In the best renditions of standards, the singer retains the flavour of the original song, and yet adds his or her individual touch. This is where American Standard scores. Taylor’s voice texture and delivery style haven't changed a bit, and he sounds as fresh as he did 45 or 50 years ago.

He begins with ‘My Blue Heaven;, popularised by Gene Austin in 1928, and follows up with Henry Mancini’s ‘Moon River’ and the jazz standard ‘Teach Me Tonight’. The track list includes ‘You’ve Got To Be Carefully Taught’ and ‘The Surrey With The Fringe On Top’ created by Rodgers-Hammerstein II, and the Gene Kelly popularised ‘Almost Like Being In Love’.

My favourites are the Rodgers-Hart beauty ‘My Heart Stood Still’, Billie Holiday's ‘God Bless The Child; and the Hoagy Carmichael masterpiece ‘The Nearness Of You’. Aided by smooth and varied arrangements featuring the acoustic guitar, violin, cello, trumpet, harmonica, gentle electric guitar and basic percussion, Taylor takes these songs to another level. His voice that makes you swim in an ocean of nostalgia, morning or night.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/6zi9uk/article30983658.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5bm-music-column,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/james-taylor-gets-nostalgic/article30983659.ece
301,2020/03/04,Musician couple Alexandre Jurain and Sukanta Bose treat Hyderabad to a fine mix of music,"Making music together

When Alexandre Jurain, 44, met Sukanta Bose, 43 in Shantiniketan nearly two decades ago, little did the duo know that their meeting would result in the forming of Azarak — a coming together of two different people, countries and kinds of music. The duo married and continue to create music, most of which is inspired by Nature.

Alexandre Jurain

Alexandre was born in a village in Champagne, France surrounded by forests and ponds. Passionate about nature and music, he learnt the piano, discovers jazz, and listens to Bach, John Coltrane, Keith Jarreth, Magma, Bartok and Stravinsky. Increasingly interested in Indian music, he arrived in Shantiniketan at the end of 2000 and met Abir Singh, a fantastic musician playing one of the rarest stringed instruments in the world, the esraj.

It is at Shantiniketan, that he met Sukanta, who became his companion, in life and in music. Born in Chandernagor, West Bengal, her parents, passionate singers, introduced her from a very young age to Indian classical music and to the interpretation of Rabindra Sangeet. While studying painting at the University of Shantiniketan, created by Tagore in the early 20th century, Sukanta took singing lessons from two masters, Vikram Singh and Mohan Singh.

Alexandre reminisces about their early years and says, “We met a long time ago and our music has changed over the years. Initially Sukanta used to sing Rabindra sangeet and I used to accompany her, but after I learnt playing the esraj, we started touring and composing together.”

Sukanta Bose

The duo were in town recently for the Dhi Collective and Alliance Francaise of Hyderabad event A Performance by Azarak which saw their dexterous talent mesmerise the audience. Sukanta shares their story when she reveals, “Alex composed many tunes during his childhood walking in the forests amid moon light and when he learnt the esraj, he used those tunes to compose the music which we have improvised upon.”

The 300-year-old esraj is a bowed stringed instrument which is a combination between sarangi and sitar. The base of the instrument is like sarangi while the neck and strings are like sitar. It gives a sound very much like sarangi without being as difficult to play. Remarking on his association with the instrument, the musician shares, “When I was a child, I used to play the piano, so I was used to playing an instrument. When I came to Shantiniketan, I started playing the instrument and never looked back.”

The duo who enjoy performing pieces like ‘Orphee and Eurydice’ and ‘Wïsso Waï’ admit that theirs is a confluence of different styles. “There is a lot of similarity in our thought process and ideology even though there is a difference in our musical styles. Both of us find harmony in nature and like to be in sync with it. It was this philosophy which brought us together.” As the interview comes to a close, they sign off full of praise for the city, “We didn’t explore the city as we were tied up with the concert but the people were good listeners and it has been a great experience.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/9d521g/article30979496.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym03sukanta-Alexandre-Jurainjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/alexandre-jurain-sukanta-bose-azarak/article30979497.ece

The number of Telugu speaking people in Assam is almost twice that of the combined number of those who speak three other major south India languages – Malayalam, Tamil and Kannada in that order.

Hindi speakers are the third largest linguistic group in Assam behind the Assamese and Bengali people, linguistic data from the 2011 census presented in the Assembly has revealed.

The Assamese speakers accounting for 48% of the State’s population led the linguistic list with 1.51 crore people, followed by the Bengali speakers with 90.24 lakh people (38% of the total population of 3.1 crore). The Hindi speakers, comprising 6.73% of the population, had 21 lakh people. They outnumbered the Bodo speakers – the largest plains tribe in the Northeast – by 6.85 lakh.

The Bodos were 4.53% of the total population followed by the Mishing tribal dialect speakers with 1.98%., the Nepali speakers with 1.91% and the Karbi dialect speakers with 1.63%.

The data showed that Assam was home to people belonging to almost all States and communities across India and beyond, as evident from 173 people listed as ‘Afghani’.

Non-Muslim communities on Tuesday gifted a Koran each to a vandalised mosque in western Assam’s Baksa district as a token of communal harmony.

Unidentified miscreants had on March 1 night vandalised Kalapani Anchalik Mosque and burnt 14 Islamic holy texts, including some copies of the Koran. This had enraged the people of the area. Baksa is one of the four districts under the politically volatile Bodoland Territorial Council where elections are due in April.

“We organised a peace committee meeting today (Tuesday) where people from various communities from the village and surrounding areas came together to discuss ways of maintaining communal harmony. Elders of each non-Muslim community gifted the mosque a copy of the Koran,” said District Superintendent of Police Thube Pratik Bijoy Kumar.

The authorities feel this gesture would go a long way in ensuring peace in a district that has been troubled by communal violence since the 1990s. Most of these incidents were election-related.

Politicians kept away

Locals said there was a conscious effort by all the communities to keep local politicians out of the peace committee meeting.

BJP supporters had allegedly raised the slogans en route to attending Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s rally in Kolkata on Sunday.

‘Rally staged by TMC’

BJP’s State leadership distanced itself from the Sunday incident. Party vice-president Subhas Sarkar said that the ‘goli maro’ rally was “staged by TMC to malign the BJP”.

The Kolkata police have registered a case under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), 34 (common intent), 505 (public mischief) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had described the slogan as “inflammatory, illegal and demonic” and said strong action will be taken.

War of words

Meanwhile, a war of words over the recent political developments in the State continued with BJP MP and Union Minister of State Babul Supriyo criticising Ms. Banerjee for her “genocide” remarks.

On Monday, Ms. Banerjee had called the violence in Delhi a “planned genocide”.

Mr. Supriyo urged the Chief Minister not to make ‘provocative’ statements. “The Chief Minister doesn’t even know the meaning of genocide. So she should think twice before shooting off her mouth. At a time when normalcy is returning to Delhi, she should stop making these kind of provocative comments,” he said.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/one-more-arrested-for-raising-provocative-slogan/article30976439.ece

312,2020/03/04,Green Task Force to accept card payments,"Swiping machines introduced on pilot basis in two Corpn. wards

The Green Task Force in Kozhikode city is all set to go digital. The task force members will now carry swiping machines with them to collect user fee from shops and houses. The project was launched on a pilot basis in Wards 61 and 62 on Monday.

There are around 500 Green Task Force members in the Corporation, who collect biodegradable as well as non-biodegradable waste from establishments and houses. The user fee depends on the quantity of the waste collected. It could be a minimum of ₹60 for non-biodegradable waste and a maximum of ₹10,000. However, bigger establishments such as malls pay around ₹25,000 per month as user fee.

The decision to introduce swiping machines comes after several users expressed difficulty to pay in cash. “With the swiping machine, the fee goes directly to the account of the force and there is proper record for every transaction,” said K.M. Gireeshan, project manager of Green Task Force, Kozhikode Corporation. He said there were plans to use a UPI platform for online cash transactions, which enables users to pay the fee without the task force members visiting them. At present, urban local bodies at Talipparamba and Kannur are the only ones in the State to have made arrangements to collect user fee digitally.

Meanwhile, the task force is yet to be in full swing in many wards of the Corporation. “We have trained all the task force members and they are ready for deployment. But it is the absence of enough material recovery facilities (MRFs) that is stopping them from getting on the field,” said Mr. Gireeshan. At present, the Kozhikode Corporation has MRFs at Njeliyanparamba and West Hill. The tender proceedings have been completed for six other MRFs, which are expected to be completed in three months.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/green-task-force-to-accept-card-payments/article30975978.ece

Alva’s Kannada Medium High School, Puttige, Moodbidri, was conferred the Dr. Nitte Shankara Adyanthaya Memorial Best School Awards 2020 among rural Kannada-medium schools on Nitte University Campus, Deralakatte, near here, on Tuesday.

While Vivekananda High School, Tenkila, Puttur, received the second prize, Navajeevan Higher Secondary School, Perdala-Badiyadka, was given a special prize for Kasargod district of Kerala. The first prize comprised ₹ 15 lakh in cash and a plaque, the second prize ₹ 10 lakh in cash and a plaque and the special prize ₹ 3 lakh in cash and a plaque.

The former Lokayukta N. Santosh Hegde and MAHE Pro-Chancellor H.S. Ballal presented the awards in the presence of Nitte (Deemed to be University) Chancellor N. Vinay Hegde and others.

The Dr. Nitte Shankara Adyanthaya Memorial Best School Awards were constituted in 2016 with the objective of recognising and encouraging rural Kannada-medium schools excelling in all spheres of education. Schools in the districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi and also Kasargod district in Kerala were evaluated on the performance of students in the 10th standard examinations, achievements in sports, cultural activities, school infrastructure and innovative educational practices.

The Award Committee was headed by Mr. Santosh Hegde and included representatives of the District Offices of Public instruction/Education.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Vinay Hegde said that Kannada medium helped him to understand life properly and he has much love for the language. Kannada language was never an obstacle for growth and if anyone has such a feeling, one should remove that. A student achieves overall growth not just by studying in English medium alone, he said. Many Kannada medium schools in Kasargod district of Kerala were on the verge of closure; they have to be saved, Mr. Hegde said.

Dr. Ballal said that language was the focal centre of one’s culture and tradition; disappearance of a language results in the destruction of the tradition and culture. Mr. Santosh Hegde said that schools were getting name and fame because of students. It was necessary to inculcate values among students for a corruption-free society, he said.

322,2020/03/04,Rise in inflow at Baje dam likely to reduce water scarcity in Udupi this summer,"In addition, there is water in stock in the dam at Shiroor: Municipal Commissioner Anand Kallolikar

With the water level increasing by about three inches due to rain upstream at Baje Dam against the Swarna, from where water is supplied to Udupi city, the municipality is not expecting water shortage this summer.

Last summer, the city had faced chronic water scarcity and the municipality had resorted to water rationing with many localities getting water once a week.

The water level in the Baje dam on Tuesday stood at 5.59 metres. Last year, the water level in the dam stood at 5.39 metres.

While the Baje Dam is about 18 km from here, the Shiroor dam, smaller than the Baje dam, is about 22 km from here. Last year, there was no water in the Shiroor dam in March.

Municipal Commissioner Anand Kallolikar told The Hindu that last year the water inflow at Baje dam had stopped in January. There were no pre-monsoon showers upstream either, which led to chronic water scarcity in the city.

“But the rain on Monday in the upstream areas has increased the water level in the Baje dam by three inches. Besides, we have water stock in Shiroor dam. We expect to tide over this summer without any severe water scarcity,” he said.

The work to remove silt taken up in the areas in two blocks behind the Baje dam — one from the behind the Baje dam to Mane bridge and the other from Mane Bridge up to Shiroor Mutt — in November-December 2019, has also increased the water storage capacity of the reservoir. The work was taken up after about eight years.

Meanwhile, the Udupi municipality is planning to divide the city into three zones to ensure equitable water supply during summer as there were complaints every summer from the residents staying in uplying areas, including Manipal, Indira Nagar, Manjushri Nagar, of not getting water because of lack of water pressure.

“Hence, we have decided to supply water to the three zones in turns so that there was no drop in water pressure and the people in the uplying areas were supplied water. But this plan has to receive the nod of the district administration,” Mr. Kallolikar said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/ozo45t/article30976178.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MNBAJEINFLOW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/rise-in-inflow-at-baje-dam-likely-to-reduce-water-scarcity-in-udupi-this-summer/article30976179.ece
323,2020/03/04,Battered NH 66 stretch in city between Nanthoor-Surathkal gets a new look,"National Highways Authority of India takes up restoration works at a cost of ₹ 7.74 crore

The battered stretches of National Highway 66 between Nanthoor Junction and Surathkal have acquired a new look, thanks to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) that has undertaken extensive restoration works.

The 17-km stretch of four-lane NH 66 built under the Port Connectivity Project was filled with pot-holes and craters during and after the monsoon. Slow moving vehicles on the stretch that also connects the New Mangalore Port, had been causing frequent traffic snarls on the busy stretch of the highway that connects the northern and southern parts of the country.

NHAI came under severe criticism for the pathetic condition of the stretch, for which it collects exorbitant toll at the Surathkal Toll Plaza. With the monsoon getting extended beyond October, NHAI and the State Public Works Department had to resort to temporary patch-filling work on the highway before the November 2 visit of Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu to the National Institute of Technology, Karnataka, at Surathkal.

Post-December, the authority took up road restoration works starting with concreting of busy junctions, including Chokkabettu Junction, near Kulai.

Later, the T Junction in the Baikampady Industrial Area on NH 66 that had witnessed massive erosion, was restored with fixing of paving blocks. The battered ascending ramp of Kulur Flyover too was restored thereafter.

Meanwhile, NHAI has been giving a fresh coat of bitumen on the remaining stretches of the highway, between Baikampady and Kulur, between Kulur and Nanthoor and on other stretches.

Funds

Though the NHAI project office in Mangaluru had received ₹ 6.1 crore for maintenance of the stretch during 2018-19, no visible work was taken up. However, with ₹ 7.74 crore being released for the current financial year, the authority has addressed major problems affecting the travelling public.

Welcoming the work, Suresh Kumar, a resident of Baikampady, said that at least now road users and people around the highway could heave a sigh of relief with no potholes and dust. Yet, there are stretches where rainwater gets collected along the highway and NHAI should address this issue too.

Otherwise, all the restoration work would get washed away in the monsoon, he cautioned.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/g0w5jv/article30976155.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MNNATIONALHIGHWAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/battered-nh-66-stretch-in-city-between-nanthoor-surathkal-gets-a-new-look/article30976156.ece
324,2020/03/04,Bond yields decline on expectation of rate cut,"After Fed action, market sees RBI following suit

After the U.S. Federal Reserve reduced interest rates on Tuesday to fight the economic slowdown due to the spread of COVID-19, there is growing expectation in the domestic market that the Reserve Bank will follow suit.

Bond yields softened on Wednesday amid rate cut hopes, with the yield on the 10-year government bond dropping 12 bps to close the day at 6.23%.

“We note other Asian central banks have already been easing on account of expected supply-led growth disruptions, while the RBI has been stealth easing via [long-term repo operation], partly as high inflation inhibited conventional easing,” Madhavi Arora, lead economist, Edelweiss Securities, said.

“However, as we argued post another sluggish GDP print last week, RBI could now front-load its impending rate cuts and could further the LTROs by as early as end March,” Ms. Arora said.

After cutting interest rates by 135 bps between February and October 2019, the central bank has hit the pause button. At the same time, it introduced long-term repo operationsthrough which it lends to banks at rates cheaper than prevailing market rates. “Coordinated easing measures taken by central banks open up an opportunity for RBI to look at easing. The correction in crude oil prices would help push inflation down, allowing RBI to look through the transient inflationary forces which had forced it to ‘pause’ last time. Interest rate sensitive sectors viz., banking, auto, real estate and housing finance would [benefit],” said Pankaj Bobade, head — Fundamental Research, Axis Securities.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Tuesday’s Fed cut supported the call of a 50 bps RBI rate cut in 2020.

325,2020/03/04,COVID-19 | SEBI says gauging virus impact,"Taking necessary steps, says whole-time member Mohanty

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is assessing the possible impact of COVID-19 on the markets and taking steps to tackle the same, said S. K. Mohanty, whole-time member, SEBI.

“SEBI is aware of the coronavirus and the possible impact that it can have on the market. We are taking necessary steps,” he said. on the sidelines of a capital market summit organised by industry body Assocham.

“We’ve seen the RBI statement. Whatever has to be done, has to be done. We are internally assessing the situation,” he added.

The SEBI statement comes a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said it was monitoring the financial markets closely on account of the virus scare.

Asked if the issue had been discussed at the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC), which has representations from all regulatory bodies, the SEBI member said, ‘not yet.’

The impact of COVID-19 in India has been visible in most segments of the markets, including equities, currency and bonds.

Incidentally, the last few trading sessions had seen the benchmark Sensex shedding more than 3,000 points while the rupee went past the 73-mark on Tuesday and bond yields dropped 11 bps on Wednesday.

Tax on REIT, InvITs

On a different note, the capital markets regulator has taken up with the government the issue of taxation with respect to dividends from real estate investment trusts (REITs) and infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs).

A Budget proposal has made dividends from such structures taxable, which, market participants believe, would be a huge dampener for the segment.

“...the taxation part is not in the hands of SEBI, but we have taken it up with the government, let’s hope for the best,” said Mr. Mohanty.

“If that (change or amendment) happens, if we stick to the taxation incentive to REITs and InvITs given in 2016, if that is restored, then definitely billions of dollars India would get and will help our economy in a great way,” he added.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/sebi-says-gauging-virus-impact/article30984179.ece
326,2020/03/04,Nod for changes to Companies Act for decriminalising offences,"Priority is to axe sections that criminalise offences having no malafide intent: FM

The Centre proposes to amend the Companies Act again, in a bid to decriminalise a number of offences and ease corporate social responsibility (CSR) requirements, especially for smaller companies.

The amendment bill will also enable the listing of Indian companies on stock exchanges in foreign jurisdictions. This is expected to give Indian firms greater access to capital, a broader investor base and better valuations.

On Wednesday, the Union Cabinet approved the proposal to amend 65 sections of the Act. “The priority is to remove sections which criminalise offences which may not have been intended to be malafide,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told journalists after a Cabinet meeting.

She outlined proposed changes to 52 out of 66 compoundable offences under the Act, either removing them entirely, downgrading penalties from jail sentences to fines or suggesting alternative adjudication mechanisms.

Recategorise offences

The Centre proposes to recategorise 23 offences so that they can be dealt with through an in-house adjudication framework, while five types of offences will be dealt with under different alternative frameworks.

Another seven will be omitted altogether. Most of these are procedural or technical defaults that lack the element of fraud or do not affect larger public interest, according to an official statement.

For 11 kinds of offences, the provision of imprisonment will be removed, limiting punishment to fines only. Six offences that had already been decriminalised earlier will see a further reduction in the quantum of penalties.

The proposed amendments will also ensure that companies which have an obligation to spend ₹50 lakh per annum or less on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) are no longer required to have a CSR committee. Companies that spend more than the mandatory 2% on CSR in a particular year can carry it forward as credit for fulfilment of CSR obligations for the next few years as well, she said.

The changes are “expected to significantly enhance the confidence of Indian corporates in the government’s resolve to provide greater ease [of doing business] and accord highest respect to honest wealth creators in the country and reduce the burden on the justice system,” said an official statement. The amendments are based on the recommendations of a high-level panel set up in September 2019. If passed by Parliament, these would be the second set of amendments to the Act over the last year, as the law was already amended last July. Ms. Sitharaman told journalists that further changes were not expected.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/3r89m0/article30984136.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THBUNIRMALASITHARAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/nod-for-changes-to-companies-act-for-decriminalising-offences/article30984139.ece

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said the exercise of consolidation of 10 public sector banks (PSBs) into four is on course and the merger will come into effect from April 1, 2020.

The Union Cabinet, she said, has given a go-ahead for the merger proposal and the government has been in regular touch with these banks.

There will be no regulatory issues, she said.

“The banks’ merger is on course and decisions have already been taken by the respective bank boards,” she told reporters here.

The mergers are aimed at creating global sized banks in India.

In the biggest consolidation exercise in the banking space, the government in August 2019 had announced four major mergers of public sector banks, bringing down their total number to 12 from 27 in 2017, a move aimed at making state-owned lenders global sized banks.

United Bank of India and Oriental Bank of Commerce will be merged with Punjab National Bank; Syndicate Bank will be merged with Canara Bank; Allahabad Bank will be amalgamated with Indian Bank; and Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank will be consolidated with Union Bank of India.

Claiming that the proposed amendments were aimed at improving the ease of doing business, Ms. Sitharaman explained: ""Out of 66 compoundable offences under the Act, 23 will get recategorised so that they can be dealt with through in-house adjudication framework, seven have been omitted altogether, 11 will have limited punishment in the form of fines alone by removing imprisonment provision, five will be dealt with under different alternative frameworks, six which had earlier been decriminalised will now have reduced quantum of penalties.""

The proposed amendments will ensure that companies which have an obligation to spend Rs. 50 lakh per annum or less on corporate social responsibity (CSR) are no longer required to have a CSR committee. Companies which spend over the obligated 2% on CSR in a particular year can carry it forward as credit for fulfilment of CSR obligations for the next few years as well.

In November, a government-appointed high level panel proposed decriminalising more than half of the existing compoundable offences under the companies law as well as lower monetary penalties for violations by startups, amid efforts to further improve the ease of doing business in the country.

331,2020/03/04,Govt to bring settlement scheme for LLPs,"The LLP settlement Scheme, 2020 -- that will come to force from March 16 to June 13 -- would permit a “one-time condonation of delay in filing statutorily required documents” with the Registrar of Companies.

The government will come out with a one-time settlement scheme for Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) that will provide more time to submit their pending documents as well as immunity from prosecution for defaults.

The LLP settlement Scheme, 2020 -- that will come to force from March 16 to June 13 -- would permit a “one-time condonation of delay in filing statutorily required documents” with the Registrar of Companies.

“LLPs, that wish to avail themselves of the scheme, may file the pending documents/ forms and make good the defaults, to gain immunity from prosecutions for such defaults,” the corporate affairs ministry said in a release on Wednesday.

LLPs are governed by the LLP Act, which is implemented by the ministry.

According to the release, it has been observed that due to applicability of additional fee on late filings, which in case of inordinate delay could actually become a financial burden, a large number of LLPs have remained non-compliant. This is mainly due to their inability to pay late fees for the cumulative period of delay.

There would be a one-time relaxation in additional fee for the defaulting LLPs to make good their default by filing pending documents.

The scheme would permit LLPs to submit their filings that were due till October 31, 2019. The LLP concerned has to pay a nominal additional fee of ₹10 per day for the period of delay as well as any fee that is to be paid for submitting a document. The additional fee per document would be capped at ₹5,000.

As per the release, the scheme would be applicable for submission for four types of forms -- 3, 4, 8 and 11 -- by the LLPs.

Form-3 pertains to information about LLP agreement and changes while Form-4 relates to notice of appointment, cessation, change in name/ address/ designation of a designated partner or partner.

Form-8 is for statement of account and solvency (annual or interim), and Form-11 pertains to annual return of an LLP.

“The scheme is being introduced in pursuance of the government’s objective of providing greater ease of living to the citizens of the country and is expected to provide a significant relief and a window of opportunity for LLPs to abide by the law and conduct business accordingly,” the release said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ldsowj/article29334704.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05NORTHBLOCK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/govt-to-bring-settlement-scheme-for-llps/article30980971.ece
332,2020/03/04,Sensex falls 2% intraday as virus cases increase,"About 1,800 stocks lose ground on BSE

Equities witnessed extreme volatility on Wednesday with the benchmark Sensex shedding more than 2% during intraday trading as the number of COVID-19 cases in India jumped to 28, leading to increased concerns that the economy might take a larger hit than previously expected.

The 30-share Sensex lost nearly 780 points during the afternoon session to touch a low of 37,846.10 before closing at 38,409.48, down 214.22 points, or 0.55%.

The broader Nifty settled the day at 11,251.00, shedding 52.30 points or 0.46%.

The market breadth was extremely weak with nearly 1,800 stocks losing ground on BSE, as against only 639 gainers.

Sharp decline

“The rise in coronavirus cases dented sentiment and triggered a sharp decline in the middle,” said Ajit Mishra, vice-president — Research, Religare Broking. “However, it rebounded in the latter half, considerably trimming losses,” he said.

“The recent surge in the coronavirus cases outside China has spooked the investors’ sentiment across the globe... the surprise rate cut by the U.S. Fed failed to cheer the participants and in fact, it has raised doubts about the health of the U.S. economy,” added Mr. Mishra.

Incidentally, the fall in the Indian indices came amidst a mostly positive trend in the Asian markets that rallied on the back of a surprise 50 basis points rate cut by U.S. Federal Reserve.

Top laggards in the Sensex pack included IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, ITC, UltraTech Cement and HDFC Bank, while Sun Pharma, Tech Mahindra, M&M and Asian Paints ended with gains.

Traders said the domestic market turned increasingly jittery as 28 coronavirus cases were confirmed in India. At the beginning of the session, only six cases were reported.

Global stocks, on the other hand, rallied after the US central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by a sizable half-percentage point in an effort to support the economy in the face of the spreading coronavirus.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted that the coronavirus “poses evolving risks to economic activity“.

The rate cut, however, failed to cheer Indian investors. There are still a lot of uncertainty on how the major economies will contain the spread of the virus, according to Ashika Institutional Equity Research.

“Thus, we remain skeptical that Fed rate cut will stabilise markets sentiments due to coronavirus outbreak,” it said.

335,2020/03/04,The demolition of reason,"What we see today is the adoption of various strategies of evasion, obfuscation, deflection, and denial

It was always an exaggeration to claim that man is a rational animal, distinguished from others by his capacity to take rational decisions. But it is no hyperbole to say that all humans can learn to reason with beneficial consequences. Reason has many functions — to help arrive at a common understanding and consensual decision; discern what is and is not relevant; express our deepest thoughts and lend them coherence; differentiate right from wrong, good from bad, the significant or the urgent from the trivial. We are not purely rational and indeed should never be so. But to not use reason when it is badly required is plainly foolish or outright devious.

Reason in its most debased form

Seen widely in our world and amplified in the electronic media, however, is the collapse of reason. Or rather, the deliberate, wicked surrender of virtually every form of reason and the adoption, instead, of various strategies of evasion, obfuscation, deflection, and denial. Conversations are stalled, discussions disrupted, facts manipulated and distorted. Reason now appears to serve, as never before, only self-interest and power. So, reason may not have disappeared completely, but it is certainly reduced to its most debased form — one that is cynical and instrumental.

When reason is so sullied, words become vacuous — mere sounds without meaning. Intellectual differences are reduced to a cockfight, mere shadow-boxing. Witnessing a group of British journalists picking holes in the argument of the far-right UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, exposing obvious inconsistencies and throwing widely known facts at him to show that he was a liar, the Turkish writer Ece Temelkuran likened this effort to playing chess with a pigeon who knocks over the pieces and shits on the chess board. Then, “the pigeon departs, proudly claiming victory, and leaving behind a mess for you to clean up”. How does one engage and find common ground with those who make disruption and ignorance their primary values and are guided by them? Ms. Temelkuran describes the impossibility of having a proper political discussion with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s supporters. Talking to them is “like making a milkshake without the lid on,” she says. Reason is utterly helpless when people choose to defy it.

Rounds of whataboutery

One of the most troubling features of current debates on television is that every substantive discussion of an important public issue is instantly replaced by an avoidable, unreasonable slanging match between the BJP and the Congress, as if all Indians are supporters of either the BJP or the Congress. More importantly, attention is diverted to real or imagined wrongs committed in the past by the Congress which helps evade fixing responsibility and accountability for wrongs committed in the present. For example, the recent horrific killings in Delhi cannot be discussed because “how dare those responsible for the 1984 pogrom against the Sikhs bring up Delhi 2020”? Likewise, a complaint about the muzzling of the press or about the fear experienced by ordinary citizens to speak out against the current regime simply has be upstaged by a passionate denunciation of Indira Gandhi’s Emergency. But why does the failure of one party to give us some good (say, freedom) erase the failure of another party to do the same? Why can’t people complain against both?

Consider this: forty years ago, a man was caught stealing red-handed and punished. Today he himself is robbed and goes to the police to report the crime. But the police asks, “Aren’t you the same man who committed a theft in 1980? You have no right to lodge a complaint”. This is absurd. Does a man forfeit his right to complain or protest merely because he once committed a wrong? What kind of an argument is this? Admittedly, some arguments have relevance and validity in the immediate aftermath of a crime. But they lose force as time passes and circumstances change. It might be valid to speak in the 1940s of the responsibility of Nazi Germany for the mayhem it caused by starting the Second World War but farcical to keep carping about it in the 21st century. The crime has long been acknowledged, punishment has been meted out, and Germans, even those who had morally disassociated from it much earlier, have apologised in word and deed. They have even institutionalised the remembrance of wrongdoing in memorials. This renders redundant any further reprimand of the Germans. What use is bringing it up now especially by those who are destroying liberty today?

The Emergency was a horrific event, a permanent blot on Indian democracy and we must remember it continuously to ensure that it does not recur. But it would be ludicrous to ask the Congress, the leading Opposition party, to shut up if it protested against the imposition of Emergency-like measures and crazy to order ordinary citizens, who first suffered in the 1970s and might suffer again, to stop being “selective” when protesting against an assault on free speech, the suspension of habeas corpus or the mauling of an independent judiciary. To compel anyone to speak about every single past violation of rights in the same breath as current violations is a devious way to bully everyone into silence.

Let us return to the present. We know that a slogan raised by some BJP leaders was an unambiguous incitement to violence. They were caught on video, reported to the Election Commission, and suspended from campaigning. This is an incontrovertible fact. Soon enough, horrific violence engulfed the national capital where the slogan was first raised. When a public interest litigation was brought to the court pleading that an FIR be registered about the culprits, their defence pleaded that unless all such hate speeches are examined, nothing should happen. As if this was not perplexing enough, another ridiculous feature entered the discourse. The speech of a Congress leader, which was not found to be inflammatory earlier, was pushed into the media and played out as a war cry by those who know its legal insignificance. Why then did they do so? To confuse and mislead people and to vitiate discourse. Is it not excellent ammunition for a new round of whataboutery?

Evaluating political actions

Recently I got talking with a taxi driver about the National Register of Citizens in Assam. I said that I was sorry to hear about the fate of the officer in charge of the survey, whose professional integrity was redoubtable earlier but who now has five FIRs registered against him. His crime? He had discovered large numbers of Hindus without documents to prove their citizenship, now declared to be illegal immigrants. Unfazed, he said: “But Sir, such a man would have been shot dead in Pakistan”, implying that India is tolerant compared with Pakistan. After all, India only paralyses people with false cases, whereas in Pakistan, the same conduct is rewarded with death penalty! This is whataboutery gone mad! Political actions in India today are evaluated by two standards. First, the worst practices of the Congress and second, the repressive acts, real or imaginary, of a rogue state across the border. The political class and all those mesmerised by it have simply sidestepped constitutional principles and political morality.

336,2020/03/04,Tapping the LIC source,"The government should ensure that a fair return is realised from the proposed partial disinvestment

More than 64 years after former Finance Minister C.D. Deshmukh called for the nationalisation of insurance, the government is considering partial disinvestment of its holding in the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). It plans to accomplish this in the second quarter of 2020-21. This begs the question: why now?

The simple answer is, the partial disinvestment of LIC is a source of income to the public exchequer to make up for the loss in tax revenue over successive cycles of corporate tax cuts, most of which were aimed at spurring domestic industrial development.



Watch | LIC through the years

Two groups of policies

The policies of LIC can be divided broadly into two groups: participating and non-participating. Participating policies are eligible for not less than 95% of the profits (surplus) emerging each year. Bonus is declared from this profit. Non-participating policies are not eligible for this bonus. As compensation, the premium rates under these policies are significantly lower. If Section 28 of the LIC Act, 1956, which prescribes the share of profits to participating policyholders, is not amended to reduce this share, then there will likely be no issues in carrying out disinvestment. However, if the government tries to reduce the percentage of profit going to participating policyholders, there could be a host of problems.

Since rights of existing policyholders cannot be taken away, this amendment can be made applicable only to policies issued in future and not to existing policies. This can create administrative problems. Two books of accounts must be maintained in each branch office: one with respect to old policies and another with respect to new policies. The bifurcation of administrative expenses between the two groups may also be a major problem. We can therefore assume that no change will be made to Section 28 of the LIC Act.

The value of a life insurance company is assessed by finding the present value of future profits generated by the current business, the probable flow of new business in the future, and the present value of profits from this new business. This is a complex and time-consuming process. There is another method known as the Dividend Discount Model. This method is generally applicable only in the case of companies that pay regular dividends. The LIC has a long and uninterrupted history of dividend payments from inception.

Under this method, if it is assumed that if the dividend increases by 3% each year, the present value of future dividends will be ₹300,000 crore (₹3 trillion). If the rate of increase of dividends is 4% or more, then the present value of future dividends will be very high and, theoretically, be equal to infinity. The average annual rate of increase of dividend over the last 30 years is 14.32%, so one can imagine what would be the present value of future dividends.

Many products

The Corporation has a wide range of products. Its agents are reluctant to sell the high profit margin unit linked products since these do not guarantee maturity value. Its portfolio of Group, Pension and Annuity products, which have very low profit margin, is quite substantial. Shareholder’s share of profits is only 5%. It is not even 50% of the share of profits of shareholders of private insurers. Still, its dividend to shareholders is substantial. LIC is also introducing unit linked products, which generally have good profit margins. So, its dividends may go up even further. It is my considered view that its value today will be anywhere between ₹3 trillion and ₹5 trillion.

Its overall cost ratio compares favourably to that of any private insurer. With a capital of just ₹100 crore, it is managing a life fund of about ₹30 trillion and has built up, in the policyholders’ account, a solvency reserve of ₹1.5 trillion. Its million-strong dedicated agency force can be the envy of any insurer. About 96% of LIC’s new business comes from this group. On every count, it is a dream organisation. The government should ensure that a fair return is realised from the proposed partial disinvestment.

One in three women faces intimate partner violence, according to the World Health Organization. Each successive government has tried to put in place legal and judicial recourses for these women, but has left children unprotected and exposed. Witnessing such widespread violence at home affects children seriously. First, there are recorded physiological effects of trauma on the brain. CT scans show that children who have been exposed to trauma develop smaller corpus callosum and smaller hippocampus regions, which means that their learning, cognitive abilities and emotional regulation are affected. Second, inter-generational transmission of violence is a disturbing consequence of violence in families. Dr. Byron Egeland, a widely published researcher in the areas of child maltreatment and developmental psychopathology, showed a history of abuse to be a major risk factor for abusing the next generation. Researchers have estimated an average inter-generational transmission rate of 40%. This means that for every 100 persons who were abused as children, 40 transmit this violence to the next generation.

Rakesh’s own history shows that he was a victim of violence. Rakesh had been a witness to violence between his parents at home every day until he turned 20. He saw his mother being slapped, and learnt to create cover-up stories for the frequent injuries that appeared on his and his mother’s bodies. By the time he was five, he had learnt that violence was an acceptable means to deal with conflict, and that it was important for the man to dominate through power-assertive violence. To cope with the trauma at home, he had also learnt to quickly suppress his childhood fear and deep insecurity. How else could he deal with the complexity of it? The trauma left physical effects on his brain, leading to poor emotional regulation.

According to Dr. John Bowlby, a renowned psychiatrist known for his pioneering work in developing attachment theory, the “internal working model” of a child is developed based on familial patterns of showing love and resolving conflicts. Rakesh’s internal working model had been developed based on behaviours between his caregivers in the first two years of his life. How can we teach our children other ways of healthy relationships between partners if this is all they have witnessed all their lives?

It is important to note that not all victims of domestic violence become aggressors. We must not victimise young survivors of violence. Declaring that some of these victimised children will end up being violent themselves can, in fact, make it a self-fulfilling prophecy. Yet, it is crucial in a country that faces a massive crisis of violence against women to understand that a history of abuse is often a risk factor that points to a likelihood of perpetrating inter-generational abuse.

Dealing with childhood trauma

India puts in place reactive policies every time a new case of violence comes to the fore. The country’s domestic violence policies have ranged from declaring certain offences against women as criminal offences, to setting up all-women police stations, to capital punishment for fatal rape cases. These policies have ignored the effect of trauma on children and the concept of inter-generational transmission of violence.

As a 2016 report by the U.S. Children’s Bureau explains, “violence and abuse produce trauma symptoms which when left unresolved, increase the likelihood that the individual will engage in violent behaviour as an adult.” We need to provide spaces for children to resolve these symptoms of childhood trauma.

India has become serious about mental health beginning with the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, but it needs to do more. Policymakers need to link the provision of professional mental health services to families recovering from domestic violence. A prospective policy, working with families to actively provide trauma-informed mental health care, needs to be in place.

But for this to happen, India needs more mental health practitioners. It needs accredited systems to train and track the quality of mental health trauma-care providers. Connecting such a network to peer-supportive groups can help survivors integrate their experiences into their lives and finally heal.

338,2020/03/04,Flow and ebb: On India’s tour of New Zealand,"India had a rude jolt in New Zealand after doing well in the shortest format of cricket

India’s recent cricket tour of New Zealand has been a tale of the spectacular rise followed by a debilitating fall. A 5-0 sweep in the Twenty20 series was seen as the perfect launch pad for Virat Kohli’s men to extend their supremacy in the subsequent One Day Internationals and Tests. But New Zealand at home, has always been an indomitable opposition. Just as Clive Lloyd’s marauding West Indians struggled in the early 1980s, it was India’s turn to eat humble pie. The ODIs were lost at 0-3 and in the following two Tests, New Zealand prevailed by 10 wickets and seven wickets at Wellington’s Basin Reserve and Christchurch’s Hagley Oval, respectively. The last mentioned game finished on Monday with two days to spare and the world’s number one ranked squad looked bereft of ideas. Indian batsmen floundered against nagging swing bowling, an old nemesis, while its speedsters led by Jasprit Bumrah emerged second-best to the host’s attack. Kane Williamson’s men, tough in their sport but quick to smile, proved that their 2019 World Cup semifinal victory over the Men in Blue at Manchester’s Old Trafford, wasn’t an exception. India’s woes tied up with history too as since its maiden tour of New Zealand during the 1967-68 season, it has won just two Test series while losing six and drawing level in the remaining two jousts.

India missed an injured Rohit Sharma atop the batting tree and its latest opening pair of Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw put on minuscule alliances of 16, 27, 30 and eight. The middle-order was exposed early to seamers Tim Southee, Trent Boult and Kyle Jamieson, who between them bagged 34 wickets to snuff out any latent resistance within the Indian ranks. Kohli suffered the batting horrors, with a mere 38 at an average of 9.50. Obviously an aberration in his otherwise exemplary record, but the skipper’s poor form affected the team. Meanwhile, Bumrah and company, without enough runs on the board backing them, could not exert pressure and their bowling wasn’t as effective as it was in the past. The latest slump in New Zealand did not reverse India’s supremacy in the World Test Championship table where Kohli’s unit still stays on top with 360 points, ahead of second-placed Australia (296 points). However, New Zealand leapfrogged from the sixth slot to third and is sitting well with 180 points. India has batsmen aplenty, who can hasten its scoring rate, but it also needs willow wielders capable of batting for time in Tests, a spirit that Rahul Dravid encapsulated and one that is evident in Cheteshwar Pujara too. It needs some more of this ilk, who prefer patience against good old swing bowling in cold climes.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/flow-and-ebb-the-hindu-editorial-on-indias-tour-of-new-zealand/article30975733.ece
339,2020/03/04,Growing numbers: On India’s COVID-19 preparedness,"India cannot be complacent while dealing with the possible spread of COVID-19

On Monday and Tuesday, India reported three more coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases — one each from Delhi, Hyderabad and Jaipur (an Italian tourist) — bringing the total number to six. While the first three cases, reported from Kerala, were in young adults who had arrived directly from China, the two new cases were Indians who had arrived from Italy and Dubai. Italy and the UAE have reported local transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), thus marking all the five as imported cases. Detection of the three cases is no surprise considering that hundreds of passengers have arrived in India from China and other countries where local transmission of the virus has been going on for the last couple of weeks. On Tuesday, the Health Ministry said that six people in Agra who had come in contact with the COVID-19 index case in Delhi have been “detected with high viral load” and kept in isolation. Their samples have been sent to the Pune-based National Institute of Virology for confirmation. If even one of the six is confirmed to be positive, it would indicate local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and will automatically change the status of virus spread in the country. The silver lining is that it highlights the ability of the system to trace and test people who have come in contact with the index case. Community transmission should not come as a surprise in light of the fact that the six confirmed cases had come in contact with many people before their infection status was confirmed.

Also read | Two schools shut in Noida, families quarantined; visa suspension extended to 4 countries

The Health Ministry’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) network is in hot pursuit to trace people who have come in contact with the six people whose samples have been sent for confirmation. Already, about 26,000 arriving passengers have been put under community surveillance of the IDSP network. Care should be taken to ensure that people under community surveillance do not flee, as was the case in Kerala when two adults under observation for coronavirus left the country unnoticed. While thermal screening at airports and seaports does help in detecting people with a fever so that further screening and testing can be performed to ascertain the infection status, it is essential that people who have arrived in the country seek immediate medical care and testing when symptoms show up days after landing. The median incubation period after infection is three days; the incubation period can also last more than three weeks as per one study. Infected people do not show symptoms during the incubation period and hence thermal screening at airports and seaports will be unable to detect such cases. It is therefore heartening that universal screening of passengers arriving from 12 countries is being undertaken. It is also important that people and health-care providers are made aware that molecular testing does not have very high sensitivity and hence may turn up false negatives. It is hence essential that at least two negative tests are obtained before a person is certified as being uninfected.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/growing-numbers-the-hindu-editorial-on-indias-covid-19-preparedness/article30975709.ece

“We arrested Giri for gambling, but handed over him to the custody of the Byappanahalli police as there is a non-bailable warrant against him in a robbery case,” said a police officer.

The raid was conducted around 8.30 p.m. after the CCB received information that non-members were gambling and betting on the premises.

342,2020/03/04,NHAI tells High Court Nellyadi-Mudigere highway project has been kept in abeyance,"The Karnataka High Court on Tuesday said there was no need to entertain a PIL petition against greenfield highway stretch between Nellyadi and Mudigere Handpost as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) told the court that the detailed project report for this stretch of the highway widening and development project was kept in abeyance in March 2019.

The NHAI has submitted to the court a communication, dated March 13, 2019, in which it had decided to keep in abeyance the detailed project report on the proposal to widen the Nellyadi and Mudigere Handpost stretch, which is one of the four stretches of NH-173 connecting Chitradurga and Mangaluru taken up for development in four packages under the greenfield highway project.

It was noted in the NHAI’s communication that the proposed stretch between Nellyadi and Mudigere Handpost passes through 25 km of virgin ghat section, and representatives of wildlife board had raised the issue of the road alignment intersecting elephant corridors.

The NHAI, while taking note of objections and concerns expressed during public consultation held in Mudigere by NGOs and environmentalists on projects impacting biodiversity, had decided to review this stretch after completion of priority stretches. The NHAI has also stated in its statement that only 7.95 hectares of forest diversion was proposed for this stretch while denying the allegation made in the petition that diversion of more than 60 hectares of forest was sought for.

In his petition filed in November 2019, Vinay Madhav, a native of Makonahalli in Mudigere taluk, claimed that the construction of highway in Nellyadi-Mudigere Handpost was planned without obtaining clearances under the Forest (Conservation) Act. And the Court has passed an interim order asking the NHAI not to commence actual construction without the prior permission of the court.

While declining to entertain the petition as the DPR of this stretch was kept in abeyance, a Division Bench disposed of the petition while asking the NHAI to send a communication to the petitioner if it continued the project while reserving liberty to the petitioner to approach the court again.

Meanwhile, the Bench decided to continue another PIL petition, in which certain challenges were made to the remaining three packages of development of NH-173 while ordering issue of notice to the NHAI.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/6cieek/article30978455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/nhai-tells-high-court-nellyadi-mudigere-highway-project-has-been-kept-in-abeyance/article30978456.ece

344,2020/03/04,Chennai Metro Rail spares Good Shepherd School’s playground for children,"For phase II project, Chennai Metro Rail wanted to take over a substantial piece of land in Good Shepherd School to build the Sterling Road station.

Much to the relief of hundreds of children, Chennai Metro Rail has decided to spare the playground of Good Shepherd School in Nungambakkam, that they had earlier planned to acquire for building a station.

For phase II project, Chennai Metro Rail wanted to take over a substantial piece of land in Good Shepherd School to build the Sterling Road station. This station to be built as an undeground one will be a part of the stretch from Madhavaram to SIPCOT. After making some changes in the design, Chennai Metro Rail decided to leave the playground and acquire an adjacent building, that houses elementary classes.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), they have acquired 17,495 sq.ft of land from the school and paid them an amount, which they refused to disclose. “We will not touch the playground. Instead, we have acquired a building where elementary classes are run. Now, with the money we have paid, the school will construct another building inside their premises to have the elementary classes and have been given one year’s time for it. Once they shift, we will demolish this existing building and begin our construction later,” an official said.

Recently, CMRL officials said, they formed a private negotiation committee for handling land acquistions for the phase II project.

In total, Chennai Metro Rail will need 117.12 hectares to build the phase II project that aims to cover 118.9 km of the city touching north and southern parts of the city with 128 stations at various locations. They have already sent out notices to various land owners in the past year to begin construction sometime this year.

The seven-day strike of the packaged drinking water units was withdrawn on Wednesday.

“We decided to withdraw the strike after the court order. There is already a pending case pertaining to the issue and we plan to face the issue legally,” said A. Shakespeare, founder, Greater Tamil Nadu Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers Association.

Nearly 552 manufacturing units have been closed across the State for operating without a No Objection Certificate from Water Resources Department over the past few days.

Of these, nearly 103 units were in areas such as Avadi and Poonamallee in Tiruvallur district, catering to the city’s drinking water needs. People in the city and other districts have already been put to much hardship owing to the strike. The situation is set to normalise by Thursday, as most striking units have resumed operations.

The 20-litre bubble tops, which are largely used by domestic and commercial sectors, are expected to reach retailers by Thursday morning. The sealed units have been allowed to renew their licences or file fresh applications for NOC and the government has been directed to process these within 15 days as per the court directive, he said. “We need to check how many units would be allowed to renew their licences and resume operations,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cnesuq/article30981346.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MARTH--WATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/packaged-drinking-water-units-withdraw-strike/article30981347.ece

With June the deadline for beginning services, Chennai Metro Rail has now finished laying tracks in the phase I extension project that links Washermanpet to Wimco Nagar, covering a distance of 9 km.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), the work that began more than a year ago was completed only a few weeks ago. “We are particular about opening this stretch to the public in June; so, we are trying to finish one job after another so that we can meet the deadline. There were a lot of challenges working in this 9 km-stretch but we have been able to manage everything so far. Now that the track work is over, the trial run with a locomotive can be done,” an official said.

The trial is likely to happen this month with the locomotive and soon after that, the train will be run through to check for any possible glitches that arise. “These trial runs will go on till the operations start in June and we will conduct various tests to see that there is no problem before passengers travel through this stretch,” another official said.

Meanwhile, CMRL has been building the stations along this stretch. A feel weeks ago, they had terminated a contract with ITNL that was to build two stations owing to slow progress of work and currently, two different contractors are completing this work. “We are in the process of installing different systems like signalling and telecommunication; soon, installation of lifts will also start in stations,” he added.

The phase I extension project constructed at an estimated cost of ₹3,770 crore with nine stations, is built as a combination of elevated and underground stretches. The areas where CMRL will build stations include Washermanpet, Sir Theagaraya College, Korukkupet, Tondiarpet, Toll Gate, Thangal, Gowri Ashram, Tiruvottiyur and Wimco Nagar. From Washermanpet till Korukkupet, CMRL is building an underground stretch and from there on, it becomes an elevated stretch upto Wimco Nagar.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/gxhu7p/article25894771.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02JanDSJ04-ChenGC557B44B3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-metro-completes-track-laying-work-for-phase-i-extension-project/article30980847.ece
347,2020/03/04,"This summer, you can go kayaking at Chennai’s Chetpet Eco Park","Stand-up paddling and kayaking will soon be introduced at the lake in the park

Thanks to the lake at the Chetpet Eco Park having over seven feet of water, visitors to the park will soon be able to enjoy some new fun activities, including kayaking and stand-up paddling.

The Tamil Nadu Fisheries Department Corporation (TNFDC) will shortly introduce these sports in the lake, which is spread over nine acres and has two islands.

Stand-up paddling will be an activity where one person can stand on a large surf board and paddle on the water. The activity is getting quite popular in Europe. Users will have to wear life jackets, and a life guard will be available at all times in the area. Kayaking on the calm waters will be done with open kayaks.

TNFDC managing Director G. S. Sameeran said that the lake has enough water as a result of the desilting and deepening done last year. “We were able to save rainwater during the last monsoon. We are planning to introduce these activities this month and hope city residents will have more fun this summer. The modalities, including timings and charges, are being worked out.”

These activities are to be implemented through a revenue-sharing model with Kovalam-based Surf Turf that will manage the activities, invest in equipment and maintain them. The Corporation, which manages the Eco Park, has allowed Surf Turf to use the lake. They will share certain a percentage of revenue generated.

“These sports can be used both as exercise and as leisure activities. It depends on how much you want to push yourself. The timings would be from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. and then again from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. We are quite excited about the tie up and expect a lot of beginners to come and try their hand,” said Arun Vasu, CMD TT Group and mentor at Surf Turf.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/x5okwe/article30980249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MARTH-Chetpetjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/this-summer-you-can-go-kayaking-at-chennais-chetpet-eco-park/article30980251.ece
348,2020/03/04,Institute of Mental Health in Chennai screens its women patients for cervical cancer,"The screening programme, on Wednesday and Thursday, will check over 300 women patients

The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is celebrating International Women’s Day, which falls on March 8, by focusing on the health of its women patients. The institute is now screening nearly 320 women patients on its campus for cervical cancer.

IMH, along with Government Kasturba Gandhi Hospital (KGH) for Women and Children, has undertaken the screening initiative for its women patients on Wednesday and Thursday. “This is the first time we are screening our women patients for cervical cancer on the campus. We usually refer them to the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology for any gynaecological problems they may have. It is important for us to ensure that they are healthy, and so, we have arranged for cervical screening in line with the International Women’s Day,” P. Poorna Chandrika, director of IMH, said.

The majority of the women patients are aged 30 years and above. Dr. Chandreika added that authorities of KGH readily agreed to screen the women patients.

T. Srikala Prasad, head of department, urogynaecology, KGH, said, “Cervical cancer screening is important for every woman, but all the more important for these patients. This is because many of them may not know how to tell the staff if they have had a white discharge. These patients may not have had an examination of the cervix and so, IMH planned for such a screening.”

For the screening, KGH moved some of its couches to IMH and has set up a room to create a proper screening environment for the women. Dr. Srikala said that screening would involve visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid (VIA), while IMH has procured an instrument for providing magnified vision. Retired doctor, Ramani Rajendran, who is an authority on colposcopy, was also involved in the screening initiative, she added.

Doctors would also screen the women for breast cancer during these two days.

The level of comprehension of the patients and to what extent they cooperate is important. “We will screen the patients for two days depending on their level of comprehension. We will continue if more patients come in,” she added.

K.L. Malarvizhi, director of KGH, was present at the screening camp. Dr. Poorna Chandrika, hoped that this would be conducted every year, and in future, to also bring in mammography for the patients.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/institute-of-mental-health-in-chenani-screens-its-women-patients-for-cervical-cancer/article30979864.ece

The police have identified the registration number of the bike that was used by two youngsters to hurl bombs at a car near Kamarajar Arangam on arterial Anna Salai on Tuesday evening.

Though the bombs did not damage the vehicle, the explosion caused some damage to the frontage of shops in the area.

In the CCTV footage, two persons, suspected to be minors, were seen riding a bike that came down from Anna flyover towards Teynampet.

The pillion rider threw an explosive device at a moving car coming in the opposite direction. It landed on the road and instantly thick smoke emerged at the site of the explosion. He hurled another ‘bomb’, but it just grazed the car. The vehicle stopped for a few seconds and sped away, turning towards Mayor Sundar Rao Road.

Using CCTV footage, the police obtained the registration number of the bike; however, it was found to be fake.

“Special teams rushed to a house in T. Nagar and then to other neighbouring districts hunting for the owner. But we could not trace them. We will zero in on them by Wednesday afternoon,” said a senior police officer.

The Madras High Court on Tuesday expressed surprise over the State government not collecting any money from drinking water packaging units for the groundwater drawn by them and suggested that the authorities concerned should give serious thought to levying appropriate charges, depending upon the quantity drawn.

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar were taken aback when Advocate General Vijay Narayan informed them that groundwater was allowed to be extracted for free. When the drinking water packaging units were being run for commercial gains, why should the State provide water free of charge to such units, the judges wondered.

The senior judge on the Bench said that the government did not let any mineral be exploited by private parties without payment of charges to the exchequer. Since everything under the ground belonged to the State, officials should not allow extraction of groundwater without claiming compensation, he added.

He also said that the requirement of installing water meters at groundwater extraction sites would make sense only if the government used the readings to levy appropriate charges and not just to keep a tab on the quantity of water extracted, depending upon the classification of areas into critical, semi-critical and so on.

The observations were made during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition in which the court ordered closure of all unauthorised drinking water packaging units across the State. Appearing on behalf of some of the closed units, senior counsel G. Masilamani and P.S. Raman said that the people were the ultimate sufferers due to the abrupt closure of units.

Impressing upon the need for government authorities to take a quick decision on pending applications for renewal of licences and issuance of no objection certificates (NOC), the senior counsel said that the State was unable to provide potable drinking water to all and hence that void was being filled by private drinking water packaging units.

Earlier, Special Government Pleader J. Pothiraj filed a compliance report stating that out of 261 recognised units in the State, 116 had applied for renewal of licence and NOCs for 132 had been cancelled for various violations. The remaining 13 units were closed down. Even among the 132 units whose NOCs had been cancelled, the extraction points of 124 units had been sealed. Apart from these 261 units, government officials had identified 552 illegal units and sealed all of them, the report read.

On his part, advocate N. Ramesh, representing Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CWSSB), told the court that enactment of a new Groundwater (Development and Management) Act was under the government’s consideration. Till then, CMWSSB had decided not to issue any new NOC or licence for extraction of groundwater for commercial purposes in Chennai. The board would, however, continue to issue transport permits for water extracted from the outskirts after obtaining due licence from the Revenue Divisional Officers concerned, to be transported to the packaging units situated in the city, he said.

After hearing all of them, the Division Bench said that it would pass a comprehensive interim order in the case on Wednesday and keep the PIL petition pending for continuous monitoring.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/clzs3c/article30976749.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THWATERCANSTRIKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/high-court-against-giving-groundwater-for-free-to-bottling-units/article30976750.ece
351,2020/03/04,Water units to decide on continuing strike today,"Packaged water units have remained closed for almost a week now, sparking off a shortage of drinking water in the city.

Members of the Greater Tamil Nadu Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers’ Association plan to take a decision on continuing the indefinite strike on Wednesday.

With the closure of 103 manufacturing units in Tiruvallur district till Monday, the supply dropped to 15-20% of the usual in the city on Tuesday, said Association members. About 1,600 units across the State have downed shutters in protest against the sealing of units that operated without no objection certificate from the PWD following a court directive.

A. Shakespeare, founder of the association, said that the State government must consider relaxing norms for manufacturing units that have been operating from before 2014, when the government order was passed on groundwater extraction. Such units could be allowed to function with restrictions. “We have already obtained licence from different government bodies to operate the units,"" he said.

Moreover, the government must relax the norms pertaining to sinking of borewells for units functioning prior to 2014. The interval of 150m between borewells would not have been followed by those who dug borewells near units. ""We are incurring a loss. The membranes used for reverse osmosis will be damaged when not used and we need to spend ₹5 lakh to repair them,"" he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/water-units-to-decide-on-continuing-strike-today/article30976711.ece

353,2020/03/04,Tamil Nadu government staff yet to get their salary,"Software glitch remains unresolved

With the glitch in the implementation of the Integrated Financial Management and Human Resource Management System (IFHRMS) yet to be resolved, several State government employees and teachers of State-run schools are yet to receive their salary for February. It looks like they would have to wait for a few more days.

Notwithstanding the technical experts from a private major camping at the Secretariat for the past few days, the issues are yet to be sorted out.

Staffs from the Office Proceedings (OP) section of every Department are coordinating with the technical staff to resolve the glitch. The Public Department is one of the largest departments at the Secretariat.

“When the software is not ready, why did the government take up this misadventure? The government is still insisting that the pay bills be cleared only through IFHRMS and not through web pay roll software of the NIC like before. Wonder why the government is adamant,” a government employee asked.

Another employee pointed to the EMIs to be paid and education loans taken for children’s studies.

“We have been planning everything around the salary and the government has not been planning. If the government was serious about this IFHRMS software, they should have planned well in advance. The government should take responsibility for this,” a teacher said.

‘No Infrastructure’

He pointed out that the infrastructure available was not sufficient to implement the IFHRMS. “Some units in rural areas still do not have computers, but they have been advised to go to internet cafes. There should be a minimum internet speed. Ignoring all that, the government has gone ahead with it.”

Another official claimed that the contract workers from the private company are not trained properly to resolve the issue.

Data safety

Also, what about the safety of the data? The government has handed over data of the entire establishment to a private player on a platter.”

When contacted, Tamil Nadu Secretariat Association (TANSA) president S. Peter Antonysamy said the association was taking steps to help resolve the issue.

“We have been helping to resolve the issue. Officials should have been initially given to staff over IFHRMS. I hope the issue would be resolved in the next few days,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tamil-nadu-government-staff-yet-to-get-their-salary/article30976611.ece
354,2020/03/04,Bikers hurl country bombs at moving car on Anna Salai in Chennai,"‘Target’ speeds away, minor damage to shops and offices in the vicinity

Just after 4 p.m. on March 3, there was a buzz in the city, with many anxious residents glued to television channels running ‘breaking news’ tickers on ‘explosions’ in the city.

Very soon the tickers got modified to ‘bomb blasts’. It was only an hour later that the first facts of the case emerged: two youth had hurled bombs (initially described as country bombs) on a car near Kamarajar Arangam; both bombs did not damage the vehicle, but on impact, caused minor damage to the frontage of shops in the area.

The windshield of a car (not the target) was shattered and people who were inside showrooms and office buildings came rushing out, even as police personnel from the police station nearby reached the spot.

Two persons, suspected to be minors, were seen in CCTV camera footage riding a bike that came down from Anna flyover towards Teynampet.

The pillion rider rose from his seat and threw an explosive device at a moving car on the opposite side of road. It landed on the road and instantly thick smoke emerged at the site of the explosion. Yet again, he hurled another device, but this time it glanced off the SUV — a Fortuner. The vehicle stopped for a few seconds and sped away, taking Mayor Sundar Rao Road, a one-way stretch. The SUV is said to belong to an AIADMK functionary.

Gaffar Khan, owner of a car showroom, said: “Suddenly, we heard a loud bang. It was not like a regular cracker or transformer. We felt a strong tremor too. Everybody ran out of the showroom and we found the front glass broken.”

Police sources said the bikers were not wearing helmets. The pillion rider threw the first bomb, suspected to be a country bomb. The target was a Fortuner moving on the opposite side. The first device landed on the road. The second bomb hit the vehicle. The vehicle stopped for a few seconds and then sped away.

Commissioner of Police A.K.Viswanathan reached the spot and held a preliminary enquiry with police officers who were present.

“The initial investigation revealed that a Fortuner vehicle was targeted by people on a two-wheeler. Investigation is in progress. We will solve the case very soon,” he said.

Experts from the Forensic Sciences Department collected samples from the spot. Teynampet police began the investigation after scrutiny of CCTV camera footage.

Another explosive device is hurled at the moving car. The car is hit and stops briefly before driving off. Police rush to the spot. Illustration: R. Rajesh

356,2020/03/04,‘Govt. mulls banning plastics for pre-packed goods too’,"AAG says 52 industries were closed down last year for manufacturing banned plastics

The State government on Tuesday told the Madras High Court that it was considering a proposal received by the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) on January 28 for lifting the exemption granted to pre-packed goods such as oil, milk, biscuits, chocolates, snacks and groceries from the ban on single-use plastic products, in effect since Jan. 1, 2019.

Justices S. Vaidyanathan and P.T. Asha were told by Additional Advocate General P.H. Arvindh Pandian that the proposal was under the active consideration of the State government and that an appropriate decision would be taken at the earliest in consonance with an announcement made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15 to phase out single use plastic products from the country by 2022.

The AAG also said the TNPCB was effectively enforcing the ban on single use plastic goods, such as carry bags, water pouches, straws, sheets used for wrapping food, plastic coated paper cups and plastic flags since January 1 last year.

Illegal manufacture

He said 52 industries involved in illegal manufacture of the banned plastic items were closed down last year after snapping their power supply.

He filed a status report by Environment Secretary Shambu Kallolikar: “The District Industries Centre and Greater Chennai Corporation have been requested to provide a list of tiny and small scale plastic manufacturing industries and on verification of units which are still in illegal operation, action will be initiated to close them down through the TNPCB.”

Surprise inspections

It added that TNPCB had formed teams to conduct surprise inspections.

“Surprise inspection was carried out by nine teams of TNPCB in Chennai district across 444 Starbucks, KFC, McDonalds outlets and other hotels and restaurants. Show cause notices were issued to 42 outlets/hotels for using banned single use plastic,” the report said.

Further, TNPCB had written to the Home as well as Commercial Taxes department to ensure strict vigil at the check posts located at the borders of the State.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/govt-mulls-banning-plastics-for-pre-packed-goods-too/article30976520.ece
357,2020/03/04,HC directs all HR&CE dept. staff to take the ‘Hindu pledge’,"Judges make it clear that no one can be exempted, including the Commissioner

The Madras High Court on Tuesday ruled that all those serving in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department, right from its Commissioner to the lowest grade employee, must take a pledge that they were Hindus by birth and that they continued to profess the religion even now.

Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy rejected the contention of the State government that officers in the rank of Commissioner, Additional Commissioner, Joint Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner need not take such a pledge and that it was meant only for employees below these officials.

Top brass not excluded

Referring to Section 10 of the HR&CE Act read with Rule 2 of the Manner of Proof of Professing Hindu Religion Rules of 1961, the judge said, the rule begins with the words, “Every person appointed or deemed to be appointed...” and hence it was clear that Commissioner and other top officials could not be excluded from its ambit.

The rules do not make any distinction or differentiation on the basis of hierarchy of officials. “What is applicable to lower grade officials should be applicable to those in higher cadre also. After all, both are involved in the same process. In fact, this should be applied with more rigour to persons working in higher capacity,” the Bench said.

The judgment was passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by advocate S. Sridharan of Chennai with a plea to remove from service the incumbent HR & CE Commissioner and all other officials who had not taken the mandatory pledge to assert that they were Hindus by birth and they continue to profess the religion.

Objecting to the prayer sought for by the petitioner, a government advocate told the court that even if the court comes to a conclusion that such a pledge must be taken by the Commissioner and other top officials, it could direct them to take it even now, instead of ordering their removal as prayed for by the litigant.

Directive to govt.

Accepting the submission, the Bench directed all officials of HR & CE department across the State to take the pledge afresh, even if they had already taken it, as per the rules in force, within eight weeks.

The judge directed the government as well as the HR & CE Commissioner to ensure that the court orders were complied with promptly.

In his affidavit, the petitioner pointed out that Section 10 of the HR&CE Act of 1959 states that the Commissioner, Additional Commissioner, Joint, Deputy or Assistant Commissioner and every other officer or servant appointed to carry out the purposes of the Act should be a person professing Hinduism and they shall cease to hold office when they cease to profess that religion.

Further, a Government Order issued on September 23, 1961, brought into force the Manner of Proof of Professing Hindu Religion Rules and as per those rules, every person appointed under the Act must take a pledge before the presiding deity in the nearest Hindu religious institution and in presence of the chairman of the board of trustees of that institution.

Written pledge

Two witnesses should be present at the time of taking the pledge and it should be reduced in writing.

The written pledge should be signed by the official concerned and placed before the head office, which should keep it as a permanent record along with the service register of the individual employee concerned.

Stating that the HR & CE department has one Commissioner belonging to the All India service apart from two Additional Commissioners, 26 Joint Commissioners and 64 Assistant Commissioners, the petitioner claimed that all those who had not taken the pledge as required under the 1961 GO must be removed from service forthwith.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yj7rnp/article30976515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MadrasHighCourtvg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-directs-all-hrce-dept-staff-to-take-the-hindu-pledge/article30976516.ece
358,2020/03/04,Unorganised workers’ union stages protest,"‘Withdraw two controversial codes’

Members of Joint Action Committee of Unorganised Workers’ Unions on Tuesday staged a demonstration here demanding the withdrawal of the controversial codes — the Occupational Safety and Health Code and Social Security Code — introduced recently.

They described the two codes as anti-labour and said the passage of the two codes will nullify the benefits so far enjoyed by the unorganised sector workers.

R. Geetha, a coordinator, said the proposal to repeal the Building and other Construction Workers‘ (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 and the introduction of two codes have created an uncertainty about the existing welfare boards.

The role of the State governments and State boards has been reduced while the role of the Central government has been increased.

“There is uncertainty and anxiety about the fate of the huge cess fund, which has been accumulated over a long period and the larger amount of interest earned on it. There is uncertainty about the continuation of the millions of registered beneficiaries, the continuation of financial assistance and pension benefits to aged construction workers,” said Ms. Geetha.

The workers also urged the State government to oppose the new codes since they are anti-worker.

The workers also claimed that the two codes had been brought to Parliament without consulting the stakeholders.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unorganised-workers-union-stages-protest/article30976458.ece

360,2020/03/04,Irregularities surface in ticket sales at Parthasarathy temple,"Earnings not deposited in bank account yet

Irregularities have reportedly surfaced in the sale and printing of special tickets for the Vaikunta Ekadasi festival at the Sri Parthasarathy Swamy temple here. A little over ₹1.50 lakh received from the sale of 300-odd tickets, priced at ₹500 each, that was supposed to be paid into the bank account of the temple on January 6 this year, has not been done so far, sources in the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) department said.

They added that since the tickets were sold on the previous day, the amount should have been paid into the account on the very next day. “Income from tickets for archana, special darshan, thaligai, prasadam and other heads to the temple must be collected till late evening and paid into the temple account the next morning,” a source explained. Since the responsibility to pay the amount lies with the executive officer in-charge at that time, a show cause notice has been served on the official questioning the delay.

Apart from the 3,000 special tickets printed by the temple authorities after obtaining permission from the Commissioner, unusually this year another 2,800 special tickets were printed. “The printer has submitted the bill for clearance. But it has been kept on hold since it does not have the sanction from the Commissioner,” explained another source.

Narayanan, a devotee, questioned as to how the executive officer could get another batch printed. “Tickets were sold in black for up to ₹2,000 per ticket by certain persons even late at night on January 5. But genuine devotees were allowed to get only one ticket per person on production of Aadhaar card. People started coming to the temple much before the actual issuance of tickets. The family of the EO was exclusively present during the vishwaroopa darshan on Vaikunta Ekadasi. She was transferred out twice but she kept coming back to the temple using undue influence,” he alleged.

He also claimed that there were irregularities in the maintenance of accounts of vasthrams (cloth) presented by devotees to adorn the idols. “One staff member, who was caught twice and suspended earlier for not maintaining the vasthrams, silver and gold utensils, was involved in it again this time. He was charging ₹2500 for pushpa angi but the bill amount was ₹500. This person is involved in many irregularities,” he alleged demanding that action be taken against errant officials and temple employees involved in such issues. A source in the HR and CE explained that the temple staff had been placed under suspension.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/irregularities-surface-in-ticket-sales-at-parthasarathy-temple/article30976440.ece
361,2020/03/04,Sithalapakkam lake in need of succour,"Residents complain of garbage dumping and illegal drawal of water

Sithalapakkam lake, brimming with water, remains an eyesore. The waterbody, located along the Medavakkam-Mambakkam Main Road, has over the years has fallen victim to encroachments and also suffers from poor maintenance. Spread over 160 acres, it now serves as a dumping ground for garbage. Wastewater is also let into it by sewage tankers.

G. Sathyanarayanan, a resident of Sithalapakkam, rued that the panchayat, rather than protect the lake, was using a portion of for dumping waste generated in the locality. He also complained about water being illegally drawn from the lake for commercial use.

Environment activists in the locality want the newly formed Chengalpattu district administration to take steps to construct a compound wall around Sithalapakkam lake, similar to the one built around Vengaivasal lake. They also want the authorities to clear encroachments from the lake.

Eco-restoration plan

The Water Resources Department (WRD), which manages both the Vengaivasal and Sithalapakkam lakes, has plans to remove the ‘makeshift’ dump site and rejuvenate the waterbody.

A WRD official said, “We have approached the local body and block development officer several times in the past, requesting them to stop dumping garbage along the lake. Waste gets dumped again and again even after being clearing.”

The department plans to take up eco-restoration of the lake. In fact, there are plans to rejuvenate it on the lines of Paruthipattu lake.

Besides desilting and strengthening of the bund, the project would include creating facilities such as fencing and a walkway. The rejuvenation project, estimated to cost of ₹4-5 crore, would be taken up shortly. The work is expected to be executed as part of the ₹3,000-crore comprehensive flood mitigation project.

363,2020/03/04,RTOs across city in crying need of more space,"Of the 16 RTOs, only seven function from their own buildings, and only one has its own testing track

‘Cramped’ best describes the state of the Mandaveli Regional Transport Office (RTO), which functions from a rented premises on V. C. Garden Second Street.

While the lane gets congested with applicants’ vehicles, the RTO itself suffers from a severe space crunch and does not even have a testing track of its own.

“We conduct the driving tests near Foreshore Estate. Our attempt to get some land near R.A. Puram to set up our office has failed. Till recently we used the space near St. Mary’s Road Cemetery for vehicle inspection. Following complaints from residents, we shifted to Foreshore Estate. We urgently need space of our own,” said an official.

This is not the only RTO suffering from a lack of space and a testing track. Many others in the city too face the same problem and this is a hurdle to their smooth functioning. On an average, close to 100 persons apply for licences every day across RTOs.

Of the 16 RTOs in the city, only those at Thiruvanmiyur, Poonamallee, Red Hills, Anna Nagar, Tondiarpet, K.K. Nagar and Tondiarpet function from their own buildings. The others, including those at Ayanavaram, Ambattur, Perambur, Valasaravakkam, Mandaveli, Meenambakkam, Tambaram and Kundrathur, function from rented premises. Funds have been allocated to construct a building for the Sholinganallur RTO, said an official from the Transport Department.

Parking woes

Officials said that the people who come to RTOs complain that they do not have space to park their vehicles. “The Valasaravakkam RTO is functioning on the narrow Kaliamman Koil Street in Virugambakkam. Due to this, there is frequent congestion. We hope to move to our own premises soon,” said an official.

Even the staff feel stifled working in cramped rooms at most RTOs. “Considering the growth in number of vehicles, the government should provide spacious buildings,” said an official at the Mandaveli RTO. “In the mornings, there is heavy traffic congestion and the applicants feel uncomfortable. We are also looking out for some other space,” said an official at the Tambaram RTO, located on Old State Bank Colony Road.

Only one track

Only one RTO in the city, Anna Nagar, has its own track to conduct tests for licence applicants.

“The remaining conduct the tests in nearby grounds or on the road. This causes inconvenience to the applicants,” said a motor vehicle inspector.

For example, the K.K. Nagar and Virugambakkam RTOs conduct the tests in an open ground in West K.K. Nagar. The Thiruvanmiyur RTO holds tests near the beach. The Tambaram RTO conducts driving tests on the service road next to the Outer Ring Road.

“There were plans to have a sensor-based testing track at Sholinganallur, but it has not taken off till date. The only advanced testing track functioning as on date is in Karur,” said an official.

Scouting for land

State Transport Authority officials said that they are scouting for land for all the RTOs.

“We have got one option for the Valasaravakkam RTO. It is located near Maduravoyal. The testing track will also be near it. We are also hunting for other offices,” an official claimed.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lojt4a/article30976409.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THRTOMANDAVELLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rtos-across-city-in-crying-need-of-more-space/article30976410.ece
364,2020/03/04,A blow against social justice,"Denying application of reservation in promotions has largely confined SCs and STs to lower cadre jobs

The recent verdict of a two-judge Supreme Court Bench on reservations and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes promotions — “that no individual could claim reservation in promotions and that the court could not issue a mandamus directing State governments to provide reservation” — has mainly raised four constitutional questions: Whether reservation in promotions is a fundamental right or not. Whether a court can direct the state to provide reservations. Whether quantifiable data for inadequate representation is a must for giving reservation in promotions. And whether it is the obligation of the state to give reservation.

In the first instance, as this case involves multiple constitutional issues, it should have been dealt with by a larger constitutional bench that included a Scheduled Caste (SC) or Scheduled Tribe (ST) judge. So, it is the moral responsibility of the Union Government to appeal this case and request a constitutional bench hearing. It must be noted that in 2018 a five-judge Constitution bench had denied reservation for SCs and STs who belong to the creamy layer; the Central government has asked for a review by a seven-judge Constitutional bench. This verdict on SCs and STs promotions has affected social justice and the advancement of the under-privileged.

Addressing the first question, the scope for reservation for the Backward Classes is promised in Part III of the Constitution under Fundamental Rights. Articles 16(4) and 16(4A) which empowers the state to provide reservation for SCs and STs are a part of the section, “Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment”. The right to equality is also enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution. Many construe that the reservation is against Article 16 (Right to equality). But one should understand that the absence of equal opportunities for the Backward Classes due to historic injustice by virtue of birth entails them reservation. In other words, the right to equality is the basis of reservation as there is no level-playing field among castes. Articles 16 (2) and 16(4) are neither contradictory nor mutually exclusive in nature. In fact, they are complementary to each other; even Article 16(4) is not a special provision. Now, another question arises as to whether reservation should be applied in promotions?

Destabilising move

The answer is yes, because in India, where there is a peculiar hierarchical arrangement of caste, it is conspicuous that SCs and STs are poorly represented in higher posts. Denying application of reservation in promotions has kept SCs and STs largely confined to lower cadre jobs. This is even seen in the higher judiciary. Hence, providing reservation for promotions is even more justified and appropriate to attain equality. The question of law is not about enabling reservations in promotions or not, but this judgment destabilises the very basis of reservation; when there is no direct recruitment in higher posts, the implementation of reservation is justified at every level to get a reasonable representation. It is not correct to subdivide the scope of reservation at the entry level and in promotions; this delineation will only lead to confusion in the implementation of reservation. Now, by declaring that reservation cannot be claimed as a fundamental right is a dangerous precedent in the history of social justice.

Editorial | Substantive equality: on SC/ST govt. staff promotions

Can a court issue a mandamus to the state for providing reservation? This is inappropriate because when the court is empowered to pass orders to create extra seats every year for forward-caste students who claim to be affected by reservation, why cannot it direct the state to provide reservation in promotions? The Supreme Court has extraordinary powers under Article 142, which empowers the Court to pass any order necessary for doing “complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it”.

The next question is about the necessity of quantifiable data to show an inadequate representation of reserved category people. This question has been addressed in the Constitution. Article 16(4) reads: “Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which, in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State.”

Here, “in the opinion of State” should not be construed as the discretion of the state to give the reservation or not; on the contrary, if the state feels that SCs and STs are under-represented, then it is in the domain of the state to provide reservation. In the Indra Sawhney vs Union of India case (Mandal Commission) the idea of quantifiable data on inadequate representation was applied for exceeding the 50% cap for reservation; within 50% where the existing quotas for SCs and STs are accommodated were not affected. The responsibility of collecting data on representation by the Backward Classes lies with the state. Pathetically, the last caste-based census was in 1935, and in the pre-Independence era, by the British government. After Independence, no government has had the inclination to conduct a caste-based census due to political reasons. Even if a caste-based census is collected, the population and proportionate representation of SCs and STs will be low. For this reason alone, a proper caste-based census has not been conducted in independent India. Moreover, Article 16(4) clearly mentions that if the state, in its opinion, feels that SCs and STs are not adequately represented, then it can provide reservation for them. There is no mention of “quantifiable data” in the Constitution. Even after 70 years of SC/ST reservation, their representation is as low as 3%.

Finally, if the argument is that it is not binding on the state to give reservation, it must be noted that when reservation rights are in Part III as Fundamental Rights, it is the obligation of the state to ensure reservation to the underprivileged. This judgment has interpreted Articles 16 (4) and 16(4A) only as enabling provisions. Enabling provisions mean that these provisions empower the state to intervene; it does not mean the state is not bound to provide it. Interpreting the Constitution by paraphrasing and selective reading is dangerous.

Administrative efficiency

More importantly, this judgment has raised a new point — that the decision of the State government to provide reservation for SC/STs should not affect the efficiency of administration. This implies that the entry of SC/STs in the job market can reduce the quality of administration; this by itself is discriminatory. There is no evidence that performance in administration is affected on account of caste. There have been many attempts to dilute reservation in the past. But, this judgment appears to be debatable in the larger context and should be challenged in a constitutional bench. In a country of parliamentary democracy, even the Constitution of India can be amended. If the government at the Centre has genuine concern for SC/STs, it can amend the Constitution using its political majority.

365,2020/03/04,A COVID-19 response that is quick off the blocks,"Given that India has a fragile health system, it is critical to plan a coordinated and coherent action plan

We are now facing the global spread of COVID-19, the new coronavirus disease, with confirmed cases being identified in new countries on an almost daily basis. As of March 2, 2020, according to the World Health Organisation, there are around 89,000 confirmed cases from 65 countries; 27 countries have reported local transmission. In addition to China, there are now epidemics in South Korea, Iran, Italy and Japan. India has reported six confirmed cases to date in Kerala, Rajasthan, Delhi and Telangana. High income countries with resources such as the United States, Italy and Germany have reported local transmission clusters. Dr. Nancy Messonnier, U.S. CDC, says: “It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness.”

Getting the system ready

In India, we should anticipate the possibility of a rapid viral spread due to its uniqueness of being a respiratory pathogen with capability of community transmission. India needs to be ready to mount a coordinated, coherent and sustained response.

Even if the disease does not reach epidemic status in India, it behoves us to continue to develop and maintain infrastructure to respond to new novel infectious agents capable of rapid spread. Over the past decade we have already seen outbreaks in India of swine flu and Nipah. As such, outbreak preparedness is an investment which will pay dividends immediately at worst or in the medium to long term at best. Preparedness allows a health system to take proactive steps to mitigate or lessen the adverse impacts of an outbreak and to be in control without being overwhelmed. COVID-19 has given us an opportunity to test our systems and build resilience for the future.

The objective of the response should be to adapt to the stage of the outbreak. In the initial days when travel-related cases are few and manageable, such as the current status in India (known cases), it makes sense to do extensive screening, testing of all suspected cases and do contact tracing to prevent its spread into the wider community. But once an outbreak takes hold with sustained community-wide local transmission, then testing lessens in significance and may in fact rapidly overwhelm the laboratory capacity. At that point, the response should change from containment to mitigation so that the health system does not crumble. Akin to a team chasing in cricket: with 10 wickets in hand and power play, it can go for big shots to win the game quickly. But if it loses wickets, then taking ones and twos to ensure that the required run rate does not go out of hand makes sense (epidemic peak and surge capacity in outbreak response terms).

Full coverage: Coronavirus disease COVID-19

Components of a response

India has a fragile health system which is fragmented. It is critical to mount a coordinated and coherent response. This not only means involvement of both public and private sectors but also allopathic and non-allopathic medical systems, different departments such as police, fire, transportation, tourism, food supplies and other sectors. The response should be proportional and based on scientific principles while ensuring transparency and respecting human rights. The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), currently designed to be set up in situations of large natural calamities, should be leveraged; it should coordinate across ministries and departments. It should set up a dedicated web portal which includes a dashboard with key indicators, current case definitions, guidelines, risk communication materials and micro plans. Transparency and fact-based information are hugely important as in moments of crisis, rumours and unsubstantiated claims can rapidly spread. Utilising social media, media outlets effectively is also crucial. An epidemic of fear and misinformation can be damaging, stigmatising and corrosive to public interest.

The Ebola example

Trust in government, its institutions and fraternity among fellow citizens forms the bulwark of an effective response. An outbreak which is unaddressed will have short- and long-term impacts on health. The 2014-15 West Africa Ebola outbreak overwhelmed local fragile health systems; many front-line health workers and prominent doctors fell victim. The subsequent outbreak response absorbed all available health resources and impacted other programmes such as routine immunisation leading to measles outbreaks in the aftermath. So, a response plan should be able to maintain ongoing regular health programmes while at the same time devoting adequate resources to the response. This in itself would be a delicate balancing act on the part of the NCMC. They, in conjunction with duly constituted State and district-level crisis committees, also have the even more difficult task of determining whether cluster containment measures such as those practised in China are feasible in the Indian context given its diversity and resources, and if so, how effective it would be and when to call it off. The response should be informed by the requirement to balance public health measures and the rights of those impacted.

With neither a definitive cure nor a vaccine on the immediate horizon (multiple teams are working on this internationally), the response plan undoubtedly relies on basic measures such as risk communication, health education, social distancing, and home isolation to reduce the speed at which the outbreak will spread. Large-scale behaviour change will be the cornerstone of a successful response. It is worthwhile to remember that Ebola was brought under control by people who within a short time changed their long-held traditional burial practices and routines such as hand shaking, and not just by people in hazmat suits treating patients in temporary hospitals. Though media shows people in hazmats more than people washing hands properly, it is the latter which plays an equal if not bigger role.

Risk communication

In Iran, the Deputy Health Minister is among those infected. So a response plan should ensure that critical personnel (deemed irreplaceable) across sectors such as health, energy, defence, and food supply are identified and protected. Priority also needs to be given to protecting front-line health workers, intensive care unit nursing staff, doctors including specialists such as intensivists, pulmonologists, etc. In India, infection prevention and control practices in health-care facilities are often lenient. The reasons range from non-availability of personal protective equipment to a relaxed attitude towards safety norms, analogous to how seat belt or helmet use is practised in India. Risk communication should address this and make people feel comfortable entering hospitals where all the staff, right from parking attendants, security guards, receptionists, nurses, paramedical workers and doctors, are wearing appropriate personal protective equipment.

The government should draft and publish clinical guidelines for triage, admission, discharge, ventilator support and other components, as applicable for various levels of the health system. These should be updated on a regular basis, as we learn more about the virus and how to tackle it. There should be strict enforcement to ensure equity and considerations built in so that those vulnerable are protected and get equal access to care.

Across the board

A simple back of the envelope calculation will show that current health-care resources in themselves will be inadequate for the response — for example, the number of ambulances needed or the number of contact tracers in the Department of Health, etc. As such, resources from other departments and general public, financial, in kind and personnel, need to be pooled and mobilised. They need to be trained on a fast track without making compromises on quality. Preparedness is neither the sole domain nor the prerogative of government; all institutions, entities, firms both private and public and even individuals and households should make contingency and advance preparedness plans.

Companies need to decide on a nimble basis putting in measures such as work from home, suspension of non-essential travel, and reinforcing workplace hygiene and health information protocols, expansive leave policies for the sick or those under quarantine. Local authorities can make plans for school closure, home isolation and social distancing.

The unprecedented containment measures taken by China have bought the world some lead time. India has been fortunate to only see limited cases so far, but we must not squander this time window and be ready for a worsening situation. Preparing for the worst case scenario will hold us in good stead.

The fears of the writer that the pursuance of Hindu Rashtra is no longer a camouflaged destination but is the current location, is not entirely unfounded (Editorial page, “The message from Delhi”, March 3). The way the country is progressing towards majority appeasement and the unabashed hate speeches, which intentionally go unnoticed by those who matter in certain political parties are all in the making of a Hindu Rashtra. In this pursuit, economic issues of concern such as agriculture and unemployment have fallen by the wayside. It is a sad state of affairs that the dangerous and imperious path being chosen is being gleefully encouraged by polarised sections.. By the time the people of this great nation realise the mistake of supporting and pursuing this path of self-destruction it may be too late to recover.

367,2020/03/04,Bharatanatyam performances by Rama Vaidyanathan and Shobana in Palakkad showcased their virtuosity,"They performed at the 9th National Cultural Festival organised by Gowri Creations

The last two evenings of a week-long festival of dance and music at Rappadi Open Air Auditorium, Palakkad, proved to be an aesthetic treat with Bharatanatyam performances by Rama Vaidyanathan and Shobana, which showcased their virtuosity and artistry.

Rama commenced her recital with ‘Skandamoorthi’, a production eulogising Lord Muruga. The birth of Skanda came alive on stage through graceful execution of gestures, fluent exercises in rhythm and captivating expressions. Rama then moved on to Dandayudhapani Pillai’s famous varnam, ‘Swamiye Azhaithodi Vaa’. Here again, Murugan is the ‘nayaka’ whose separation lands the ‘nayika’ in anguish.

The dancer astutely portrayed the myriad moods of the viraholkhantitha nayika, who is unable to withstand the arrows of Lord Kamadeva (God of love). The vyabhicharibhavas (transitory expressions), such as the “cool rays of the moon” and the “fragrance of sandal paste” that heighten the female character’s desire for the protagonist, contributed to the sthayi (enduring) bhava considerably. The dynamics of Rama’s movement in the jathi and swara segments was succinct yet spell-binding. Sudha Raghuraman’s rendition of the piece in raga Poorvikalyani was evocative and the bhava of each and every word was illuminated in consonance with the dancer’s immaculate abhinaya.

Next, she presented an abhang of Janabai, zooming in on Panduranga Vittala. In the piece, the female protagonist perceives the Lord in three different forms — as mother, as co-worker and friend and finally as the supreme Brahman, her saviour.

The dancer, as a devotee, depicted Vittala as a deer and herself as her child. As friend and co-worker, the character’s chiding of Vittala and her insisting on him doing household chores were amusing to watch. In contrast, Rama then showed the character transforming into a devotee for whom Vittala is the ultimate redeemer.

In the Tamil padam ‘Edungaanum’ that followed, the dancer portrayed a visibly exasperated nayika who learns that her lover has spilled the beans about their secret union to all, including her friends. As the lover approaches her while pretending to be pious, the wounded nayika reacts furiously. Rama presented her feeling of shame, irritation and embarrassment with ingenuity.

Rama concluded her recital with a thillana, once again bringing to the fore the image of Muruga and the kavadi (ornamented arched pole) that is integral to him. S Vasudevan’s nattuvangam, Sumod Sreedharan’s beats on the mridangam and G Raghuraman’s flute were well attuned to Rama’s efforts.

Shobana’s performance, on the concluding day of the festival, adhered to the canons of Margam. She began her recital with Mallari, characterised by a chain of swaras that illuminated the rhythmic grace of the dance. Shobana then moved onto a piece in praise of goddess Kaali. The terrifying form of Mahakaali confronting a demon and her mood in contrast to being a benevolent goddess were portrayed with theatrical flavour.

Visual dynamics

The varnam of the Tanjore Quartet, ‘Sarasijakshulu’, set to raga Kalyani and Roopaka tala, captured the state of mind of the nayika through whom the lotus-eyed Krishna’s magnificent feats were unfolded. Shobana wove a series of alluring visual phrases in Sreekrishnathulabharam that put down the arrogance of Satyabhama and held aloft the true devotion and concern of Rukmini. Her expressive upangas intensified the hastabhinaya (hand gestures) and made the vinyasa memorable. She then infused a fresh tone to the clichéd Sudama-Krishna reunion by presenting a condensed version.

Afterwards, Shobana’s disciple, Srividya, presented a Kshetrayya Padam, depicting a nayika whose long-cherished union with Muvva Gopala is repeatedly intercepted in different venues by the crowing of a rooster. Shobana then took up a Javali in raga Chengurutti depicting the distress and trauma of a nayika deeply disenchanted by the nayaka’s infidelity as she comes to know of his dalliance with another lady. The dancer’s instinct for emotive acting entranced the audience when she enacted the female protagonist’s sentimental outpourings in front of her sakhi.

Shobana then depicted the acclaimed lines of the Gitagovindam that highlight Lord Vishnu’s incarnations as Narasimha and Vamana. The closing item of her recital was a thillana of the Tanjore Quartet.

Accomplished artistes usually become part of the orchestra for Shobana’s recitals. With Radha Bhadri as vocalist, Anantha R Krishnan on the mridangam and Sruthi Sagar on the flute, the dancer was in her element throughout. Yet the absence of the violin was conspicuous as it would have added punch to the visual fluidity of the dance.

369,2020/03/04,"‘While looking at GDP, we must look towards women’","IWN chairperson says female entrepreneurs in country struggle to find funding, mentors

The NITI Aayog should introduce policies to encourage participation of women in entrepreneurship said Kalpana Unadkat, chairperson, Indian Women Network (IWN), western region, of Confederation of Indian Industries (CII).

Ms. Unadkat made the statement while speaking at the International Women’s Week at IWN’s We Connect conference in the city, which focused on women entrepreneurs, on Monday.

“A lot of women today have entered the field of entrepreneurship and are giving out job opportunities, while many of them are still struggling with issues like funding and mentoring. All the successful women entrepreneurs had fantastic ideas but lacked funding to reach the next level in their initial journey,” she said.

Ms. Unadkat said, “While looking at the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of our country, we need to look towards women, as the more women that are involved in entrepreneurial works, the more growth is ensured. Therefore, the government needs to produce women entrepreneurial academics and policies from the NITI Aayog to encourage participation.”

The conference also witnessed participation by Jayashree Mundhe, who runs a self-help group (SHG) with the Mahila Arthik Vikas Mahamandal in Karad village in Parbhani district. Ms. Mundhe started in 2004 with a mixer that she bought with an SHG’s help and started grinding red chilli powder in her home. Today, she has her own business, grinding multiple spices in large grinding machines, and has even started an oil mill.

“Our family used to work as farmers before I started the grinding business. Initially, relatives and village residents discouraged me, as they preferred I work at our farm instead. Hence, in my initial years, I worked in the farms as well as in my business. Now, I operate out the spice grinding business only for two months a year, which still earns me in lakhs,” Ms. Mundhe said.

A panel discussion on ‘Taking The Entrepreneurial Stage’ was led by entrepreneurs from various fields. Meera Shenoy, founder of Youth4jobs, said parents of girls with disabilities worry about their marriage and not their professional career, while Jay Sayta, founder of Glaws.in said gaming is a largely male-dominated sector today and women gamers will be welcomed by all.

371,2020/03/04,Casteist slur case: HC upholds acquittal of 7,"Accused of insulting man from Hindu cobbler community over property dispute

The Bombay High Court has upheld the acquittal of seven men from the Hindu Maratha Kunbi community who were accused of insulting a man from Hindu cobbler community on casteist lines.

The men were acquitted on February 27, 2002, but the State government challenged the decision of the Joint District Judge and Additional Sessions Judge of Thane in the High Court.

A single Bench of Justice K.R. Shriram heard the appeal challenging the acquittal of Pandurang Patil, Kumar Patil, Sopan Patil, Prashant Pandurang, Vilas Patil, Jairam Patil and Namdeo Patil for allegedly abusing Baban Gaikwad.

Mr. Gaikwad worked as an enquiry officer in the Virar branch of a land development bank. He had a plot in Kandivali, which was adjacent to the property owned by Mr. Pandurang Patil. Despite Mr. Gaikwad putting a fence around his land, Mr. Pandurang Patil encroached on it. Mr. Pandurang Patil then asked Mr. Gaikwad to remove the fence. When Mr. Gaikwad challenged Mr. Pandurang Patil to remove the fence, he started dismantling it, leading to an altercation. Mr. Pandurang Patil and the other accused then assaulted Mr. Gaikwad.

The accused were then charged under Section 3(1)(x) (intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. They were also booked under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) read with Section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) of the Indian Penal Code.

The High Court recorded that two of the accused had died and the complainant in the case was not present for the proceedings despite the court making it clear that the matter will not be adjourned for any reason as it has been pending for 17 years.

Justice Shriram said, “I cannot conclude that specific words were uttered in a place within public view. On this ground the SC/ST charge has to fail.”

The Bench also noted the trial court’s observation that the prosecution had failed to prove its case. Justice Shriram said, “Given the circumstances, in my view, the opinion of the trial court cannot be held to be illegal or improper or contrary to law. The order of acquittal, in my view, cannot be interfered with. I cannot find any fault with the judgment of the trial court.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/casteist-slur-case-hc-upholds-acquittal-of-7/article30976844.ece
372,2020/03/04,Doctors cut blood loss during spine surgery,"Ethiopian teen was not given blood transfusion for religious reasons

A 15-year-old Ethiopian girl suffering from scoliosis underwent surgery in a Mumbai hospital. What made the procedure challenging was that the patient, Selam Engida, belonged to Jehovah’s Witness, and thus could not be given blood transfusion. Doctors said they undertook a multi-modal team approach to ensure minimal blood loss during the procedure.

Scoliosis is a condition in which there is a sideways curvature of the spine. As Selam had a significantly crooked spine, she could not walk much or run.

Her mother had detected the condition two years ago but could not get her operated upon due to lack of finances. “If scoliosis is not treated at an early stage, there are chances that the heart and the lungs could get affected,” said Dr. Akhil Tawari, paediatric spine surgery consultant at SRCC Hospital, who operated on her. The reconstruction surgery involved inserting screws and rods in the spine to straighten it.

“Firstly, the patient was given saline for hemodilution, which increases the volume of fluids in her body, so the effective blood loss is less. Her blood pressure was also maintained to an optimum level and external fluids and medications were used to arrest the bleeding from the bones. Instead of using the normal procedure to cut the bone, we used a bone scalpel to reduce the bleeding, which cuts through the bone without injuring the soft tissues,” Dr. Tawari said.

The entire surgery was very risky as it was to be done near the spinal cord and misplacement of the screws or rods could lead to paralysis, he said.

“To get the real-time signals of the functioning of the spinal cord, we had to carry out neuromonitoring, so if any problem occurred, we could reverse the step,” the doctor said. A team of paediatric doctors including spine surgeons, the anaesthesiologist and critical care consultants worked together. Doctors inserted 24 screws and two rods, and ensured much less bleeding.

While the patient was operated on January 22, she was able to walk within two days and recovered from pain in two weeks. The surgery cost ₹4 lakh, and Selam got a donor among the Jehovah’s Witness community to sponsor it. She was allowed to fly back to Ethiopia last month.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/j8iyiy/article30976822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04bm-Ethiopian,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/doctors-cut-blood-loss-during-spine-surgery/article30976823.ece

The Central Railway (CR) is gearing up for the summer rush at Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT) by regulating the flow of passengers through its main building. The station’s passenger load increases every year during the summer rush, with hundreds queuing up for hours to get into the general compartment of trains.

LTT has two key access points, one from Tilak Nagar station and another through the main building. The plan, a senior railway official said, was to shut the Tilak Nagar access point completely and direct passengers to use the station building, which will ensure more discipline during the rush.

Senior Divisional Security Commissioner, Mumbai CR, K.K. Ashraf, said the plan was being implemented on a trial basis as part of a larger station security plan and they would assess its impact in a few weeks’ time.

Officials are also hoping that by sealing the access point towards Tilak Nagar, the autorickshaws that are illegally parked can no longer operate. Railway authorities have received several complaints regarding overcharging by autorickshaws. “Earlier, no one would use the main station exit as there were no transport options there. With the prepaid share autorickshaws stand, people have an option of regulated fares,” the official said. The stand was inaugurated in February but has been facing competition from autorickshaws parked illegally near the Tilak Nagar end. “Passengers have become used to walking towards the Tilak Nagar exit on alighting from trains as the old station building could be accessed from there. But now there is a foot over bridge with lifts that connects all platforms and the current station building,” a senior official said.

Reducing the access points to stations has also been part of the security plan at six stations. To deal with the summer rush, CR’s will be deploying an additional 25 personnel of the Railway Protection Force to regulate crowds.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6d036g/article30976735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BMSTATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cr-to-shut-one-exit-at-ltt-streamline-passenger-flow/article30976736.ece
375,2020/03/04,Kamathipura redevelopment may get a UN thrust: minister,"Awhad talks about converting the area into a business centre

Redevelopment of Kamathipura in south Mumbai may get a boost with help from the United Nations (UN) under its social impact fund meant for the developing countries, Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said in the Assembly on Tuesday.

Mr. Awhad said, “Kamathipura has the potential of being turned into one of the busiest business centres of Mumbai due to its unique location. Be it Mumbai Central, Byculla, Nana Chowk or Chhatrapti Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, every business market is near Kamathipura. We are in talks with the UN which has a social impact fund under its kitty for the developing countries. The funds can be used to change the face of this area.”

He was replying to a discussion on issues related to the real estate sector in Mumbai and those concerning the Slum Rehabilitation Authority and the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority.

Jitendra Awhad said a team of UN officials is expected to visit Kamathipura next month.

A team of UN officials, the minister said, is expected to visit Kamathipura next month. “We are working on it with the same intensity as the previous government worked on changing the face of Bhendi Bazar.”

On affordable housing, Mr. Awhad said the housing policy approved by the former chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, gave authority to the State to acquire the land, which was obtained for a special economic zone, but there was no industrial activity in more than 50% area.

“The policy has mentioned a special Act to make this workable. This government intends to bring such an Act. We believe that we can construct over five lakh houses in five years on this 25,000 acres of land in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region,” the minister said.

Mr. Awhad also announced to kick-start projects by May 1, which will make way for over 30,000 houses available in the next two years. “There are over 1.56 lakh homes which are unsold. We have to accept that the economic slowdown has hit the sector hard. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that the real estate sector survives to provide affordable houses to the poor.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/scf6cc/article30976785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4bmAssembly-Backbenchersrevcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kamathipura-redevelopment-may-get-a-un-thrust-minister/article30976659.ece
376,2020/03/04,Marathi actor in trouble for FB post ‘against Buddhists’,"Rabale police file case under Atrocities Act based on complaint

The Rabale police have registered a case against Marathi actor Ketaki Chitale, along with a Facebook user, for her post on Sunday.

Swapnil Jagtap (26), a resident of Ghansoli and final-year law student part of the Ambedkar Yuva Sangh, said in his complaint that he had received a screenshot on WhatsApp on Ms. Chitale’s post and a comment posted by one Suraj Shinde.

Mr. Jagtap said, “Ms. Chitale had given six pointers that had comments on Muslims, Parsis, Jains, Christians and Buddhists. She mentioned that on December 6 every year, Buddhists travel for free to Mumbai, giving out a very wrong message. Below her post, one Mr. Shinde wrote very objectionable comments about Babasaheb Ambedkar, Mata Ramabai Bheemrao Ambedkar and Mahatma Jyotiba Phule. The comments were such that no one would even like to read them.”

Mr. Jagtap said the remarks were an outright insult and casteist, which is unlawful. He said, “I do not know Ms. Chitale or Mr. Shinde personally and have no information about where they reside. Mr. Shinde, in his comment, has boasted about being a Maratha, and degraded Buddhists.”

A case was registered against Ms. Chitale and Mr. Shinde on Tuesday under Section 295 (injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class) of the Indian Penal Code, and sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.

Vinayak Vast, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Vashi division, said, “The case has been registered by the Rabale police and would be investigated by me as the cases under the Atrocities Act have to be investigated by an Assistant Commissioner of Police-level officer. Once the case is transferred to me, the people mentioned in the first information report would be called for recording statements.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2vrihy/article30976642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BMKetaki-Chitale,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/marathi-actor-in-trouble-for-fb-post-against-buddhists/article30976643.ece
377,2020/03/04,HC grants bail to man who molested ex-actor,"‘No formula on how a woman should react in such situations’

The Bombay High Court on Tuesday admitted the appeal of a 41-year-old businessman challenging his conviction in a case of molestation of a former actor on board a domestic flight in December 2017.

Justice Prithviraj Chavan suspended his sentence and granted him bail till the appeal is heard and disposed of. Justice Chavan also directed him to submit a fresh bail bond of ₹25,000 and not leave Mumbai without the court’s permission.

A sessions court on January 15 this year had convicted the accused, Vikas Sachdev, under Section 354 (assault or criminal force on woman with an intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act as the victim was a minor at the time of the incident. He was awarded three years’ imprisonment.

‘Wrongly convicted’

On February 20, Mr. Sachdev filed an appeal before the High Court, claiming that the trial court erred in finding him guilty. Advocate Aniket Nikam, appearing for Mr. Sachdev, argued that there is no independent evidence to corroborate the testimony of the victim, particularly because of several additions and omissions.

Mr. Nikam told the court that his client had been wrongly convicted and even if his leg had touched the victim, it must have been a mistake and without any intention to harass her. The judge said, “You [Sachdev] were travelling in business class where you have a lot of space, then why keep your leg on someone else’s arm rest?” When Mr. Nikam argued that neither the complainant nor her mother complained to the flight crew members and “walked out of the flight smiling”, the court said there is no formula on how a woman should behave or react to such incidents. The judge said, “This is not mathematics. There is no straitjacket formula on how a woman should behave or react when faced with such a situation.”

Mr. Nikam then argued that there were contradictions between the statements given by the victim and other eyewitnesses. He said, “The crew members of the flight had deposed that the accused was sleeping throughout the flight.”

Justice Chavan, however, said, “There is no reason for her to lie and a woman may speak less but she understands more. It is a natural gift for a woman to understand touch. Look a man may not understand, but a woman knows man’s intention when he touches her. It is only the victim who can talk about the accused person.” The judge said the accused will never admit that he touched the victim intentionally. Justice Chavan said there will hardly be any woman who has not experienced such incidents in local train and buses.

The court said, “There is no scope of the appeal being heard and decided in the near future and since the sentence imposed on the applicant is short, the sentence stands suspended.”

378,2020/03/04,79% milk in Maharashtra is adulterated: study,"Only 15% branded milk packets match FSSAI standards, loose milk fares better at 22% standardisation

A worrying 79% of branded or loose milk available in the market is adulterated, the latest annual report by the Consumer Guidance Society of India (CGSI) has found.

According to CGSI, a non-profit consumer organisation, 413 samples of milk packets were tested for their fat and solids-not-fat (SNF) contents from January 2019 to December 2019. Of these, only 87 milk samples (21%) complied to the standard specifications set by the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India (FSSAI).

The report said of all the milk samples, 73 were branded packets and only 11 of them (15%) adhered to the standard mark. The remaining 85% of the branded milk currently sold in the market was adulterated.

5% more adulteration

Commenting on the findings of the survey, Dr. Sitaram Dixit, chairman, CGSI, said, “Milk forms an essential portion for all concerned and it needs to be complying with the standards of FSSAI. As compared to the research conducted for 2018, the adulteration has increased by 5% this year.”

The report also said of the 340 non-branded or loose milk packets tested, 76 samples, which made up for 22%, were standardised, while the remaining 264 packets (78%) were found to be adulterated.

The high rate of adulteration of milk continues despite it being made a non-bailable offence in Maharashtra. In the last five months alone, the Mumbai Police Crime Branch has busted several milk adulteration rackets operating out of the city.

Rackets galore

In a raid conducted in Goregaon in January, the Crime Branch had seized over 219 litres of adulterated milk, which was being packaged under reputed brand names. Whereas, in October last year, the Crime Branch had busted a different racket and seized 500 litres of oxytocin, a chemical used for increasing milk production in milch animals, which was being supplied to dairy farmers.

In a similar raid in August last year, the Crime Branch had raided a society in Andheri where milk produced by popular dairy brands were being adulterated.

“The rackets are well organised, with milk packets being collected from trucks in the dead of the night or early in the morning, at a pick-up point well away from the hub. The adulteration itself goes on through the day, with the milk being repackaged and pumped into the market as fast as possible to reap maximum profits,” a Crime Branch officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qmhxl6/article30114085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Milk1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/79-milk-in-state-is-adulterated-study/article30976549.ece
379,2020/03/04,Ulwe murder: police find footage of accused,"Shows man in late 30s leaving victim’s car; police suspect argument led to killing

A day after a 55-year-old woman from Shelgar village in Ulwe was found shot dead, the police have found CCTV footage of a man in his late 30s entering the woman’s car and driving off with her.

In another footage, the accused is seen getting out of the car and walking away. According to the police, Prabhavati Bhagat, a home maker, and her husband Balkrishna (62) were on their way to buy a sari when they stopped at Bank of Maharashtra in Sector 19, Ulwe, around 2.15 p.m..

Mr. Bhagat entered the bank and his wife was waiting in the car parked outside. Then a man got into the driver’s seat and drove the car away, the police said.

“When the accused entered the car, the woman did not raise an alarm. So we suspect that he was known to her,” a police officer, who is part of the investigating team, said. The police also suspect that a verbal duel inside the car could have led to the accused killing the woman. The officer said, “The woman’s body was found around 600 metres from the place from where she was abducted. If the accused had planned to murder her, he should have ideally taken the vehicle to an isolated place.”

The police also found the windowpane of the driver’s seat broken. The officer said, “We have found the shell of a 7.62 mm bullet inside the car. The bullet hit the victim on the right side and came out from the left side of her waist. A few years ago, the victim ran a business in Ulwe along with a partner. We have learnt that the victim’s son had an altercation with the partner recently. We are investigating all angles in the case.”

380,2020/03/04,"In pursuit of train robbers, police crack 3-year-old murder","One of the gang members, who had pushed his accomplice, from a moving train in Malegaon over previous enmity arrested

What started as the verification of a routine tip-off about a gang of robbers who would strike aboard trains and buses ended up solving a three-year-old murder case that had been closed as an accidental death.

According to Crime Branch officers, senior police inspector Sunil Mane, Unit X, received information last month that a gang that specialised in stealing or robbing wallets and cell phones aboard trains, mainly in Nashik, had also committed similar crimes in Mumbai. After several days of inquiries, officers found out that one of them had died in 2017.

“While the suspect was supposed to have died in a train accident, our informant insisted that he had actually been murdered by another member of his gang. As the incident had occurred outside our jurisdiction, we needed further verification before we could act on it,” an officer said.

A team comprising assistant police inspectors Dhanraj Chaudhari and Hanmant Dopewad and constables Satish Kamble and Pramod Kamble visited Malegaon, where the deceased suspect hailed from, and then Ghoti police station in Nashik, in whose jurisdiction he had died.

Rashid Wahab Sayyed

Inquiries with the Ghoti police revealed that Rashid Wahab Sayyed (22), a Malegaon resident, had indeed been found dead on railway tracks on August 29, 2017, and an accidental death report had been filed in this connection. The Crime Branch team also learned that his family had filed a missing persons complaint at Pawarwadi police station in Malegaon on September 5, 2017.

The officers were able to get a physical description of the accused. The team searched in Malegaon, and with the help of the local police, identified the accused as Anwar Sayyed (19).

“Investigations in Malegaon revealed that Rashid had been having an affair with Anwar’s mother, and that the latter had learned about it. On the intervening night of August 28 and 29, Rashid and Anwar met aboard a moving train to divide the day’s spoils. They had an argument over the splitting up of the proceeds. Anwar, who was already angry over the affair, assaulted Rashid and threw him off the moving train,” the officer said.

Anwar was picked up for inquiries and allegedly confessed to the murder during questioning, after which he was handed over to the Ghoti police.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rmlqes/article30976518.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04bmaccused,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/in-pursuit-of-train-robbers-police-crack-3-year-old-murder/article30976457.ece
381,2020/03/04,"Profits, not environmental concern, drive Coastal Road project, says petitioner","Planning is unscientific, no-development zones in city opened up: Shweta Wagh at climate conference

The planning behind the Coastal Road project is uncoordinated and driven by profits and contractors’ interests rather than social or environmental priorities, said Shweta Wagh, associate professor at Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute of Architecture and Environmental Studies.

Ms. Wagh, who is also one of the petitioners against the Coastal Road project, was one of the panellists at a recent discussion on the project at Climate Crisis: Action for Tropical Coastal Cities, a conference on the effects of climate change and steps that can be taken to avoid or repair them.

“The approach towards planning the project is highly unscientific and is driven by needs of profits rather than the realities of the city. No-development zones, which earlier allowed restricted development, have now been opened up for urban development,” Ms. Wagh said. In Aarey colony, these include the Metro car shed and high density resettlement, which are to be built in the catchment areas.

She said, “The Chitale Committee report on the Mumbai floods points out that reduction in permeable areas in catchments results in downstream flooding.”

Ms. Wagh said the State government is trying to justify development projects that are destructive and causing damage to nature. She emphasised the importance of transparency and engagement with citizens in the decision-making process.

“The public is doing its part. The fishermen affected by the Coastal Road project filed a complaint as it was impacting their livelihood. Even the Coastal Regulation Zone permissions were obtained without the appropriate documents in this case,” she said.

Pradip Patade, co-founder of Marine Life of Mumbai, a citizen-driven initiative aimed at exploring and understanding Mumbai’s coastal biodiversity, displayed pictures of species of marine animals found in the city’s coastal areas.

Explaining the link between climate change and health disorders, Dr. Amita Athawale, Professor and Head of Department, Pulmonary Medicine and Environmental Pollution Research Centre, KEM Hospital, said asthma, cough and cold and allergies are directly affected by the change in weather. Ms. Athawale said low-allergy-inducing, ornamental plants found in streets and gardens can significantly reduce these effects.

She said, “The major causes of health issues are animals and insects, food and water safety, carbon monoxide and our daily habits. Waste management is also a huge problem in Mumbai. People usually believe in popping a paracetamol when they are affected by any kind of body ache, but self-medication can land one in trouble.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/r3c6qa/article30976419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BMConcalve,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/profits-not-environmental-concern-drive-coastal-road-project-says-petitioner/article30976420.ece

383,2020/03/04,Activa 6G review: A greener version of its former self,"A sleek update

There are popular scooters, and then there is the Activa. According to Honda, somebody in India buys an Activa every nine seconds and the total has crossed 2 crore units now. Numbers like these prove that the company has perfected the formula. And that’s why it is a pretty big deal when Honda decides to completely redo its most popular scooter and here is what you need to know.

What does it look like?

Honda has played it safe with the cosmetic update on the 6G and it is only received a minor facelift. The scooter now looks a little sharper from the front, thanks to the sleeker-looking headlight and redesigned chrome accents on the apron. The mudguard is now less rounded, and looks similar to the one on the Activa 125. The side panels haven’t changed that much, but they now have a slightly sharper rake towards the rear. Moving on to the rear, it is completely new and also borrows inspiration from the Activa 125 for the tail-light. Activa enthusiasts will be happy to know that the scooter still retains its metal body.

How does it ride?

The increased wheelbase, telescopic fork at the front and 12-inch front wheel have brought about an evident transformation. The scooter doesn’t feel as nervous at higher speeds any more and changing lanes is a lot easier, but there’s still a slight flighty feeling above 60kph. The improved handling and stability also doesn’t come at the cost of ride quality, as the scooter soaks up potholes and undulations very well.

The engine on the Activa 6G is an all-new affair. It has a different bore and stroke (the latter’s now longer), and now uses fuel-injection instead of a carburettor. As with many BS-VI-compliant engines, both power and torque have gone down — by 0.17hp and 0.21Nm, respectively. It doesn’t come as a surprise that this Activa isn’t a very quick scooter. Acceleration is rather lethargic and the 6G struggles to accelerate above 75kph.

That said, the 6G feels extremely refined at all speeds, much more so than the 5G, and many buyers will also appreciate how unbelievably quiet the new engine is. There were times when I felt like the engine wasn’t even running. While the performance has gone down, Honda is claiming that 6G is 10 percent more fuel-efficient.

As for ergonomics, it is capable of accommodating people of most sizes, but very tall ones won’t be comfortable, as the handlebar is positioned quite close to the rider.

What features does it get?

Honda has gone a little backwards with the display, as the 5G’s digi-analogue unit has been replaced with a basic analogue cluster. However, the 6G has gained a bunch of features. It now gets a kill switch that also doubles as a starter button, and it gets a silent-start like on the Activa 125. The 6G also gets a pass-light switch, which is a small but useful touch. Another far more useful addition is the external fuel-filler cap that can be opened remotely via the key fob. Lastly, with the more expensive Deluxe variant, you’ll also get an LED headlight, similar to the 5G, which we’ve not yet had the opportunity to try out at night. However, we wish Honda had also given priority to a front disc brake, because the performance from the drum brakes is quite weak and disappointing.

Should I buy one?

The Activa 6G is definitely a better scooter than its predecessor. Not only is it greener, but it is also a lot better equipped and it has a lot more going for it as an overall product. However, these updates come at a price — ₹63,912 for the Standard and ₹65,412 for the Deluxe.

It now costs ₹7,500 more than the 5G, which is allright when you consider all the work that has gone into it. It’s also only slightly more expensive than its direct rival, the TVS Jupiter (₹61,449-67,911). However, what remains the same as before is that Honda charges you quite a premium for its products and that you can get better performing 125cc scooters in base trim from Hero, TVS and Suzuki for about the same price.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/xfsbnv/article30980729.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04bgmhondaactivaG6jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/review-activa-6g-is-a-greener-version-of-its-former-self/article30980730.ece
384,2020/03/04,"Why the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza petrol is an all-round, sensible buy","A facelift sans all the frills

Selling over 5,00,000 units since its launch in 2016, the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza has been a runaway hit. An upright SUV design, a practical cabin, and a punchy and economical diesel engine indicate that the Vitara Brezza had all the ingredients compact SUV buyers wanted. The Vitara’s styling has been refreshed for 2020 and the interior gets an equipment update too. However, the biggest change is under the hood; the old 1.3-litre diesel engine makes way for a BS-VI 1.5-litre petrol engine, effectively transforming the Brezza from a diesel-only model to a petrol-only one. We see what the petrol Brezza is like and if it has the same mass appeal as the older version.

First and foremost, how do you identify this as the 2020 Brezza? Maruti hasn’t made any sheet metal changes, but there are enough cosmetic changes to distinguish it from the older model. The front bumper is new, as is the grille which sports a new four-slat design and a generous helping of chrome too. The headlamps, while familiar, are now dual-projector LED units — first in the segment — and get new LED daytime running lights that double as indicators. LED fog lights are also part of the new lighting package.

New 16-inch alloy wheels, revised tail-lamps and a new rear bumper complete the makeover. There are also new colours to be had, along with the option of a contrast black-finished roof on the top ZXi+ trim. Furthermore, there are a lot of accessories to personalise your Vitara Brezza.

Inside, the changes aren’t as extensive. The dashboard has been retained, and the only real talking point is the incorporation of Maruti’s latest SmartPlay Studio touchscreen infotainment system. Touch responses are significantly better now, and the general layout of the menus is also easy. A unique detail on the automatic version is an infographic on the MID of the hybrid system at work.

As before, access to the Brezza’s cabin is convenient, while the relatively-high seating position and upright pillars give that all-important feel of driving an SUV. There is plenty of room at the back and passengers will like the view out of the large windows too. The boot is well-shaped and should you need more space, there is always the option to split the rear seat 60:40.

Powering the Brezza is Suzuki’s familiar 1.5-litre, naturally-aspirated petrol engine, which is also the sole engine of choice on the Ertiga, XL6 and Ciaz. The engine makes 105hp and 138Nm of torque, which aren’t shining figures for the compact SUV segment. However, in everyday driving, you won’t have reason to complain. The engine is smooth and quiet, there’s enough pep at low speeds and, though unexciting, there’s a pleasant build of speed. Overtaking traffic won’t pose much of a problem either, though you do miss that mid-range kick that you’d get on the older diesel. That being said, the Vitara Brezza petrol isn’t slow. In our preliminary tests, it did the 0-100kph dash in a brisk 11.89sec (a Venue turbo needs 11.4sec), 20-80kph in third gear in a class-best 11.40sec, and 40-100kph in fourth in a respectable 14.88sec.

The engine isn’t quick-revving and tops out at just over 6,000rpm. Still, keep your foot pinned down and you will like the way the engine winds in the top end of the rev band. The throaty note from the unit also adds some character.

The standard-fit 5-speed manual gearbox requires little effort, and the light clutch is also easy to live with in town. Coming to the automatic, the petrol motor comes paired with a 4-speed torque converter unit in place of the diesel’s AMT. The unit shifts smoothly between gears and works well in everyday scenarios. It’s only when you want immediate power that it tends to falter, taking a bit of time to get to the right gear.

Interestingly, the Brezza auto, with an ARAI-tested fuel economy of 18.76kpl, is more efficient than the manual, rated at 17.03kpl. Part of the reason is Suzuki’s SHVS mild-hybrid system that comprises an integrated starter generator and lithium-ion battery. It adds in mild motor assist under hard acceleration, energy recuperation on deceleration and auto start/stop functionality.

There is a change in ride and handling too. The steering is lighter and requires less effort to twirl, while low-speed bump absorption seems to have improved too. You don’t feel as much of the surface imperfections as before. On the flip side, the steering has lost some of the older Vitara’s directness, which takes away confidence at higher speeds. There’s also more vertical movement when you go faster.

Moving to the prices, the Vitara Brezza petrol-manual prices start at ₹7.34 lakh and top off at ₹9.98 lakh, while the automatic’s prices range from ₹9.75 lakh to ₹11.40 lakh. While these are on par with those of rivals, it’s not as competitive as it ought to have been. The reason? The Brezza’s 1,462cc engine means Maruti’s compact SUV does not qualify for small car excise sops available to models with length under 4m and petrol engines with displacement under 1,200cc.

What the updated Brezza also lacks is novelty value. Yes, the facelift helps, but there is a nagging feeling that Maruti missed a chance to up the cabin ambience and add in more features. It sticks too close to formula and doesn’t feel any more than the 2016 model rehashed for 2020.

385,2020/03/04,Why the Toyota Camry Hybrid is one for all seasons and reasons,"The Toyota Camry Hybrid can handle everything except a free fall

Once upon a time, I remember scoffing when my uncle, who owned a Rover 2000, mentioned that the car’s biggest flaw was limited range brought upon by its lack of fuel economy. For a pre-teen taken with performance and appearances, frugality (much like reliability, or durability), had little currency. The luxurious Rover 2000 (originally the Rover SD1) that cost an astronomical sum of over ₹2 lakh in the 1980s, was a dream wagon.

Now, with all respect to the neo-romantic ideal of a ‘thing of beauty being a joy forever’, I would submit that the notion of beauty becomes less simplistic and more layered as you grow older. By no means am I suggesting that the new Toyota Camry Hybrid is not a handsome vehicle. When set side by side with its predecessor, this new luxury sedan has blossomed into a strikingly good-looking adult. Its evolution marked not just by its newly acquired good looks but with sensibilities to match, the new Camry Hybrid’s heart moves not just by the unabashed machinations of an internal combustion engine, but an electric motor that makes the car, especially for its heft and size, extraordinarily frugal.

On a reasonably long drive from Delhi to the town of Narnaul in rural Haryana, plied by roads meant more for tractors rather than low-slung sedans, the Camry not only took your columnist without complaint, but also never let the rough and tumble translate into a bumpy ride for its occupants. This is the sort of car that spares a careless driver the blushes when he completely misses a minor asphalt hill disguised as a speed-breaker. Rolls Royce likes to use the word ‘waft’ a lot when describing the ride quality of its cars. The Camry might not waft, but it sure can glide, whilst cocooning its passengers in a cockpit as safe as you’re likely to find outside a rally car.

In Narnaul, you’re told by pro golfer Digvijay Singh, who’s set up a skydiving outfit at a remote airfield, that the chances of fatality of the drive from Delhi are exponentially higher than those posed by jumping out of an air plane yoked to a parachutist. You point to the Camry’s enviable safety record and he seems nonplussed. Stats aren’t vehicle-specific are they? Not sure, I say, but pretty certain that the Camry affects the odds. The safety net, so to speak, when we plummet down from 10,000 feet up in the air, is deployed by an instructor who’s done it thousands of times, literally. As much as I love technology, I’ve never been happier about that.

386,2020/03/04,University students continue relay hunger strike,"University had increased the fees by up to 25%, triggering protests

The indefinite relay hunger strike by students of Pondicherry University, in protest against fee increase and demanding 25% reservation for local students in all courses, entered the fifth day on Wednesday.

With no immediate solution in sight, the Students Council has decided to continue with the relay strike in front of the administrative block on the campus, keeping away from classes.

The students commenced their indefinite hunger strike on February 28, accusing the authorities of increasing the fees disproportionately last year.

In addition, transport fees of ₹4,000 a year was introduced for day scholars.

Facility denied

A spokesperson of the Students Council said the administration had given strict directions to the health centre to deny regular check up for the protesting students.

“Instead of addressing the students’ concerns, the administration is trying to intimidate us by denying medical treatment, which is considered a basic human right even during war situations,” he said.

The strike will go on indefinitely until the administration is ready to address the concerns raised by the students, the council spokesperson added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/university-students-continue-relay-hunger-strike/article30984689.ece

In a statement, Mr. Narayanasamy registered a strong protest against the Centre’s move to collect specific details on “place of birth of father and mother, last place of residence, mother tongue” along with other information like Aadhar (optional), voter ID card, mobile phone and driving licence numbers.

Already, Bihar and Kerala had rejected as “unacceptable’ the new initiative since the collection of additional information has come to cause panic and unnecessary fear.

People were concerned that the exercise was a precursor to the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), he said.

Mr. Narayanasamy said it would not be possible for old and destitute people to furnish details since they would not have the details with them.

390,2020/03/04,Spiritual park in Karaikal set to give tourism a boost,"The park will house an amphitheatre, meditation dome and replicas of nine Navagraha temples with inscriptions

An upcoming Spiritual Park in the temple town of Thirunallar is set to give a much-needed impetus to the tourism sector in Karaikal.

The park, spread over 6,62,822 square metres, will house an amphitheatre, meditation dome, replicas of the nine Navagraha temples with inscriptions of their importance, a garden ‘darbha’ (grass used to perform puja), trees for 27 ‘nakshatras’ and 12 ‘rashis’ and a fountain.

The project, undertaken by the Tourism Department under the Centre’s Swadeshi Darshan at a cost of around ₹5 crore, will be completed in a few months, a senior official told The Hindu.

The amphitheatre, on an area of 550 square metres, will screen devotional programmes during evening hours.

“The park will become a major attraction for hundreds of pilgrims visiting the landmark Thirunallar Saneeswaran temple. It is designed in such a way as to give a spiritual atmosphere for pilgrims,” said an officer associated with the project in the Karaikal administration.

As part of the Swadeshi Darshan project, the administration has developed the pond in Sri Jadapureswarar Temple at T.R Pattinam and also a queue complex and waiting hall at Sri Badra Kali Amman temple. The queue complex and waiting hall would be of immense assistance to hundreds of pilgrims visiting the temple every Tuesday. Around 2,000 devotees, mostly women, spend the night at the temple every Tuesday as a ritual, said the official

Apart from the Centrally-sponsored programmes, the territorial administration has taken up various works such as renovation of 14 ponds, the bus terminal and improvement of roads as part of the Thirunallar Temple town development programme, officials said.

The Puducherry government has decided to supply around 6,000 milch cows to farmers to improve domestic productivity of milk, Minister for Social Welfare M. Kandasamy has said.

“As part of efforts to improve the quantum of milk produced locally, the government has decided to provide milch cows to dairy farmers. Details of the scheme will be worked out soon,” he told The Hindu.

Of the total 1.10 lakh litres of milk needed for domestic consumption here, around 55,000 litres of milk are procured from neighbouring States. Supply of milch cows would help the government save money and improve the livelihoods of farmers, he added.

The scheme was discussed at a meeting the Minister had with officials of Animal Husbandry, Agriculture, Pondicherry Cooperative Milk Society and Registrar of Cooperative Societies on Tuesday evening, the Minister said.

“We will help farmers get loan from banks. The government will pay the interest, besides the subsidy given by the Centre. The money for procuring cows will be set aside in the next budget,” he said

392,2020/03/04,Greenfield airport at Karaikal waiting to take wings,"‘Puducherry government must play its constructive part’

A long-felt yearning of pilgrims and tourists for an airport at Karaikal could be fulfilled under UDAN 4.0, the latest round of Regional Connectivity Scheme, if only the Puducherry government plays its constructive part at this juncture, according to representatives of trade and tourism sector.

The fourth round of Regional Connnectivity Scheme has now lessened the burden of land acquisition, as a runway length of 1.2 km would suffice for operating below 20-seater aircrafts.

With the Ministry of Civil Aviation setting its sights on operationalising 1,000 routes and more than 100 airports in the next five years, the tourism sector hopes that the Puducherry government would, in right earnest, factor in the convenience of pilgrim tourists visiting Thirunallar Saneeswaran Temple, the Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Velankanni and the Nagore Andavar Dargah, and play a pro-active role in enabling establishment of the greenfield airport by the Karaikal Airport Private Limited (KAPL).

The Puducherry government had proposed a 560-acre expanse for the project to the Ministry of Civil Aviation. But, there were problems in land acquisition since a sizeable chunk constituted agricultural fields. The promoter managed to acquire 230 acres from private owners so far, and will be in a position to continue with the project if some extent of land on the proposed runway path is acquired.

The project for which the promoter has invested ₹20 crore so far could not take off due to the difficulty in acquiring land on the runway path.

The Puducherry cabinet had, last year, cleared a proposal to engage Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) for reviving the project. But, the CIAL backed off after studying the complications involved in land acquisition, according to an official source.

A votary of the greenfield airport said the onus was on the Puducherry government to secure legal clearance for the sale of a land parcel of 110 acres belonging to the Dharmapuram Adheenam, which had expressed inclination to dispose off the property a decade back.

“In the event of getting the title for the land on the runway path, we will be able to start off with small aircraft, and subsequently move on to operating ATR-type aircraft,” J.V. Chowdhury, Chairman of KAPL told The Hindu.

“We are prepared not only to provide cultivable land of equal value elsewhere in Karaikal for the farmers who are tenants of the Adheenam land, but also see through their economic development through tie-up with international organisations,” Mr. Chowdhury said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/greenfield-airport-at-karaikal-waiting-to-take-wings/article30979514.ece
393,2020/03/04,LIC rolls out new unit-linked plans,"‘Launch of credit cards tied to the PSU’s rapid growth’

LIC has rolled out two new unit-linked plans — Nivesh Plus and SIIP — and opened two new offices in the city.

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, who opened a city sales office for LIC credit cards and a BIMA Connect office on Chetty Street, said that LIC is constantly diversifying its portfolio. This ability of offering new schemes is what makes LIC the dominant player in the insurance market. The public sector undertaking had retained the trust of the public even while maintaining its growth, he said.

Salient features

K. Kadiresan, LIC zonal manager, launching the new plans, explained the the salient features of LIC’s Nivesh Plus plan (UIN 512L317V01) and LIC’s SIIP (UIN 512L334V01). The Nivesh Plus Plan is a single premium, non-participating, unit-linked, individual life insurance plan offering insurance cum investment during the term of the policy. It starts with a minimum ₹1lakh in single premium mode. The sum assured options are 1.25 times the Single Premium or 10 times the Single Premium.

The LIC SIIP is more a regular insurance/investment plan, with minimum premium of ₹40,000 (for yearly mode) with no maximum premium limit. The proposer can choose the amount of premium. Upon the completion of specified policy years, guaranteed additions as a percentage of annualised premium shall be added to the Unit Fund under an in-force policy. The basic sum assured, offered for ages below 55 years, is 10 times annualised premium and, for ages 55 years and above it is 7 times annualised premium.

Mr. Kadiresan said the launch of credit cards was tied to the rapid growth of the PSU’s insurance business, with LIC having 76% market share.

M. Shyam, chief manager, N. Ramakrishnan, LIC senior divisional manager, Vellore and other officials spoke.

394,2020/03/04,A taste of Maloya music and tabla fusion in Puducherry,"Dogo Fara blends protest poetry, jazz, slam and reggae

Reunion Island band Dogo Fara’s recent concert in the city was an embodiment of the French island’s Maloya musical tradition of blending protest poetry, jazz, slam, reggae and dance.

The back-to-back performances on successive days at the Krtashraya gardens of Aurodhan were part of the Tablatronic World Peace tour led by Subhash Dhunoohchand, composer and tabla virtuoso of Indian origin from Mauritius and Dogo Fara from Reunion Island, an isle that lies east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean.

They were performing in the city after sweeping audiences off their feet in Mumbai and Chennai.

The six-piece band Dogo Fara features Anas Mall, Maxence Emprin, Guillaume Imare (Massaï), Farid Aubras, Frédéric Riesser and Loran Trémoulu.

In the tradition of Maloya, one of the two major musical genres of Reunion Island, the band sung in Reunion Creole. Though percussion instruments were mostly used in the past, modern instruments have been added to the ensemble lately to render a new sensibility and contemporary texture.

Music critics compare Maloya to the American blues and jazz. However, unlike the blues, indigenous Maloya music was considered a threat to the French state and banned in the 1970s. The genre has seen a revival over the decades. Since 2009, Maloya has featured in UNESCO’s very select Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

While in Mumbai, the first Hindi phrase the band learnt was “Yeh kaun hain... yeh Dogo Fara hain” before unleashing their music.

“Playing here was special for us as we are very connected with India. We are planning a longer tour next year and will be here again” said Massai, lead singer.

Subhash, an innovative sound artist from France, considers the Tablatronic World Peace project one of the greatest modern explorations of tabla fusion in recent years. “The Tablatronic World Peace tour is an Indian electronic fusion project reflecting my own journey, travelling from India to Europe”, said Subhash, who has collaborated with the likes of Hariprasad Chaurasia, L. Shankar, Budhaditya Mukherjee, Sivamani, Anatholi Bulkin, C. Nardy and Celine Bonacina.

He was a disciple of one of the greatest masters of the Ajrada gharana style of tabla, Pt. Sudhir Kumar Saxena. “Indian music runs in my family. I was lucky to be connected with different genres like jazz, African, western classical and folk music, which hold great influence in my musical composition.”

“I am hoping a whole new chapter of Indian drumming will emerge with this. I take the tabla, electronic drums and other instruments which take the traditional sound of the tabla and place them in the modern setting of electronic music, with additional elements of breakbeat and house music,” he said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/20t8zk/article30976490.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PY26INDOFRENCHMUSICNIGHT6,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/a-taste-of-maloya-music-and-tabla-fusion-in-puducherry/article30976492.ece
395,2020/03/04,Pondicherry University asks students to call off protest,"Shift protest site to Ponlait Students Corner: Registrar

Pondicherry University authorities appealed to the students to call off their strike against fee hike, on since February 6, and cautioned that failure to comply would compel them to disallow agitations within the administrative building precincts.

“If the students insist on continuing the protest, the University would be constrained to disallow such protests within the precincts of the administrative building and to earmark a restricted area for such activities as followed in other Central Universities,” said University Registrar B. Chitra, in a press note.

The Registrar urged students to vacate the building premises and to protest, in a peaceful manner, at the Ponlait Students Corner instead, without causing disturbance to stakeholders of the University.

“We are constrained to inform you that any violation shall be liable for action under the Code of Conduct,” the Registrar said.

The administration understands the need for access to education for all, especially to the marginalised sections of society. Hence, when students sought a reduction in the fee, we immediately worked to decrease it wherever possible.

Moreover, a 20% fee concession is offered by the University to students in need, who are not covered under any scholarship. Several scholarships are provided by the University to meritorious and marginalised students along with other financial aid.

“The core cause of the protest has already been addressed by our University,” the Registrar said.

Chief Secretary Tom Jose has sought the help of the Indian Embassy in Iran to rush assistance to traditional fishers unable to come home from Iran owing to the travel ban imposed in the country owing to massive COVID-19 outbreak.

Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma told the Assembly that Indian embassy officials had promised to provide medical aid, food, and safe drinking water to the 60-odd fishermen. They were processing similar requests from Tamil Nadu and other coastal States.

The Minister was replying to a submission moved by Congress legislator M. Vincent.

He said the fishers were stranded in Azalur province in Iran. Some fishing companies in the country had contacted Kerala fishers to work on their deep-sea fishing vessels.

They had sent messages to their relatives that the outbreak had disrupted their travel plans, and many were confined in cramped rooms with limited access to food and safe drinking water. Some appeared to have been abandoned by their employers and had little knowledge of the local language or custom.

400,2020/03/04,Exam manual reform bid invites wrath,"University rolls back initiative after charges of nepotism, ploy to award marks through illegal means

The University of Kerala has landed itself in yet another controversy after its move to modify its examination manual to expedite the examination process has led to unintended consequences. The university, which had decided to discontinue the practice of permitting multiple revaluations for examinations eight months ago, has rolled back the reform amidst allegations of nepotism and a ploy to award marks through illegal means.

A meeting chaired by Vice Chancellor V.P. Mahadevan Pillai in June last to evolve steps to clear the backlog of LLB examinations apparently paved way for the fallout. It had then been decided to discontinue the practice of facilitating second and third revaluations of answer scripts. The reform was proposed to replace the system of conducting multiple revaluations if the outcome of the first revaluation varied by at least 10% (when compared to the marks obtained after original valuation). The average of the multiple rounds of revaluation used to be considered as the final mark.

Consequences

However, the move gave way to unforeseen consequences after university officials applied the reform to various other courses without due consultations, sources said. It has now emerged that variations, some as high as nearly 40 marks, were effected as the final marks in LLB, BA, and BTech exams.

Sources said mark differences of 20% and more were found in 61 out of 939 answer books of first semester BA examinations.

Similar variations were found in 28 out of 616 answer scripts of the sixth semester BTech examinations (2013 scheme). In view of the situation, the university decided to restore the earlier practice of permitting multiple revaluations with retrospective effect.

However, the fallout has prompted various sections to accuse the university of modifying the norms for the benefit of a certain group before reverting to its original system.

It is also alleged that the university was yet to take steps to nullify the mark lists issued on the basis of the first revaluations.

Reliable sources point out that the decision to limit the number of revaluations was prompted by an incorrect interpretation of a Kerala High Court order.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/exam-manual-reform-bid-invites-wrath/article30976337.ece

With the commissioning of the scheme, people need not depend on tanker lorries and other sources for safe drinking water. Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran commissioned the scheme and the ₹4.98-crore Silent Valley Sunbath Park at a function held at the palace junction.

The sunbath park, on the land owned by Kerala Tourism near the Government Guest House, will facilitate sunbath for holidayers away from the hustle and bustle on the Light House and Eve’s beaches. The project is part of a master plan worked out by the department for the overall development of the beach destination in the next 30 years.

403,2020/03/04,Nari Shakti Puraskar for elderly learners,"Bhageerathi Amma, 105, and Karthyayani Amma, 98, have cleared Class 4 course

After a mention in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s monthly Mann ki Baat programme recently, there is more recognition coming the way of 105-year-old Bhageerathi Amma of Kollam and for her fellow equivalency learner 98-year-old Karthyayani Amma of Alappuzha.

The two women have been selected for the Union government’s Nari Shakti Puraskar, a national award to recognise exceptional work for women empowerment, for the year 2019.

The award will be presented by President Ram Nath Kovind at a function organised by the Ministry of Women and Child Development on March 8.

Bhageerathi Amma, who made news when she became the oldest equivalency course student in the history of the Kerala State Literacy Mission Authority, has completed the Class 4 equivalency course of the mission.

Sharp memory

She had lost her husband in her 30s, following which the responsibility of bringing up six children fell on her. With a sharp memory and good eyesight, she completed the course with the support of her family, particularly her 70-year-old daughter Thankamani and literacy resource persons S.N. Shirley and K.B. Vasanthakumar. The centenarian wants to clear the Class 10 equivalency course.

Karthyayani Amma wondered where she had lost two marks in the Class 4 equivalency examination as part of the literacy mission’s Aksharalaksham scheme. The nonagenarian scored 98 out of 100, bagging the first rank.

She never attended school and eked out a living as a cleaning employee in temples. She was married at 30, widowed early, and raised six children. When a literacy crew went to her colony in January 2018, Karthyayani Amma came forward to enrol for studies.

She had witnessed her 60-year-old daughter Ammini Amma pass a literacy mission course and decided she too wanted to study. For her part, Karthyayani Amma aspires to clear the Class 10 equivalency examinations and acquire computer skills. She was also selected as the Commonwealth of Learning Goodwill Ambassador.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ihh167/article30981561.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tv-Karthyayani-Amma-and-Bhageerathi-Ammaweb,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/nari-shakti-puraskar-for-elderly-learners/article30976312.ece
404,2020/03/04,Managing waste of all kinds,"Non-biodegradable waste to be used as alternative fuel in cement factories

With Clean Kerala Company Ltd. arriving at an understanding recently with cement manufacturers for the handing over of non-recyclable, non-biodegradable waste to be used as alternative fuel in these factories, the city Corporation hopes to address almost all kinds of waste being generated in the city. The Clean Kerala Company had last month signed an agreement with Coimbatore-based ACC Ltd. for collection of non-recyclable plastic waste from all the local bodies in the State.

The city Corporation currently has arrangements for regular collection of recyclable waste at various collection points, from where it is sent to different agencies involved in recycling.

“But, as of now, we do not have an arrangement for collecting old polystyrene foam beds, thermocol, low-value plastics, tetrapacks, and similar materials. All of these materials can be used as alternative fuel in cement factories. The Corporation had two years ago held talks with some cement manufacturers, but we could not arrive at an understanding then. The company had collected segregated waste samples from here and tested in its laboratory, but it did not progress beyond that. Now, once we get a communication from the Clean Kerala Company, we can start collecting these materials too at the material collection facilities,” said a Corporation health official.

As per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines issued in 2017, cement factories are permitted to use such materials as fuel in furnaces. Co-processing of plastic waste as alternative fuel and raw material in cement kilns is considered to be a more environment-friendly and sustainable method for waste disposal, as compared to landfilling and incineration, as emissions are less. The high temperature inside the kilns permits such waste materials to be burned without harmful emissions.

Emission-monitoring

The cement plants are supposed to have a continuous emission-monitoring system to ensure that they are within the permissible limits. The performance evaluation of co-processing of plastic waste was carried out in ACC Ltd.’s plant in Madhya Pradesh. The CPCB in its report found it to be a successful method in waste processing.

In the initial phase, the Clean Kerala Company will be providing 2,000 metric tonnes of non-recyclable, non-biodegradable waste, collected from local bodies across the State. A few local bodies in the State have already made arrangements on their own with cement manufacturers.

“Once this is done, the only waste that remains to be addressed are napkins and diapers, for which we are planning to set up incinerators this year itself,” said the health official.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/managing-waste-of-all-kinds/article30976296.ece
405,2020/03/04,All-party meet on March 16 to discuss Census,"State to cooperate with Census but not with the work related to NPR

The government would call an all-party meeting on March 16 to discuss Census 2021.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said in the Assembly on Tuesday that Kerala would fully cooperate with the Census exercise. But, it would not cooperate with the work related to the drawing up and revision of the National Population Register (NPR).

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had earlier sought clarity from the government on the proposed NPR.

No CAA

Mr. Vijayan also reiterated that the government would not implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). He was rounding up the discussions and voting on Demands for Grants in the 2020-21 Budget.

The Opposition and the ruling front felt people were genuinely apprehensive that the NPR, a biometric roster of citizens, was a precursor to the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The highly controversial NRC was purportedly an extension of the NPR.

The NRC envisaged a taluk registrar of citizen registration to oversee the preparation of the list of “Indian citizens” at the sub-district level to exclude people of “doubtful citizenship” from the safety and welfare net of the State.

Both the Opposition and the ruling front agreed that any move to implement the NPR against the backdrop of the NRC and the CAA would trigger a sense of insecurity among citizens.

The State had informed the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, Union Ministry of Home Affairs, that it could not collaborate with the preparation of the NPR.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/all-party-meet-on-march-16-to-discuss-census/article30976136.ece
406,2020/03/04,Rail users want overnight train from Kumbakonam to Belagavi,"‘It will facilitate movement of pilgrims, especially from northern Karnataka, to temple towns in the region’

Ahead of the release of a new railway timetable in July, the Thanjavur District Rail Users Association has placed a slew of demands and suggestions to the Southern Railway administration for implementation during the schedule revision.

One of them is operation of an overnight express train from Kumbakonam to Belagavi via Thanjavur, Tiruchi, Namakkal, Salem, K.R. Puram and Hubballi. Operation of the new service will provide travellers an additional train to reach Bengaluru from Tiruchi and the delta region.

The new service will be feasible due to heavy movement of pilgrims, especially from northern Karnataka, to temple towns such as Srirangam and Kumbakonam, association advisor A. Giri has said in a representation to the railway administration.

Non-availability of platforms is stated to be the reason for introduction of another train to Bengaluru from the delta region and Tiruchi notwithstanding heavy demand. The new service from Kumbakonam to Belagavi will address the persistent demand for another train to Bengaluru, Mr. Giri said.

In line with the diversion of Train No. 16179/16180 Mannai Express to Chennai via Tiruvarur, which is a shorter route eliminating engine train reversal at Nidamangalam, the Mayiladuthurai – Mysore Express, which is running with full capacity between Tiruchi and Bengaluru, can be diverted to run via Namakkal, the association suggested.

The railway administration can operate a new day-time express train connecting delta region with Palani and Pollachi via Tiruchi. The Rameswaram-Tirupathi expresses (Train No. 16779/16780) may be operated as a daily train since it is well-patronised. By doing so, the arrival time at Tirupathi can be advanced to around 7 a.m.

The railways can explore the feasibility of introducing a day time express train between Karaikal and Tiruchi, leaving Karaikal at 5.30 a.m. and departing from Tiruchi at 6.30 p.m. in the return direction.

The services of the erstwhile Nagore-Kollam Express can be restored to run as Karaikal-Kollam express via Thanjavur, Tiruchi, Madurai, Sengottai and Punalur through a rake-sharing arrangement with Ananthapuri Expresses (Train No. 16723/24). The introduction of the service will fulfil a long-felt demand for direct connectivity to Madurai from Nagore, Nagapattinam and Karaikal.

Chennai Egmore-Velankanni Expresses (Train No. 16185/16186) can be operated with independent rake considering its high level of occupancy and growing demand. At present, the train with only five coaches is being operated as a link train with Kamban Express, the association said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/rail-users-want-overnight-train-from-kumbakonam-to-belagavi/article30984599.ece
407,2020/03/04,Colony residents join hands with police in crime fighting,"They have installed a network of 40 CCTV cameras

The Natarajapuram (South) Colony Residents Welfare Association here has joined hands with the police in stepping up vigilance in the locality by installing a network of 40 CCTV cameras.

The surveillance network covers every nook and corner of the locality comprising 13 streets. The CCTV cameras have been linked to a control room set up in the area.

The surveillance network project in Natarajapuram has been funded by a software company in the area.

Already, CCTV cameras were installed at 160 places across Thanjavur town ahead of the consecration ceremony of Big Temple in February and linked to the Modern Police Control Room.

The CCTVs installed and commissioned at Natarajapuram Colony on Monday will also be linked with the control room within a week or 10 days, said Deputy Superintendent of Police, Thanjavur Town, Ravichandran.

Earlier, the DSP also declared open a police beat centre at the colony.

Dust masks for traffic police personnel deployed at different points in the town, sponsored by the Natarajapuram Residents Welfare Association, was also handed over to the police.

408,2020/03/04,"Not a bumper samba, but increase in area coverage offsets loss of yield","We will achieve production target for Tiruchi district this year: officials

With samba paddy harvest nearing completion, the Agriculture Department is confident of achieving its annual food grain production target for Tiruchi district.

Although it has not been a bumper harvest as expected, the increase in area of cultivation due to opening of Mettur Dam in August and the widespread rainfall will help achieve the annual target set under the food grain mission for the district comfortably this year, department officials say.

The targeted area for coverage, which includes all cereals and pulses, is 1.18 lakh hectares (ha) and the production target is 4.05 lakh tonnes. “We will achieve the targets comfortably this year, thanks to increase in area of coverage due to good flow in the Cauvery and widespread rainfall though the yield in BPT 5024 variety was affected in some pockets of the district due to diseases such as blast and bacterial leaf blight,” says a senior official.

Department sources say that nearly 90% of harvest has been completed and the remaining crop will be harvested within the next 10 days or so. Samba paddy was raised on about 48,000 ha as against last year’s cultivated area of 38,230 ha. The average paddy yield in the district so far is 4,900 kg a ha.

There have been widespread complaints of the yield being affected in BPT 5204 and Akshaya Ponni varieties with some sections of farmers even demanding compensation from the government. Although the Agriculture Department has been discouraging farmers not to go in for the variety over the last five years, as it is susceptible to blast and other diseases, a large number of farmers still opt for it, attracted by the good price that it commands in the open market.

“Farmers get up to ₹1,500 a bag and this is a big attraction for them. But farmers who raised bold varieties such as COR-50 and CR1009 have reported good yield and returns this season as they did not have to spend much on pesticides,” observes a department officer.

However, officials say that not all farmers who raised BPT have suffered losses. In some pockets, there has been a yield drop of up to 50% in areas where farmers did not adopt the recommended crop protection measures.

Farmers who harvested samba crop can go for gingelly or blackgram to get good supplementary income within a short duration, he suggests.

Commenting on the harvest this season, N. Veerasekaran, coordinator, Ayyan Vaical Pasanatharar Sangam, says it has definitely not been a bumper harvest. “But farmers who were able to raise two crops have got some profit. Those who raised BPT and other varieties have reported less than normal yield as the non-seasonal rain extending up to December affected the crop in many places.”

According to the Agriculture Department, the area under millets has been 51,000 ha, the same as last year. Pulses have been raised on about 9,000 ha so far and this is also likely to touch last year’s coverage of 11,000 ha.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/toas63/article30984573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY05-11PADDYHARVESTED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/not-a-bumper-samba-but-increase-in-area-coverage-offsets-loss-of-yield/article30984574.ece
409,2020/03/04,‘Lack of diaphragm chambers clogs sewer lines’,"Tiruchi Corporation has begun survey on apartments that do not have them: Commissioner

Tiruchi Corporation has begun a survey on apartments that do not have diaphragm chambers to filter out non-bio degradable waste getting into underground sewer lines.

The move comes in the wake of frequent burst of sewer lines and manhole leakages in the city recently mainly due to blockage of baby diapers.

Corporation Commissioner S. Sivasubramanian told The Hindu that it had been noticed that indiscriminate dumping of soiled diapers in toilet closet was among the reasons for malfunctioning of underground sewer lines. Though most of the users were aware that diapers were not to be flushed in toilet closets, a section of them continue to do so.

Citing a field report by underground drainage workers, Mr. Sivasubramanian said obstruction of diapers was the main cause of sewer line burst and leakages. It had also been noticed that several apartments in the city had not set up diaphragm chambers to filter out non-degradable waste getting into underground drainage lines.

Hence, officials of Srirangam, K. Abishekapuram, Golden rock and Ariyamangalam zones had been asked to carry out a survey on apartments, who did not have diaphragm chambers, in their respective zones. The survey would be completed within 10 days.

The Commissioner said that notices would be sent to the apartments, who had failed to set up diaphragm chamber facility. They would be asked to create the facility immediately. If they failed to provide the facility within a time frame, the apartments would be penalised.

Mr. Sivasubramanian said that an awareness campaign would be organised to create awareness of the dangers of ill-advised dumping of non-degradable waste.

Residents in the particular apartment would be sensitised. They would be shown methods of safe disposal of waste.

Stating that non-defrocked waste constituted about 5% of waste generated in the city, he said the Corporation had sent notices to companies, producing and marketing of diapers, seeking them to help the civic body to dispose them safely.

As per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, the companies had to shoulder the responsibility of disposing the plastic wrappers on products and diapers safely.

The Corporation was waiting for their reply, Mr. Sivasubramanian added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/lack-of-diaphragm-chambers-clogs-sewer-lines/article30984555.ece
410,2020/03/04,Officials detect rotten fish during raid at Tiruchi market,"Officials of the Departments of Fisheries and Food Safety and Drugs Administration on Wednesday conducted checks at Puthur fish market in the city.

Led by R. Sharmila, Deputy Director, Fisheries, the team of officials inspected stalls to ascertain the quality and freshness of the fish sold at the market.

They zeroed in on a few vendors selling spoiled fish by mixing it with fresh ones.

The fish sold at the market comes from the sea near Nagapattinam, the Cauvery and other small water bodies near Tiruchi.

Ms. Sharmila instructed the vendors to sell quality fish to customers as rotten fish could cause several health complications including vomiting and diarrhoea. She also instructed them to keep the stalls clean to avoid contamination.

She asked the vendors to check the quality and freshness of the fish before buying them.

Fresh fish would not smell foul.

Its eyes would be shiny and the flesh red, especially under the gills, Ms. Sharmila told them.

The flesh of spoilt fish would be pink in colour and the eyes dull. “This is an easy way to spot the difference,” she added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/1xztwv/article30987776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY05-RAID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/officials-detect-rotten-fish-during-raid-at-tiruchi-market/article30984518.ece
411,2020/03/04,Kendriya Vidyalaya awaits fund allocation for permanent campus,"School inundated with applications for admission

There is no indication of the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) releasing funds for establishing a permanent campus for Kendriya Vidyalaya GOC (SR) at Ponmalai, Tiruchi.

The school was started with a primary section during 2016-17 academic session.

Despite the huge demand for admission to class I, the intake is limited to 40 as the accommodation capacity is limited in the temporary facility.

Last year, there were over 800 applications for the limited seats, and this time around, there are already indications that the number will be far more, according to an official source.

The temporary building encompasses eight classrooms, one room for principal, an office room, a staff common room and a computer lab. There are about 20 full-time teachers catering to a student strength of over 420.

According to official sources, the building has been in the planning stage under the purview of the Central Public Works Department for close to two years.

The KVS is awaiting budgetary allocation to release funds for construction of the new building on the five-acre site provided by the railways free of cost.

The school will be in a position to double the student strength only after moving to the permanent campus, sources said.

Meanwhile, online registration for class I admissions in Kendriya Vidyalayas that take place during March every year is expected to commence shortly.

Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan has intimated to the schools that in view of increasing queries regarding announcement of admission schedule for the academic session 20-21, some essential changes/modifications in KVS admission guidelines are underway.

Modifications

The admission process should be started only after such changes/modifications are effected in the guidelines. The Deputy Commissioners in all regional offices have been instructed to direct the principals under their respective jurisdiction to wait till further orders, a circular issued on Tuesday said.

As in institutions of higher learning under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, the Central Government will be implementing EWS (Economically Weaker Section) quota in the Kendriya Vidyalayas with effect from 2020-21 academic session, the sources said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/kendriya-vidyalaya-awaits-fund-allocation-for-permanent-campus/article30984503.ece
412,2020/03/04,Chennai ICF opens window of opportunity for fabrication sector,"Heavy engineering industries in Tiruchi region, which are going through a rough patch due to shrinkage in orders from BHEL, have been sounded out on business opportunities at Integral Coach Factory (ICF), Chennai, particularly in the areas of forging and machining.

At a session on ‘Business opportunities at ICF, Chennai,’ organised on Wednesday by Confederation of Indian Industry, Tiruchi Zone, ICF Senior Materials Manager S. Jayaprakash apprised prospective vendors of the tender process to supply components.

The requirement for vendors was on the rise for ICF and huge opportunities awaited the fabrication sector in Tiruchi, he said and urged them to actively participate in the tender process.

Vendors in Tiruchi could derive advantage from the proximity to Chennai over those in places such as Kolkatta and Pune from the second year onwards. In the first year, only 20% of development orders out of the net procured quantity would be sourced from the new vendors, he said.

A long-time partnership would be to the betterment of vendors in Tiruchi due to the reputation of ICF, Chennai, for making prompt payments.

The vendors in Tiruchi could gain valuable insights by participating in the mega-vendor meet to be hosted by ICF, Chennai, on March 11, Mr. Jayaprakash said.

Unlike in the case of BHEL for which the vendors carried out conversion, in the case of ICF, they would have to procure the materials themselves. For this, the prospective vendors could tap the utility of the Raw Material Assistance Scheme of National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC).

Under the scheme, NSIC provided financial assistance for procurement of quality raw materials at a low cost to MSME sector so that the industries could concentrate on manufacturing quality products. MSMEs could utilise economies of scale and avail cash discount or bulk purchase discounts. NSIC took care of all procedures and documentation, he added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/chennai-icf-opens-window-of-opportunity-for-fabrication-sector/article30984490.ece

Students of Cauvery College for Women in Tiruchi donated their hair for cancer patients on Wednesday, as part of a month-long observation of World Cancer Day.

Over 2,000 students sat in rows as haidressers from Green Trends, a salon chain, cut small locks of hair as part of ‘Shair’, a hair donation initiative. The students received an appreciation certificate for their donation from the organisers.

“Every year, we organise a donation campaign within our salon from February 4 to March 4. Customers who visit to have their hair cut choose to donate it. This year, however, we decided to approach college students solely for this purpose,” a representative of Green Trends said.

Students could choose to donate one small lock of hair or cut a sizeable length. . “It is their choice, we do not force them,” the representative said.

R. Preethi, a third-year B.Com student said that she made a spontaneous decision to shorten her hair. “My parents may not like but it is for a good cause, so they will understand,” she said, as she fastened her hair to be cut.

417,2020/03/04,"Residents to hit the streets, again","Growing delay in land acquisition for service lane project has left them fuming

The residents are ready to hit the streets again. And the reason for their ire is not far to seek.

It is more than four months since the Madras High Court directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to take expeditious steps to build service lanes along a 14-km stretch between Thuvakudi and Palpannai on Tiruchi-Thanjavur National Highway.

The court also ordered NHAI to proceed with land acquisition for the project and expressed hope that the service road would be laid within six months. But the process has hardly taken off.

Now, the Federation for Retrieval of Tiruchi-Palpannai-Thuvakudi Service Roads has announced that its members will stage a demonstration in front of the Collector’s Office in the city on March 9. The fecderation, which represents various residents’ associations on the stretch, has staged a series of agitations on the issue in the past.

The decision to take to the streets was taken at a meeting held on Sunday, according to S. Subramaniyan and S. Sakthivel, organisers.

“The demonstration is only the first of a series of protests to highlight our plight,” Mr. Sakthivel warns. “If official action is not forthcoming, we plan to organise rallies and stage other forms of protest.”

The federation also plans to mobilise support from other residents’ welfare associations in Tiruchi.

Four months have gone by, and the disappointment over lack of progress in land acquisition runs deep among federation members. They point to the court’s remarks during disposal of a batch of petitions on the matter: “Considering the fact that the matter has unnecessarily dragged on from 2014, which in our considered opinion, without any valid cause, it is a high time for the NHAI to take expeditious steps to complete the above exercise and we hope and trust that the service road will be formed within a period of six months from today (October 15, 2019).”

But the authorities took more than three months even to appoint a new Special District Revenue Officer (Land Acquisition) for the project, Mr. Sakthivel argues.

“The office of Special DRO and NHAI officials keep saying that the land acquisition will be completed soon. But with each passing month, more accidents are taking place due to absence of the service lanes,” he says.

Accidents

Over 6,000 accidents have taken place over the last decade due to absence of service lanes, leading to the loss of several lives, the federation rues.

The court has accepted the opinion of the Chief Engineer, Construction and Maintenance, State Highways Department, that the width of service lanes can be 45 metres on normal stretches, 60 metres at five locations where vehicular underpass or foot overbridges are to be constructed and 50 metres on 10 other locations where bus bays are to be built.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami is aware of the issue, as he held out an assurance in the Assembly that the land acquisition process will be taken up based on the final order of the court, Mr. Sakthivel contends.

“We only hope that the officials will take note of the CM’s assurance and expedite the land acquisition process now that all legal impediments are cleared and pave the way for construction of the service lanes,” he adds.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/x19kss/article30979531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY04-ROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/residents-to-hit-the-streets-again/article30979532.ece

In order to ensure the quality of food served to devotees and offering to deities, the Tamil Nadu Food Safety and Drug Administration Department has asked the administrations of Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam and Mariamman Temple in Samayapuram to get Blissful Hygiene Offering to God (BHOG) certificates issued by Food Safety and Standards Authority of India.

While the department is keen on implementing the concept in all Hindu Religious and Charitable Temples, where an annadhanam scheme is in place, it has chosen Ranganathaswamy and Mariamman temples initially in Tiruchi district.

While Ranganathaswamy temple offers annadhanam to devotees from 8 a.m. to 10 p,m, Mariamman temple runs the annadhanam scheme for a limited time during the day.

R. Chithra, Designated Officer, Tamil Nadu Food Safety and Drug Administration Department, Tiruchi, told The Hindu that both temples had taken a lead role in providing annadhanam to hundreds of devotees, who visit the temples in large numbers

. Irrespective of the economic background and age groups, the devotees receive prasadam after it is offered to the deities, and take part in the common feast (annadhanam) arranged in the temples.

Hence, as a precautionary measure and to maintain a high level of hygiene, the temple administrations have been asked to get BHOG certificates through the department.

Prior to issuing the certificates, the department will conduct a food safety audit in the kitchens of the temples to test the quality of water, oil and other ingredients.

A third party agency will be involved in the process. Besides checking the quality of ingredients used to prepare the food items, the infrastructure for cooking willalso be checked.

Upon completion of the process the Tamil Nadu Food Safety and Drug Administration Department will issue certificates to the temples. The certificates, besides ensuring quality of food, will also enable the temples to set the standard for other temples to follow the “eat right” principles .",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/k7g7r8/article30979477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY04-FOOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/get-hygiene-certificate-food-safety-depttells-samayapuram-srirangam-temples/article30979478.ece

Minister for Revenue Pilli Subhash Chandrabose and Minister for Housing Cherukuvada Sri Ranganatha Raju have directed the district officials to complete the land acquisition process and development of layouts as early as possible.

They said here on Tuesday that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was keen on distribution of house sites on Ugadi as promised earlier. Both Ministers visited Gunkalam layout near Vizianagaram and later reviewed the progress of work.

Mr. Chandrabose said that the government’s proposal to distribute land to 25 lakh families was historic and it was also being done even before completion of one year tenure of the YSRCP government. He lso directed the officials to respond quickly to the petitions with regard to land records.

The Revenue Minister said that updating of records was a must since thousands of farmers were moving around revenue offices for correction of records.

420,2020/03/04,"YSRCP has done little to sort out issues, says TDP leader","‘It did not bother to file a caveat in apex court’

TDP leader Bandaru Satyanarayana Murthy on Tuesday alleged that the YSRCP did not do enough to sort out the issues pertaining to the quota allocated for local body elections.

“The YSRCP government knew from the beginning that the proposal for having 59.85% reservation will be rejected by the High Court. But, it did not bother to file a caveat in the Supreme Court,” Mr. Satyanarayana Murthy told the media here on Tuesday.

Socio-economic audit

According to him, BCs, SCs and STs constitute 60% of the State’s population. “The government should have done a socio-economic audit and submitted it to the Supreme Court as it was done by the Tamil Nadu government,” said Mr. Satyanarayana Murthy.

The Supreme Court earlier fixed the quota for reservation at 50%, but based on a socio-economic audit report, things can be changed. “However, the YSRCP government knowingly ignored this factor. The local body election can be delayed. The government can still approach the Supreme Court to get it cleared, said the TDP leader.

Former TDP MLA Palla Srinivasa Rao alleged that the 59.85% reservation was challenged by people from the YSRCP and when it came to the court for hearing, they did not bother to file a proper counter.

‘GO an eyewash’

“This indicates that the YSRCP is not serious about the issue. The GO on reservation higher than 50% was an eyewash,” he said.

Criticising the State government for not doing enough for the development of BCs, Mr. Satyanarayana Murthy alleged that funds of ₹14,000 crore allotted to the BC community had been diverted to other welfare schemes.

“Nine months have passed after the YSRCP assumed the power. However, no fund from the BC Sub-plan has been released,” added Mr. Satyanarayana Murthy.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/4aogka/article30978689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VZ3TDPLEADERANDFORMERMINISTERBANDARUSATYANARAYANAMURTHY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/ysrcp-has-done-little-to-sort-out-issues-says-tdp-leader/article30976814.ece
421,2020/03/04,"Excessive honking will cause hearing loss, warns doctor","‘Prolonged use of earphones should also be avoided’

People living in areas like Asilmetta Junction, Jagadamba Junction and Dwaraka Nagar are at the risk of suffering hearing loss as noise levels routinely go beyond 125 decibels (dB) during peak traffic, according to a study done here some time ago.

Traffic constables and people working at roadside shops in these areas were found to have suffered hearing loss.

Prolonged usage of earphones, exposure to sources of high noise such as loudspeakers, and working in noise-generating industries without adequate ear protection also lead to hearing loss, said Bandaru Ramachandra Rao, associate professor at Government ENT Hospital.

“Chronic exposure to noise induces progressive deafness. A general increase in the number of cases of noise-induced deafness is seen both at the Outpatient wards of Government ENT Hospital as also at private hospitals. On the contrary, hearing problems due to hereditary causes are on the decline due to growing awareness on the health problems associated with marriages between close relations,” Dr. Ramachandra Rao told The Hindu.

Dr. Ramachandra Rao advocated awareness among schoolchildren on the dangers of using earphones for prolonged durations, and also called for curbs against excessive honking on roads which is a major contributor to high noise levels as well as stress and anxiety.

“The human ear has a self-cleansing mechanism and there is no need to use matchsticks or even ear-buds to clean the ears. In fact, there is a danger of the ear drum getting ruptured by doing so. Similarly, pouring oil or other liquids into the ear can aggravate ear infections,” he said.

“We are also seeing a rise in the number of call centre employees reporting problems like tinnitus (ringing sensation in the ears) and loss of hearing,” he said.

Timely intervention

“A child born with hearing loss is often misunderstood and has to face an unsympathetic attitude even from family members. A child with hearing loss cannot develop speech and language abilities. This hinders the growth of the child,” said Dr. K. Sai Balarama Krishna, HoD and consultant ENT surgeon of KIMS ICON Hospital.

“Screening of newborn children is important for early detection. Treatment can help restore hearing. The best age for cochlear implants is between two and five years of age,” he said.

An awareness rally was organised jointly by the Government ENT Hospital and North Andhra ENT Doctors Association on the occasion of World Hearing Day on Beach Road on Tuesday.

422,2020/03/04,Two minor girls ‘gang-raped’ in Vizag Agency,"Search launched to trace the accused, say police

Two minor girls aged 14 and 17 years were allegedly gang-raped by five persons in Sunkarametta area under Araku police station limits of Visakhapatnam district on Monday late night.

The incident came to light after the parents of the girls lodged police complaints.

According to Araku police Circle Inspector P. Pydayya, the incident reportedly occurred between 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Monday when the minor girls, both residents of Sunkarametta area, were going to attend the call of nature.

“Two youth, who are known to the girls, allegedly came by a car and asked them if they would like to visit Araku Utsav. Unaware that the Utsav concluded on March 1, the girls boarded the car. The two youth were joined by three others en route. They allegedly took the girls to an isolated area and raped them,” said Mr. Pydayya while quoting from the complaints lodged by the parents of the victims.

Accused absconding

Police said that a local person who was going in that way noticed the car parked in the isolated place.

When the girls raised alarm, the local resident ran to the spot. Seeing him coming, the youth reportedly fled the scene, the police said.

“The accused are absconding. A search has already been launched to trace the accused. The victims have been sent to King George Hospital (KGH) for medical examination,” added the Circle Inspector.

423,2020/03/04,‘Govt. will stick to 50% quota for local body polls’,"We do not have enough time to approach the Supreme Court, says Deputy Chief Minister

A day after the High Court struck down the GO allowing 59.85% reservation for BCs, SCs, and STs in the local body elections, Deputy Chief Minister Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose on Tuesday said that the government would stick to the 50% cap on the quota as per the court directive.

In a GO issued in January, the State government fixed 59.85% as the share of reservation—34% for backward classes (BCs), 19.08% for SCs, and 6.77% for STs.

On Monday, the High Court struck down the GO, rejecting the government’s contention that the State was entitled to coss the 50% mark in reservation and that the Supreme Court’s earlier ruling did not constitute a comple bar to exceeding 50%.

“It is not the case that we can not move to the court to press our demand for the 59.85% reservation. As the time is short, we will proceed with the 50% quota, abiding by the Supreme Court guidelines,” Mr. Bose told the media here.

However, the Deputy Chief Minister was critical of the TDP’s statement that the YSRCP had not handled the issue well and should have moved the Supreme Court.

Dig at Naidu

“At least, we are moving forward to conduct the local body elections, but TDP president N. Chandrbabu Naidu did not even think of holding the elections in his five-year tenure. Instead of announcing the polls, it was Mr. Naidu who started the Special Officer concept for the local bodies,” he said.

Coming down heavily on the TDP, Mr. Bose said that the party was spreading rumour that B. Pratap Reddy who filed the writ petition in Supreme Court against the GO was a member of the YSRCP.

“In fact, Mr. Pratap Reddy is a close associate of the TDP. The Telugu Desam is using his ‘Reddy’ surname to defame the YSRCP. Playing politics with castes has been the hallmark of Mr. Naidu,” said Mr. Bose.

Patta distribution

He further alleged that the TDP was anti BCs and Dalits. “Why did the TDP move court when we wanted to give away 2,500 pattas to BCs in the CRDA region. This tells it all about their mindset. Now, the TDP is trying to project the YSRCP is working against the interest of BCs and Dalits,” added Mr. Bose.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/or5god/article30976373.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VZ3DEPUTYCMANDREVENUEMINISTERPILLISUBASHCHANDRABOSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/govt-will-stick-to-50-quota-for-local-body-polls/article30976374.ece
424,2020/03/04,"How many countries allow abortion on request, where is abortion completely prohibited, and more","At least 26 countries do not permit abortion under any circumstance

Argentinian President Alberto Fernandez is planning to introduce a Bill which proposes to legalise abortion in the country. If approved, it will be a significant breakthrough for abortion laws in Latin America, which, together with the Caribbean, is home to at least five of the 26 countries globally where abortion is not permitted under any circumstance.

The map below depicts the legal status of abortion across countries, based on five broad categories:

image/svg+xml

The categories are:

image/svg+xml

Category 1: Prohibited altogether

The laws of some countries do not permit abortion under any circumstance, including when the woman's life or health is at risk. About nine crore (5%) women of reproductive age in live in 26 countries that prohibit abortion altogether.

Category 2: To save a woman's life

The laws of some countries permit abortion when the woman's life is at risk.

Also read: Reproductive rights of women are not up for negotiation: Gita Sen

About 35.9 crore (22%) women of reproductive age live in 39 countries that allow abortion to save the woman's life.

Category 3: To preserve health

The laws of as many as 56 countries permit abortion on the basis of health or therapeutic grounds. 23.7 crore (14%) of women of reproductive age live in 56 countries in this category.

Also read: Comment | Seeking a more progressive abortion law

Argentina currently belongs to this category. If the latest Bill gets approved, the country may move to a higher category.

Category 4: Broad social or economic grounds

Apart from health, some countries consider a woman's social or economic circumstances too to permit abortion under a broad range of circumstances. About 38.6 crore people or 23% of women of reproductive age live in 14 countries that fall under this category.

India is among the countries that fall under category 4. The Cabinet has recently approved the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 (MTP Bill, 2020).

According to the MTP Act, for foetuses aged up to 12 weeks, only one medical practitioner's opinion that the continuance of the pregnancy would involve a risk to the life of the pregnant woman or would pose a grave injury to the woman's physical or mental health, or there is a substantial risk that if the child is born, it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.

If the foetus is aged between 12 and 20 weeks, the opinions of two medical practitioners that either of the two conditions holds true are required.

A Bill seeking to increase the gestation limit (for rape survivors, victims of incest and minors) was introduced in the Lok Sabha on March 2.

Category 5: On request (gestational limits vary)

59 crore (36%) women of reproductive age live in countries that allow abortion on request. 67 countries globally fall within this category.



The most common gestational limit for countries in this category is 12 weeks. Gestational limits are calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period, which is considered to occur two weeks prior to conception. Where laws specify that gestational age limits are calculated from the date of conception, these limits have been extended by two weeks.

425,2020/03/04,Kandukuri Ramesh Babu’s frames evoke emotions,"Photographer Kandukuri Ramesh Babu trains his camera on stray animals to tell their stories

Photographer Kandukuri Ramesh Babu has been capturing street life of Hyderabad, telling stories of ordinary people. What came as a surprise to him were the many stray animals that appeared in his frames. He has a collection of around 5000 photos of street dogs in different poses and moods, and a small part of it was displayed in an exhibition titled ‘Portraiture of Compassion’ at Goethe Zentrum recently. He says, “I never planned to take canine photos; I was photographing people and also captured these animals unintentionally.”

Portraits of compassion

Ramesh calls the dogs on the street the portraits of compassion. His frames do not show them as a symbol of poverty, desolation or less privileged. Glimpses of a dog yawning, staring into the camera or a pup having a quiet moment with its mother, form his collection. “When we say a street dog, it feels humiliating and looking down on these dogs. They have grace, compassion and are loving in nature. Even when they are hungry, they will wait near the doors of a house but will not barge in. They bark, bite, yawn, mate in an open space and quarrel and ponder. These actions are emotional and almost humane. I treat them as my neighbours or fellow beings.”

A photograph by Kandukuri Ramesh Babu | Photo Credit: By arrangement

Ramesh shares two incidents that helped him in this project.

During his days as a reporter, he had interacted with a woman, Aslam Shareefa. “She was married thrice and her fourth husband was in a critical condition and the house owner had asked her to move out. The husband died and there was no one beside her to share her sorrow. But a street dog stayed with her. We don’t really need a human being to be with us in such moments of pain,” he shares.

He also mentions a story by Russian novelist Ivan Turgenav that stayed with him about a worker and his pet dog. “An employee admonishes her worker and orders him to kill his pet. Even when the worker is about to kill it near a river, the pet looks at its master helplessly. Even then it has only love for its master.”

There is no human element in the photographs at this exhibition. “I don’t see a difference between human beings and them. They feel the same emotions and I see humanity in them,” he adds.

There is also the fear that people experience while walking on streets as dogs get aggressive during nights. “The problem arises when we we look at them as street dogs,” says Ramesh revealing he took injections as he was bit by them twice. “I too used to be scared and irritated with them. But now with my changed perspective, I consider them as human beings.” He says, “The animal too owns the street and problem arises when man considers it his own domain. Cows and dogs are like scavengers doing their work on street. Also, the way we (read human beings) shout and scream at family members, they also get into barking mood. There’s also this saying, barking dog doesn’t bite,” he says.

Owning the street

A photograph of a pair of two dogs standing guard on a street was taken at Parsigutta. He informs, “In the role of a watchdog, the animals bark when they see an an outsider.”

Actor and Blue Cross founder Amala Akkineni, who was the chief guest had pointed out the importance of canine sterilisation. “She told us that in the 27 pictures, only one canine was sterilised, and if a stray dog is not sterilised, it can have even 2000 puppies in its lifetime.

“As a precautionary measure, we have suggested that his team members get health tests done immediately. Our Noida and Gurgaon offices will be shut for two days. We have also advised all our colleagues to work from home for a couple of days, while we get our offices sanitised. However, there will not be any impact on our daily operations and Paytm services will continue as usual,” the company said.

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said six family members of the 45-year-old Delhi patient had tested positive.

Coronavirus broke out in China’s Wuhan city in December and has spread to over 60 countries, killing more than 3,000 and infecting nearly 90,000.

“India, with a significant rise in COVID-19 cases, will start universal screening at all international airports and sea-ports through the use of thermal imagery equipment as well as mandatory filling of declaration forms of places visited by tourists and travellers returning from abroad. All passengers of international flights will now have to undergo screening, and not just from the 12 countries listed earlier,” he said.

The Minister said the government would open a laboratory in Iran so that Indians there could be tested for a possible exposure to coronavirus before being brought back. An estimated 1,200 Indians, mostly students and pilgrims, are now in Iran. “If the Iranian government lends its support, a testing facility could be set up there as well, so that Indians there can be tested before they can be brought back.”

Dr. Vardhan held a meeting with Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain and civic body officials on Wednesday and urged them to augment the facilities at isolation wards in city hospitals, if needed. “Currently, we have 15 laboratories in India which are conducting tests for coronavirus, 19 more laboratories are being established,” he said.

China isolated the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) from a patient and shared the first whole genome sequence data of the virus with the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) on January 11. This allowed scientists from across the world to study the genome data to know more about the virus origin and develop diagnostics.

As on March 4, 23 countries, including Nepal, Vietnam and Cambodia, have shared 159 genome sequence data. At 65, China has deposited the most number of genome sequences followed by the U.S. (16), Australia (10), Japan (9) and Singapore and South Korea (eight sequences each).

However, till date, India has not shared even one genome sequence data. The first COVID-19 patient in India, a medical student who had returned from Wuhan, was confirmed on January 30 by the Pune-based national Institute of Virology (NIV). Two more adults from Kerala too had tested positive students and were laboratory confirmed by NIV about a month back.

Even in 2015 H1N1 outbreak when 42,592 cases and 2,990 deaths were reported from India, the full genome sequence data was not shared with the WHO reference laboratories or deposited in public databases.

“Virus genome sequencing is transforming epidemiological investigations, as we are seeing in real-time with the novel coronavirus outbreak. Sequencing provides a platform to rapidly identify unknown or unexpected pathogens, identify the origins of an outbreak, and track transmission patterns,” Dr. Nathan Grubaug, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology (Microbial Diseases) at Yale School of Public Health says in a release.

“Sequencing the genome of novel coronavirus will help us to know where the virus came from and how the virus has spread. For instance, by sequencing the genome of the virus isolated from an Indian patient, it will become possible to know if the virus had come from China or any other country,” says Gautam Menon, professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, Sonepat, Haryana and the Chennai-based Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

According to Prof. Menon, genome sequencing will help in tracing contacts and give a clear picture of whether the virus has undergone mutations to make it more virulent or less.

“India has only to gain and nothing to lose by sharing the sequence data. In a rapidly evolving pandemic-like situation, it is imperative that nations share genome sequence data quickly and to the fullest,” Prof. Menon says.

“Without sequencing the genome of the virus we won’t know where the virus came from. The European clade [for instance] is developing, which is distinctly different from China,” says Dr. Shahid Jameel, CEO of the Wellcome Trust/DBT India Alliance.

Contrary to the general notion that COVID-19 has lower death rate compared with influenza (commonly called as seasonal flu), COVID-19 has globally caused more than three times the number of deaths in reported cases than influenza.

Across the world, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died compared with generally “far fewer than 1% of those infected” with influenza, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a press briefing on March 3.

As on March 4, the number of confirmed cases globally is 93,136 and 3,198 deaths. The total number of cases reported from mainland China is 80,151 and 2,943 deaths. With 4,812 cases (28 deaths), the case load in South Korea is the highest outside China. At 79, Italy has reported the most number of deaths outside China, and is closely followed by Iran with 77 deaths.

The reason why COVID-19 causes more deaths compared with influenza is because COVID-19 “causes more severe disease than seasonal influenza”, the WHO chief said. Also, due to its recurrence every year, people have built some level of immunity against seasonal influenza, which is not the case with the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and hence more people are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In the case of China, as on February 20, the case fatality ratio (ratio of deaths from a disease to the total number of diagnosed cases) was 3.8% — 2,114 deaths in 55,924 confirmed cases. The case fatality ratio was high for Wuhan (5.8%) and low for the rest of mainland China (0.7%).

In China, the mortality varied in people based on age and underlying conditions. The highest mortality of 21.9% was seen among people over 80 years of age, while among retired patients but less than 80 years the mortality was 8.9%.

Patients who did not have any underlying conditions were less likely to die (1.4%) than people with comorbid conditions – cardiovascular disease (13.2%), diabetes (9.2%), hypertension (8.4%), chronic respiratory disease (8%) and cancer (7.6%).

The WHO chief underlined that transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is less compared with influenza though both SARS-CoV-2 and influenza spread through small fluid droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes. While people infected with influenza but not yet sick are major drivers of transmission, that does not appear to be the case for COVID-19.

“Evidence from China is that only 1% of reported cases do not have symptoms, and most of those cases develop symptoms within two days,” the WHO chief said.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/d6yleq/article30979143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THWHO,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/covid-19-has-caused-more-deaths-than-influenza-who-chief/article30979159.ece
