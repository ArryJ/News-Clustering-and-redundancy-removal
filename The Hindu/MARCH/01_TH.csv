0,2020/03/01,Reaching out to Akka-Thayis,"Police launch initiative to help women in unorganised sector

The south division police have launched an initiative called ‘Akka-Thayi’ (sister and mother) to reach out to working women in the unorganised sector who are more at risk of abuse and harassment because of the nature of their jobs.

“There are thousands of women in workforce in the garment industry and other unorganised sectors. Many silently suffer owing to the lack of support and help. Akka-Thayi is aimed at helping them resolve their problems and empowering them,” said Rohini Katoch Sepat, DCP (south division).

As part of the initiative, which was launched on Friday, the police visit factories and places and hold meetings with the women. The first interactive session was held at Kumaraswamy Layout with employees of two garment factories. “Many women hesitate to file complaints, so we installed mobile complaint boxes and distributed papers to them. We asked them to write down their concerns and put it in the box,” Ms. Rohini said.

One of the key problems that the women wanted addressed was their commute to work and areas along their route that are not well lit. The police have identified dark spots and are working with the BBMP and the BMTC officials to provide necessary infrastructure. “We are helping the women to reclaim the space,” said Ms. Rohini.

Within an hour, the police received four complaints, which included cases of harassment and safety while travelling. Many women take the metro at Yelachenahalli station but the area is poorly lit. A day after receiving the complaints, police personnel were directed to take action. “Beat policemen have been directed to patrol the area around the station regularly,” said a police officer.

WhatsApp groups

The police intend for Akka-Thayi to be a long-term initiative. Women police personnel at the jurisdictional area have been asked to start a WhatsApp group for employees as part of a series of confidence-building measures.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/reaching-out-to-akka-thayis/article30958554.ece
1,2020/03/01,Day passes for BIFFes to be issued from today,"Pass for the remaining three days of the festival costs ₹300 and for a single day, it is priced at ₹100

Film enthusiasts who were unable to get season passes for the Bengaluru International Film Festival (BIFFes) will be able to attend the event on the last three days. BIFFes will issue day passes from Monday at Orion Mall.

“We have always desisted from issuing day passes till the weekend is over. This year too, we are following the same principle,” said N. Vidyashankar, creative director, BIFFes.

A pass for the remaining three days of the festival, scheduled to end on Wednesday, costs ₹300 and a pass for a single day is priced at ₹100. Sunday recorded the highest footfall since the festival began with almost all shows running at full capacity. “There were 3,000-odd seats at the venue, but the number of attendees seemed to exceed the capacity. Many people had to skip a show to stand in line for the next screening,” said one of the organisers. Oscar-winner Parasite and Pedro Almodovar’s Pain and Glory were the crowd-pullers.

People were queuing up to see films two hours before their scheduled screenings. To help manage the crowds, for the first time, BIFFes issued tokens to people in queues an hour before the screening. This was to ensure others didn’t try to get into the line midway. “The token system was a good idea as people need not stand in line for hours and return disappointed,” said Chidambara, an attendee who was hoping to get a token for Parasite.

National anthem back

The national anthem was played at the beginning of every screening at BIFFes on Sunday. Though the festival began last week, the practice is no longer being followed as PVR Cinemas has discontinued it.

However, Suneel Puranik, chairperson, Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy, the organiser of the festival, wrote to PVR Cinemas to play the national anthem before every screening. “I know the Supreme Court has held it is not mandatory. But just because it is not mandatory, we need not discontinue the good practice of paying our respect to the country. So I requested the venue partner to play the anthem,” said Mr. Puranik.

However, the reintroduction of the national anthem has not gone down well with many delegates. “Playing the national anthem at every screening five to six times a day only makes it a farce. Why should we prove our patriotism at a film screening? This is an imposition,” said Prasanna L., a film enthusiast.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/5puw9b/article30958539.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGBIFFES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/day-passes-for-biffes-to-be-issued-from-today/article30958542.ece
2,2020/03/01,Revived Puttenahalli lake under threat from raw sewage,"Untreated waste from two areas in the vicinity started entering lake last year; BBMP says BWSSB will start work on pipe to divert sewage today

On one end of the lake, there is a large machine for digging and moving earth, besides workers from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) cleaning and dewatering the lake. On the opposite side, a steady stream of sewage is entering the water body. The quantity and speed is the highest in the morning, say caretakers of the lake.

Often touted as one of the best examples of what a citizen-led movement can achieve, Puttenahalli lake is today threatened by a steady stream of untreated sewage.

The caretakers say raw discharge from two areas in the vicinity started entering the lake last year. “Earlier, sewage from Aradhana Layout used to flow in, but it was stopped. But sewage from Nataraja Layout continues to enter the lake, even when efforts are on to dewater the lake for rejuvenation,” said a caretaker.

According to the Puttenahalli Neighbourhood Lake Improvement Trust (PNLIT), the lake has a recorded area of 13 acres 25 guntas with a perimeter of 1.1 km and is a rain-fed lake with no other water source.

Bird habitat

The PNLIT, the citizens group that took up responsibility of bringing the lake back to life, aimed not only to make it a “clean-looking water body”, but also “nurturing it into a habitat for birds”.

In July 2008, the water level receded because of the dysfunction of the inlets, groundwater depletion and encroachments. In August 2009, the BBMP fenced the lake, and from February 2010, rejuvenation work began. In 2011, the BBMP signed an MoU with PNLIT, handing over the maintenance of the lake to the trust.

“Within a year of its restoration, Puttenahalli Lake gained recognition as an avian habitat with over 50 species of birds spotted in and around the lake. We estimate that by 2017, the habitat at Puttenahalli lake should have stabilised. The lake will then be on ‘maintain mode’ and should not need continuous infusion of funds for its sustenance,” the PNLIT website says.

However, residents around the lake said the continuous flow of raw sewage is threatening to undo the work that went into making the lake a model for others to follow. According to a resident who requested to be anonymous, in June 2019, the residents of Nataraja Layout got fed up of the underground drain constantly overflowing onto the road. “They opened up the drain to direct the sewage into the lake. Raw sewage began to gush into the wetland. We raised a red alert with the authorities. The BWSSB told us they completed the procedure to replace the drain with a bigger one, and issued a work contract. However, this has been stalled because of the underground drain from Nataraja Layout enters the lake premises below the walking track on the south east. The encroachers on the lake bund have built houses and shops along the length of the pathway,” the person said.

If the sewage inflow is not stopped immediately, Puttenahalli lake may soon become one more lake in Bengaluru that is in danger of being killed as much by government apathy as by pollutants, the resident said.

Can be saved: BBMP

The BBMP is confident of saving the lake. A senior official from the civic body admitted that the sewage entering the lake directly from Nataraja Layout was coming in the way of ongoing rejuvenation work.

“The BWSSB had some issue in connecting two ends of the pipe as a slum was in the way. It was a legal issue as well. But now they will have to be evicted and it is up to the slum board and the Bengaluru DC. The BWSSB will connect two ends of the pipe, which could not be connected earlier. This will help in the sewage bypassing the lake and entering the UGD,” explained the official. The BWSSB is expected to start work on Monday.

The civic body is aiming at completing the work by the first week of May. “As sewage is entering daily, we are having to pump it out and it is interfering in the dewatering process as well. Once the sewage inflow stops, it will be easier for us to work,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/szcbgo/article30958469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGMarchPuttemahallicol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/revived-puttenahalli-lake-under-threat-from-raw-sewage/article30958470.ece
3,2020/03/01,Summer heat heralds water woes,"Residents in five outer zones of the city say they are already facing a shortage

Summer is yet to officially begin, but several neighbourhoods, especially those in the five outer zones of the city, are already facing water shortage. Residents in some of the affected areas, such as Ramamurthy Nagar, Singasandra, Byatarayanapura, Jakkur, Devarabisanahalli and Bellandur, are heavily dependent on tanker water. The problem is exacerbated by depleting water levels in borewells.

The Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) is still far from completing the project to provide drinking water and sanitary connections in the 110 villages and the erstwhile City Municipal Council (CMC) areas.

Padmanabhaiah Veluru, a resident of Kanakagiri Layout in Ramamurthy Nagar, said though the water pipeline work had been completed over a year ago, they are still dependent on three public borewells. “However, with groundwater levels coming down, we know that summer is going to be tough. Residents have already been warned that supply may be reduced to twice a week,” he said. In areas like Jakkur, Ramamurthy Nagar and Horamavu, the water utility has completed laying water pipelines. However, despite its many appeals, many citizens are yet to apply for individual connections.

Jakkur councillor K.A. Muneendra Kumar, who is also the ruling party leader, claimed that councillors of wards in the five outer zones had been providing water through tankers to residents for free. “Residents are used to getting free water. They now don’t want to spend money on individual water connections,” he claimed.

Meanwhile, for the parts of the city it supplies water to, BWSSB officials said that every day, the water utility draws 1,450 MLD (million litres per day). In January, a representative from the BWSSB had informed the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike council that there was enough water to tide over the summer months.

‘Enough Cauvery water’

Reiterating that there is enough water in the Cauvery (KRS and Kabini reservoirs) to tide the city over the summer, the official, who is in charge of drinking water supply, told The Hindu that water issues could be a result of localised distribution network problems. The official also said that BWSSB could supply water to a particular area if at least 85% of the residents have applied for and have been sanctioned individual water connections.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/y6brsb/article30957744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28BGSUMMERWATER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/summer-heat-heralds-water-woes/article30957745.ece

5,2020/03/01,‘Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act brought little change’,"Karnataka State Disabled and Caregivers Federation says that without budgetary allocation, the law is as good as not implemented

Over three years after the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 came into existence, and around six months after the Karnataka government notified the rules for the same, persons with disabilities (PwDs) in the State say both developments have brought about little change in their lives.

Without a budgetary allotment, the Act and the Rules are as good as not being implemented, said the Karnataka State Disabled and Caregivers Federation, ahead of the State Budget.

G.N. Nagaraj, president of the association, who has a son with intellectual and physical disability, said the government has not considered the spirit of the new Act at all in budgetary allocations so far. “The Budget for PwDs every year has been about pension, grants for special schools, equipment and loans. It has never been revamped according to the 2016 Act,” he said.

The upcoming State Budget is particularly important for the sector, the association says, as they are hoping for the maintenance allowance to be hiked. “It has been the same for decades together – ₹600 (for disabilities up to 75%) and ₹1,400 (75% and above),” said Mr. Nagaraj.

The 2016 Act was commended for factoring in a number of issues, including increasing the number of types of disabilities from seven to 21, including blindness, hearing impairment, locomotor disability, dwarfism, intellectual disability, mental illness, autism spectrum disorder and acid attack victims.

This apart, the Act made other recommendations, among them district-level committees to be constituted by the State governments to address local concerns of PwDs, and penalties for offences committed against PwDs as well as violation of provisions of the new law.

Mr. Nagaraj pointed out that at present, PwDs are paid lower than the others for the same job while reservations for jobs and higher education courses are of no use as there are not enough people with disabilities who are eligible for these posts and seats. “For example, only a small number of students with disabilities pass SSLC. Where is the question qualifying for professional courses?”

He also pointed out that the Act gives “tremendous opportunity in the private sector” for PwDs, a point that the State government has not paid attention to at all.

The Act speaks of an “equal opportunity policy” for every establishment, including private establishments having 20 or more employees.

“The equal opportunity policy of a private establishment having 20 or more employees and the government establishments shall contain... list of posts identified suitable for persons with disabilities in the establishment, provisions for assistive devices, barrier-free accessibility and other provisions for persons with disabilities...” the Act says.

This, the association says, will open up thousands of private institutions such as education, hospitals and other offices to PwDs.

Apart from implementing the Act as a pilot after a survey before full implementation, the caregivers association has also demanded that a separate department be created to handle disabilities as there is “skewed” distribution of funds within the existing department.

Officials from the department and the Minister for Women and Child Development Shashikala Jolle were unavailable for comment.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/equmlm/article30955478.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGLOKSABHAELECTIONKARNATAKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/rights-of-persons-with-disabilities-act-brought-little-change/article30955479.ece

The District Crime Branch police arrested a 32-year-old man for cheating 195 persons of ₹14.04 lakh, here on Saturday evening.

Police identified the accused as V. Karthikeyan of Vettavalam Road in Tiruvannamalai Town. Karthikeyan ran a Deepavali chit scheme in 2018 and collected ₹600 each from 195 persons for 12 months through his contacts in local villages.

He had assured the depositors of a two-grams gold coin, 25 grams silver, a box of sweets and a gift hamper with fire crackers. When he failed to keep his promise, the depositors urged him to return their money. After a couple of months, he stopped answering depositors’ phone calls, evading them.

Based on a complaint from one of the depositors, the police conducted a probe and arrested Karthikeyan under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. He was remanded to custody.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/man-arrested-for-deepavali-chit-scam/article30958359.ece

Following his speech at an event marking the 50th anniversary of the magazine Thuglak, some outfits staged protests outside his house, and he had also received threats. Subsequently, a five-member team, headed by a sub-inspector, was deployed for his security outside his house.

Since the protests against him had subsided, he sought the removal of the security arrangements.

Hence, on Saturday, the Deputy Commissioner (Intelligence), R. Thirunavukkarasu, met him to discuss his request and reviewed the security arrangements.

11,2020/03/01,Fire breaks out in chemical godown in Madhavaram,"Thick smoke engulfs locality; traffic affected

A fire broke out at a chemical godown near the Madhavaram inter-city bus terminus and spread to a few other units near it on Saturday evening. Thick black smoke engulfed the area and residents from the neighbouring areas complained that they were not able to sit inside their houses due to the heat.

According to the residents, there are a few godowns and small-scale units, including the chemical godown, near the bus terminus. Around 3.30 p.m. on Saturday, the residents heard a loud noise and saw flames coming out of one of the units.

“Thick black smoke billowed across the locality. There were frequent small explosions and oil barrels from the factory could be seen flying out and fallling on the road, nearly 50 m away. It was frightening,” said Ismail, a resident.

The fire could be seen from Kolathur, located 7 km from Madhavaram. Some of the residents called the fire control room and 20 fire tenders and 20 Metrowater lorries were rushed to the spot. “More than 500 firefighters are trying to douse the fire. It is suspected that the chemicals kept in the factory caught fire. However, it will be known only after investigation,” said a police officer.

D. Neelakannan, president, Federation of Madhavaram Residents’ Welfare Associations, said that he visited the spot soon after the fire broke out. “It is impossible to sit inside houses close to the factory due to the heat. We could hear frequent explosions. Everyone complained of burning sensation in the eyes,” he said.

Traffic was also affected on the stretch, as many gathered on the road to see the fire.

14,2020/03/01,"More countries on watch list, but screening staff inadequate","COVID-19 alert: airports in State also short of protective equipment

The number of countries from where passengers are being screened at airports for symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is now 12, the latest addition being Italy, Iran and South Korea. But the existing facilities for screening are far from adequate, say passengers and healthcare personnel.

Screening for COVID-19 started with passengers of four countries — China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore. However, in the last few weeks, the number of countries on the COVID-19 map has been rising. But some passengers say screening for symptoms is far from satisfactory, while healthcare personnel blame it on insufficient manpower. There is also a lack of adequate personal protective equipment for them.

Public health officials said with the addition of more countries on the screening list, the State government is supporting the airport health authorities with manpower. They have deputed doctors and paramedical staff to be part of the screening teams at airports — 10 for Chennai and 12 for Tiruchi, an official said.

“The Directorate of Public Health (DPH) deputed six staff nurses and four health inspectors to the Chennai airport. Some of them are on a continuous 12-hour shift. Passengers from at least nearly 15 flights were screened during a night shift, and this is affecting their efficiency and health,” an official said.

Currently, there are five airport medical officers along with a few doctors of the CGHS, he said, adding, “At least 20 more persons, including doctors from DPH, are required here. The personnel can be posted on three shifts and improve checks on arriving passengers.”

Masks, gloves

Officials noted that healthcare personnel were not provided triple layer masks or N95 masks and adequate number of gloves at the Chennai airport. “They are only wearing regular masks. The number of gloves is also insufficient,” another official said.

Officials said there are chances of missing passengers who travel from affected countries and reach any of the airports in the State through a transit flight. Smritika Srinivasan, a 26-year-old working professional from Chennai who returned to the city after a visit to Doha, says, “There was an announcement while we were on the aircraft, asking only passengers who are running a temperature, to go in for a screening when we land in Chennai. After that, the rest of us went ahead with immigration as usual without any screening. This is not how it should be. Ideally, they should screen passengers from all flights,” she said.

But officials of Airports Authority of India (AAI) say they provided every facility that the Airports Health Organisation (APHO) requested since they conduct the screening.

“As soon as a flight arrives, hand sanitisers are provided to passengers and thermal screening is done immediately; and only after that do they head to immigration. We have installed smart hygiene machines. Whatever the APHO has asked us we have provided and are coordinating with them. If we receive instructions that passengers from all flights have to be screened, we will certainly do so. We are strictly following instructions,” an official said.

Another official at the airport said they have been screening all passengers from the 12 countries and even passengers arriving from other countries with fever.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/w5rqtp/article30954037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29SCREENPASSENGERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/more-countries-on-watch-list-but-screening-staff-inadequate/article30954038.ece
15,2020/03/01,I-T dept. seizes ₹1 cr. from city-based firm,"₹400 cr. in unaccounted income detected

The Income Tax department has seized ₹1 crore and detected unaccounted income of over ₹400 crore during searches conducted on a prominent business group based out of Chennai.

The group deals in non-ferrous metal processing — lead, copper and aluminium — apart from money-lending activities, and is said to have reported a turnover of more than ₹1,000 crore.

The I-T department did not disclose the name of the group.

The searches were conducted on February 25, according to a statement by Surabhi Ahluwalia, spokesperson of the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and I-T Commissioner (Media and Technical Policy).

‘Kacha’ accounts

The highlight of the search operation was the discovery of hidden cloud servers that were different from those regularly used by the group for accounting, containing unaccounted transaction details often referred to by the group as ‘kacha’ accounts, the statement said.

“Similarly, a large amount of encrypted data was retrieved from a pen drive which was tracked and obtained from a third-party premise. The pen drive and the database were decrypted to gather information about the unaccounted capital accumulated by the group,” the press statement said.

Evidence was also gathered regarding the introduction of unaccounted funds as bogus share premium in one of the companies belonging to the group, it added. A large number of property documents, promissory notes and post-dated cheques taken as collateral security in the money-lending business were recovered and seized during the searches, the department said.

The investigations are ongoing and the department is in the process of finalising the proceedings.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/i-t-dept-seizes-1-cr-from-city-based-firm/article30954034.ece
16,2020/03/01,CCB busts online vehicle scam,"Two suspects nabbed in Rajasthan

Central Crime Branch (CCB) officials of the city police have busted a multi-crore online market scam, in which fraudsters posed as army officers to sell vehicles, cheating over 100 buyers in Chennai.

G. Nagajothi, Deputy Commissioner, CCB, has advised customers not to fall prey to people posing as army officers, trying to sell products in online markets. People have been also directed not to click on suspicious payment links.

According to the police, the CCB has been receiving complaints about the online market scam since last November. “The fraudsters copy pictures of army men in uniform from social media and post it on the site. They advertise that they have an automobile to sell as they are getting transferred from the unit in Chennai,” said a police officer.

When a prospective buyer contacts them, they send their fake credentials on WhatsApp. Following this, they ask the buyer to transfer money through digital wallets. Subsequently, when the purchaser questions the delay in the delivery of the automobile, the conmen site reasons such as lorry getting held up at the toll gate and non payment of insurance.

“The buyers realise their folly only when the conmen switch off their mobile phones. Thousands of people have been cheated across the country by the gang,” said a police officer.

Following a complaint, Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan directed CCB Additional Commissioner C. Easwara Moorthy to form a team headed by Ms. Nagajothi.

“During investigation, the cyber-cell team found that most transactions and calls were done from Dundawal village, Bharatpur, in Rajasthan. Since we came to know that many in the neighbouring States had been cheated using the same modus operandi, we coordinated with other State Police Departments. Even they confirmed that Rajasthan was the source of the calls,” the officer said.

However, when the police team rushed to Rajasthan, there was no proper help from the local police initially. “The villagers did not allow our team to enter. Our officers spoke to their counterparts there and finally we managed to nab the masterminds — Naresh Pal Singh, 36, and Bachchu Singh, 26 — both from Bharatpur,” said the officer.

The police team is bringing them to back to Chennai. “We have to arrest the other gang members who helped them create bank accounts with fake addresses and documents. We will gather more details after interrogation,” the officer said.

The police have also advised people to be careful while buying goods from online sites. “There are many fraudsters posing as army officers who are waiting to con gullible people. Verify first and then purchase. If you are selling a product, never click on payment links, as your account can be compromised,” said Ms. Nagajothi.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ccb-busts-online-vehicle-scam/article30954032.ece

19,2020/03/01,"Extend qualification period, say shuttlers","Saina and Kashyap feel coronavirus outbreak is affecting the schedule

Indian shuttlers Saina Nehwal and P. Kashyap feel that the BWF should extend the Olympic qualification period in view of the novel coronavirus outbreak wrecking havoc on the qualifying events for the Tokyo Games.

Concerns over the rapid spread of the deadly virus had forced the postponement of the four Olympic qualifying events so far — Lingshui China Masters (February 25 to March 1), Vietnam International Challenge (March 24 to 29), German Open (March 3 to 8) and Polish Open (March 26 to 29).

“Qualification period can be extended if the tournaments are getting cancelled cause of #coronavirus,” Saina tweeted, tagging the Badminton World Federation (BWF) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

“It will be unfair for most of the players who are really close to qualifying for Olympics 2020.”

Saina, the London Olympic bronze medallist, is currently lying at 22nd in Race to Tokyo list and needs a rapid rise in the rankings to qualify for the Games.

Her husband Kashyap and former World No. 1 Kidambi Srikanth are at 24th and 21th spots respectively in the Race to Tokyo list.

For them and several top players around the world, including China’s two-time Olympic champion Lin Dan (currently placed at 30th), the next few tournaments will be crucial as they try to squeeze into the top 16 to qualify for Tokyo.

The prestigious All England Championships (March 11 to 15), offering 12,000 ranking points for the winner, is next in line, followed by the Swiss Open, India Open (Super 500), Malaysia Open (Super 750), and Singapore Open (Super 500) before qualification period ends on April 28.

20,2020/03/01,Not all book buyers are ardent readers,"Some travel hundreds of miles to buy books, but would never open a page of them

I overheard a conversation between a customer and a book seller at a book fair, changing my very idea that those who buy books are avid readers. A middle-aged woman ordered the sales boy at a stall to show her books that must not exceed 10 inches in length and seven inches in breadth; the thickness of the entire set should be within 20 inches.

She just dismissed the boy when he asked for the names of the books and the authors. Bringing out a six-inch scale from her bag, she said that she needed the books only to fill a space dedicated to books in her beautiful teak showcase.

The honest confession may disappoint a good many book lovers. But the hard truth lies in the question whether most book buyers are actual readers at all. I have come across people who buy the latest books but are poor readers. They travel hundreds of miles to College Street in Kolkata and even attend the Kolkata Book Fair every year only to buy books. If they are asked about the contents of the books they have bought, they look dumbfounded.

They want to show themselves as voracious readers which they are not. I am acquainted with a high school teacher who is regarded by his friends and colleagues as a book worm. Actually, he buys a huge number of books and lends them to some genuine readers on condition that they should underline the portions they deem interesting and of course, relate the subject matters of the books. The teacher just commits the underlined portions to memory and vomits them wherever he finds opportunities.

On the contrary, there are some avid readers who are extremely reluctant to buy books, though they have the money. They borrow books from others only to finish them in one go. Some of them, though gifted with a marvellous memory to remember minute details of hundreds of books they have read in their life, pretend to be forgetful of returning the books to their owners. Despite their unquestionable honesty in everyday life, they hardly feel a guilty conscience for not returning the books.

Mitchell Stephens, a journalism professor at New York University, in his essay “The Death of Reading” in Los Angeles Times Magazine, lamented how the lack of the reading habit has enveloped our life. Even books attaining the fame of “number one best seller” may be a poor read.

The renowned theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawkins’s A Brief History of Time has sold more than 10 million copies. Surprisingly, the book is often dubbed “the most unread book of all time”. The Hawking Index (HI), a mock mathematical measure on how far people will, on an average, read through a book before giving up, was invented by American mathematician Jordan Ellenberg. According to HI, A Brief History of Time, has been read only by 6.6%. However, Hillary Clinton’s Hard Choices tops the list of the most unread books scoring 1.9%.

I cannot restrain from referring to an avid reader who runs a tea stall sparsely visited by customers. Most of his time is passed by reading classic Bengali novels stacked in one corner of his stall with tea-making materials. The reading habit does not depend merely on educational qualifications, profession or status.

21,2020/03/01,When appalams were a family affair,"Everyone had work to do, and everyone’s task was equally important in getting a month’s supply of the snack ready

My aunt was visiting, and we sat around a large meal with fried appalams (or papads) being passed around. I looked on amused at the satisfied smiles. “Any meal becomes special with fried appalams,” my father used to say. He truly became a child beaming happily while breaking them off.

I said as much to my aunt, his sister, and she chuckled happily.

“Yes, appalams were your father’s favourite. Three days every month was dedicated to making appalams,” she said. I sat back to enjoy the nostalgic look that lit her eyes.

We sat enthralled as she narrated the story of how her mother would roast the dal and set them out to dry. My grandmother’s life has always fascinated me. Feeding and raising a large family of nine children must have been a herculean task, but my grandmother seemed to have been a competent taskmaster, budget planner, forecaster, chef and mother. As the appalam-making tale unfolded, it was evident that those three days were filled with buzz. Everyone had work to do, and everyone’s task was equally important.

The younger ones had to shoo away the birds while the lentils dried in the sun. The older boys would have to pummel the dried lentils with an iron cudgel. “No grinders or machines those days, remember,” my aunt said.

The older girls would then have to take the powdered lentils, mix them to cookie dough consistency and roll them out into neat little circles before setting them out to dry again.

The younger ones took up their sentry duty to shoo away the birds while the appalams dried in the sun.

“One time, my mother was alarmed to see the dough stained with blood and looked up to see that while pummelling, your father had accidentally hit himself on the forehead a few times. Poor fellow. That month, we had a little less appalam stock because we had to throw out that batch, but your father got his full share because he liked appalams so much, and of course, he played the sympathy factor the whole month,” she said and giggled.

Three days a month set aside for appalam making, so that the children may enjoy fried snacks every once in a while, seemed to be a lot of planning and processing. Obviously, fried appalams held a special appeal in the hearts of the children. Each one felt they had contributed to the process, and the satisfying crunch must have had a special meaning.

Going to the supermarket and picking up a packet of appalams has become so blasé a task that I rarely stop to think about how it was prior to mechanisation and automation.

“Automation has changed so many things, hasn’t it,” said one voice, and we all piped in. The topic of automation took us for a bumpy ride down the river of time. While automation has helped feed and clothe billions of us, mass production and capitalism have also blurred the lines between needs and wants.

I loved the mental image of appalam making in a small village house in south India. The little heart-warming tale did get me thinking about the last time the whole family pitched in on one activity together that contributed towards something meaningful, that too on a regular basis.

In our eagerness to simplify and automate, we do seem to have complicated things somewhat.

I was reminded of what the author of the classic, Little House on the Prairie, says in the book. The book chronicles the adventures of a family in the late 19th century, where the whole family works together to build a log cabin in the prairie to live in.

22,2020/03/01,Why child is the father of man,"Often, people turn ever more childlike as they add numbers to their age

Every month, I spend three or four days with my 92-year-old father and 82-year-old mother and get to experience first-hand the little joys and sorrows of their life.

My father is mentally sharp, though of late, he seems to have taken a fancy to interpolate some of his accounts of the past with some creativity and ingenuity of his own. During my recent visit, he was narrating how my nephew had his head bandaged in a hospital after an accident and how the little one complained, “Grandpa, I cannot see because of this bandage.”

The accident and the bandage are facts, but my nephew’s complaint is not — at that age, he could barely utter a few words.

Father has a photographic memory (though he often laments that he is fast losing it) of the events of his long career in Parliament House. His voice becomes excited and his eyes light up while narrating anecdotes. He has a huge library stocked with books on philosophy and spirituality, and he seems to switch off on most other topics. His absent-mindedness, for long, the butt of jokes, has attained new dimensions. Brushing his teeth with his shaving cream and vice versa, forgetting to have his medicine but not his lemon candy, mistaking identities of people from outside the family — wife for daughter, for instance — have started coming to him with effortless ease. He avoids the mobile phone like the plague and feels it is both intrusive and irritating.

My mother, with her incessant love for all things gold, is a study in contrast. She believes in flaunting her jewellery. I guess that were it not for the likes of her, the gold market in India would have crashed a long time ago. Not just gold, she is very much ‘in’ life. Whether it is talcum powder, a sari or even juicy gossip, she is fond of it all. She has mastered WhatsApp and is adept at forwarding videos and messages, though initially she would get her emoticons all mixed up. She once sent a smiley while expressing condolences. Life for her is quite simply and clearly binary with people being neatly stacked up as “good” and “bad”. The pet dog who snaps at her has to go because it has become “bad”. However, this categorisation is dynamic and may change even within the course of the day. She loves going out, meeting people and attending weddings and get-togethers. She, however, does not like going out alone and this is when issues crop up with not just my “detached” father but also any of us who do not share her enthusiasm for attending social events. Garrulous by nature, she is loath to missing out on any piece of action.

It is only now that I better understand what William Wordsworth meant by “The child is the father of man”. For, I see them becoming ever more childlike, each in his or her own way, as they add numbers to their age.

23,2020/03/01,Dance of danger on the roads,"The cost of our culpable lethargy is loss of precious human lives

Early in the morning, we tried crossing a near-empty Kochi road, the narrow carriageway divided into two lanes by Metro rail pillars. Following the “keep-left culture”, like any prudent person, we were eyeing the vehicles speeding from a distance to our right side. At half the lane, from darkness emerged a scooter to our left, wrong side, a bolt from the blue. Taken aback, we narrowly escaped. The scooter, too, stopped. We asked the gentleman why he had resorted to such dangerous methods, avoiding a slightly longer ‘U-turn’. His classic reply, “These days one shouldn’t help anyone; I stopped only for you!”

Some time ago, there was a hue and cry after a motorcyclist fell into a pit dug by a government department and got run over by a bus. A discerning walk through any road could identify a number of killer potholes, dangerously uneven surfaces and dilapidated drains and slabs. Who cares!

Bernard Shaw is right, “We learn from history that we learn nothing from history.”

After a tragedy, the media make a noise but seldom do we follow up or do a stitch in time. The cost of our culpable lethargy is loss of precious human lives, apart from overburdening the fragile healthcare system and the precarious exchequer. In God’s Own Country itself, nearly 4,000 people die and over 50,000 are seriously injured in 40,000 road accidents every year.

The exponential increase in the number of vehicles — consequent chaotic driving and parking — makes us indifferent to traffic rules. Footpaths are all encroached upon or too filthy to walk. Pedestrians remain the most marginalised and vulnerable, whose very existence is challenged.

A sensible, integrated and time-bound system — addressing these issues from the initial conception of the road itself — is called for. This would ensure designing of safe roads, timely maintenance, and scientific licensing, regulation and enforcement that is technologically in-built.

We need to think out of the box. The gravity of the problem, involving the lives of tens of thousands of hapless victims and their poor families, warrants empowering the road safety commissioner with executive magisterial powers under provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code for the due fulfilment of the exigencies of road safety. The officials should be made squarely responsible for any lapse in this regard. Based on any complaint and information about any deficiency on any road that has the potential to cause an accident, the commissioner should act emergently directing the custodian of that road, whichever department, to cause the deficiency to be rectified forthwith to avoid danger.

There is no reason the above should not be an effective solution to such a baffling humanitarian problem. Complaints, information and directions could all be communicated electronically and notified on a participatory website that can be accessed by citizens and authorities.

Simple solutions often elude us. Most road accidents are man-made and preventable, if only we take care to tighten enforcement of rules, fill a pothole, put up a board of caution or mirror warning incoming vehicles. All these hardly require huge funds or time for sanction/execution.

24,2020/03/01,A preventable cancer wreaks havoc,"Opening the prestigious journal The Lancet, I was struck by the editorial “Eliminating cervical cancer”. It’s a cancer that is most preventable and yet is woefully prevalent in India. According to recent statistics (WHO Globocan), among the 5,00,000 patients with cervical cancer diagnosed globally each year, most are in developing nations. India is among the countries with high incidence and prevalence.

Almost 97,000 women are diagnosed with this crippling cancer annually in India (20% of global incidence). More alarming, 88% of deaths from cervical cancer are from Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Among the 97,000 diagnosed, 60,000 die — this is way too high, to have two of three women diagnosed die. The prevalence (those living with cancer) is about 2,25,000 and the quality of life of these women is poor. This is a double burden of death from cervical cancer and significant disability in those living with this disease.

Cervical cancer screening and prevention using PAP smear and HPV vaccination are highly effective. The WHO envisions 70% of women between the ages of 35 and 45 to be screened; 90% of girls fully vaccinated by age 15; and 90% of patients with disease to receive evidence-based care. There shall be no choice for the Indian healthcare system but to take up this cause for eliminating cervical cancer. We should meet and exceed WHO targets.

Zero harm treatment

Now, the next target is zero harm in healthcare delivery. Unsafe care in hospitals is a global concern. Deaths from preventable harm are among the top 10 causes of mortality. In keeping with the adage Primum non nocere (First do no harm), we must make our health systems safer. Are our hospitals safe? Not safe enough! The Union and the State governments and the medical profession should ensure healthcare safety — both for patients and the workforce. Zero harm in healthcare implies achieving absolute patient and workforce safety by eliminating preventable harm… in many dimensions: diagnostic safety, medication safety, surgical safety, healthcare-associated infection mitigation, and safe and effective communication culture, to name a few.

25,2020/03/01,More than the sum of its parts,"An 11-year-old tears down a cycle but is unable to put it back together

My father’s favourite Sunday activity was maintenance of his Ambassador car. I would watch in fascination as he effortlessly went about his hobby, happily whistling a tune. It convinced me that vehicle maintenance was the easiest thing to do.

When I turned 11 and learnt to ride a bicycle, my parents decided to buy me one. Sukhdevji, the proprietor of the cycle shop, addressed me directly, making me feel important. Then, he selected a machine for me and sweetened the deal with a free bell and a spongy seat cover.

Sukhdevji and Brijlal, the mechanic who put it all together, walked to the door and formally handed over the spanking new bicycle to me. Before I pedalled off, they advised me to come back after a fortnight for oiling and minor adjustments.

On my visit, Brijlal tightened a few nuts, oiled the chain and inflated the tyres. I was asked to return after a month.

But I decided to maintain the bicycle myself. Had I not observed Brijlal’s work closely? It was all so easy.

One Saturday, a half-day at school, Appa was away at work and Amma had gone to visit Aunty Mathur. I took the car’s tool-kit. Also other useful things such as Amma’s kitchen pincers and her can of sewing machine oil. I started whistling Appa’s tune and went about the work.

One hour later, as the bicycle was torn down, there was a knock on the door. It was Amma. I proudly led her to my workplace. She surveyed everything, but did not utter a word. She picked up her pincers and pulled my ears with it till I let out a cry in pain. Only then did I realise that something was wrong. Reluctantly, I began putting the parts back. But nothing seemed to be fitting. When Appa returned home, he looked at me sternly but did not say anything.

It’s a tradition

Though even today I am not too sure, I think I heard the suppressed laughter of Appa and Amma and words which translate to “family tradition of fixing things which ain’t broke”.

Soon, Appa helped me collect the parts in a gunny bag and sent me to Sukhdevji in a cycle-rickshaw.

Brijlal saw the gunny bag, the bicycle frame and the two wheels. A quick glance at me and my sheepish, disconcerted look told him everything. No explanations were required. He just yelled to inform Sukhdevji, “The work of yet another budding engineer has arrived.”

26,2020/03/01,"Heaped plates, hungry stomachs","Food turning surplus at celebrations and other gatherings should be collected and given to the poor

Marriages, birthday celebrations, anniversaries, alumni meetings, conferences, seminars and many similar events lay out lavish multi-course feasts with plenty of starters, soups and salads followed by the main course and ending with desserts. After the events, mounds of food are dumped in dustbins, unmindful of its value to the poor who go hungry.

Most such gatherings serve buffets. The tendency of food wastage is more when people help themselves. They pick more than what they can eat only to waste the excess.

Similar wastage happens when hotels serve complimentary breakfast buffets. Wherever food is free and in plenty, people take more than what they can eat. Those fortunate to have surplus food forget the plight of those who do not have enough to eat. Millions of people die of malnutrition and hunger in India. Starvation deaths in some parts of the country are now new. The Global Hunger Index, 2019 places India at 102 among 117 countries, indicating a serious level of hunger. Despite considerable industrial and economic growth and self-reliance in foodgrain production, India is unable to provide enough food to a large number of people, especially women and children. Food wastage adds to the woes.

Nearly one-third of the food produced every year gets lost or wasted, but the affluent sections still throw what they can’t eat into the dustbins. It is said that 40% of fruits and vegetables and 30% of cereals are lost from inefficient supply chain management and do not reach the market. While significant levels of food losses occur at harvest and during post-harvest handling, a lot of food is lost or wasted during the distribution and consumption stages. Poor transport facilities and roads in the hinterland force some of the farmers to dump their produce in the open. So the problem is not lack of food. It is a lack of ability and sensitivity to distribute food to the poor.

Social involvement

While many public-spirited people and non-governmental organisations collect surplus food and distribute it to the poor, a more inclusive involvement of society in this work is required. Most important is to educate the people about the ills of food wastage. Social awareness and disseminating knowledge on sharing food resources in a better-organised mode will be able to make a difference.

It may not be possible to regulate food usage in social functions but display of information and appeals against wasting food can eventually help. The NGOs can field volunteers to collect surplus food to feed the hungry. Awareness material should be developed to bring about a transformation in the way food is preserved.

Restaurants can be given incentives to reduce food waste, and municipalities should levy a tax on disposing of leftover food. On the lines of Swachh Bharat, campaigns can be launched to reduce food wastage.

Unless elimination of food wastage becomes an agenda of everyone, it is difficult to end hunger. Organisations can launch corporate social responsibility programmes to eliminate food wastage. Coordinated work of government, corporates and NGOs will be able to change the mindset of people.

27,2020/03/01,Mysore horse racing: Adjudicate creates Invitation Cup history,"Five-year-old is the first to retain the premier crown; Trafalgar gives trainer Mckeown a historic double

Kolkata-based trainer James Mckeown made the historic circuit of the Mysore Race Track his own when he saddled Adjudicate (Multidimensional-Alvarita) and Trafalgar (Western Aristocrat-Bluegrass Phenom) to win the ‘Grade 1 Double’ — Indian Turf Invitation Cup and Major P.K. Mehra Memorial Super Mile — on Sunday.

Five-year-old Adjudicate, ridden by Y.S. Srinath, became the first horse above the Classic age to win the Invitation. She is also the first since the terms of the race changed in 2013 to win in successive years and with a record timing in both essays.

Calcutta Derby winner Trafalgar, ridden superbly by David Allan, won the Super Mile in an emphatic fashion to vindicate his owners’ decision to target him for that race, given the poor run in the Indian Derby, instead of going for the Invitation.

The last time two Kolkata-based horses won the Invitation and the Super Mile was back in 1996 in Chennai.

Champion team: Adjudicate (Y.S. Srinath up) being led in by, from left, breeders Gajendra Singh and Sultan Singh, representing Shona Stud Farm, along with owner Amitabh Nanda and trainer James Mckeown, after her victory in the Indian Turf Invitation Cup on Sunday.

Aachen takes honours

Arun Alagappan-owned Aachen (Tazahum-Mink Mitten), bred at the Sans Craintes Stud Farm, claimed the honours in Villoo C. Poonawalla Million, while Darius Byramji-trained Multifaceted (Multidimensional-Dhaawiah) took the Suresh Mahindra Multi Million Trophy (Gr. 3) in a record time.

Trafalgar, owned by Messrs Joydeep Datta Gupta, Jayanta Mukhopadhay, Sanjay Datta Gupta, Jeet Banerjee, Achuthan Siddharth, Martand Singh Mahindra, Shouryabrtata Mandal And Sigma Scan Systems Pvt. Ltd., set the double rolling. He looked outstanding in the Parade Ring and ran true to his looks to give his connections its first Super Mile victory.

Adjudicate, owned jointly by the Khaitan family from Kolkata and the Nanda family from Mumbai, inscribed her name into the annals of racing history. Not only did she win the first-ever running of the Invitation Cup here, but also became the first to win the pièce de résistance of the Indian Turf two years in succession.

Multifaceted triumphs

Multifaceted, owned by the Edwards family from Sri Lanka and ridden by Suraj Narredu, made amends for his lacklustre performance in the Bangalore Turf Club Sprinters Cup on Saturday with a great run over the 1400m in the Suresh Mahindra Multi Million.

28,2020/03/01,Drive for helmet emoji to caution youth gains pace,"Aims to spread awareness of road safety

A campaign to sign a petition on change.org to make the helmet an emoji is drawing the attention of the youth within weeks of its launch. Started by the general insurance company, ICICI Lombard, the drive aims at getting the maximum number of people to sign the nationwide petition in the interest of road safety.

As the youth spend most of their time on smartphones, the initiative intends to help create the helmet emoji in order to increase conversations on the topic of safety and raise awareness of the need to wear helmets while riding two-wheelers. The campaign is live on all social media pages of the company, which are accessible through its official website.

Sanjeev Mantri, executive director of ICICI Lombard General Insurance, said once the petition secures a sufficient number of signatures, it will be assessed by Unicode, the world standard for text and emoji.

Mr. Mantri said, “For an emoji to be selected by Unicode, there has to be substantial evidence that a large number of people will like the emoji. There is also a standard size that the emoji has to conform to along with an evaluation of whether the emoji expresses what it intends to convey.”

The initiative aims to reach out to youths in a language they understand. Mr. Mantri said, “Many studies help us understand the way the virtual world is growing. Often, the first users of these digital innovations are the youth. As per a Google study, it is estimated that by 2021 we will have almost 600 million smartphone users in India, a big reason why we want to reach out to the youngsters through their mobile phones.”

Mr. Mantri said with the introduction of steeper fines against offenders, more riders have started wearing helmets in the country. He said this wasn’t the case till a few years ago when a large number of people were careless when it came to wearing helmets.

He said, “Though we can still see some people riding bikes with their helmet hanging on the handlebars, a considerable change is visible. More importantly, the government is also rooting for the cause by passing laws towards road safety.”

Mr. Mantri said the company is not expecting to make a sudden impact through the campaign, but it believes it is an important step towards ensuring the safety of two-wheeler riders. “All habit formations or behaviour changes take place by sustained reinforcement and talking to the person’s mind. If we get a good number of signatures, say a million, the emoji will be India’s contribution to the world,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/304awe/article30953970.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMHelmet-emoji,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/drive-for-helmet-emoji-to-caution-youth-gains-pace/article30953971.ece
29,2020/03/01,"2 held for stealing ₹70,000 from ATM","Manager of servicing agency gave machine’s keys to Ola driver

The Sanpada police have arrested two people for stealing ₹70,000 from an ATM.

The accused have been identified as Suyog Ravindra Dheevar (32), manager at Hitachi payment services who gave the keys to the machine to Johnson Shetty (34), an Ola driver who used them to steal the money.

The complaint was filed by Juber Khot (41), Juinagar branch manager, Axis Bank, on February 26. In his complaint, Mr. Khot said he suspected that money had been stolen from the bank’s ATM from which cash could be withdrawn and deposited. He said Hitachi payment services and Brinks Arya had been awarded the contract to service the machine. Both agencies would turn up for servicing and take a video to keep a record of their work.

Mr. Khot said for the past few weeks, customers had been complaining about a snag in the machine which created a mismatch between the amount deposited and the one displayed on the screen. The bank officials then called the agencies and found that currency notes had got stuck in the machine and they were processed again. On February 8, a bank holiday, a security guard informed Mr. Khot that the door of the ATM was lying open. Mr. Khot instructed him to down the shutters.

On February 10, Mr. Khot called up the agencies and the servicing staff retrieved 39 currency notes of ₹500 denomination which were stuck in the machine.

Mr. Khot was still suspicious of the entire episode and filed a complaint with the Sanpada police.

A police officer from Sanpada police station said, “During our investigation, we found CCTV footage of two men standing outside the ATM on the night of February 7 at 11.56 p.m. We tracked their movement using the footage and traced the duo. The bank provided another footage that showed a man entering the ATM by trying to cover his face, opening the lock of the machine using a key and making away with money. But he forgot to close the machine’s door, causing the crime to come to light.” The duo was arrested on charges of criminal breach of trust and theft.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2-held-for-stealing-70000-from-atm/article30953953.ece
30,2020/03/01,Parambir Singh new Mumbai Police chief,"Former State Anti Corruption Bureau chief known for bringing underworld under control in late 1990s

Senior Indian Police Service officer Parambir Singh on Saturday took over from Sanjay Barve as the Commissioner of Police of Mumbai.

Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had on Friday announced that Mr. Barve would not be getting any more extensions to his tenure. Mr. Barve, who was appointed the city police chief in March 2019, had already received two extensions of three months each.

Mr. Singh’s appointment was officially announced by the Home Department at 12.30 p.m. on Saturday and he reached the Mumbai Police headquarters at 3 p.m. to take charge. Mr. Singh was earlier serving as Director General of the Maharashtra Anti Corruption Bureau.

Addressing the media after taking charge, Mr. Singh said, “Mumbai is considered among the safest cities in the world. I will make it my priority to implement measures to ensure the safety of its citizens, particularly women. Mumbai has in the past witnessed blood-soaked gang wars on its streets. Today, however, the situation is different and we will try to finish what remains of the underworld.”

The 1988-batch IPS officer is still remembered by veterans for his part in bringing the rapidly worsening underworld under control in the late 1990s. As a young Deputy Commissioner of Police, Mr. Singh headed one of the two special squads of encounter specialists tasked with taking strong action against gangsters. He added that efforts to ensure the safety of the city from terrorist elements will continue in coordination with other concerned agencies.

On the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register, Mr. Singh said, “Protesting is the right of citizens. Any protest that is conducted within the limits of the law will be respected but any instance of the law being broken will be dealt with appropriately.”

Stays predecessor’s order

Hours after he took charge, Mr. Singh stayed an order issued by Mr. Barve on Thursday to transfer 25 officers, including four Assistant Commissioners of Police. Several officers confirmed that a circular to this effect has been issued by Joint Commissioner of Police (Administration) Naval Bajaj. Mr. Singh and Mr. Bajaj could not be reached for comment.

Mr. Barve, meanwhile, was given a ceremonial farewell at the police grounds in Naigaon on Saturday morning. All senior officers of the Mumbai Police were present at the occasion and Mr. Barve was seen personally interacting with them after the parade.

“Mumbai Police has always been a capable and efficient force. During my tenure I have witnessed a State election and several protests, but every situation has been handled par excellence by our officers,” Mr. Barve said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/9mub37/article30953931.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMPARAMBIRSANJAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/parambir-singh-new-mumbai-police-chief/article30953933.ece
31,2020/03/01,"Tattoos of victim’s lover, wife lead police to killer","Brothers-in-law arrested for murdering 25-year-old resident of Chembur

When a 25-year-old man decided to get his initials and that of his beloved tattooed on his body, he would not have thought that one day they would lead the police to his killers.

The Parksite police found a decomposed body close to the IIT Bombay campus in Powai on February 20. The level of decomposition was such that it was impossible to identify the body. Doctors who conducted the post-mortem at Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar said the face had been bashed in with a heavy and blunt object.

The police then registered a case of murder and destruction of evidence against unknown persons.

An officer, who was part of the investigating team, said, “The only clue we had was two tattoos on the body. One was heart shaped with the initials ‘SR’ on the neck, and another on the arm had the initials ‘SN’. We circulated a physical description of the victim to all police stations in Mumbai, nearby commissonerates and on WhatsApp groups our officers are part of.”

The officer said after five days, the RCF police came up with a possible clue. “We were expecting a missing person’s complaint registered in his name somewhere. However, the RCF police informed us that they had arrested a man last year in an assault case who fit the description. As a practice, distinguishing marks of all arrested accused are recorded in the FIR,” the officer said.

Based on the FIR, the police identified the deceased as Siddharth Satpute, a resident of RCF area in Chembur. He had been arrested for allegedly assaulting his brother-in-law with a sickle.

Crucial clue

The police visited Satpute’s residence and spoke to his neighbours, who told them that his wife had moved out with their son a few months ago. The neighbours told the police that the ‘S’ in both tattoos stood for Satpute’s first name, while the ‘R’ represented his former love interest, and the ‘N’ was for his wife.

The officer said, “We also made inquiries with his wife, who said despite being separated, Satpute regularly turned up at her house and created a scene. He even assaulted her mother in front of her and her brothers. We kept a watch on her family members and with the help of local informants learned that her two brothers, Nikhil and Ravi Tak, were seen with him a few days before the body was found.”

Both the brothers were picked up for inquiries and after sustained questioning, they broke down and confessed to the crime. “It was Ravi that Satpute had assaulted last year and got arrested for. On February 18, the duo invited him for a drink near the spot where the body was found. They waited for him to get drunk and bashed his face in with a stone,” the officer said.

The duo has been arrested. They have named two friends as accomplices and the police are looking for them, officers said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/9mzrzo/article30953866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMParksite-victim,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tattoos-of-victims-lover-wife-lead-police-to-killer/article30953867.ece
32,2020/03/01,A leader and go-getter,"Colleagues say Singh is a supportive officer who never fails to let them know that he trusts them

Parambir Singh, who took charge as Mumbai Police Commissioner on Saturday, is credited with playing a significant role in bringing the underworld’s activities under control at its peak in the late 1990s. Officers who have worked under him describe him as a thoroughly supportive officer who never fails to let them know that he trusts them.

Mr. Singh was a Deputy Commissioner of Police in Mumbai when gangsters like Dawood Ibrahim Kaskar, Rajendra Nikhalje alias Chhota Rajan, and Arun Gawli were most active. Mr. Singh was DCP (Zone VI), and Chembur, which was Rajan’s home base, was in his jurisdiction. Rajan had already split with Dawood by then and both gangsters were at war, leading to as many as two murders in broad daylight in a single day. Mr. Singh formed a special squad of officers to tackle the growing menace and gave them full support in their work against the Rajan gang.

Retired Assistant Commissioner of Police Praful Bhosale, who worked with Mr. Singh at the time, said, “It was only because of the way he led from the front that we were able to achieve significant control over the underworld. He believes in constantly motivating his subordinates and personally interacts with all of them irrespective of rank, unlike some officers who prefer to distance themselves from on-ground personnel. Besides, he shares complete information with his subordinates, instead of following the need-to-know model and nothing makes a policeman feel more trusted than this. He is also not someone who bows to pressure. ”

After being transferred as DCP Zone II, Mr. Singh formed a similar squad that included Mr. Bhosale and the late Vijay Salaskar, who was martyred during the 2008 terrorist attacks. This squad was tasked with focusing on Gawli’s activities. Salaskar instilled such fear in Gawli’s mind that he submitted an official letter seeking Salaskar’s transfer.

A similar squad was formed by former top cop and MP Satyapal Singh, who was also a DCP at the time, which included retired senior police inspector Pradeep Sharma and police inspector Daya Nayak, who is now with the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad. Between them, the two senior officers are credited with dealing a severe blow to the underworld’s activities through a spate of encounters and arrests.

Mr. Singh went on to serve in several other important postings after being promoted to Inspector General rank, including the ATS and as IG, Konkan Range, before being elevated to Additional Director General rank. He later took over as Commissioner of Police, Thane City, and during his tenure, the Thane police cracked some big cases. These included a massive telecalling racket where the accused were cheating citizens of the U.S. by posing as officers from the Internal Revenue Service, and a international drug smuggling racket involving actor Mamata Kulkarni and her husband Vicky Goswami. Several officers from the Thane police said they were initially doubtful about the cases given how massive their scope was, but it was Mr. Singh who motivated them to go ahead.

It was also during his tenure that Mr. Sharma, as the head of the Thane Anti Extortion Cell, arrested Dawood’s brother Iqbal Kaskar in a string of extortion cases as well as infamous bookie Sonu Jalan.

“After my reinstatement, hardly anyone was willing to touch me and there were already smear campaigns against me. Singh sir trusted me and gave me a good posting. He is a very gutsy and supportive officer. If there is one person that I respect in the Maharashtra Police force today, it has to be him. Mumbai is in safe hands,” Mr. Sharma said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/93nsyc/article30953807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMPARAMBIRSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a-leader-and-go-getter/article30953808.ece

35,2020/03/01,Biden sweeps South Carolina primary,"He wins 48.4% of the vote and 33 delegates over Sanders 19.9% and 11 delegates; Tom Steyer drops out

The Democratic party’s race for a presidential candidate saw a significant shift on Saturday night as former U.S. Vice-President Joseph R Biden Jr. won the South Carolina primary by a landslide, with support from the state’s African American community. Mr. Biden, who has projected himself as the establishment wing of the party, won 48.4% of the vote and 33 of the 54 available delegates, with Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont who is leading the progressive wing of the party, coming in second with 19.9% of the vote and 11 delegates.

Having performed poorly in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr Biden’s position in the primaries has been secured — at least for now — by Saturday night’s victory in South Carolina, giving his candidacy momentum as the country heads to ‘Super Tuesday’ when 14 states hold primaries. Some 61% of blacks supported Mr. Biden on Saturday as per exit polls conducted by Edison Media Research compared to 17% supporting Mr Sanders — 56% of those who voted were black.

Mr. Sanders leads the delegate count nationally, followed by Mr. Biden.

Buttigieg draws a blank

Pete Buttigieg, the former Southbend Indiana Mayor, who leads Mr. Sanders in Iowa delegates (the results have been challenged by Sanders campaign) is third in overall delegates. However, the Mayor, who has failed to gain traction in the African American community, got no delegates from South Carolina.

It was a bad night for billionaire Tom Steyer as well, whose proposed policies included climate action, a wealth tax, a minimum wage and addressing ‘unchecked capitalism’. Mr. Steyer, who came in third in terms of vote share (11.3%) but failed to win any delegates, announced that he is dropping out of the race.

Mr. Sanders, who is the most popular candidate among younger Democrats and whose campaign message is social and economic justice, has also been improving his ratings among African Americans nationally. A Reuters/Ipsos poll from last week ranked Mr. Sanders ahead of Mr. Biden nationally in terms of popularity with African Americans. In South Carolina, Mr. Sanders won the 17-29 age group (43% versus Mr. Biden’s 26%) but Mr. Biden had a progressively greater lead over Mr. Sanders in older age groups.

Mr. Biden’s victory speech on Saturday night had what appeared to be repeated veiled references to Mr. Sanders. “Talk is cheap. False promises are deceptive. And talk of a revolution isn’t changing anyone’s life,” Mr. Biden said. Mr. Biden and other centrist Democrats have taken issue with Mr. Sander’s universal healthcare proposition, ‘Medicare for All’ as being too expensive to fund. Mr. Biden also thanked one of his key African American supporters on Saturday night.

Praises for ‘buddy’

“My buddy Jim Clyburn, you brought me back,” he said to the U.S. House of Representative’s Majority Whip, who had given Mr. Biden his influential endorsement and spoke before Mr. Biden at the latter’s victory speech on Saturday.

At least five Democrats, including Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, former New York City Mayor and billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg, U.S. Senator from Massachusetts and progressive candidate Elizabeth Warren, as well as Senator from Minnesota and moderate, Amy Klobuchar, were scheduled to be in Alabama on Sunday to mark the attack on a voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery 55 years ago, Reuters reported. Alabama is one of fourteen states that will vote on Tuesday.

On Saturday, Mr. Sanders flew to the delegate-rich California, which also votes on Tuesday, when 34% of delegates who will vote in the nominating convention later this year will be awarded.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ri8s0g/article30958055.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Biden,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/biden-sweeps-south-carolina-primary/article30958057.ece
36,2020/03/01,Experts raise concerns for India over U.S.-Taliban agreement,"The proposed Afghanistan-Pakistan dialogue, facilitated by the U.S., must not cut India out of the region’s security architecture, warn experts

New Delhi has signalled its acceptance of the U.S.-Taliban and U.S.-Afghanistan peace agreements in Doha and Kabul that aim to end the 18-year war in Afghanistan, by sending envoys to witness them.

Also read | U.S. strikes a deal with Taliban to end 18-year-long Afghan war

The two agreements set out a course for the next 14 months, including the pull-out of U.S. troops, the denial of space to foreign terrorist groups and any violence against the U.S. and allies, and intra-Afghan dialogue.

However, after a closer look at the texts of the two agreements distributed to news agencies, named the “Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognised by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban, and the United States of America”, and the “Joint Declaration between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the United States of America for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan”, diplomatic and security experts say the impact on India may be a cause for worry for the government.

Terms still nebulous

“The reduction in violence is a much-needed respite for Afghans,” said Amar Sinha, National Security Advisory Board member and former Ambassador to Afghanistan.

Also read | U.S.-Taliban agreement | India hails peace deal in “contiguous neighbour”

However, Mr. Sinha added that “all Taliban demands have been front-loaded, while the actual terms of the ‘peace deal’ are yet to be negotiated between the Taliban and the Afghan side, facilitated by the U.S. So, much of the heavy lifting remains.”

More critical of the agreement, Anand Arni, former Special Secretary in the Research & Analysis Wing, who worked closely on Indian policy in Afghanistan, said it was “entirely one-sided”. “Taliban cannot deliver on the assurances it has given, and yet the U.S. has handed over Afghanistan to them. There is no reference to the Constitution, rule of law, democracy and elections,” he said.

The salient points of concern are:

Does the term “U.S. and Allies” include India?

In the Doha agreement, the Taliban has guaranteed “enforcement mechanisms that will prevent the use of the soil of Afghanistan by any group or individual against the security of the United States and its allies”. However, it is unclear whether India, which is not a U.S. ally, is included in this definition, and whether Pakistan-backed groups that threaten India, would still operate in Afghanistan. The Kabul declaration with the Ghani government more specifically commits to stopping “any international terrorist groups or individuals, including al-Qa’ida and ISIS-K, from using Afghan soil to threaten the security of the United States, its allies and other countries.”

Impact of prisoner release and lifting sanctions

Officials worry most about the “mainstreaming of the Haqqani network”, which Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists reportedly fight alongside and were responsible for the 2008 bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul. According to the agreements, 5,000 Taliban prisoners will be released by March 10, 2020, the first day of intra-Afghan negotiations, and the remainder in another three months. Officials also point out that the U.S. has committed to taking Taliban leaders off the UN Security Council’s sanctions list by May 29, 2020, which could considerably bring down the number of terrorists Pakistan is accused of harbouring, according to the FATF greylist conditions. This might benefit Pakistan during the June 2020 FATF Plenary, when it faces a blacklist for not complying.

Handing powers to Taliban

In the Doha agreement, the U.S. has committed to clearing five bases and bringing troop levels down to 8,600 in four and a half months, and even appears to submit to the possibility of a Taliban-led government, by extracting promises that the Taliban will not provide “visas, passports, travel documents or asylum” to those threatening the U.S. and its allies. This appears to sideline the “Intra-Afghan” dialogue, and India’s support for the election process for leadership in Afghanistan. In the last section of the agreement, the U.S. and Taliban seek “positive relations with each other and expect that the relations between the United States and the new post-settlement Afghan Islamic government as determined by the intra-Afghan dialogue and negotiations will be positive”.

Afghan govt. in peril?

This indicates that the Ghani government, which India has recognised as winner of the 2019 election, will only serve for an interim period. This also raises a big question mark on the future of Afghanistan’s government, and whether it will remain a democracy. “The bottomline is that India cannot look at the agreements or the route to Kabul via Washington’s view,” said Mr. Arni.

Above all, experts warned the Afghanistan-Pakistan dialogue facilitated by the U.S. on cross-border terrorism and mechanisms must not cut India out of the region’s security architecture.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7o4lrx/article30958528.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Zalmay-Talibanjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/experts-raise-concerns-for-india-over-us-taliban-agreement/article30958002.ece

38,2020/03/01,Ankara confirms action against Syrian regime,"Turkey on Sunday announced the launch of an offensive against the Moscow-backed Syrian regime.

Tensions have soared between Russia and Turkey — who back opposing forces in the Syria’s civil war — after an airstrike blamed on Damascus killed dozens of Turkish soldiers in Idlib last week.

Turkish and Syrian military exchanged fire over the weekend with Syrian forces targetting a Turkish drone and artillery and Ankara claiming to have shot down two Syrian fighter jets.

The situation in rebel-held Idlib was already volatile as the regime supported by Russian air power pressed an assault on the region, killing hundreds of civilians, in a bid to retake the last opposition enclave in an eight-year civil war.

The confrontation between the Russia-backed Syrian military and NATO-member Turkey, which supports Syrian rebels, has prompted worries over a wider conflict.

Migrant numbers have already surged along the rugged frontier after Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, seeking to pressure the EU over Syria, said the country had “opened the doors” to Europe.

“Following the heinous attack on February 27 in Idlib, operation ‘Spring Shield’ successfully continues,” Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said in a video shared by the Defence Ministry.

Turkish forces hit Syrian regime positions after Mr. Erdogan warned Damascus would “pay a price” for the air strike that killed 34 Turkish troops inside Idlib on Thursday.

39,2020/03/01,‘Spoilers’ may try to sabotage peace process in Afghanistan: Pakistan Foreign Minister,"Shah Mehmood Qureshi said that he told Mike Pompeo that it was also key to see the optics of the intra-Afghan dialogue, address political uncertainties in Afghanistan and mobilise international support for its rebuilding

Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Sunday warned that “spoilers” could try to sabotage the peace process in Afghanistan, a day after the US and the Taliban signed a landmark deal in Doha to bring lasting peace in the war-torn country.

Mr. Qureshi was among several foreign dignitaries who attended the signing ceremony in Qatar on Saturday.

Addressing a press conference in Islamabad on his return from Doha, Mr. Qureshi said he met US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after the signing ceremony and highlighted that it was important to deter the “spoilers”.

“There are spoilers both within Afghanistan and outside, you will have to keep a lookout for them and deter them. You have to identify them and put them to blame and shame - a mechanism is needed for that,” he said.

Mr. Qureshi said that he told Mr. Pompeo that it was also key to see the optics of the intra-Afghan dialogue, address political uncertainties in Afghanistan and mobilise international support for its rebuilding.

“The role that Pakistan has played as facilitator was being acknowledged and praised. People who used to criticise Pakistan were appreciating its role yesterday,” he said.

Support from Pakistan

He said Pakistan would extend full support to the intra-Afghan dialogue to bring last peace in the war-torn country, but noted that the ultimate responsibilities were on the Afghans.

“It has to be seen whether the Afghan leadership agrees to sit and make a political roadmap. They are the ones who have to make the decision as to what kind of Afghanistan they want,” he said.

He said Norway had expressed its willingness to hold the intra-Afghan dialogue.

Mr. Qureshi said it would be also important for the Taliban to cut off links with al-Qaeda and other terror groups to the satisfaction of the world.

Mr. Qureshi also said Pakistan expected Afghanistan would not allow any country “such as India or any other, use their soil against Pakistan”.

He said the agreement generated positive momentum which should be maintained and “one thing that can do this is the release of prisoners”.

He said the Taliban were successful in reducing violence across the country which “had not seen such a reduction of violence in the past”.

The foreign minister said the deal signed in Doha could pave the way for full withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan in the next 14 months.

Mr. Qureshi also called the agreement as “harbinger” of peace and said Pakistan would be benefit from peace in Afghanistan.

40,2020/03/01,Tough talks ahead as Ghani rejects Taliban prisoner swap,"Clause part of pact that lays out foreign forces’ pullout plan

Afghanistan’s weakened government protested on Sunday against a key component of a deal between the U.S. and the Taliban, setting the scene for fractious talks when Kabul and the insurgents meet to strike a separate agreement.

President Ashraf Ghani, who faces a political crisis following claims of fraud in his recent re-election, said he would not commit to a clause in the U.S.-Taliban deal that calls for a massive prisoner exchange, something the militants have been demanding for years.

The swap is one part of the accord, fleshed out over more than a year of talks between the U.S. and the Taliban, that was signed Saturday in Doha and lays out a 14-month withdrawal timetable for all foreign forces -- provided the militants fulfil various pledges and open talks with Kabul.

Also Read Taliban starts diplomatic outreach after U.S. deal on Afghanistan

Mr. Ghani committed to continue honouring a partial truce that has seen violence plummet in Afghanistan, but he pushed back against the requirement for the Taliban to release up to 1,000 prisoners and for the Afghan government to release around 5,000 insurgent captives by March 10, when talks are supposed to start.

The agreement says the “United States commits to completing this goal” of releasing the Taliban prisoners, but it is unclear how that would happen if Kabul is not on board.

5,000 prisoners

“There is no commitment to releasing 5,000 prisoners,” Mr. Ghani told a rare press conference, noting that any release is “not in the authority of the US, it is in the authority of the Afghan government”.

“It could be included in the agenda of the intra-Afghan talks, but cannot be a prerequisite for talks,” he said.

‘Biggest challenge’

While supporters of Saturday’s accord say it marks a critical first step toward peace, many Afghans fear it amounts to little more than a dressed-up U.S. surrender that will ultimately see the Taliban return to power.

The extent to which that happens hinges on the coming “intra-Afghan” dialogue between the Taliban, the Ghani administration, and other Afghan political players.

But critics say Mr. Ghani has prioritised his re-election over making a deal with the Taliban, and has struggled to finalise who will negotiate with the Islamic militants.

Also Read Taliban starts diplomatic outreach after U.S. deal on Afghanistan

“The biggest challenge right now is the lack of preparedness of the Afghan government to negotiate, even though they knew for several years... that this was going to happen and that these would be the parameters of the deal,” Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said.

“It would be an extremely lucky situation if in 14 months there was a deal signed with the Taliban,” she added, referring to the timeline under which all foreign forces are supposed to quit Afghanistan.

After Mr. Ghani’s re-election was confirmed last month, his bitter rival Abdullah Abdullah immediately rejected the result and vowed to set up a rival administration. Washington has pointedly not congratulated Mr. Ghani.

Political deal-making is notoriously difficult in Afghanistan, a country still riven by tribal and ethnic rivalries, and where squabbling leaders and warlords struggle to find common ground on important issues.

The Taliban had, until now, refused to negotiate with Mr. Ghani’s government — which they considered a U.S. puppet regime.

41,2020/03/01,Migrants head to Greece as Turkey relaxes curbs,"33 Turkish soldiers die in Syrian strike

Greece placed its borders on maximum security footing on Sunday after hundreds of migrants used porous crossing points to enter the country from Turkey, with thousands behind them seeking entry after Ankara relaxed curbs on their movement.

Turkey said on Thursday it would no longer restrain hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers in its territory from reaching Europe despite a deal to do so reached with the EU in 2016.

Turkey’s turnabout came after an air strike killed 33 Turkish soldiers in neighbouring northwest Syria, where Ankara has deployed forces to help secure its border against a new influx of refugees from the Syrian civil war.

Turkey has said funds promised by the EU to help it deal with 3.7 million Syrian refugees already in the country has been slow to arrive; Ankara had threatened several times in the past to open the floodgates if it did not receive more support.

Its announcement that it had stopped containing migrants within the country triggered an almost instant rush to the borders it shares with EU member Greece.

42,2020/03/01,Pope Francis says a cold will force him to skip spiritual retreat,"The pope has taken ill at a time when Italy is battling a surging outbreak of the potentially deadly coronavirus

Pope Francis announced on Sunday that a cold he is suffering from will force him to skip a week-long Lenten spiritual retreat with senior Vatican officials that had been due to start later in the day.

The pope made the surprise announcement to thousands of people in St. Peter's Square during his first public appearance since last Wednesday, when he was seen coughing and sneezing.

“Unfortunately a cold will force me not take part this year (in the retreat). I will follow the meditations from here,” he said. It is the first time that Francis has missed the annual retreat south of Rome since his election in March, 2013.

The Vatican had previously said only that he was suffering from a “slight indisposition”.

He coughed several times while making his brief address on Sunday and sounded like he had a stuffy nose.

43,2020/03/01,"COVID-19: Iran reports 11 new virus deaths, taking total to 54","According to health ministry spokesman, testing across the country showed there were 385 new cases.

Iran's health ministry on Sunday reported 11 new deaths from the COVID-19 and 385 infections, bringing the overall number of lives lost to 54 and cases to 978.

“Eleven people lost their lives” in the past 24 hours, spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a televised news conference, adding that testing across the country showed there were 385 new cases.

What is the real size of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran?

International experts are questioning the scale of the new coronavirus epidemic in Iran, where the official death toll is second only to China and risks creating a regional epicentre of contagion.

While Iran has acknowledged 43 deaths among 593 confirmed infections nationwide — with a vice-president and deputy health minister among those testing positive — unofficial tolls are much higher.

The London-based BBC Persian service says 210 people have been killed by the virus; a figure it says it collated from hospital sources.

Also Read China says will repatriate overseas citizens if needed due to COVID-19

The report was immediately dismissed by Iran's health ministry.

The People's Mujahedin, an exiled organisation that Tehran considers a terrorist group, claims that the epidemic has killed ""more than 300"", while infecting up to 15,000 across the country.

Six epidemiologists based in Canada used a mathematical model to estimate that there have been more than 18,000 cases on Iranian soil.

Their calculations — not yet peer reviewed — take into account the number of cases in other countries that originated from Iran.

""When a country exports cases to other destinations it's very likely that the burden of infection in this country is significant"", according to Isaac Bogoch, coauthor of the study and a specialist in infectious diseases at the University of Toronto.

'Position of weakness'

This week, Reporters Without Borders added its own criticism of Tehran's handling of the outbreak, accusing the government of stifling news on the spread of the virus.

“The authorities insist they have the situation under control but they have... obstructed journalists trying to cover the story,” the media advocacy group said in a statement.

On Saturday, Iran's health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour responded to the criticisms, accusing foreign media of spreading false news.

“Among Iran's radicals, there is an obsession with not giving ammunition to the enemy and avoiding appearing weak,” said Thierry Coville, an Iran analyst at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.

Iranian Twitter user Assieh Bakeri speculated: “Talking about coronavirus could soon be considered troubling for public opinion, undermining public security and insulting the president!”

Economic crisis weighs

More than seven percent of people in Iran confirmed to be infected with the virus have died, according to Iran's official data, a far higher mortality rate than in other countries.

In China, 3.5% of infected people have reportedly died. In Italy, another country hit hard by the virus, the death rate is reported at two percent.

“In Iran, for example, they started detecting patients based on death. So if you calculate the case/fatality rate that way, it is going to be very high,” said Cecile Viboud, an epidemiologist at the National Institutes of Health in the United States.

Whatever the reliability of official figures, Iran is certainly one of the main centres of contamination outside China.

The situation is aggravated by an economic crisis, as the country grapples with the effect of Washington re-imposing sanctions in 2018 -- a move that hit oil exports and provoked a recession.

‘""Why did Iran not stop flights to China? There is a rational explanation — China is one of the last countries buying their oil. They need to maintain the economic link,” Coville said.

“With the sanctions, we can say that the government has lost at least 30 percent of its budget revenues. This has inevitably had an impact on their health system,” he added.

Situated at a geographical crossroads in the Middle East and surrounded by countries with creaking infrastructure and challenging humanitarian conditions, Iran's situation gives cause for worry.

“This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics”, the Canadian study concluded.

Azerbaijan, Iraq, Canada, Georgia, Lebanon, New Zealand and Qatar have now confirmed coronavirus infections among people arriving from Iran.

Iranian authorities have taken measures to counter the virus' spread, including cancelling Friday prayers in several cities, closing schools until at least Tuesday, shutting parliament until ""further notice"" and restricting travel within the country.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/z3w0ar/article30956508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAN-COVID19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-iran-reports-more-new-virus-deaths-and-more-cases/article30956509.ece

Pakistan will close its border with Afghanistan for seven days from Monday to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus, the Interior Ministry said on Sunday, as the authorities ramped up efforts to stop the new cases of infection.

The announcement came a day after two more people tested positive for COVID-19 in Pakistan, taking the total number of infections in the country to four.

“During the period, necessary measures will be taken to safeguard the health of the people of both countries,” it said.

The authorities have shut schools in the southern province of Sindh, including in Karachi where the first case was reported, and the southwestern province of Baluchistan, which borders Iran, The Express Tribune reported.

They have also begun to trace nearly 8,000 pilgrims who recently returned to the country from Iran.

The authorities have kept more than 200 of the pilgrims in quarantine at the Taftan border and have stepped up scanning measures at airports and other border crossings, including in western Afghanistan, said government health adviser Zafar Mirza.

45,2020/03/01,Explained | Why is Israel holding its third election in a year?,"Israelis head to the polls on Monday with a sense of deja vu after trying and failing twice in the past year to break the country's political deadlock.

Why so many elections?

In late 2018, Benjamin Netanyahu, veteran leader of Israel's right-wing Likud Party, seemed to be at the peak of his powers.

The dominant political figure of his generation, Mr. Netanyahu was about to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister.

But he had a one-seat majority in parliament, and called a snap election for April 9, 2019.

Also read: Editorial | A second election for Israel

The immediate reason given was the vulnerability of his ruling coalition after the resignation of Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman. More hawkish than even Netanyahu, Lieberman quit, accusing the prime minister of being too soft on Palestinian militants in Gaza.

But many Israelis saw it as a ploy by Mr. Netanyahu to gain a renewed public mandate to ward off prosecutors who were then in the final stages of drafting charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust against him.

Once re-elected, the theory went, Mr. Netanyahu could say an indictment was not in the national interest. He denies wrongdoing, accusing his enemies of a witch-hunt.

What went wrong?

No single party in Israel has ever won an outright majority in parliament, and Mr. Netanyahu failed to get enough seats.

He struggled for weeks to put together a government. Then, rather than let his principal rival - former armed forces chief Benny Gantz - have a chance to form a government, Mr. Netanyahu triggered another election, on Sept. 17.

What happened in election number two?

Again Mr. Netanyahu fell short. Likud and Mr. Gantz's centrist Blue and White Party ended in a virtual tie.

That left Lieberman a king-maker. But Lieberman cited policy differences with both men to avoid anointing either.

After months of horse-trading in which Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz both failed to win enough support, the outcome, much to the dismay of the jaded Israeli electorate, was Monday's election.

Is this time any different?

Yes. Since the previous election, formal criminal charges have been filed against Netanyahu. Prosecution is now a reality, not a possibility. His trial is due to open on March 17, just two weeks after the election.

Also, both previous elections were fought without the electorate knowing the contents of U.S. President Donald Trump's long-delayed Middle East peace plan.

That was published in January, and would grant U.S. recognition to Israel's settlements in the occupied West Bank.

Palestinians were furious, saying it gives away land they seek for a future state. Netanyahu pledged to annex the settlements after the election.

Could Netanyahu win this time?

Mr.Netanyahu will need to win support from other parties if he is to form a coalition government with at least 61 of the parliament's 120 seats.

The court hearings will prompt rivals to demand that he resign, even before sentencing. A verdict is likely to be months away, and the appeals process could take years.

Could Netanyahu lose to Gantz?

Opinion polls have shown Liked and Blue and White virtually neck and neck, with Mr. Netanyahu's party edging slightly ahead in the final stages of the campaign.

Mr. Netanyahu is a known quantity. Mr. Gantz, barring an unexpected surge in centrist voters he would have to bring together rightists and those representing Israel's Arab minority, which are on opposite sides of the political spectrum.

Could there be a fourth election?

Yes, if Monday's prolongs the deadlock. But some Israeli politicians regard this as unacceptable. Aside from political instability, it would mean further fiscal paralysis for Israel under a continuing caretaker government.

That could lead to the defection of some former Likud partners to a Gantz-led coalition.

What about a ‘national unity’ government?

Many Israelis would like Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz to unite, to end the bickering. But Mr. Gantz says he will not partner with Mr. Netanyahu now that an indictment has been filed.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wraqfd/article30673965.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH28NETANYAHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/explained-why-is-israel-holding-its-third-election-in-a-year/article30956044.ece
46,2020/03/01,Olympics | Japan’s crowdless sports: A prelude to a COVID-19-hit Games?,"“If the Olympics look like this, it's going to be a sad sight,” said 68-year-old shoemaker Hiroshi Enomoto, one of the fistful of spectators cheering on the runners in the downtown area of Asakusa.

A line of masked spectators raises muffled cheers for elite marathon runners, and a baseball bat's thud on a ball echoes around a vast, empty stadium: Sports in Tokyo this weekend set the tone for how a coronavirus-hit Olympic Games could play out.

For the first time ever, Japan's professional baseball teams staged pre-season openers behind closed doors after the country dramatically escalated its response to the global coronavirus epidemic by closing schools and cancelling mass events.

In Tokyo, Sunday's staging of the annual marathon, which last year saw close to 38,000 amateur participants, was scaled back to just a few hundred professional athletes, with the public strongly discouraged from lining the route. In past years the event attracted more than 1 million roadside spectators.

“If the Olympics look like this, it's going to be a sad sight,” said 68-year-old shoemaker Hiroshi Enomoto, one of the fistful of spectators cheering on the runners in the downtown area of Asakusa.

The Olympic marathon itself has been moved to Japan's northernmost island of Hokkaido because of worries over Tokyo's scorching summer heat, but Mr. Enomoto and others wondered whether this weekend's crowdless events were a harbinger of things to come.

“There are maybe 20% of the number of people who came to see the race last year. Normally, it's so packed you can barely breathe,” said Mr. Enomoto, who remembers seeing the 1964 Olympic torch relay passing through Asakusa.

Barely 30 minutes after the runners zipped through the neighbourhood's sun-soaked streets, staffers clad in bright vests removed plastic barriers and cleaning trucks swooped in to pick up trash.

About an hour later, Birhanu Legese from Ethiopia arrived at the finishing line in sight of the Imperial Palace in 2:04:15. Japan's Suguru Osako ended fourth in 2:05.29, beating his own national record and securing a spot in the men's field for the Olympics.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the president of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach have said the Games will go ahead. Mr. Bach said his organization was “fully committed” to the July 24 start, dismissing other options as “speculation”.

But the sports event cancellations and other measures were not limited to the marathon. Soccer and rugby have also been affected, and Japan's sumo association was to make a call later in the day on what to do with its next tournament, slated to start in Osaka next Sunday.

Baseball fans who on Saturday had to swap the 46,000-capacity indoor stadium of the Yomiuri Giants - Japan's version of the New York Yankees - for a sports bar in central Tokyo said they hoped the virus would not impact the Games.

“I don't think the Olympics will be cancelled. I'd like to see them, so if possible, I want them to go ahead,” said Natsuki Tsukamoto, 26, in between sips of beer and bites of fried chicken.

Deprived of the support of Tsukamoto and other fans at the Tokyo Dome, the Giants slumped to a 3:5 loss to their cross-town rivals, the Yakult Swallows.

Elsewhere, the manager of Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles baseball team, Hajime Miki, reflected on the importance of spectators to sport after another game played in the absence of fans.

“It made us realise again that the cheering and getting the fans to see the games gives power to the players,” said Mr. Miki.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k2eoel/article30939665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OLYMPICS-IOC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/olympics-japans-crowdless-sports-a-prelude-to-a-coronavirus-hit-games/article30956038.ece

48,2020/03/01,Taliban starts diplomatic outreach after U.S. deal on Afghanistan,"Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar met Foreign Ministers from Turkey, Uzbekistan and Norway in Doha along with diplomats from Russia, Indonesia and neighbouring nations.

The Taliban's political chief has met with senior diplomats from countries including Russia, Indonesia and Norway, hours after signing a deal with Washington aimed at ending the Afghan war, the hardline Islamist group said in a statement on Sunday.

Saturday's accord was signed in the Qatari capital Doha by U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on hand to witness the ceremony.

Soon after the agreement, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be personally meeting leaders of the Taliban in the near future and rejected criticism surrounding the deal signed with the Islamist insurgents.

Mr. Baradar met Foreign Ministers from Turkey, Uzbekistan and Norway in Doha along with diplomats from Russia, Indonesia and neighbouring nations, the Taliban said, a move that signalled the group's determination to secure international legitimacy.

“The dignitaries who met Mullah Baradar expressed their commitments towards Afghanistan's reconstruction and development... the U.S.-Taliban agreement is historical,” said Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid.

“Baradar received congratulatory messages and thanked them (ministers and diplomats) for attending the ceremony,” he said.

In the agreement, the United States said it is committed to reducing the number of its troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 from the current 13,000 within 135 days of signing the deal, and working with its allies to proportionally reduce the number of coalition forces in Afghanistan over that period, if the Taliban adhere to their security guarantees and ceasefire.

A full withdrawal of all U.S. and coalition forces would occur within 14 months of the deal getting signed, if the Taliban hold up their end of the deal, the joint statement said.

Prior to the signing ceremony, the Taliban had ordered all its fighters in Afghanistan to refrain from violence against civilians, Afghan and western forces.

“The fanfare around the signing ceremony proved that many countries are willing to start fresh talks with Taliban leadership... they are also working fast to secure the validation too,” said a senior U.S. diplomat who was present at the signing ceremony in Doha.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/t6ow7f/article30955935.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TALIBAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taliban-start-diplomatic-outreach-after-us-deal-on-afghanistan/article30955860.ece
49,2020/03/01,Thailand records first COVID-19 death: health official,"Thailand has recorded 42 coronavirus cases since January, with 30 of those recovering and 11 still being treated in hospitals, according to the department

A 35-year-old Thai man who also had dengue fever has died from a coronavirus infection, Thailand's first death from the COVID-19 disease, Suwanchai Wattanayingcharoen, director-general of the Department of Disease Control, said on Sunday.

Thailand has recorded 42 coronavirus cases since January, with 30 of those recovering and 11 still being treated in hospitals, according to the department.

Thai health officials said the dead man had worked in the retail sector, where he had come into contact with many tourists during the early stages of the outbreak.

“This was a case of local transmission, and he was at risk because he had exposure to Chinese tourists,” Mr. Suwanchai said, speaking at a news conference.

The patient was first admitted to a private hospital for dengue fever on Jan. 27. He was later diagnosed with the coronavirus and transferred on Feb.5 to the government's main treatment centre, Suwanchai said.

He died from multiple-organ failure late on Saturday.

New measures to deal with the spread of the coronavirus - earlier introduced by Thailand's National Committee on Communicable Diseases - came into effect on Sunday.

53,2020/03/01,Muhyiddin Yassin sworn in as Malaysian Prime Minister,"The swearing-in capped a week of turmoil that began with Mahathir's resignation in an apparent bid to consolidate power

Malaysia's Muhyiddin Yassin, a Malay nationalist politician backed by the corruption-tarnished former ruling party, was sworn in as Prime Minister on March 1 after the King picked him to replace 94-year-old Mahathir Mohamad.

The swearing-in capped a week of turmoil that began with Mahathir's resignation in an apparent bid to consolidate power, but ended with him sidelined and complaining of betrayal after decades dominating Malaysian politics.

Mahathir promised to seek a vote in parliament to challenge Muhyiddin's support, but conceded he might not win.

Muhyiddin, 72, was sworn in at a palace ceremony in front of Malaysia's King, Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, and promised to fulfil his duties as prime minister.

The change in leadership comes less than two years after Mahathir joined old rival Anwar Ibrahim, 72, to defeat the ruling party of six decades, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), on an anti-corruption platform. “This is a very strange thing,” said Mahathir. “This is the losers that will form the government,” he added, referring to the outcome of the 2018 election.

He said he had the support of 114 of parliament's 222 members, but it was not guaranteed that they would all support him at a vote in a country of tangled political interests where horse-trading is commonplace.

Mathathir questioned whether a government involving the former ruling party would be as ready to pursue graft cases against its politicians. Those include former prime minister Najib Razak, who is now on trial for corruption.

Also read: Malaysian king summons Mahathir, who’s trying to be PM again

A week of twists and turns in Malaysian politics began with Mahathir's resignation, breaking his alliance with Anwar as he proposed a national unity government without party loyalties that would have given him greater authority.

But Anwar then launched his own bid to become prime minister while Muhyiddin built his alliance.

King’s choice

It was down to the King to decide who would have the best chance to form a government. Although Mahathir and Anwar said they had reunited on Saturday and now had majority support, the King announced Muhyiddin as the candidate.

About 200 protesters gathered in Kuala Lumpur late on Saturday to protest against the King's decision. Police said they were investigating a Twitter post that encouraged people to join the protest, which they said was illegal.

Muhyiddin is from Mahathir's Bersatu party, but had shown himself ready to work with UMNO - from which he had been sacked in 2016 after questioning former prime minister Najib's handling of the 1MDB corruption scandal.

UMNO's fortunes have risen since its 2018 defeat, with the Pakatan coalition of Mahathir and Anwar losing five by-elections in the face of criticism from some Malay voters that it could do more to favour the biggest ethnic group in a nation of 32 million.

UMNO, which Mahathir led from 1981 to 2003 during a previous stint as prime minister, supports Malay nationalism.

“I think Muhyiddin would lead a more overtly pro-ethnic Malay government characterised by social division, economic nationalism, and possibly less fiscal restraint,” said Peter Mumford of the Eurasia consultancy.

As well as personal relationships, politics in Malaysia is shaped by ethnic, religious and regional interests. Malaysia is more than half ethnic Malay, but has large ethnic Chinese, Indian and other minorities.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nmq2t9/article30955483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MALAYSIAPOLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/muhyiddin-yassin-sworn-in-as-malaysian-prime-minister/article30955486.ece

56,2020/03/01,"Joe Biden wins South Carolina, establishes himself as a leading rival to Bernie Sanders","The victory came at a a crucial moment in Biden’s 2020 bid as he bounced back from underwhelming performances in the first three contests

Joe Biden scored a convincing victory in South Carolina’s Democratic primary on Saturday, riding a wave of African American support and ending progressive rival Bernie Sanders’ winning streak.

The victory came at a a crucial moment in Biden’s 2020 bid as he bounced back from underwhelming performances in the first three contests and headed into “Super Tuesday,” when voters in 14 states go to the polls and about a third of the delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination are at stake.

Biden hopes the South Carolina victory will be enough to establish him as the clear alternative to Sanders as the race quickly shifts nationwide. Standing in Biden’s way, in addition to Sanders, is former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, one of the world’s richest men, who has spent more than half a billion dollars courting voters in dozens of states yet to vote.

The South Carolina primary was the first major test of the candidates’ appeal among black voters. And while it gave the 77-year-old Biden a win when he most needed it, he must still prove that he has the financial and organizational resources to dramatically expand his campaign in the next 72 hours. He will also be under pressure to rely on his decades-long relationships with party leaders to create a new sense of inevitability around his candidacy.

Even before news of Biden’s win was declared, Bloomberg announced his own plan to deliver a three-minute prime-time address Sunday night on two television networks. He didn’t say how much he paid for the air time, which is unprecedented in recent decades.

And Sanders was already peeking ahead to Super Tuesday, betting he can amass an insurmountable delegate lead at that point. After two consecutive victories and a tie for the lead in Iowa, the 78-year-old Vermont senator’s confidence is surging.

Sanders was spending the lead-up to Super Tuesday campaigning in the home states of two major Democratic rivals, betting he can score a double knockout blow - or at least limit the size of their victories.

In a power play, Sanders hosted a midday rally Saturday in downtown Boston, campaigning in the heart of liberal ally Elizabeth Warren’s political turf. Addressing a crowd of thousands on the Boston Common, Sanders said his success in the Democratic primary means “the establishment is getting very nervous” - but he never predicted victory in South Carolina.

On the eve of Super Tuesday, Sanders will host a concert in Minnesota, where home-state Sen. Amy Klobuchar is looking for her first win.

Senior adviser Jeff Weaver was among the staffers dispatched to California on Saturday. He said Sanders is aggressively hunting for delegates, noting that their campaign’s experience during the 2016 primary against Hillary Clinton taught them that any candidate who finishes Super Tuesday with a significant delegate advantage will be difficult to catch.

""I’m confident we’re going to do very, very well across the country,” Weaver said of the coming four days. He also sought to downplay the importance of South Carolina, where “Biden is expected to win.”

""For the vice president, he needs an extraordinarily large win in South Carolina in order to convince folks he’s going to be able to go the distance,” he said.

Yet the Democrats’ 2020 primary election is far from a two-person race.

In South Carolina, billionaire activist Tom Steyer has spent more than $19 million on television advertising - more than all the other candidates combined - in his quest for his first top finish in four contests. At his state campaign headquarters on Saturday, Steyer said he felt optimistic going into the vote and was looking ahead to trips to Alabama and Texas, two Super Tuesday states.

Not ceding anything, Pete Buttigieg is fighting to prove he can build a multiracial coalition. And with the help of super PACs, Warren and Klobuchar have vowed to keep pushing forward no matter how they finish on Saturday.

Still, Saturday was all about Biden and whether he might convince anxious establishment Democrats rally behind him at last.

Elected officials inclined to embrace his moderate politics had been reluctant to support him after bad finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire and a distant second place in Nevada last week. Yet fearing Sanders’ polarizing progressive priorities, they’re still searching for an alternative who’s viewed as a safer bet to defeat Trump in November.

Senior Biden adviser Symone Sanders shifted away from calling South Carolina Biden’s “firewall” and instead called it a “springboard,” on par with how the state boosted the presidential aspirations of Barack Obama in 2008 and Clinton in 2016.

That sentiment was echoed by former senior Obama adviser David Axelrod, who said a big Biden win in South Carolina could give him a Super Tuesday boost that might force several candidates to quickly consider whether to proceed, including Bloomberg.

""If Biden wins by a big margin, it will translate into a bigger day for him on Tuesday,” Axelrod said. “And if he beats Bloomberg by a significant margin on Tuesday, Bloomberg is going to have to consider what he’s doing here.”

Indeed, South Carolina represents much more than the fourth state on the Democrats’ months-long primary calendar.

It serves as the first major test of the candidates’ strength with African American voters, who will be critical both in the general election and the rest of the primary season.

Roughly three in 10 people of voting age in South Carolina are black, according to census data.

There was evidence that Biden’s status as former President Obama’s two-term vice president helped him win over African Americans.

About 4 in 10 voters in South Carolina wanted to return to the politics of the past, compared to about a third in Iowa and New Hampshire. That includes the roughly 50% of African American voters who said they want a Democratic presidential nominee who would emulate the Obama’s presidency, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the electorate.

By comparison, roughly two-thirds of white voters wanted a presidential candidate who would bring fundamental change to Washington.

While voting technology was a concern in two of the last three primary contests, South Carolina uses a wide array of voting technology that presents unique challenges.

Saturday’s election in South Carolina marks the first statewide test of its new fleet of electronic voting machines, a $50 million upgrade from an old and vulnerable system that lacked any paper record of individual votes. The new machines produce a paper record that can be verified by the voter and checked after the election to detect any malfunction or manipulation.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/s08bbk/article30955347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTION2020JOEBIDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/joe-biden-wins-south-carolina-establishes-himself-as-a-leading-rival-to-bernie-sanders/article30955348.ece
57,2020/03/01,"COVID-19 | Germany has means to respond if virus sparks economic crisis, says Finance Minister","Earlier this week, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said Germany may introduce tax breaks to cushion the effect of the coronavirus should the epidemic worsen

Germany would be in a position to enact a fiscal stimulus package should the coronavirus spark a global economic crisis, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said in remarks published on Sunday.

The spread of the virus has raised fears of a pandemic. In Germany there have been 66 confirmed cases, and a government crisis committee on Friday widened cross-border travel guidelines and cancelled major international events.

“Should it come to major turmoil in the global economy because world markets and production centres become affected, we have all the means to act fast and decisively,” Scholz told Welt am Sonntag newspaper. “Our fiscal policy is built on a solid footing so that we can deal with a major economic crisis with full force.”

The German economy, Europe's biggest, has been weakening as its export-oriented manufacturers languish in a recession. There are fears the coronavirus outbreak could sink Germany into a recession, given the economy's reliance on exports and Chinese supply chains.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's right-left government has resisted calls to take on new debt to finance a fiscal stiumuls to revive a stalling economy. Any decision to unleash a fiscal stimulus would need approval from both Merkel's conservatives and their Social Democrat (SPD) junior coalition partners.

The SPD's Scholz said: “If the situation demands that such a stimulus is necessary, we have the means to introduce a fiscal stimulus programme.”

58,2020/03/01,"In good early sign for Biden, exit polls find Clyburn endorsement influential in South Carolina","About six in 10 voters in South Carolina's Democratic primary on Saturday said influential congressman James Clyburn's endorsement of Joe Biden was a factor in their decision - a good early sign for Mr. Biden's chances in the pivotal early nominating state, early exit polls showed.

The polls by Edison Research also found about half of South Carolina voters want a candidate who will return to Democratic President Barack Obama's policies, a key argument of Mr. Biden, who was Obama's vice president. That compares with three in 10 who want more liberal policies.

Mr. Biden is aiming for a decisive win in South Carolina - the fourth state to weigh in on the Democratic race to find a challenger to Republican President Donald Trump - to resuscitate his struggling campaign against national front-runner Bernie Sanders, a progressive U.S. senator from Vermont.

The contest in the Southern state is taking place just three days before Super Tuesday elections in 14 states, which will award one-third of the available national delegates in a single day.

South Carolina, where African Americans account for 60% of the Democratic electorate, is seen as a last stand for Mr. Biden. The onetime front-runner faltered in national polls after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.

His second-place finish in Nevada's caucuses a week ago, while still far behind Mr. Sanders, provided his campaign fresh momentum, and polls show he is well positioned to win South Carolina.

For months, Mr. Biden's campaign has argued the state would serve as a “firewall” given his strength among African-American voters, and Mr. Biden himself has suggested anything less than a victory would imperil his campaign.

“He's going to show them what he's got,” said Allison Pryor, 57, a retired parole officer from Charleston who said she planned to vote for Mr. Biden.

Mr. Biden's South Carolina effort got a boost on Wednesday when Clyburn, a black congressman from South Carolina, endorsed the former vice president.

With Super Tuesday looming, Mr. Biden hopes a comfortable victory in South Carolina might be enough to blunt the momentum of Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist who Democratic Party leaders worry might be too far left to beat Trump.

After South Carolina, Mr. Biden will also face competition from billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has blanketed the country with half a billion dollars in advertising. Bloomberg skipped the first four states and will be on the ballot for the first time on Tuesday.

“If we win solidly here, I think it's going to raise us a lot of money as well and a lot of enthusiasm,” Mr. Biden told reporters as he greeted supporters at a polling place in Greenville, South Carolina, on Saturday.

Mr. Sanders, with his unabashed populist message of ending economic inequality, has grown stronger with each contest, finishing in a virtual tie for first in Iowa with former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, before notching a narrow win over Buttigieg in New Hampshire and a decisive victory in Nevada.

Mr. Sanders said on Friday he was in “striking distance” in South Carolina.

“We've come a long way,” he said at a church hall in Saint George, a town about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Charleston. ”When we started this campaign here in South Carolina, I think we were 25 or 30 (percentage) points behind. We've made up a lot of ground.”

“The number of migrants moving through Edirne towards the border grew through the day as cars, taxis and buses arrived from Istanbul,” the head of IOM's Turkey mission Lado Gvilava said in the statement.

“Most of those on the move are men but we are also seeing many family groups travelling with young children,” he added.

Mr. Gvilava said the IOM was distributing food and other basic supplies, but with temperatures dropping close to freezing “we're concerned about these vulnerable people who are exposed to the elements.”

IOM staff reported that buses continued into the evening to be “loaded to over-capacity” in Istanbul with people bound for the border area.

The mass movement of people began after Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to open the gates and allow refugees to travel to Europe as a way to pressure EU governments over the Syrian conflict.

Turkey and Russia, who back opposing forces in the Syria conflict, have held talks to defuse tensions after an air strike killed the Turkish troops, sparking fears of a broader war and a new migration crisis for Europe.

At the border Saturday, Greek police clashed with several thousand migrants already gathered at the entrance to EU territory, where they hurled rocks at security forces firing tear gas across the frontier.

In 2015, Greece became the main EU entry point for one million migrants, most of them refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/at-least-13000-migrants-along-turkish-greek-border-un/article30954789.ece
60,2020/03/01,Turkey drone strikes kill 26 Syrian soldiers in NW Syria: monitor,"The apparent retaliation came after 33 Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike by Syrian regime forces on Thursday

Turkish drone strikes killed 26 Syrian soldiers in northwestern Syria Saturday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said.

Earlier in the day, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened reprisals for the killing of dozens of Turkish troops in Syria on Thursday.

“Twenty-six members of the Syrian army were killed when Turkish drones targeted positions of the regime forces in the Idlib and Aleppo countryside,” the Britain-based Observatory said.

The apparent retaliation came after 33 Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike by Syrian regime forces on Thursday. A 34th soldier later died from his injuries.

Russia-backed regime forces have since December led a military offensive against the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib in northwestern Syria, where Turkey supports some rebel groups.

The onslaught has caused almost a million people -- mostly women and children -- to flee their homes and shelters, the United Nations says.

Tensions have spiked in recent weeks between Ankara and Moscow, whose relationship has been tested by violations of a 2018 deal to prevent a regime offensive on Idlib.

Turkey deployed troops to man observation posts in northwestern Syria under that deal.

French President Emmanuel Macron urged his Russian and Turkish counterparts on Saturday to halt hostilities in Syria and agree to a lasting ceasefire, his office said.

Mr. Macron told the Russian and Turkish leaders in separate phone calls that he was “deeply concerned about the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe” caused by the Syrian offensive and its allies in the province of Idlib.

“The President of the Republic stressed that an immediate cease to hostilities was needed and called on Russia and Turkey to establish a durable and verifiable ceasefire as they committed to France and Germany at the four-way summit in Istanbul in the autumn 2018,” his office said in a statement.

62,2020/03/01,COVID-19 | Brazil confirms second case of virus,"Authorities said they were gathering information and more details would be provided later

Brazil's Health Ministry on Saturday confirmed the country's second case of the fast-spreading new coronavirus, diagnosed in a patient in Sŗo Paulo who had recently visited Italy.

Authorities said they were gathering information and more details would be provided later. There was no evidence that the virus was circulating nationwide, the health ministry's statement said.

Brazil's first case of the novel coronavirus was confirmed on Feb. 26, during the country's Carnival holiday, a peak time for domestic travel.

The first confirmed case in Brazil is a 61-year-old man in Sŗo Paulo who also returned recently from Italy and was recovering at home.

There are 83,652 confirmed cases globally, according to the World Health Organization's latest situation report from Friday.

64,2020/03/01,COVID-19 | Trump says U.S. considering restrictions at Mexican border over virus,"Mexico's government said on Friday it had detected three cases of coronavirus infection in three men who had all recently travelled to Italy

The United States is considering shutting off the country's southern border with Mexico to control the spread of the new coronavirus, President Donald Trump said on Saturday, as his administration announced new limits on travellers who have visited Iran and recommended against travel to hard-hit areas of Italy and South Korea.

Mexico's government said on Friday it had detected three cases of coronavirus infection in three men who had all recently travelled to Italy, making the country the second in Latin America to register the fast-spreading flu-like illness.

Asked at a White House press briefing if he was considering closing the U.S.-Mexico border, Mr. Trump said: “Yes, we are thinking about southern border.

Later in the press briefing, however, Mr. Trump played down possible restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border. “We're thinking about all borders,” he said. “We have to think about that border, but ... this is not a border that seems to be much of a problem right now. We hope we won't have to do that.”

Earlier on Saturday, Reuters, citing two Department of Homeland Security officials, reported that the Trump administration was considering imposing entry restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Vice President Mike Pence, whom Mr. Trump appointed earlier this week to be in charge of the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak, said on Saturday the administration will ban non-U.S. citizens who have visited Iran within the last 14 days and are traveling from other countries. There are no direct flights to the United States from Iran.

Deaths in Iran from the coronavirus have risen to 43, an Iranian health official said on Saturday.

The United States already bans the entry of citizens of Iran under travel bans imposed on citizens of several Muslim-majority and other countries, under a measure the administration says is necessary to protect against terrorism attacks.

The White House was to hold a call with airlines later today to discuss the new restrictions, administration officials said.

The State Department is raising its travel advisory to a ”Level 4” “Do Not Travel” for regions of South Korea and Italy that are hard hit by the coronavirus, Mr. Pence said.

The Trump administration has been considering adding South Korea to the restrictions it has already imposed on travellers to China for more than a week, officials said.

Mr. Pence said the State Department will work with Italy and South Korea “to coordinate a screening medical screening in their countries of any individuals that are coming to the United States.”

U.S. public health officials said on Friday they had identified four “presumptive” coronavirus cases believed to have emerged from community transmission of the infection, signalling a turning point in efforts to contain the disease in the United States.

Washington state health officials reported the first patient death from coronavirus in the United States on Saturday. State health officials were due to provide more information at a news conference on Saturday afternoon. No other details were immediately available.

The Trump administration also said on Friday that the United States would invoke a federal defence law to boost production of masks, gloves, gowns and other items.

A group of 11 Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives led by Chip Roy of Texas sent a letter on Friday to top Trump administration officials that pressed for details on the plan to contain the coronavirus at the border with Mexico.

“Given the porous nature of our border, and the continued lack of operational control due to the influence of dangerous cartels, it is foreseeable, indeed predictable, that any outbreak in Central America or Mexico could cause a rush to our border,” the lawmakers said.

A group of three Republican senators led by Martha McSally, of Arizona, sent a similar letter on Friday to the head of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

MEXICAN CASES

Possible restrictions on travellers coming to the United States from Italy could be complicated by that country's participation in Europe's Schengen agreement, which allows travellers and goods to cross frontiers without checks, according to the DHS officials.

U.S. airlines announced drastic cuts this week to their flight schedules to South Korea.

The discussions over possible border restrictions remain in the preliminary phase, but the DHS has considered increased screening of people from certain countries based on that country's medical capacity and volume of travellers to the United States, according to one of the officials.

“The issue of it in our hemisphere is something we are exploring,” said one of the officials. “We are all a little worried now that Mexico has its first cases.”

A Mexican Foreign Ministry official said on Friday that the countries had not discussed possible border restrictions.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yajaxw/article30954139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPVIRUSOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-trump-says-us-considering-restrictions-at-mexican-border-over-virus/article30954140.ece
65,2020/03/01,U.S. President Donald Trump to meet Taliban leaders ‘soon’,"Mr. Trump said he thought the negotiations would be successful because “everyone is tired of war.”

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said he would be personally meeting leaders of the Taliban in the near future and rejected criticism of a deal that the United States signed with Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan.

He spoke hours after U.S. and Taliban representatives signed a deal that could pave the way toward a full withdrawal of foreign soldiers and move closer to ending the 18-year war in Afghanistan.

Mr. Trump said the agreement should allow the United States to draw down troops from 13,000 to 8,600. He held out the possibility of withdrawals beyond that number, but said the United States could quickly move forces back into the country if needed.

Mr. Trump has frequently expressed a desire to put a halt to ”endless wars” and has said he has been personally struck by meeting wounded soldiers who are missing limbs on his visits to Walter Reed Medical Center.

The president came under sharp criticism for the deal from his former national security adviser, John Bolton, who said in a tweet that “signing this agreement with Taliban is an unacceptable risk to America's civilian population.”

“This is an Obama-style deal. Legitimizing Taliban sends the wrong signal to ISIS and al Qaeda terrorists, and to America's enemies generally,” he said, referring to former President Barack Obama, Trump's Democratic predecessor.

Mr. Trump's willingness to meet Taliban leaders at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Maryland, last year was a factor in Bolton's exit from the White House. Taliban violence in Afghanistan prompted Mr. Trump to cancel that meeting.

Mr. Trump rejected the criticism from his former aide.

“Nobody should be criticizing this deal after 19 years. He had his chance, he didn't do it,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Bolton.

Mr. Trump did not say where he would be meeting leaders of the group that has fought the American presence in Afghanistan since war broke out following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

At a White House news conference, Mr. Trump said Afghanistan's neighbors should help maintain stability following the agreement.

Many expect the forthcoming talks between the Afghan sides to be more complicated than the initial deal. But Mr. Trump said he thought the negotiations would be successful because “everyone is tired of war.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/f53lej/article30953990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPVIRUSOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-president-donald-trump-to-meet-taliban-leaders-soon/article30953991.ece
66,2020/03/01,"COVID-19 | Italy reports virus cases top 1,100, deaths reach 29","Civil protection chief Angelo Borrelli said 52% of the people who tested positive for the virus in Italy are being isolated in their homes and not hospitalized

Italian authorities say the country now has more than 1,000 COVID-19 cases and 29 people infected with the virus have died.

The head of Italy’s civil protection agency said during a news conference that the total number reached 1,128 on Saturday. Officials also reported eight more deaths in the previous 24 hours of people with the virus, bring Italy’s total to 29.

Civil protection chief Angelo Borrelli said 52% of the people who tested positive for the virus in Italy are being isolated in their homes and not hospitalized.

They said it would take at least two weeks — the period of incubation — for the effect of the containment measures to show up in fewer new cases.

U.S. advisory

A U.S. government advisory urging Americans to reconsider travel to Italy due to the spread of a new virus is the “final blow” to the nation’s tourism industry, the head of Italy’s hotel federation said Saturday.

The U.S. State Department issued a level three travel advisory — the second-highest level of warning — for the whole of Italy late Friday, saying that the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended “avoiding non-essential travel.”

Other major countries have issued warnings for only defined areas of northern Italy where most cases of the new coronavirus are clustered. The national total reported by Italian health authorities approached 900 on Saturday, the greatest number of any country outside Asia. There have been 21 deaths of people with the virus.

More than 5.6 million Americans visit Italy every year, the second-largest national group behind Germans, according to the most recent statistics. They represent 9% of foreign tourists in Italy, and are among the biggest spenders at an average of 140 euros a day for a collective total of 5 billion euros a year, the hotel federation Federalberghi said.

“We had already registered a slowdown of Americans coming to Italy in recent days,” Federalberghi President Bernabo Bocca said in a statement. “Now, the final blow has arrived.”

Risk of GDP collapse

The Assoturismo Italian tourism federation was already warning that the sector that is responsible for 13% of Italian GDP risked collapse from the virus outbreak’s impact on travel.

March bookings were down 90% in Rome and 80% in Sicily, Assoturismo said, referring to parts of Italy largely untouched by the virus so far. The industry federation estimated that canceled reservations for March would cause 200 million euros in economic damage - and that was before the U.S. upgraded its advice on travelling to Italy.

“This is the darkest moment. Not even September 11 hit so heavily,” the federation’s president, Vittorio Messina, said, referring to the 2001 terror attacks in the United States.

Virus cases in Italy exploded from a handful to hundreds after infection clusters emerged in the Lombardy and Veneto regions on Feb. 21. Venice, the Veneto region’s capital, was recovering from a tourist lull tied to record flooding in November when officials cancelled the final two days of Carnival celebrations this week because of the virus. Bookings dropped immediately

The Italian government late Friday took action to help the tourism industry, such as delaying deadlines for tax payments and a moratorium on industry mortgages.

The hotel federation’s Bocca called the measures insufficient and asked all levels of government to adopt urgent measures to guarantee cash flow to tourism operators to protect jobs and avoid ‘’the collapse of an industry” that operates 300,000 businesses and employs 1.5 million people.

Veneto and Lombardy - dual engines of the Italian economy - remain the hardest hit. Eleven towns, all but one in Lombardy, have been locked down, blocking the movements of more than 50,000 people living and working an hour’s drive from Italy’s financial capital, Milan.

Both regions also closed schools, museums, theaters, cinemas and most public offices, emptying urban centers like Milan, where many companies permitted office workers to telecommute.

Some neighborhood restaurants and shops remained shuttered, and even those that opened had just a handful of tables. The regional train company, Trenord, said its weekday ridership had been 40% of normal.

One Milan restaurant, la Rava e la Fava, put an ad in the local section of the daily Corriere della Sera newspaper to entice clients back. Under the words ‘’Kill Virus” and a photo reminiscent of Uma Thurman’s character in ‘’Kill Bill,” the tongue-in-cheek ad called for ‘’rationality,” and underlined the restaurant’s exemplary hygiene.

“In nearly 15 years of business, we have never sneezed on anyone, nor will we ever, because that is how our grandmother taught us,” the ad read. It signed off- “A safe place.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fi30ki/article30953453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ITALYVIRUSOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-italy-reports-virus-cases-top-1100-deaths-reach-29/article30953454.ece

The first death from the novel coronavirus has been confirmed on U.S. soil, in Washington state, health officials said Saturday, after a handful of cases of unknown origin were detected, indicating the disease was spreading in the country.

The fatality occurred in King county, the most populous in the state and home to Seattle, a city of more than 700,000 people, officials in the state said. The victim was not immediately identified.

“It is a sad day in our state as we learn that a Washingtonian has died from COVID-19. Our hearts go out to his family and friends,” Washington state Governor Jay Inslee said in a statement.

70,2020/03/01,How serious is Germany’s far-right problem?,"Why is the growing popularity of the AfD’s political rise with its focus on refugees a cause for concern?

The story so far: The killing of nine people at two shisha lounges in Hanau, Germany, last week by a person suspected to have a far-right background has heightened concerns about the country’s right-wing extremism. The Hanau attacker had released a manifesto before the assault, targeting mainly those of Kurdish origin, which called for extermination of people in several West Asian countries. In recent years, Germany, like several other European countries, has seen twin far-right problems — growing street violence by extremists against minorities and immigrants and the rapid political rise of the far-right party Alternative for Germany (Alternative für Deutschland or AfD), which has normalised to an extent anti-immigrant rhetoric in the country’s political discourse. The growing popularity of the AfD, which is already represented in all regional parliaments in the country, is what makes Germany more vulnerable to far-right threats than other countries in the continent.

How many far-right groups are there?

Post-war Germany has been wary of nationalist politics and has shown zero tolerance to anti-Semitism and race-related crimes. The Nazi-era crimes are remembered in Germany and taught in schools. The public are banned from using Nazi slogans or symbols and there are laws against Holocaust denial. But despite this culture of atonement and strong legislation to prevent racist crimes, Germany has seen the resurgence of xenophobic groups, especially after the German reunification in 1990. In November 2011, German officials uncovered the National Socialist Underground (NSU), a neo-Nazi terrorist group, which had carried out decade-long underground activities, including a series of murders of immigrants and people of foreign origin. In 2015, a group of people in Freital, a town in Saxony, launched attacks on refugee shelters and political opponents. Known as the Freital Group, they claimed that their actions were aimed at “protecting German people from refugees”. In 2018, eight members of the group were found guilty of terror related crimes. The prosecution argued that the group’s crimes were based on “xenophobic, far-right extremist and Nazi ideology”. They were sentenced for up to 10 years in jail. In 2018, German police arrested members of another neo-Nazi cell called Revolution Chemnitz, who were allegedly planning attacks on immigrants, journalists and political opponents, on October 3, German Unity Day. Many of these extremists use the Nazi salute, carry swastikas and even sing the Die Fahne hoch, the anthem of Hitler’s Nazi Party.

If the NSU had worked underground for years, far-right extremists are no longer hiding in Germany. The rise of the AfD, which broke with Germany’s post-war consensus on pluralism and multilateralism and took an overly German nationalist approach at all issues, from internal and external security to economic policy, has shaken up the political climate in the country. The AfD’s growth has coincided with a sharp jump in the number of far-right attacks in Germany. According to the BfV (Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz), the domestic security agency of the federal government, there are 24,100 right-wing extremists in Germany, of which 12,700 are “violence-oriented”. The country has also seen 8,605 crimes nationwide committed by neo-Nazis and other groups in the first half of 2019, according to Interior Ministry data. A week before the Hanau shooting, police arrested 12 members of a far-right terror cell, who were plotting to attack mosques in 10 States. The AfD does not have proven direct links with these groups. As a mainstream political party, it does not endorse violence either. But when it comes to immigrants, Muslims, Germany’s past crimes and German nationalism, both AfD leaders and the neo-Nazis often speak the same language.

What does the AfD want?

The AfD was founded in 2013 by a group of conservative leaders, many of whom were part of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Their plan was to occupy the political vacuum created by the CDU’s shift towards the centre from the right under Ms. Merkel’s leadership. Initially the AfD was focused on its anti-euro agenda and staunchly opposed German taxpayer’s money being used to bail out debt-trapped countries in the euro zone, mainly Greece.

But German politics would undergo a sea change after Ms. Merkel decided to welcome a million immigrants, mostly from the war-torn Arab world, to the country. The AfD quickly transformed itself into a nationalistic, populist, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim party. In 2016, Frauke Petry, the then leader of the AfD, called on police to shoot illegal migrants on Germany’s border. Bjoern Hoecke, another AfD leader, once termed Berlin’s memorial to the victims of the Nazi rule a “monument of shame”. The party’s 2017 manifesto read “Islam does not belong to Germany” and called Muslims “a big danger for our state, our society and our system of values.” These extreme views helped the AfD turn around its fortunes. If it had won 4.7% of the vote in the 2013 federal election, the vote share jumped to 12.6% in 2017. With 89 seats, the AfD is now the third largest party in the 709-member Bundestag, the federal Parliament.

What is next?

If the AfD was seen as a political untouchable by the establishment parties till recently, that is also slowly changing. Earlier this month, in the eastern State of Thuringia, a liberal leader was elected premier with help from Ms. Merkel’s CDU and the AfD. It created national outrage and Ms. Merkel made a decisive intervention. Thuringia Premier Thomas Kemmerich quit after the controversy. The CDU’s leader and Ms. Merkel’s designated successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, has also announced her resignation from the party leadership. But despite the uproar, the Thuringia episode is an example that the AfD is fast becoming a mainstream political party in Germany. And with the AfD’s rise and its open embrace of racist and anti-Muslim rhetoric, the many sleeper neo-Nazi cells which were till now resisted by the post-war consensus feel emboldened. That consensus is now under attack.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jqso86/article30952769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01THGERMANY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/how-serious-is-germanys-far-right-problem/article30952770.ece
71,2020/03/01,A failed probe finds its way to Venus,"Venera 3 was a failure as a mission as it lost communication before its planned encounter. It did, however, crash into Venus on March 1, 1966, thereby becoming the first human-made object to make physical contact with a celestial body other than our moon. A.S.Ganesh takes a look at the Venera 3 mission...

When we speak about the space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union that took place in the second half of the 20th Century, we often focus on the moon missions. There were, however, various other missions during this time that had many different objectives as well. One of these was the Venera programme that corresponded to a series of probes developed by the Soviet Union – to better understand our neighbouring planet Venus – between 1961 and 1984.

Launched in 1961, Venera 1 lost radio contact before it flew by Venus. Venera 2 failed to send back any important data, but it did fly by Venus at a distance of 24,000 km in February 1966. Venera 3 too lost communication before atmospheric entry, but it did become the first human-made object to land on another planet on March 1, 1966.

With the planned mission including landing on the Venusian surface and studying the temperature, pressure and composition of the Venusian atmosphere, Venera 3 carried a landing capsule that was 0.9 m in diameter and weighed 310 kg. The atmosphere was to be studied during the descent by parachute.

Positive start

Venera 3 was launched on November 16, 1965, just four days after the successful launch of Venera 2. Things went fine for Venera 3 as ground controllers were able to successfully perform a mid-course correction on December 26, 1965 during the outbound trajectory and also conducted multiple communication sessions to receive valuable information.

Among these were data obtained from a modulation charged particle trap. For nearly 50 days from the date of launching, Venera 3 was thus able to give an insight into the energy spectra of solar wind ion streams, out and beyond the magnetosphere of our Earth.

A failure and a first

Just before Venera 3 was to make its atmospheric entry in Venus, on February 16, 1966, it lost all contact with scientists on Earth. Despite the communications failure, the lander was automatically released by the spacecraft.

At 06:56:26 UT (universal time) on March 1, 1966, Venera 3’s probe crash-landed on the surface of Venus, just four minutes earlier than planned. It wasn’t in a position to relay back any information as it had lost contact, but it was the first time an object touched by humans had struck the surface of a planet other than our own.

Success follows

Investigations revealed that both Venera 2 and 3 suffered similar failures owing to overheating of several internal components and solar panels. With regard to Venera 3, its impact location was on the night side of Venus and the site was put in an area between 20 degrees north and 30 degrees south latitude and 60 degrees to 80 degrees east longitude.

Venera 3 tasted success in what was largely a failure, but it did pave the way for several more successes as well. For, Venera 4 became the first to measure the atmosphere of another planet, Venera 7 became the first to achieve soft touchdown and transmit information from another planet, and Venera 13 and 14 returned colour photos of the Venusian surface, days within each other. Venera 13, in fact, transmitted the photos on March 1, 1982, exactly 16 years after Venera 3 had landed on Venus.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/9i7zw0/article30894301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01istbvenera14jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/a-failed-probe-finds-its-way-to-venus/article30894304.ece
72,2020/03/01,"Prime Minister, Home Minister should step down: VCK chief","Thol. Thirumavalan calls for a SC-monitored probe into Delhi violence.

Holding the Centre and Bharatiya Janata Party responsible for the violence in northeast Delhi, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalan on Saturday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah should step down and pave the way for a Supreme Court-monitored probe into the riots in the national capital.

Speaking at a demonstration organised by the VCK to condemn the riots in Delhi, Mr. Thirumavalan said the violence was an orchestrated attack that was well planned to decimate the peaceful protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. For the last several days, peaceful protests were being held in Delhi by various political parties and Muslim organisations seeking the repeal of the CAA. Suddenly, ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to India, the BJP organised a pro-CAA rally in the capital. The inflammatory speeches made by the BJP leaders vitiated the peaceful atmosphere and led to the violence.

Condemning the inaction of Centre, the VCK leader said if the government wanted it could have controlled the riots on the first day itself. “Violence in the national capital has put the entire country to shame before the international community. Dozens of people lost their lives and savings,” he said.

Seeking the arrest of BJP leaders who made provocative speeches and compensation of ₹1 crore each to the families of the victims, he said the party would continue with the agitation against the CAA.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/gdvwpx/article30953996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29FEBTHPY29VCKPROTEST2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/prime-minister-home-minister-should-step-down-vck-chief/article30953997.ece
73,2020/03/01,Puducherry Chief Minister condemns violence in Delhi,"Addressing a press conference on Saturday, V. Narayanasamy said the violence was planned to quell the peaceful protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that was unfolding in the capital.

Condemning the violence in northeast Delhi, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said the Central government was responsible for the death of innocent people in the riots.

Addressing a press conference on Saturday, the Chief Minister said the violence was planned to quell the peaceful protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that was unfolding in the capital.

‘Most atrocious’

Dubbing the incidents as most “atrocious” the Chief Minister said the police were clueless in controlling the violence as there was no instruction from the top.

“It goes to show that the Central government and BJP instigated the violence. The CAA was brought to divert attention from the failed economic policies of the Central government. Now they have unleashed violence to spoil the peaceful protest against the legislation,” the Chief Minister said.

Briefing the outcome of his meeting with Union Minister for Road, Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari during his recent visit to Puducherry, the Chief Minister said the Ministry had agreed for the four-laning of the stretch from Mahabalipuram to Puducherry at a cost of ₹800 crore.

The Centre has agreed to provide four-lane connectivity from Madagadipet on the Villupuram stretch to the East Coast Road. The project would cost around ₹130 crore.

These projects would certainly ease traffic congestion on the arterial roads in Puducherry, the Chief Minister added.

The government was also looking ways to reduce traffic congestion by constructing more flyovers, Mr. Narayanasamy said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/q00vmy/article30953992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29FEBTHCMPRESSCONFERENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/puducherry-chief-minister-condemns-violence-in-delhi/article30953978.ece
74,2020/03/01,Pathrakulam: 65 cents recovered,"Sabha can retain land where temple dedicated to Chattambi Swami exists

The Revenue Department on Saturday issued orders for recovering 65 cents of land held by the Sree Vidhyadhiraja Sabha at East Fort. The sabha has been accused of encroaching on the land and filling up the Pathrakulam pond.

The government has agreed to allow the sabha to retain possession of the slice of land on which a temple dedicated to Chattambi Swami is situated. For recovering the disputed land, the Revenue Department has cancelled an order issued in 1976 assigning it to the sabha on lease for constructing the memorial to Chattambi Swami.

Saturday's order would be subject to review pending the verdict of the Supreme Court on a litigation involving the State government and the royal family of erstwhile Travancore, the order issued by Venu V., Principal Secretary, Revenue and Disaster Management, said. It goes on to state that technical studies may be undertaken if the resumed land has to be used for flood control measures in the Thampanoor and East Fort region.

During the Travancore era, the Pathrakulam pond was an important link in an intricate drainage network in the Fort region. This system reportedly broke down after Pathrakulam was reclaimed and the private trust built the Theerthapada Mandapam over it.

Tension at East Fort

Tension prevailed in East Fort late Saturday after revenue officials initiated steps to recover the land held by the sabha. Soon after a team led by the Revenue Divisional Officer arrived to seal the area by around 9 p.m., a sizeable group of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers led by O. Rajagopal, MLA, and district president V.V. Rajesh gathered in front of the Theerthapada Mandapam and threatened the officials against going ahead with their responsibility. They accused the government of using force to evict the landholders without giving them an opportunity to express their views. The decision will be challenges through political and legal means. The party has also decided to take out protest marches to the police stations of all Inspectors of Police in the district.

Soon, a large posse of the police were deployed in the area to bring the situation under control. The revenue officials then removed the flex banners that had been hung by the sabha and erected a board as part of resuming the land. The agitators later took out a protest march to the Fort police station.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/54d4su/article30953744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARN9899,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/pathrakulam-65-cents-recovered/article30953737.ece

The District Planning Committee (DPC) will organise a four-day conclave from March 2 to evolve a development framework for local self-government institutions (LSGIs) in the district.

The event, Vikasanotsavam, which will be held at the Putharikandam grounds, is also envisaged to take stock of Annual Plan project implementation in the district since the introduction of the People’s Plan campaign.

Besides identifying inadequacies in the existing development pattern, the programme will witness deliberations among people’s representatives and experts in various domains to chart out a comprehensive development approach for the next five years.

Addressing media persons, District panchayat president and DPC chairman V.K. Madhu said delegates representing all LSGIs – 73 grama panchayats, 11 block panchayats, four municipality, one corporation and district panchayat each – will participate in the programme.

77,2020/03/01,KWA gets ready for a tough summer,"Water in Peppara to last till June; water level in Vamanapuram river has started dipping

Kerala Water Authority (KWA) officials in the district are keeping their fingers crossed with all indications pointing to a tough summer ahead.

Storage in the Peppara dam indicates that the capital city region is in a comparatively safer zone as there is enough water to last till June. But rural Thiruvananthapuram could face the same problems it did last year.

Difficult time

A large number of panchayats and the municipalities of Attingal and Varkala which bank on the Vamanapuram river for drinking water are likely to have a difficult time as water levels have already started dipping.

On Friday, the water level in the Peppara dam - the chief source of water for the city region - stood at 104.5 metres. Last year on the same day, the storage had been 104.91 metres.

“The storage is adequate for 120 days,” a KWA official said. On the other hand, the KWA is worried about the seasonal spike in summer-time consumption.

“The storage indicates that city supply should not be a problem. On the other hand, per capita consumption of water easily rises by 25% during the summer months. Negotiating the summer without a crisis would hinge on judicious consumption patterns,” Suresh Chandran, Superintending Engineer, Thiruvananthapuram Circle, KWA, said. Residents had gheraoed the KWA office in Peroorkada on Friday after a water diversion to solve the shortage in Technopark hit supply in residential areas in the city. The matter has been sorted out, KWA officials said.

With water levels in the Vamanapuram river dipping alarmingly during the 2019 summer, the KWA was forced to regulate supply in northern parts of Thiruvananthapuram district, including Varkala and Attingal municipalities.

This year, the situation has not worsened so much to warrant such extreme measures yet, but the two bunds erected on the river may not prove adequate to ensure water levels for uninterrupted supply by April.

KWA officials are also hoping for copious summer rainfall which would help avert a crisis in this region. “Already we have been forced to shut down one of two pumps in the pump house supplying Attingal due to the dipping water levels. The situation will worsen,” a KWA official said. Vamanapuram river is the source for a number of KWA schemes catering to 28 panchayats and the two municipalities.

Vast stretches of the river had run dry during the two previous summers.

Check dams

Although the KWA had recommended the construction of five check-dams on the Vamanapuram river, not even one has been constructed ahead of summer 2020. Though the Water Resources Department has plans to build a storage dam in the upper reaches, the project is yet to make any progress, sources said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/qgqae7/article30953724.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TVPEPPARADAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/kwa-gets-ready-for-a-tough-summer/article30953717.ece

A senior official from the Union Ministry of Health, Padmaja Singh (Joint Secretary), who was in the capital on Saturday to assess the State’s COVID 19 preparedness and action plan, has expressed total appreciation and satisfaction at the manner in which the State is monitoring and managing the fluid situation.

Ms. Singh, who met the Health Secretary and the State COVID-19 Outbreak Control and Prevention Cell, was given a complete picture on how the State had managed to diagnose its three COVID-19 cases and, more importantly, how these cases were managed so that there was no secondary transmission at all.

79,2020/03/01,Operation Headgear begins in city today,"After HC order on enforcement of rule

The Thiruvananthapuram City police are set to launch Operation Headgear, a month-long intensive drive from March 1 to crack down on two-wheeler riders and those riding pillion violating the helmet rule.

The move comes against the backdrop of the Kerala High Court directing the government to enforce the helmet rule for those travelling on two-wheelers and the subsequent efforts made in sensitising the public.

District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram City) Balram Kumar Upadhyay said that several motorists and pillion riders were not wearing helmets and adhering to motor safety rules in spite of the steps adopted to generate awareness.

Fines will be levied from those caught violating the rule during vehicle inspections and through the surveillance cameras that are linked to the police control room. Besides, such violations will also be captured by police officers using their mobile phones and conveyed through a WhatsApp facility.

While ₹500 each will be levied from motorists or pillion riders who violated the rule, twice the amount will be charged if both were found to travel together without helmets, the police clarified.

All units of the City police including the Traffic police, Cheetah patrol, Highway Beacon and Control Room teams will participate in the enforcement activities, Mr. Upadhyay said.

The police penalised as many as 13,442 motorists for riding two-wheelers without wearing helmets in January and February. While 4,052 violations were captured using the control room cameras, as many as 3,957 motorists were reported to ride without helmets through the WhatsApp facility. Besides, 3,114 and 2,219 two-wheel riders were caught by the traffic police and local police units respectively during the period.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/mna69u/article30953861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tv-helmetcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/operation-headgearbegins-in-city-today/article30953706.ece

81,2020/03/01,LIFE makes a dream come true for many,"Many homeless senior citizens in district finally manage to build a house of their own

For the past forty years, 70-year old Omana Amma and 62-year old Padmini Amma have been neighbours, staying in rundown sheds.

While Padmini Amma stayed with her husband and children, Padmini Amma has always been alone. Their only source of income has been the occasional work as part of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).

On Saturday, to celebrate them occasion of both of them getting new houses as part of the State government's Livelihood, Inclusion, Financial Empowerment (LIFE) housing, they travelled together to the Putharikkandam Maithanam in Thiruvananthapuram to witness Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan making the declaration of LIFE crossing the two lakh milestone.

“We have been staying in those old sheds for so long. It feels good to finally live in a proper house. I have always been living alone, and I got my house as part of the special scheme for those who do not have anyone to look after them,” says Padmini Amma.

Padmavathy (62) from Malayinkeezh and her children also used to stay in a house, which had become too hard to live in, long back.

“When my husband passed away some years back, I got job as an ayah at a nearby school.

During my retirement, I got an amount of ₹75,000. Adding this with the ₹4 lakhs I got from LIFE, I could build a proper house,” says Padmavathy.

Struggled a lot

Sarojam (66) from Chenkal panchayat had to struggle a lot to complete her house, as the nearest road was located quite far from the location of her house.

This meant that she had to pay extra amounts to those who would carry the building materials all the way from the road. “I have been living in a hut, before the ward member approached me to be part of the LIFE beneficiary list. Much of the work is complete.

After completion, I will shift to the new house. Lack of drinking water is an issue, even though the house is located close to a river,” she says.

Madhavikutty Amma from Vilappil panchayat had the added pleasure of not only getting a new house after a wait of more than 25 years, but also getting the opportunity to hand over the lamp to the Chief Minister, for inaugurating the event marking the 2 lakh milestone.

82,2020/03/01,Indian Super League semifinal | Bengaluru FC beats ATK,"Deshorn Brown’s opportunistic strike (31st minute) proved to be the difference in what was a closely-fought first leg battle.

There was finally some cheer in the Bengaluru FC camp as it battled past ATK 1-0 in the first leg of the ISL semifinal at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium on Sunday.

Deshorn Brown’s first-half strike secured the reigning champion a morale-boosting win that puts it in the ascendancy going into the second leg in Kolkata next Sunday.

Nishu sees red

The home side played the last five odd minutes with 10 men after Nishu Kumar was sent off for denying Roy Krishna a scoring opportunity near the edge of the area. ATK pinned its hopes on the resulting free kick for the crucial away goal. But despite a retake, ATK couldn’t score as BFC’s excellent defensive co-ordination came to the fore.

Earlier in the evening, the first chance of the match fell to BFC in the seventh minute when Rahul Bheke rose to meet Dimas Delgado’s corner but headed it over the bar. But for that, BFC pegged itself deep with ATK doing all the pressing.

Just after the quarter-hour mark, ATK thought it had gone ahead when David Williams, after collecting the ball from Krishna on the right flank, drove it into the net, only to be called for a handball.

The hosts’ first phase of sustained pressure came around 30 minutes and it brought three consecutive corners. While not much came off them, BFC stuck immediately after, when Brown bundled the ball in from close range after ATK goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharja made a mess of a weak shot from central defender Juanan.

At the break, in an attacking move, Cuadrat brought on striker Kevaughn Frater for defender Albert Serran and the Jamaican proved the liveliest of the lot.

Brilliant save

On 75 minutes, he unleashed a superb left-footer from 30 yards out which was brilliantly saved by Arindam. He then released Paartalu on the right wing but the latter’s cut-back wasn’t capitalised on by Chhetri.

Much of ATK’s attack was restricted to the left side of the midfield, but Michael Soosairaj had a largely forgettable outing there.

ATK’s hopes rose when Williams went on a marauding box-to-box run that brought the free-kick from a dangerous position. But BFC ensured it wouldn’t be denied the victory.

83,2020/03/01,Watford brings Liverpool’s run to a shuddering halt,"Klopp’s men still enjoy a 22-point lead at the top of the table.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp warned his side the Premier League title is not won yet after a 44-game unbeaten run in the league came to a crashing end as Watford beat the European champion 3-0 on Saturday.

Klopp’s men still enjoy a 22-point lead at the top of the table, but their sluggish return from a two-week winter break earlier this month was finally punished.

Ismaila Sarr’s quickfire double and Troy Deeney’s strike 18 minutes from time ended Liverpool’s hopes of romping to a first league title in 30 years with an unbeaten season.

“What the boys did so far is exceptional but it is not over,” said Klopp.

“We did not expect the number of games we won. It was never easy and it will never be easy, so now let’s carry on.”

A 55-point gap separated the sides before kick-off, but the out-of-sorts visitors failed to muster even a single effort on goal in the first 45 minutes.

They were eventually stung by two quick strikes by Sarr.

Firstly, the Senegalese beat Robertson to Abdoulaye Doucoure’s low cross to stab home at the near post.

Six minutes later, Sarr had too much pace for a flat-footed Liverpool defence as he raced onto Deeney’s through ball and showed fantastic composure to lift the ball over the advancing Alisson Becker.

Sarr also had a big part to play in Watford’s third as he pounced on a short passback and had the vision to pick out Deeney, who lofted the ball nonchalantly over Alisson to make it 3-0.

“It’s such an important win for us. But it is one win,” said Watford boss Nigel Pearson.

“It’s in our own hands, and we have to deliver that performance week in, week out.”

Sarr should even have had a famous hat-trick with his final touch as he curled wide when one-on-one with Alisson.

The results:

Saturday: Premier League: Watford 3 (Sarr 54, 60, Deeney 72) bt Liverpool 0.

Serie A: Napoli 2 (Manolas 19, Di Lorenzo 82) bt Torino 1 (Edera 90+1).

Bundesliga: Cologne 3 (Bornauw 9, Cordoba 39, Nuebel-og 75) bt Schalke 0.

84,2020/03/01,Premier League | Liverpool's dream run ends in 3-0 thrashing at Watford,"Liverpool's unbeaten run of success in this season's Premier League was ended in unfathomable fashion on Saturday as struggling Watford hammered the European champions 3-0 at their ecstatic Vicarage Road stadium.

Ismaila Sarr inspired the extraordinary upset, stunning Liverpool with two goals in six second-half minutes before he set up captain Troy Deeney with a third for the team who had started the day one from bottom, 55 points behind the runaway leaders.

Liverpool's first league defeat of the season meant the end of their hopes of going the whole league campaign as unbeaten as the new 'Invincibles' after 44 league matches without a defeat.

It also came on the evening when they were expected to surpass champions Manchester City by creating a new English top-flight record of 19 successive league victories.

The setback will doubtless not stop Juergen Klopp's men going on to lift their first English title for 30 years as they still remain 22 points ahead of their nearest pursuers, yet their season's aura of domestic invincibility has now been demolished.

Liverpool had previously dropped only two points in the league this season — their draw at Manchester United in October — but from the start, Watford attacked them with unexpected vigour.

Watford had looked the more likely to break the deadlock in the first half with Gerard Deulofeu proving Liverpool's main tormentor before he was taken off by stretcher with a knee injury.

Yet it was only when Sarr struck twice just before the hour mark and then turned provider for Deeney to shoot home a third that the 'mission impossible' became a reality.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/hk2ll1/article30953943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXBRITAINSOCCERPREMIERLEAGUE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/premier-league-liverpools-dream-run-ends-in-3-0-thrashing-at-watford/article30953944.ece

Operation of passenger trains hauled by electric locomotive on the main line stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Villupuram and back commenced on Sunday following statutory clearance from the Commissioner of Railway Safety, Southern Circle, Bengaluru.

The Southern Railway will operate three set of passenger trains on the nearly 110 km Mayiladuthurai – Villupuram – Mayiladuthurai broad section hauled by electric locomotive daily. The first passenger train hauled by a electric locomotive left for Villupuram from Mayiladuthurai Junction at around 5.40 a.m. on Sunday. A brief ritual was conducted at Mayiladuthurai to mark the occasion, said railway sources.

A senior railway official said operation of electric loco hauled passenger trains commenced from Villupuram side and from Mayiladuthurai side on Sunday. Prior to operation of passenger trains on the newly electrified section, these trains were hauled by diesel locomotive.

The operation of electric loco hauled passenger trains on the main line portion from Villupuram to Mayiladuthurai and back has been introduced after obtaining mandatory clearance from the CRS.

The CRS who had inspected the electrified portion of the main line section from Cuddalore to Mayiladuthurai via Chidambaram and another separate stretch from Mayiladuthurai to Tiruvarur early last month had given his authorisation a few days later for introduction of electric loco hauled passenger and freight trains on both stretches.

Consequent to receiving the authorisation, the Southern Railway authorities at first operated an electric loco hauled freight train prior to operation of electric loco hauled passenger train.

The entire main line section from Villupuram to Thanjavur via Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai and Kumbakonam is being electrified by the Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (RVNL), a Government of India enterprise.

Final phase

With overhead electrification works having been completed up to Mayiladuthurai Junction, the ongoing project has now entered the final phase with electrification works currently under way in the last portion from Mayiladuthurai to Thanjavur Junction.

The main line section, falling under the Tiruchi Railway Division’s jurisdiction, is one of the oldest stretches in the present Southern Railway zone.

The section was originally laid as a metre gauge over 120 years ago during the colonial era.

Subsequently, it was converted into a broad gauge section. With traffic having almost reached the saturation point on the main line section with a single track, it was time for the stretch to be taken up for track doubling works as this would eventually pave the way for operation of more trains on this section, says A. Giri, advisor, Thanjavur District Rail Users Association.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/electric-trains-chug-on-energised-section/article30957148.ece
87,2020/03/01,Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night comes alive on stage,"Students from 14 colleges in Tiruchi and neighbouring districts and three city schools witnessed The Department of English, St. Joseph's College's production of Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night.

A 35-member cast and a total team of 68 students came together nearly six months ago to prepare for the shows, said V. L. Jayapaul, Assistant Professor, St. Joseph's College. “The work on the set, design, costumes, began nearly six months ago. For the main cast, we auditioned students from the Department of English, but the supporting members, the musicians, light design were done by students from other departments”, he said. The efforts for the show, including painting the props, attaching tunes to some parts of the script were all done by the students, he said.

The show used an abridged version of the script to help students understand the dialogues better, Mr. Jayapaul said. Students of Jegan Matha Matriculation Higher Secondary School and Sacred Heart Higher Secondary School attended the show on Saturday morning. The students enjoyed the performance and laughed at Feste, the court jester and Sir Toby, a drunkard in the play. “Twelfth Night is a good play to watch for students as they will learn pronunciation and language. It might even kindle an interest in acting,” Mr. Jayapaul said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/drj5q/article30957071.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY02DRAMATRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/shakespeares-twelfth-night-comes-alive-on-stage/article30957072.ece
88,2020/03/01,All is not well in Cantonment area,"Residents contend with overflowing manhole and contaminated drinking water

An overflowing manhole of the underground drainage network on Reynolds Road in Cantonment area has caused severe inconvenience to commuters and residents.

The leakage of sewer from the manhole, located on middle of the busy road, was first noticed by commuters on Friday night. Since, the leakage became heavy, the local residents lodged a complaint with the concerned authorities of Tiruchi Corporation on Saturday morning. As the day progressed, faecal waste too began emerging from the manhole and started flowing on the road. But, local residents alleged that no one from the Tiruchi Corporation, which is just 500 meters away from the overflowing manhole, came forward to attend the call till Sunday afternoon.

Besides a popular shopping mall, there are a number of flats, residences and commercial establishments on Reynolds Road. With no action being taken by the authorities, commuters and residents had to face inconvenience for the last three days. Unable to bear the stench emanating from the overflowing sewage, most of the local residents preferred to stay indoors except for pressing situations when they were forced to go out. Commuters on Reynolds Road walked or drove fast to avoid the stench.

“The stench is unbearable. It is a harrowing experience to see human waste flowing on the road,” said M. Thirupathi, a resident on Reynolds road.

Residents alleged that the Corporation officials, who had seen the malfunctioning of UGD while travelling on the road, had failed to take action to set right the issue for several hours.

A few meters away, the residents of State Bank Officers Colony on Lawsons Road have alleged that for the last few days the supply of drinking water is being mixed with sewage. Several residents, mainly children and elders, who drank the contaminated water, fell ill with complaints of indigestion, vomiting and fever.

Sensing a bad smell in the drinking water, most of the apartment dwellers have stopped using the drinking water being supplied by the Corporation. Several of them emptied the water tanks. The residents, who are still unclear on the quality of the water being supplied to them, now bank on the bore water for drinking and other purposes.

Calling upon the attention of the Corporation authorities, the residents of SBI Officers Colony have urged them to take immediate steps to check the drinking water lines in Cantonment area to identify the points of sewerage mix so as to solve the issue.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/9l0xbt/article30957044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY02MANHOLETRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/all-is-not-well-in-cantonment-area/article30957045.ece

P State president Kanna Lakshminarayana has demanded that the government issue posting orders to all the employees, including crucial police officers, who are kept under compulsory wait, and provide a congenial working environment.

In a letter to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, he stated that it was distressing that a large number of employees had been kept under compulsory wait for no fault of theirs, and they were also not paid salary. As a result, they were deprived of their source of income.

Mr. Lakshminarayana insisted that the employees could not be penalised for the bureaucratic delays in issuing the posting orders.

The setting aside of 150 SIs, 120 inspectors, 80 DSPs, five additional SPs and five non-cadre SPs needed deep scrutiny, he said.

“How can law and order be maintained in such a situation?” he questioned, and pointed out that such “vindictive acts” would demoralise the police personnel.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/give-posting-to-staff-kept-under-compulsory-wait-kanna/article30955413.ece

The Press Council of India (PCI) has decided to drop the proceedings in the murder case of Andhra Jyothi reporter K. Satyanarayana in East Godavari district, as per the recommendation of the inquiry committee.

‘Personal grudge’

PCI Chairman C.K. Prasad stated in the adjudication report dated January 22, 2020, that the inquiry committee heard DSP A. Srinivasa Rao and Circle Inspector K. Kishore Babu, and that the DGP reported that there was a personal grudge between the deceased and the accused, Vangalapudi Gowri Venkata Ramana, and all the accused conspired to kill Satyanarayana to take personal vengeance.

The DGP report said the murder had nothing to do with the journalist’s profession.

Satyanarayana’s wife Katha Kumari had submitted that her husband was murdered by some unknown persons and her brother-in-law complained with the Tuni rural police that some persons, who included an MLA, were the conspirators. Police investigation made it clear that the MLA was on Europe tour at the time of the commission of the crime, and verification of all the suspects yielded no result.

93,2020/03/01,Vehicle users irked as many fuel stations refuse card payments,"Dispute over Merchant Discount Rate with a bank leads to impasse

Vehicle users were in for a surprise on Saturday when payments through debit and credit cards were not accepted at several fuel stations in the city and district.

Fuel stations across the district and other parts of the State have partially stopped accepting cards owing to an issue over Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) with a particular bank that reportedly provides POS service (swipe machines) to most fuel stations.

Dealers allege that the bank has not apprised them of the circular by the Central government about passing on the MDR to the customer from the dealer from January 1.

“It has become a country-wide issue now. The particular bank has not apprised us of the government directive and continued to collect MDR from the dealers till recently. In protest, most of the fuel stations have stopped accepting payments through cards. Some which are continuing to accept card payments will be at a loss,” Consortium of Indian Petroleum Dealers honorary general secretary M. Narayana Prasad told The Hindu.

Seek refund

“We have written to the bank as well as the ministry and officials concerned about the issue. The government waived the 0.4% commission per transaction which was paid by the dealer until December 31. But we were not informed about that and the bank continued to collect it from dealers till February 24,” he said. We need the amount collected from us to be reimbursed, he added.

The Waltair Railway Division achieved the highest-ever loading of 72 rakes (3,782 wagons) in a single day on Saturday, surpassing its previous best of 68 rakes a day last year, the officials have said.

With 147 freight trains interchange and 92.3% punctuality of mail and express trains, the division is moving fast towards achieving the Railway Board’s target of 68 million tonnes loading for this year.

Gross earnings

The gross earnings of Waltair Division by the end of January has been put at ₹7,222 crore, which is 10% more when compared to that of the corresponding period last year. DRM Chetan Kumar Shrivastava attributed the achievement to the efforts in by the division, in close coordination with traffic and other departments.

97,2020/03/01,ZRUCC alleges stepmotherly treatment to Vizag railway station,"Committee member writes letter to Minister Piyush Goyal

The Zonal Railway Users’ Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) has alleged that stepmotherly treatment has been meted out to Visakhapatnam railway station by the Railway Board, East Coast Railway (ECoR) and Waltair Division authorities.

In a letter to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, ZRUCC Member N. Gajapathi Rao alleged that that the Southern Railway was interested in extending the tri-weekly 16780 Ramaeswaram – Tiruapthi Meenakshi Express to Visakhaptnam. But, the ECoR evinced no interest in the proposal.

He said that the South Western Railway was ready to allot a slot for two days a week to run express train from Visakhapatnam to Bengaluru on the condition that the rake be provided by the ECoR. “The ECoR are silent on this proposal. Similarly, there is no train between Visakhapatnam and Varanasi. Several pleas have been submitted seeking extension of bi-weekly Varanasi-Sambalpur train to Visakhapatnam, but there has been no response. The ECoR has, however, extended some trains such as Prasanthi, Visakha and Chennai Express originating and terminating in Visakhapatnam, to Bhubaneswar,” Mr. Gajapathi Rao said.

He further noted that the decades-old request for extension of the bi-weekly Swarna Jayanthi Express to Jammutavi/Katra is yet to be considered by the Railway Board.

‘Meagre allocation’

In a separate letter, the ZRUCC member decried the meagre allocation for laying of the 3rd line from Visakhapatnam to Gopalapatnam. “It needs ₹40 crore for completion of the 7-km 3rd railway line. An abstract estimate and Rate of Return (RoR) was sent to the Railway Board on April 20, 2019. The non-availability of the third line is resulting in the bypassing of many trains, without touching Visakhapatnam railway station. A third line will help avoid the detention of trains for hours together in the city suburbs, he said. Around 20 pairs of trains are bypassing Visakhapatnam and suggestions given to overcome the issue are being overlooked,” he added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/zrucc-alleges-stepmotherly-treatment-to-vizag-railway-station/article30958514.ece

101,2020/03/01,"Gold, silver lose sheen","Comex gold touched a high of $1,692 an ounce on February 24 before cooling off drastically in the last few trading sessions

After ruling strong for the best part of February, precious metals lost sheen towards the end of the month. Comex gold climbed to the highest level in seven years last week on growing concerns relating to the economic impact of the rapid spread of COVID-19. The weakness in global equity markets also played a part in fuelling the sentiment.

Comex gold touched a high of $1,692 an ounce on February 24 before cooling off drastically in the last few trading sessions. Comex silver recorded a high of $18.92 on Thursday and since remained subdued.

Comex gold fell 1.34% in February to settle at $1,566.7 an ounce while silver lost 9% to settle at $16.39 an ounce. In the domestic market, the gold futures price on the MCX rose 0.9% in February to ₹41,397 per 10 gm. MCX silver futures slipped 6.5% in the month to ₹44,403 a kg.

As observed in the previous piece, Comex gold ruled firm and also moved well past the then mentioned target price of $1,625-1,630 an ounce. The short-term outlook for gold is negative and a fall to the immediate target zone of $1,510-1,520 appears likely. The negative view would be invalidated if the price moves above the resistance level at $1,625-1,630 zone.

Comex silver, too, hit the target price of $18.8-19.1 an ounce mentioned in the previous post. The short-term outlook for silver, too, is negative. A drop to the short-term support of $15.5-15.7 appears likely.

A drop below $15.4 would impart further weakness and the price could then drop to $14.8-15. The negative outlook would be under threat if the silver price were to close above the $17.2-17.4 zone. The gold futures price at MCX ruled firm in February and hit the target price of ₹41,600-41,800 per 10 gm mentioned last month. MCX gold may remain subdued in the short-term and the price could slip to ₹39,800-40,200. A move past ₹43,100 is needed to invalidate the negative outlook. The short-term outlook for MCX silver is not too positive. The MCX silver price moved to the target zone of ₹48,800-49,000 mentioned last month and has since turned weak in the last couple of trading sessions.

MCX silver is likely to remain subdued in the short-term and the price could slip to ₹41,500-41,750. A drop below ₹43,800 would confirm the negative outlook while a close above ₹46,500 would invalidate it.

To summarise, precious metals have achieved their short-term targets and turned weak from a short-term perspective. It is advisable to remain on the sidelines till there is evidence of te resumption of an uptrend.

102,2020/03/01,Can HRA be claimed equally by self and spouse? Answers to your personal finance queries,"Readers can send in queries on personal ﬁnance and investing to moneywise@thehindu.co.in

Q. I recently closed my home loan with SBI with the retirement corpus my father had accumulated. I am now paying a monthly EMI to my father with an agreed interest rate. This is a joint loan with my wife. I have the following questions: 1) Can I claim interest benefit under section 24 for the home loan? 2) I realised that I cannot claim the principal u/s 80C as I am paying my father. Could you please confirm? 3) Should I prepare any other document to avoid I-T scrutiny? My wife and I are transferring money to my father's bank account via NEFT on the 2nd of every month.

Anil Kuppa

A. There is no specific provision under section 24 implying home loans availed from only banks and other financial institutions can be availed as deduction. Hence, interest on home loans paid to your father may be availed as deduction. However, principal repayment under section 80C can be availed only from such categories of lenders as government, LIC, National Housing Bank, other banks and financial institutions involved in financing the construction of house properties. Further, it is advisable to obtain a certificate from banks/financial institutions in support of the repayment so made. Hence, payments to your father with respect to principal cannot be availed as deduction. Documentation in the form of acknowledgement receipt from your father for the interest payments and an agreement with your father with respect to the housing loan can be entered into. It is also pertinent to note that your father should show the interest received as income in his ITR.

(The above queries were answered before the the Budget on Feb. 1 and are published now)

Q. I am a super senior citizen and a retired central government pensioner without medical insurance. I have spent about ₹10,000 towards preventive health check-ups and other medical expenses. Am I entitled to I-T exemption for the total amount, or is it limited to ₹5,000 under u/s 80D of the I-T Act?

Ram Nandula

Q. I am a super senior citizen, aged 84. This month, I incurred an expense of ₹8,400 on root canal treatment. The payment to the dentist was made by a credit card. I do not have any medical insurance. Please clarify whether this payment is eligible for deduction under Sec.80D of the I-T Act?

N.R. Krishnaswami

A. Under section 80D of the I-T Act for senior citizens, amounts paid towards medical expenditure of up to ₹50,000 can be availed as deduction in an assessment year. It is to be noted that no active medical insurance in the name of such senior citizens should be in force for such assessment year. Hence, both the claims, as above, can be made.

Q. My spouse and I work for the same organisation and live in a rented house. Both are paid House Rent Allowance (HRA). My rent paid in excess of 10% of pay works out to nil and therefore, I cannot claim any HRA exemption. As for my spouse, her HRA qualifies for exemption as the rent payment is in excess of 10% of salary. Kindly clarify if the exempted HRA could be claimed equally by self and my spouse or entire exempted HRA amount is to be claimed by my spouse only. I am in the 30% I-T slab and my wife 20% slab.

P. Venkata Rao

A. Allowable HRA is the least of the following amounts:

1) Excess of rent paid over 10% of the basic salary

2) In case you’re staying in a metro, 50% of the basic salary, and 40% if you live in a non-metro city.

3) The actual amount of HRA

HRA can be claimed as an exemption based on who is paying the rent and under whose name the current agreement is entered into. Pre-conditions under this section are that rent payment should be supported by a rental agreement and also periodic rent receipts from the landlord are to be obtained clearly displaying the names of the persons paying the rent. You may alter the rental agreement prospectively based on salaries got by both of you so that the benefits are best availed.

104,2020/03/01,Akalis not to part with more seats for BJP,"SAD chief Sukhbir Badal rejects calls for reworked seat-sharing formula

Amid a growing demand from Punjab’s BJP leaders for ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) to part with more seats for the 2022 Assembly polls, SAD chief and former Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal dismissed the possibility of any change in the current seat-sharing arrangement. Under the formula, the SAD contests on 94 seats and the BJP on 23.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Badal termed the recent violence in Delhi as “saddening” and “unfortunate”.

“Instances of the police not responding to calls during the violence clearly reflect the attitude adopted by the force,” he said.

For inclusive CAA

On the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Mr. Badal said the party has stuck to its stand from day one.

“We support the Act as far as it grants protection and safeguards to the Sikhs and several other communities including the Hindus [from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan], but the Act should not exclude Muslims because then it falls short of being inclusive and secular. We are a secular country. You should not include or exclude any name,” he said.

With the incumbent government in Punjab about to complete three years in power, Mr. Badal hit out at Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, terming him as the “'most incompetent Chief Minister the State has ever witnessed'”. He accused the government of taking U-turns on its promises made in the run up to the 2017 polls.

Mr. Badal, who is steering his party’s campaign for the Assembly elections, denied that the SAD had been hurt by the “'revolt” of a few senior leaders, saying, “'When people retire that doesn't mean it’s a crises. Their exit won't impact the party.”

Excerpts from the interview:

The relation between Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and BJP had been under strain, which was witnessed during Delhi and Haryana Assembly polls. Will this impact your alliance in Punjab ahead of the 2022 polls?

There were some issues but now everything has been sorted out. We will be fighting the next Assembly polls in alliance. We will fight the polls on the same formula (seat-sharing) that we had been doing since the beginning. There’s not going to be any single more seat or less seat. There’s no question.

The SAD recently saw a few Taksali (senior) leaders revolting. Is the party facing an internal crises? How are you preparing 2022?

There is no crisis in the party. The leaders who have left, it's basically retirement. When people retire and go that doesn't mean it’s a crisis. Their exit won't impact the party.

We are fully prepared. In 2017 Assembly polls also, when we lost, we (SAD-BJP) were number two in the vote share. Congress had 38% vote share, we were close to 31% vote share. The difference was not much..And now after Congress has been in power for three years, the people have seen this government’s poor performance. They have been exposed, people are fed up and want change. In our rallies and mass programmes, which is generating huge response, people tell us about their suffering due the indifferent attitude of the government. People are now comparing what Mr. Parkash Singh Badal’s government did for them and state’s overall development.

SAD has been accused of remaining silent on the recent communal violence in Delhi?

We have not been silent. From day one we are very clear that it is very unfortunate.. It is the government, which is responsible for maintaining law and order. They have to ensure the guilty are put behind bars.

We know how it feels. In 1984 [anti-Sikh riots] thousands of our brothers and sisters were killed. We have been fighting the cases for 30 years. I don’t want similar repetition happening again. Irrespective of the position, whosoever is guilty should be put behind bars. It's job of the police. Our MP Naresh Gujral had written to the Home Minister about inaction and apathy of Delhi police during the violence. If an MP talks to somebody and still there’s no response is coming what do you think would be effect of a common man’s word? This clearly shows the attitude of the police at that time.

Opposition parties have accused SAD of double speak on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

We have not taken different stand on CAA. We have stuck to the same stand from the beginning. We fought for CAA because we have seen thousands of our Hindus, Sikhs and people of Sindhi community who are from Pakistan come to India in last 15-20 years..We have been fighting their cases for citizenship. We support the Act as far as it grants protection and safeguards to the Sikhs and several other communities including the Hindus.

But the Act should not exclude Muslims because then it falls short of being inclusive and secular. We are a secular country. You should not include or exclude any name. I said in Parliament why are you excluding the name Muslim? If there’s nobody from the community [seeking citizenship] it’s fine. But you can't say exclude so and so.

From day one we have been sticking to the same stand. We have presented our views. We are a small minority in the whole thing (government) but we have clearly put forward our views what we stand for inside the Parliament and outside as well.

Apprehensions are being raised by those opposing the CAA that it is a step towards creating a ‘Hindu Rashtra’.

I can’t comment on this at the moment because a lot of politics had gone into this. What the intention was and what has come out afterwards... everyone has jumped into it. When the dust settles down, we will get to know what's the exact picture.

How do assess the current Congress government's performance in Punjab, which about to complete three years in power?

Even a child in Punjab can answer this question. People want to punish the ruling Congress as the government has set new records in neglect of State’s development. He (Capt. Amarinder Singh) is the most incompetent Chief Minister that Punjab has ever had. Chief Minister's job is do some work, he doesn't do that. He is hardly seen in Punjab, he doesn't meet anybody.

Name one promise, on which they (Congress) have delivered. During the last Assembly election, the Chief Minister was desperate to come into power and form the government and hence, went overboard with promises. After forming the government, he is not bothered about keeping his promises. Capt. Amarinder has put forth the claim of ‘breaking the back-bone of the drug mafia’. The truth is that he has broken the back-bone of Punjabis.

People are so fed up with him that they want to get rid of him as soon as possible. Today, drugs mafia is being patronised by Congress leaders.

The Chief Minister promised that he would waive the complete debt of all the farmers — including debt from commercial banks, co-operative societies, arthiyas (commission agents) and other sources. But after assuming power he backed out of this promise. They promised something, have done something else and are now involved only in cover up.

After the Aam Aadmi Party’s resounding triumph in Delhi Assembly polls, do you think it will pose a greater challenge in Punjab?

The whole situation in Delhi is very different from Punjab.. He (Arvind Kejriwal) can say something, promise something and get away with it but it’s not the case in Punjab. In Delhi fight was between the AAP and the BJP... the Congress converted all its vote to AAP and due to this they (AAP) won. In Punjab the Assembly polls in 2022 will see a direct fight between the Akali Dal and the Congress. AAP will be third.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/28w3b8/article30957909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02SUKHBIRSINGHBADAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/akalis-not-to-part-with-more-seats-for-bjp/article30957910.ece

106,2020/03/01,Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla to visit Bangladesh,"Bangladesh Speaker Chaudhury cancels India trip

Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla is expected to reach Dhaka for a two-day visit on Monday to prepare the grounds for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh later this month. The visit will give space to both sides to revive their bilateral relationship, which has been tense since India passed the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA).

Continuing the negative trend, Bangladesh Speaker Dr. Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury cancelled her India visit on Sunday, raising concerns over high-level contacts between the two sides.

Bangladesh had invited Prime Minister Modi along with other international leaders to the launch of ‘Mujib Year’ celebrations in Dhaka on March 17. Dhaka's leading newspaper Daily Star reported that the government of Bangladesh has also invited Congress president Sonia Gandhi for the inaugural event. Former President of India Pranab Mukherjee, too, is scheduled to travel to Bangladesh around the same time for the celebrations.

This will be the first visit to Bangladesh by Mr. Shringla after he took charge of his office in January. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s journey to Dhaka assumes importance as it comes three months after the controversial CAA was passed by the Indian Parliament. The new law, which has sparked protests across the country, grants citizenship rights to the minority communities of Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In a recent interview, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina termed the CAA as “unnecessary”.

Mr. Shringla is expected to hear words of concern from civil society members of Dhaka regarding the latest round of communal violence in Delhi. Coinciding with the arrival of the Indian Foreign Secretary in Dhaka, Terrorism and Communalism Resistance Morcha of Bangladesh has called for a peaceful protest rally in Dhaka’s Shahbagh area on Monday morning. “India must take urgent steps to stop violence in Delhi, which killed 41 and injured more than 300,"" said the organisation in a statement.

Dhaka has not explained the reasons for the cancellation of the visit, during which the Speaker was scheduled to meet with several Indian leaders, including Mr. Mukherjee. to invite them to the March 17 event. Bangladesh cancelled several high-level visits in December and January after the citizenship law was passed here.

107,2020/03/01,"With falling allocation, Navy looks at fleet optimisation","It is firm on a third aircraft carrier and six advanced submarines under Project-75I, but will also look for more unmanned solutions

Facing increasing budgetary constraints and with several big-ticket acquisitions lined up, the Navy is looking at adopting unmanned platforms, both aerial and underwater, in a big way, Navy sources said.

However, it is firm on a third aircraft carrier and the next line of six advanced submarines under Project-75I.

This year, the Navy’s share in the capital allocation of the defence budget is ₹26,688 crore, while officials said the committed liabilities alone stood at ₹45,000 crore. “We are working on ways to manage it,” one official said.

Last year too, the Navy’s capital allocation was ₹23,156 crore, while the liabilities were ₹25,461 crore. In the past few years, the Navy’s share as a percentage of the defence budget has been going down.

As part of the fleet rationalisation plan, the Navy has cut down on the requirement of minesweepers from 12 to eight and additional P-8I long-range patrol aircraft from 10 to six. The Navy now has no dedicated minesweepers in service, and is resorting to makeshift arrangements. It has procured some autonomous underwater vehicles, and efforts are on to procure more. Similarly, the Navy operates some Israeli drones, and is in the process of procuring 10 General Atomics Seaguardian High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) armed drones from the U.S. for maritime surveillance. “It is imperative to look for more unmanned solutions,” the official said.

Recently, Chief of the Defence Staff, General Bipin Rawat, called for a staggered approach to big procurements, and said the third carrier was too expensive, and the Navy would have to choose between submarines and a third carrier.

“As an expanding blue-water Navy with growing responsibilities, we need power projection. It is not about one over the other. We need more submarines, but we also need a third aircraft carrier so that we have two operational carriers on each seaboard at any given time,” a Navy source said. “We will push the case,” he said.

Pointing out that big-ticket procurements were inherently staggered, the source said, “Both are long-gestation projects and each has a different role. If we start planning now, it will take 10 to 15 years to get an aircraft carrier. So we cannot delay it.”

The P-75I is being processed through the Strategic Partnership (SP) route. The Navy has short-listed five foreign original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and two Indian strategic partners, based on the response to the Request for Information and the subsequent criteria-based evaluation. “The project is on track, and there is no change in the numbers. We should be able to issue the Request for Proposal by April,” the source said.

The Navy envisages the proposed second Indigenous Aircraft Carrier (IAC-II) to be displacing 65,000 tonnes and conventionally powered, with a steam-launched catapult for launching and recovering aircraft. “The Navy has done a detailed study, and the specifications have been arrived at based on the requirements. The IAC-II should cost around ₹45,000 crore,” another source said, adding there were exaggerated cost estimates being quoted.

In addition, the Navy has several big-ticket acquisitions lined up. These include 111 naval utility helicopters, six additional Boeing P-8I aircraft and 13 BAE Systems MK45 naval guns.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kyr31q/article30958008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02AIRCRAFT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/with-falling-allocation-navy-looks-at-fleet-optimisation/article30958009.ece
108,2020/03/01,Assam’s NRC-excluded wait anxiously six months after publication of final list,"With lack of clarity on administrative points, the process of sending notices to the excluded is yet to begin

Six months after they found their names missing from the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC), more than 19 lakh people in Assam are anxiously awaiting their chance to be back in the list.

The final draft of the NRC published on August 31, 2019, had excluded 19,06,657 out of 3.3 crore applicants for lack of proper documents to establish that they have been living in Assam before March 25, 1971, the cut-off date for detecting and deporting foreigners or illegal immigrants.

This date was prescribed by the Assam Accord of August 1985, ending six years of a violent agitation for ejection of non-citizens.

Petition in SC

“The All Assam Minority Students’ Union and the Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind had ten days ago filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking photo identity card for those included in the NRC and the immediate start of the process of appealing for possible inclusion by those excluded,” Guwahati-based rights activist A.B. Khandakar told The Hindu on Sunday.

After receiving notice from the NRC authority, each excluded person will have 120 days to file an appeal at any of the existing 100 Foreigners’ Tribunals (FTs) — 200 more are in the pipeline — which in turn will have to dispose of the cases within six months. The appellant then has the option of approaching higher courts.

“The anxiety of the excluded people is increasing by the day. These are mostly poor people who spent beyond their means to prove their citizenship and the delay in starting the appealing phase is taking a lot out of them,” said a member of a group that helped poor and illiterate people fill up NRC forms in western Assam’s Barpeta district.

The Supreme Court-monitored NRC exercise cost the government at least ₹1,600 crore. But people in Assam, rights groups said, spent more than ₹7,800 crore on collecting documents and attending hearings in faraway places. The process also claimed at least 60 lives, some killed in road mishaps.

High expectations

Expectations were high when Hitesh Dev Sarma took charge as the NRC State Coordinator in December 2019, replacing Prateek Hajela, who was transferred to Madhya Pradesh by the apex court.

The NRC authority had in mid-February allowed the release of most of the 55,000 Assam government officials who had been engaged in the updating exercise for more than five years. The release was on “various grounds like superannuation or transfer with the promotion”. All the district heads were notified for assigning new officers in their place after training them suitably in NRC work.

But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government indicated that the process of sending notices to the excluded could wait until the entire list is re-verified to make it error-free. The BJP said the re-verification was needed to weed out “Bangladeshis”, primarily Bengali-speaking Muslims.

An NGO named Assam Public Works followed it up by filing a petition in the apex court seeking 100% re-verification of the NRC exercise. The NGO’s petition in the Supreme Court in 2009 had led to the process of updating the 1951 NRC in the State.

‘Awaiting direction’

The NRC authorities said the decks were being cleared for starting the process of sending notices to the excluded. “But we are wary of the petitions in the Supreme Court, whose observations could impact the next step. Besides, there is no clarity on what to do with the excluded people who are likely to be the beneficiaries of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act,” said a college teacher who handled the NRC work.

The Assam government is also awaiting SC’s nod for the next course of action. “We are ready to set up 200 FTs, but we cannot proceed unless there is a direction from the apex court,” Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

The Gauhati High Court had in September announced a list of 221 members who will head the quasi-judicial FTs. The government has been paying them salaries since.

Similar is the case with the Electronic FT, or e-FT, that will have the details of illegal migrants, their biometrics and legacy data to be made available to the regular FTs and other agencies.

“We will start functioning when the NRC office starts giving notices,” said Anand Prakash Tiwari, the CEO of the Electronic Foreigners Tribunal Mission Directorate formed in mid-2019.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ceev1j/article30957930.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02ASSAMNRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/assams-nrc-excluded-wait-anxiously-six-months-after-publication-of-final-list/article30957931.ece

The number of monuments under the Centre’s protection could increase as the government is planning a review of those under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the ones protected by the State governments, Union Minister for Culture Prahlad Singh Patel has said.

At present, 3,691 monuments nationwide are protected by the ASI, with the highest number, 745, in Uttar Pradesh, according to his reply in the Lok Sabha on February 10.

Mr. Patel said the list of the Centrally protected monuments had not seen a substantial increase in many years, and important sites under the State governments could be added to the list. On the other hand, he added, there were some monuments that could be removed from the Central list and placed under the State governments.

“The list of Centrally protected monuments can go up to 10,000. In Tamil Nadu alone, there are about 7,000 temples, many of which are hundreds of years old. On the other hand, there are some monuments under the ASI that can be shifted to the State list,” he said.

The Minister said there were some sites that could be moved from the Central list, allowing development works in their vicinity. He was referring to the ban on construction within 100 metres of a Centrally protected monument and regulated construction within 100-200 metres under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. The Act protects monuments and sites that are over 100 years old.

If you look at FDI inflows during the last five years into the country, they far exceed the FDI during the 10 years of UPA rule, Thakur said, adding the country’s foreign exchange reserves (Forex) have swelled to all-time high of $476 billion.

He said the fiscal deficit, which used to be at 5.2% during the UPA regime, has come down to 3.3%, though this year it will be 3.8 pc and next year we will bring it down to 3.5%.

Mr. Thakur, who represents Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh as MP, said the Narendra Modi government has shown what fiscal discipline is.

Inflation, which used to be 12 per cent, came down to 4 per cent. All macro economic indicators point that India is going ahead in the right direction.., he said.

Attacking the Congress, he alleged that it was during the UPA rule that economy had beenn mismanaged.

There were scams, real status of bank NPAs were hidden, inflation was high, he said.

About the possible impact of outbreak of COVID-19 in China on world economy, he said India’s Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently held a meeting with industry to seek feedback in this regard.

Over 160 rape cases have been reported on railway premises and on board running trains between 2017 and 2019, an RTI query has found.

While the number of rapes have gone down from 51 in 2017 to 44 in 2019, there was a spike in 2018 when the number of such cases rose to 70.

According to the reply to the query filed by Neemuch-based activist Chandra Shekhar Gaur, there have been 136 rapes on railway premises and 29 on running trains during 2017-2019, totalling 165.

Of the 44 rapes reported last year, 36 were committed on railway premises and eight on trains.

Of the 70 rapes reported in 2018, 59 were reported on railway premises and 11 on trains.

Of the 51 rapes reported in 2017, 41 were on railway premises and 10 on running trains.

There have been 1,672 cases of crimes against women other than rapes — 802 on railway premises and 870 on trains.

There were 771 cases of kidnapping and abduction in these three years, 4,718 cases of robbery, 213 cases of attempt to murder and 542 murders on railway premises and on board trains.

Policing on railways is a state subject, prevention of crime, registration of cases, their investigation and maintenance of law and order on railway premises as well as on running trains are the responsibility of state governments, which they discharge through Government Railway Police (GRP)/District Police.

However, the railways has taken a slew of measures to ensure security of women.

In a reply to a question on security of women in railways, the ministry had informed Rajya Sabha last month that on vulnerable and identified routes or sections, 2,200 trains on an average are escorted by the Railway Protection Force daily in addition to 2,200 trains escorted by GRP of different states daily.

Security helpline 182 is made operational (24X7) over Indian Railways for security-related assistance to passengers in distress.

Drives are conducted against entry of male passengers into compartments reserved for women passengers and persons apprehended are prosecuted under section 162 of The Railways Act, 1989.

During 2018 and 2019, a total of 1,39,422 and 1,14,170 male passengers respectively have been prosecuted for unauthorised entry or travel in compartments reserved for women passengers.

Ladies Special trains running in metropolitan cities are being escorted by lady RPF personnel.

Fixed CCTV cameras have been provided in 2019 coaches (up to November 2019) and 511 railway stations (up to December 2019) for enhancing security of passengers.

These measures seem to have borne fruit with a dip in crimes across railways.

While in 2019, there were 55,826 total reported crimes in railway premises and on board trains, in 2017, the number was 71,055.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hx4o78/article30956981.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AHMEDABADINDIANRAILWAYBUDGET2015,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/over-160-rape-cases-reported-on-railway-premises-on-board-trains-from-2017-2019-rti/article30956858.ece

Union Minister Anurag Thakur, who has been under opposition fire over his alleged hate speech during Delhi Assembly polls, on March 1 said strict action should be taken against those involved in the communal riots in the national capital which claimed over 40 lives.

The Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs was addressing a press conference in Chandigarh after meeting with stakeholders from various trades and industries during an interactive session organised by the Income Tax department.

At the press conference, he was asked to comment on the alleged hate speeches made by him and other BJP leaders in the run-up to the Delhi elections and how such vitriolic speeches led to the riots in the city.

“Strict action should be taken against those involved in [Delhi] the riots. The strength of our country is that people of various faiths coexist and live unitedly contributing towards nation building,” Mr. Thakur said.

Further commenting on the communal riots, he said, “Police is doing its job...”

Asked again about his alleged hate speech, Mr. Thakur said, “I think sometimes there is lack of information in the media too regarding the way some things are projected.”

Evading further response on the issue, the Union Minister chose to talk about the country’s economy.

“India should move forward. We have taken big steps on the economy and will do so in future too,” he said.

Mr. Thakur added, “From Monday, Parliament session will begin, questions are raised there also from economy to various other issues and on that platform [in parliament], answers will be given on various matters.”

“If you have questions on the economy, you should ask those...,” he said when media persons kept fielding questions about his alleged hate speech.

When journalists mentioned the wordings of the alleged hate speech, the BJP leader shot back, “This is not what I said...”

Declining any further comment on the matter, the BJP leader said, “The matter is sub-judice. You [media] should have full facts [about his alleged hate speech]. Half-baked information can be dangerous.”

The Delhi High Court had recently expressed “anguish” over the Delhi Police’s failure to register FIRs against three BJP leaders over their alleged hate speeches in connection with the CAA-related violence and asked the police commissioner to take a “conscious decision” on it.

The Congress has said it will strongly raise the issue of the communal riots in Delhi during the second part of the budget session of Parliament starting on March 2 and demand Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation over alleged police lapses in curbing the violence.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/89zio0/article30956812.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ANURAGTHAKUR-RVMOORTHY-3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/strict-action-should-be-taken-against-those-involved-in-delhi-riots-anurag-thakur/article30956813.ece

Checking the nefarious designs of India’s adversaries across the Line of Control (LoC) and engaging the youth top the agenda of the new Commander of the Army’s strategically located XV Corps Lt. Gen. B.S. Raju who believes people nurturing separatist feelings have been shown the door.

For Lieutenant General Baggavalli Somashekar Raju, who took over as the new corps Commander on March 1 from Lt. Gen. K.J.S. Dhillon, his posting in the Kashmir Valley is like homecoming.

He had earlier served as the brigade Commander along the LoC and later, led the ‘Victor Force’, a counter-insurgency group of the Army that looks after the militancy-hit south Kashmir region.

“The Army is a friend of every civilian and that message has been conveyed aptly by my predecessor. My every attempt would be to continue this practice,” Lt. Gen. Raju told PTI after taking over command of the XV Corps.

On the issue of militancy, Lt. Gen. Raju, an NDA alumni from the 1984-batch, said it is too early for him to comment, but reports show that militants or separatists are not in control. “I believe that those nurturing separatist feelings have been shown the door,” he said.

Lt. Gen. Raju, who was heading the ‘Victor Force’ in the aftermath of the neutralisation of the Hizbul Mujahideen terror group’s poster boy Burhan Wani, is ceased of the matter that some people were engaged in distracting the youth from their studies.

“During my stint, the Army along with other arms of the government will counter this menace on top priority,” he said.

During his earlier stint in Kashmir, Lt. Gen. Raju had kept children engaged in different sports and creative activities and shown them that soldiers were on their side.

These activities included the Army launching a series of outreach programmes such as sports and painting competitions, distributing stationary, taking children on treks with packed meals.

On situation from across the border, the Commander said there were indications that the Pakistani army may try to push terrorists into India. “We are prepared to give them a befitting reply and defeat their nefarious designs,” Lt. Gen. Raju asserted.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lcof78/article30956748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-LTGENRAJU-PTI-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/people-nurturing-separatist-feelings-have-been-shown-door-lt-gen-raju/article30956749.ece

Curfew in parts of Meghalaya’s capital Shillong and East Khasi Hills district area was extended ""until further orders"" on Sunday after the death of a 37-year-old man, taking the toll in clashes between tribal and non-tribal people to three.

""Curfew extended in parts of Shillong until further orders as there is every likelihood of serious breach of peace and tranquility which may lead to loss of life and property,"" East Khasi Hills District Magistrate M. War Nongbri said.

The district police said three unidentified men attacked Uphas Uddin in his house at Pyrken village at about 2:45 a.m. on Sunday. A local health centre declared him brought dead.

He was the third victim of the clashes that erupted at Ichamati near the Bangladesh border on February 28 following a meeting between the Khasi Students' Union (KSU) and non-tribal people in the area. The meeting was organised to gather support against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and for the introduction of the inner-line permit (ILP).

Tribal organisations in Meghalaya have been demanding the ILP system, already applicable in four other north-eastern states, for restricting the entry of outsiders into the State.

The February 28 clash claimed the life of a KSU member identified as 35-year-old Lurshai Hynniewta. A 31-year-old vegetable vendor, identified as Rupchand Dewan of Assam's Barpeta district, was stabbed to death in Shilling's Iewduh (Barabazar) area in a retaliatory attack on February 29.

At least 15 people have been injured in the clashes since February 28, some undergoing treatment in hospitals. Petrol bombs were also thrown in certain localities. However, no damage of property was reported.

121,2020/03/01,HAL finalises plan to produce military helicopter on par with Boeing’s Apache Guardian,"The Indian Air Force is procuring a total of 22 Apache Guardian attack helicopters from aerospace major Boeing under a multi-billion dollar deal

In an ambitious project with strategic significance, aerospace major Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) has started ground work to produce a 10 to 12 tonne attack helicopter by 2027 which will be comparable with some of the best medium-lift military choppers globally like the Apache of the Boeing.

Chairman and Managing Director of HAL, R. Madhavan, said the aim of the mega project is to stop import of more than ₹4 lakh crore worth of military helicopters for the three services in the coming years.

In an interview, Mr. Madhavan said the HAL has completed the preliminary design of the helicopter and that initial plan is to produce at least 500 units with the first prototype set to be ready by 2023 if the government gives the go ahead to the project this year.

“One major project we are focusing on is to produce a helicopter in 10 to 12 tonnes category to replace the Mi-17 fleet. It will be an indigenous platform with the potential to manufacture around 500 helicopters. It will stop import of more than ₹4 lakh crore worth of platforms from foreign countries,” he said.

Mr. Madhavan said an amount of ₹9,600 crore will be required for design as well as to produce the prototype of the helicopter.

“If we get the approval in 2020, we will be able to manufacture the first chopper by 2027. We are looking at producing at least 500 helicopters of the variant. It will be a major project we are working on,” he said.

A military expert described the project as the biggest by the HAL after development of the Tejas military aircraft.

“We have done the preliminary design. We have also been in discussion with the Air Force and the Navy. The 10-12 tonnes category will have two basic structures on similar platforms. The naval version will have different dimension compared to the one for the Army and the Air Force,” Madhavan said on the proposed mega project.

“Like the LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) we developed from the Dhruv platform, a similar variant of 10-12 tonnes category can be produced to make it an Apache equivalent,” said Mr. Madhavan.

The helicopter will be powered by twin engines and will feature blade folding option for ship deck operations. The planned roles for the helicopter will be to support air assault, air transport, combat logistics and combat search and rescue. The chopper will also have a very superior weapons package.

Mr. Madhavan said the helicopter will have a huge potential for export.

The Mi-17 helicopters make up the backbone of the IAF’s helicopter fleet and they are planned to be phased out by 2032.

The HAL’s product range includes a number of helicopter like the LCH (Light Combat Helicopter) and multi-role ALH (Advanced Light Helicopter) and Chetak choppers.

Speaking at a public rally at the Sahid Minar grounds, Mr. Shah emphasised that a fear is being spread among sections of the population over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and added that “no minority from Kolkata or West Bengal will lose citizenship because of the CAA”.

The Minister reiterated that the CAA is a law to give citizenship, not to take it away. “The refugees are being made to fear that they will have to produce documents. Nothing of this sort will happen. Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist and Jains do not need any documents,” he said.

He added that by opposing a law passed in Parliament, Ms. Banerjee was disrespecting the founding fathers of the Constitution.

“We will continue to raise the demand of Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation on the floor of the House. It is a disastrous failure of the government and there was mayhem all around. Somebody has to be held accountable,” Mr. Chowdhury told The Hindu.

“When Delhi was burning, the Home Minister was extending hospitality to [U.S.] President [Donald] Trump. He cannot skirt responsibility as it has tarnished our image globally,” Mr. Chowdhury said.

He said the fact that the Delhi police, considered a better police force, could not control pointed to “some sort of nexus between the rioters and a section of police officials.”

The Labour Ministry is keen to retain an interest rate of 8.65 per cent paid on provident fund deposits to around six crore subscribers of retirement fund body EPFO for the current financial year, a source said.

The apex decision making body of Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) -- Central Board of Trustees -- is likely to consider the rate of interest on EPF (Employees’ Provident Fund) deposits in its meeting scheduled on March 5, 2020.

“The proposal to provide interest rate on EPF deposits for 2019-20 may come up for consideration and approval in the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) meeting on March 5,” a source said.

The source further said that the ministry is keen to retain the interest rate at 8.65 %, as was provided in financial year 2018-19.

Speculations are rife that the interest rate on EPF may be lowered to 8.5 % for the current fiscal, a tad lower than 8.65 per cent provided for 2018-19.

According to the source, the agenda for the CBT meeting has not yet been finalised and it is difficult to predict EPFO’s income projections for the current fiscal, which will be the basis for fixing the interest rate.

The finance ministry has been nudging the labour ministry for aligning the EPF interest rate with other small saving schemes run by the government like the public provident fund and post office saving schemes.

The labour ministry requires the finance ministry’s concurrence to provide a rate of interest on EPF deposits in a fiscal year. Since the Government of India is the guarantor, finance ministry has to vet the proposal for EPF interest rate to avoid any liability on account of shortfall in the EPFO income for a fiscal.

The EPFO had provided 8.65 % rate of interest to its subscribers for 2016-17 and 8.55 % in 2017-18. The rate of interest was slightly higher at 8.8 % in 2015-16.

As the fires ebbed, and roads to one of areas worst affected by the riots, Shiv Vihar Phase 7, opened up, 25-year-old Arshi picked her way out of the rubble of what was once her home in an area that is now a ghost town. When her family fled a few days ago, she says, their only thought was to save their lives as mobs tore down doors, set gas cylinders alight and destroyed their belongings.

My home is all right, says Arshi; but when she asked what she could salvage, she looks at her bare hands, and says, nothing at all. No clothes, no prized possessions, and no memories of the years her family has lived here.

As the district administration sets up relief centres and hands out claim forms for compensation, the family’s biggest worry, however, is that their crucial documents and all the papers in the house are strewn everywhere.

Aslam, a scrap dealer salvaged two bags worth of belongings from his home where he lived with his wife and three small children. He breaks down as he realises the mobs left nothing of the used refrigerators and air conditioner he had recently acquired with all his savings of ₹55,000.

His son Aftab, who accompanied his father back to Shiv Vihar, is visibly shaking with fear and wracked with sobs. A district official arrived to take stock of the losses, but soon lost interest and drove away, they say later.

According to resident welfare association officials, when the violence subsided and the fires burnt out, gangs of men began looting every building that was deserted. Many of them can still be seen, skulking in and out of the homes in the narrow lanes, right under the nose of the RAF and police personnel deployed to guard the streets, their t-shirts bulging with stolen goods.

As a result, the biggest task for officials will be not only distributing aid but also arranging new identification papers for the riot-affected.

For days, residents here either hid inside their homes without food or water, or took shelter at homes in other parts of riot-torn North-East Delhi. One of the officials, who asked not to be named, says he helped drive dozens out of the area to safety, until two men brandished a sword at him to stop him. Among those he saved was a paraplegic who had hidden in his own kitchen for three days without eating a thing. As he recounted the story, tears flowed down the official’s face.

Kamla Devi (name changed) returned to her home in the same gali. “We lived very happily together here, she said, as she checks her kitchen rations and other belongings. We can’t return until the others come back,” she adds.

Phase 7 was a mixed locality of Hindus and Muslims, she said, but since the violence of February, those whose homes were burnt, had moved into either Hindu or Muslim dominated areas nearby.

The fear of the police is as palpable as the smell of smoke in the area; people recount how unresponsive the forces were despite dozens of calls to 100. “They kept saying they would come, but it wasn’t until after Mr. Trump left India, and the NSA visited the area that the first batch came,” says Sanjeev (last name witheld).

“When we called and said the mobs are targetting Muslims in our gali, the police said, ‘you wanted Azaadi? Here it is’,” recalls Farhana.

In Chaman Park, just a stone’s throw from their own vandalised homes, hundreds of women are now crowding warehouses and garage spaces, opened out by owners for the riot displaced.

Donations of food are coming in from the community and citizens groups from around Delhi. As a man walks in with a bag of oranges to distribute, the children let out whoops of joy and run to him.

In a corner, Mumtaz Jehan sits quietly praying for her husband Imam Mohammad Vakil and their 20-year-old daughter Anam, both of whom are in hospital after a man threw acid on them as they fled the Madina mosque. Other women crowd around with their stories with one common refrain — they want to go back to their homes, which they fear will be taken over by intruders.

RAF officials say they are policing the area day and night to ensure no one can illegally occupy homes, and are escorting small groups as often as possible to check on the condition of their homes.

For most of the affected people, the return home — filled with horrific memories of the fateful night when they fled, the deaths of loved ones and the stark, charred rooms bereft of all their belongings — is cold comfort.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/z1cg4m/article30952281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1TH-CAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/delhi-violence-looted-burnt-out-homes-offer-little-welcome-to-shiv-vihars-riot-victims/article30952285.ece
127,2020/03/01,NPR | Why has the Bihar government said it will stick to the 2010 manual for updating the population register?,"An ally of the ruling NDA, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar made it clear that the 2020 format of the NPR has several contentious clauses.

The story so far: On February 25, the Bihar Assembly passed a unanimous resolution stating that there is no need for a National Register of Citizens in the State and that the implementation of the National Population Register (NPR) would be done strictly according to the 2010 format. An ally of the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar made it clear that the 2020 format of the NPR has several contentious clauses.

What is the National Population Register (NPR)?

The NPR is a database of usual residents in the country who have stayed in a local area for the past six months or more and who intend to remain in the same place for the next six months or more. The NPR is individual and identity specific unlike the Census which only provides information on the status of the residents of India and population swings.

The NPR database was first created in 2010. The electronic database of more than 119 crore usual residents of the country has already been created under the NPR in English as well as the regional languages. The data collection is done under the aegis of the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India. The NPR is undertaken under the provisions of The Citizenship Act, 1955 and The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003. The NPR was last updated, except in Assam and Meghalaya, in 2015-16.

How is the NPR linked to the National Register of Citizens?

Successive governments have said that the NPR is the mother database for “identity purposes”.

The Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003 mandates that particulars of “every family and individual” in the NPR would be used for verification in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) process. The Local Registrar is empowered, during verification, to mark out the particulars of individuals whose citizenship is doubtful, with “appropriate remarks” for further enquiry. The individual concerned has to then appear before the Sub-district or Taluk Registrar of Citizen Registration to prove he or she is a citizen before a formal decision is taken to include or to exclude their particulars in the National Register of Indian Citizens.

The onus to prove he or she is a citizen is entirely on the individual concerned. Thus, the data collected through NPR becomes the crux for determining the citizenship of a person.

Also Read No link between NRC and NPR, says Amit Shah

What is the NPR format of 2010?

Fifteen identity particulars of the individual members of the household are sought in the 2010 format. These include name, relationship to the head of the household, sex, date of birth, marital status, educational qualification, occupation/activity, names of parents, place of birth (of everybody staying in the household at the time), nationality, present address of usual residence, duration of stay at the present address and permanent residential address.

What does the updated manual of 2020 say?

The NPR 2020 enumeration exercise will be undertaken during April–September this year. Certain new information will be collected by enumerators in a house-to-house collection exercise such as Aadhaar, mobile, voter ID, passport and driving licence, if available with the residents on a voluntarily basis. Unlike in the 2010 NPR, the new format for NPR 2020 requires residents to disclose their mother tongue and the places and dates of birth of their parents even if they are not living in the same household at the time or not alive. Individuals have to disclose the districts and States of their parents’ birth.

What is the problem?

Besides Bihar, several State governments such as Kerala, West Bengal, Punjab have already objected to the implementation of NPR 2020, saying it is a harbinger for a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) to identify illegal migrants. The NRC exercise in Assam alone has seen the exclusion of over 19 lakh people from the citizens’ list in the State. Petitions have also been filed in the Supreme Court of India, describing the NPR as a facilitator for the NRC. State governments are nervous that the NPR data would be used to target citizens on the basis of their identity and deprive them of their citizenship. Fears about the NPR-NRC have been compounded with the passage of the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or the CAA of 2019, which fast-tracks citizenship-by-naturalisation process of persons from six religious communities, other than Muslims, who have fled persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

The NPR 2020 Manual says “date of birth is one of the important items of information being collected in the NPR”. But in a country where a large part of the population is underprivileged and where people have not been able to formalise their birth due to lack of access to health care, the task of disclosing the exact birth and place of birth, especially of their aged parents and orphans, would prove to be a daunting task, point out experts.

What lies ahead?

The workforce for updation of NPR 2020 has to be provided by the State governments. With more States objecting to the new format and its contentious clauses, the exercise may reach an impasse. Widespread doubts about the intentions behind the NPR may also affect the smooth conduct of the Census.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amaeol/article30952740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1153458725,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/npr-why-has-the-bihar-government-said-it-will-stick-to-the-2010-manual-for-updating-the-population-register/article30952741.ece
128,2020/03/01,No forcible land acquisition for house site distribution: Collector,"‘Govt. paying almost 2.5 times the prevailing land price’

Vizianagaram Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal said that there would not be any forcible land acquisition for the distribution of house sites planned to coincide with Ugadi.

“The government is paying almost 2.5 times more than the prevailing land price after studying the registration value of the lands in the respective areas,” he said. “Many landlords are coming forward to sell land to the government as they are getting good value for their properties,” Dr. Jawaharlal told The Hindu.

The land acquisition has led to a series of agitations by opposition parties.

The Collector said that 895 acres of land was available with the government, of which only 462 acres of land was being acquired for the distribution of house sites. “We have been developing 995 layouts in rural areas and 20 in urban areas such as Vizianagaram, Bobbili, Parvatipuram, Saluru and other places. The layouts will be developed as model colonies with all amenities,” he said.

“The land acquisition officiers have been permitted to withdraw ₹145 crore to acquire land. The government had already released ₹97 crore in phases and the remaining amount would be disbursed after the submission of bills,” Dr. Jawaharlal said.

“All village volunteers, secretaries and revenue officials were advised to carefully verify and choose genuine beneficiaries who will be allotted land for construction of houses in the future. As many as 33,926 people would get house sites in rural areas. The government will distribute house sites to 25,183 persosn in urban areas. The selection of 59,109 beneficiaries has been completed in all 34 mandals,” the Collector said.

Dr. Jawaharlal said that a high-level meeting would be conducted soon to speed up layout developments and finalise a list of selected beneficiaries in accordance with guidelines issued by the Special Officer and Chief Minister's Secretary K. Dhanunjaya Reddy, who recently visited the North Andhra region to review the house sites issue.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/no-forcible-land-acquisition-for-house-site-distribution-collector/article30958430.ece
129,2020/03/01,Gender parity need of the hour: Vasireddy Padma,"‘A.P. has set an example by introducing Disha Act’

Andhra Pradesh Mahila Commission Chairperson Vasireddy Padma on Sunday said that she would strive to focus her efforts on protecting the constitutional rights of women.

Speaking at a ‘Power Walk’ organised by the Commission, in association with the Women and Child Welfare Department, from PWD Ground to Tummalapalli Kalakshetram where the rally culminated in a meeting, Ms. Padma said that nobody can snatch the rights of women given by the Constitution.

“Gender discrimination is a serious issue. People should shun parochialism and contribute towards gender equality. The Jagan Mohan Reddy government in the State brought in the Disha Act for protection of girls and women, Andhra Pradesh set an example to the country by initiating such a move,” Ms. Padma said.

The Mahila Commission would organise a series of programmes to create awareness among people on key issues related to women welfare. As part of International Women’s Day on March 8, similar rallies would be conducted in Kurnool on March 5, in Rajamahendravaram on March 6, and in Visakhapatnam on March 7.

Krishna Collector Md. A. Imtiaz said women were making rapid strides in all fields. They were no less than their male counterparts in strengths, skills and intelligence, he said.

Director of Women and Child Welfare Department and Special Officer for Disha Act Kritika Shukla said that women had the right to enter any public place any time. She said the purpose of the Disha Act was to protect the rights of women and ensure speedy justice to victims of atrocities.

130,2020/03/01,"10 persons, including four chilli farmers, killed in road accidents","While a car fell into Kondaveeti Vagu, a lorry fell into a quarry

Ten persons were killed and eight others suffered injuries in two road accidents in Guntur district on Sunday.

The injured were admitted to the Government General Hospital (GGH) in Guntur, and the condition of two of them was stated to be critical.

Guntur (Urban) Superintendent of Police P.H.D. Ramakrishna said that six persons, who included four women, were killed when the car in which they were travelling fell 30 feet into the Kondaveeti Vaagu at Pulladigunta village of Vatti Cherukuru mandal.

The deceased were identified as Samadula Srinivas (51); P. Prasad (45); P.V. Lakshmi (50); S. Seethamma (50); P. Ramana (50); and Subba Rao (60). Native of Kakumanu village in the district, the victims were returning after attending a party.

Mr. Ramakrishna rushed to the spot and supervised the arrangements for shifting the injured to the hospital.

Ex gratia announced

Home Minister M. Sucharitha and district Collector Samuel Anand Kumar visited the GGH. Later, Ms. Sucharitha announced an ex gratia of ₹2 lakh to the next of kin of the bereaved families and directed the hospital authorities to provide best treatment to the injured.

One farmer critical

In another accident, four chilli farmers were killed and four others sustained injuries when a lorry laden with chilli, and in which they were travelling, fell into a 70-ft-deep quarry at Lachamallapadu village of Veldurthi mandal in Guntur rural district.

The deceased were native of Bodaveedu village. They were proceeding to sell the produce, said Guntur Rural SP Ch. Vijaya Rao.

“The condition of one farmer, who suffered a head injury, is said to be critical.

131,2020/03/01,80% beneficiaries get pension at their doorstep on first day,"‘Two months amount given to those who did not receive it in Feb.’

Over 47 lakh beneficiaries received their pension, which included social welfare and medical related, at their doorstep on the first day of the month on Sunday, covering 80% of the targeted section.

This is in contrast to about 10 days taken in the past to disburse pension to the beneficiaries, that too covering only 35% on the first day of the month.

The government sanctioned ₹1,384 crore for the month of March towards disbursal of pension to about 60 lakh beneficiaries, a release issued by the Chief Minister’s Office said.

Designated volunteers

The government had launched the new system in February this year, wherein designated volunteers disburse pension at the doorstep of the beneficiaries.

Fifty volunteers are tasked with catering to the needs of an equal number of households. These trained personnel use digital mapping, iris and face recognition tools to disburse pension. Special arrangements have been made to reach out to the beneficiaries residing in the areas where there is no proper communication network.

The volunteers disbursed pension to 26,20,673 beneficiaries by 8 a.m., and the figure touched 31 lakh by 9 a.m. By noon, 43.9 lakh beneficiaries received pension. By 2 p.m., 80% of the beneficiaries were covered.

The hurdles encountered in February were overcome this month, the release stated. The officials opened special cells in each district to monitor the exercise. Real-time data was used to address issues in the process. Those who did not receive pension last month due to some technical reasons were given two months pension now.

Criteria modified

“The government has modified the eligibility criteria under the YSR Pension Kanuka to ensure that the benefit reaches all the eligible persons across all sections of society,” the release said.

An amount of ₹2,250 is being provided under various categories, and the beneficiaries include old-age pensioners, widows, weavers, toddy-tappers, fishermen, single women, cobblers, and PLHIV (ART pensions).

Further, ₹3,000 is being provided to the eligible under Disabled Pension and ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 under CKDU/Dialysis Pension. Moreover, the minimum age limit to be eligible for the old-age pension has been reduced from 65 to 60 years.

With the increase in the number of pensioners, their total number has gone up to 60 lakh this year, which is nearly 10% of the estimated population of the State.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/f8wyqg/article30958368.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02VJPAGE4PENSION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/80-beneficiaries-get-pension-at-their-doorstep-on-first-day/article30958369.ece
132,2020/03/01,"Capital shift an illogical decision, says Kanna","‘Problem not confined to 29 villages; larger issues at stake’

BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana strongly objected to the concept of changing capital cities whenever a new party came to power and insisted that the proposal to have three capitals has driven away potential investors who had considered Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) a safe bet till the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) formed the government.

Mr. Lakshminarayana questioned where was the guarantee that a future government would not put the State in the reverse gear by shifting the capital to a place of its choice, hoping that wiser counsel would prevail on Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy at least now.

Expressing solidarity with the farmers whose protest against the shifting of capital completed 75 days, at Thullur in Guntur district on Sunday, he said the people of Visakhapatnam did not want the capital to be shifted to the port city as they feared that large-scale land grabbing would take place in the name of development.

The capital shift was a problem not confined to the 29 capital villages but it has serious ramifications in the future. The BJP stood for a single capital in Amaravati and Mr. Jagan would do well to understand that it (BJP) did not see any political mileage in the issue, he observed.

Joint plan of action

Mr. Lakshminarayana said the BJP and the Jana Sena Party would soon announce their course of action and accused both the YSRCP and the TDP of cheating people. It was unfortunate that Mr. Jagan did not respond to the plight of thousands of farmers who gave their land for the construction of the capital in Amaravati.

The State BJP chief said there was nothing positive about the nine-month rule of YSRCP as the CM was practising “politics of vengeance” and was least bothered about development. He deprived people of various benefits and created much hype about ‘Navaratnalu’ for which funds were being diverted from development schemes.

Corruption had increased a lot notwithstanding the CM’s impressive rhetoric that he would transform A.P. into a corruption-free State, Mr. Lakshminarayana added.

Women students and faculty members of Sri Padmavathi Mahila Viswa Vidyalayam (SPMVV) took out a ‘Power Walk’ on the arterial roads of Tirupati on Sunday to reclaim their rights.

Giving shape to an idea mooted by Andhra Pradesh Women’s Commission, the walk titled ‘Our space – Our right’ was meant to show that women have the right to walk into any place and at any time without an iota of fear.

Vice-Chancellor D. Jamuna formally launched the walk by flagging it off at the campus, which culminated at Jyotirao Phule Circle in Balaji Colony. She called upon men and women to join hands in wiping out gender inequalities and help in creating a future where women could achieve their goals and ambitions without having to face the stumbling blocks set by the patriarchal society. Prof. Jamuna also recalled the varsity’s motto of ensuring equal life opportunities for women through education and empowerment.

The event was conducted by the varsity’s departments of Women’s Studies, Students Affairs and Physical Education, in association with social organisations like Integrated Human Rights And Anti-Corruption Organisation (IHRAACO), Rashtriya Seva Samithi (RASS) and People’s Action for Social Service (PASS).

A total of 118 dengue cases and 37 malaria cases have been recorded in the district in the year 2019, according to reports. While authorities say that the number has come down, precautionary action has been amped up in the district to see to it there are no new cases.

The district officials have identified the affected areas and conducting awareness programmes in these areas, said District Malaria Officer A. Nookaraju.

Responding to a query, Mr. Nookaraju said that 12 cases of dengue and only three cases of malaria have been recorded this year, from January 1 to March 1. “Cases had come down significantly in the last year, and we expect the same for this year too,” he said.

According to the authorities, the district has consistently seen a downward trend in the number of dengue and malaria cases. Experts suggest that increased focus on health care, especially towards revamping public health centres and community health centres, would aid in controlling the diseases.

136,2020/03/01,APSRTC plans to launch energy efficiency drive,"Corporation and SEEDCO officials discuss the modalities

The A.P. State Energy Efficiency Development Corporation (AP-SEEDCO) and APSRTC have drawn up plans to convert 10 major bus stations, 128 bus depots and four workshops into energy-efficient ones starting with the Tirupati bus station complex.

Officials of the public carrier and SEEDCO have discussed the modalities of the project at a meeting recently and are going to give a presentation to the Transport, Roads and Buildings (TR&B) Department soon.

The annual electricity consumption of the major bus stations is 30 million units. It entails an expenditure of ₹28 crore for the APSRTC, according to a press release by State Energy Conservation Mission CEO A. Chandra Sekhar Reddy.

The objective of the energy efficiency drive in APSRTC is to reduce the wasteful consumption of energy by replacing the existing inefficient electrical appliances, including incandescent bulbs, conventional tubelights, inefficient fans, old air-conditioners and ordinary pumpsets, with energy-efficient BEE star-rated appliances.

SEEDCO will be advising suitable energy efficiency measures that will yield significant energy savings to the RTC. A team of the APSRTC and SEEDCO are shortly visiting the Ahmedabad and Vadodara central bus stations which took the lead in the country in adopting energy-efficiency technologies, to study the best practices.

APSRTC Vice-Chairman and Managing Director Madireddy Pratap has instructed the corporation officials to take necessary action for implementing the energy-efficiency programme.

According to him, the RTC will use modern technologies to provide better services and modern facilities to passengers. APSRTC chief engineer U. Srinivas and deputy electrical engineer A. Srinivasa Charyulu have been directed to pursue the issue with SEEDCO.

Government principal secretary (TR&B) M.T. Krishna Babu has said the energy efficiency project in APSRTC will go a long way in improving the public transport facility. Energy secretary N. Srikant has appreciated the proactive step of making APSRTC bus stations energy efficient.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5ke8k0/article30957953.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02ONGBUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/apsrtc-plans-to-launch-energy-efficiency-drive/article30957954.ece

143,2020/03/01,‘Gandhian philosophy need of the hour for survival of humanity’,"CSR has its roots in Gandhi’s thoughts, says ANU V-C

Gandhian philosophy based on truth and non-violence is all the more relevant to the contemporary society faced with multifarious problems, Acharya Nagarjuna University Vice-Chancellor P. Rajasekhar has observed.

Addressing a seminar on Mahatma Gandhi, Ideology, Philosphy and Relavance in Contemporary Society at the ANU P.G. Centre here on Saturday, he said the Gandhian philosophy based on morality was the need of hour for survival of mankind.

Corporate Social Responsibility had its roots in the trusteeship concept propounded by Mahatma Gandhi, who stressed on clean India and use of technology for scavenging.

But for Mahatma Gandhi the issues of the downtrodden section would not have been on the agenda of the Indian National Congress and in the literature of pre-Independence era, he said and recalled that Constitution architect B.R. Ambedkar had paid tribute at the time of his assassination that he was the true champion of Dalits’ cause.

Prof. Y. Chinna Rao of Jawaharlal Nehru University underscored the need for returning to some of Gandhi’s ideals and path. This would require a constant state of self reflexivity and commitment to goals of collective good.

“Gandhism has been dissipating steadily in our collective consciousness with selective appropriation of his ideals as in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a drive towards cleaner India,” said the Chairperson, Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy(CSSEIP) from JNU School of Social Sciences.

Thirty-eight papers were presented by scholars at the seminar sponsored by the Indian Council of Social Science Research(ICSSR), said seminar coordinator D. Venketwara Reddy.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gandhian-philosophy-need-of-the-hour-for-survival-of-humanity/article30954003.ece

146,2020/03/01,Vizag startup develops nutrition supplements for cancer patients,"We have gone for launch of two products: founder

A startup incubated at BioValley, a comprehensive entrepreneur incubation hub catering to convergence technologies in the fields of Medtech, Nutratech and Biotech, has developed nutrition supplements for cancer patients.

The products are made from natural vegetables with no side effects and can be consumed in powder form. “After successful clinical trials, we have gone for commercial launch of two products, giving a big relief to the patients during and after chemotherapy,” Raktim Chattopadhyay, founder and CEO of Esperer Onco Nutrition, the startup, told The Hindu.

According to Mr. Chatopadhyay, the cost of the supplements required by a patient is around ₹10,000 to ₹16,000 per month. If the consumption goes up or cross subsidy is extended by the government, the cost could be brought down significantly in future, he said.

The supplements were diabetic-friendly. It is lactose intolerant and can be swallowed through Royal tubes. At present, the startup is working on 23 formulations in the field of oncology care.

BioValley is located in the AP MedTech Zone.

Esperer Onco Nutrition is a clinical nutrition company born out of an idea to develop nutritional products which have better affinity to Indian guts and better clinical outcomes. Most of the nutraceuticals in India are either imported or else international formulas are copied by Indian operators. What remains unanswered is the bioavailability or affinity to Indian gut for optimal health outcome, BioValley CEO Amit Srivastava said.

The startup which was formed by pooling up ₹2 crore through seed capital opted for incubation in the city to study the Indian gut sensitivities with respect to different stages of cancer and also studied the nutritional elements role in different type of cancer taking advantage of infrastructure available at BioValley.

The startup’s nutraceutical products are aimed at tackling cachexia and adjuvants to assist in reduction of chemo load. Mr. Chattopadhyay is in jubilation as they have struck the right mix of formula and launched three products after clinical observatory studies. He said they have plans to develop more products and become a ₹100 crore company in the next three years.

The products have been tried by nearly 1,000 patients and the response is quite encouraging, he said. Some corporate hospitals, including Apollo and Fortis, have evinced interest for a tie-up to procure the products directly from the startup. The products are also being evaluated by National Health Scheme (NHS) in UK as the startup plans for foraying into overseas market.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/u4pn5x/article30953880.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-VZ-STARTUP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vizag-startup-develops-nutrition-supplements-for-cancer-patients/article30953881.ece
147,2020/03/01,‘Surya Kiranalu’ translated into Tamil,"The famous book was written by Dr. K. Surya Rao in 1976

A Tamil translation of ‘Surya Kiranalu’, a book authored by noted physician Kutikuppala Surya Rao, was released under the name ‘Surya Kiranangal’ here recently.

Dr. Surya Rao’s famous book, originally written in Telugu in 1976, depicts the disparity between the rich and the poor and other socio-economic issues. The book was critically acclaimed and has also been translated into Hindi earlier.

The book was translated into Tamil by Dravidian University associate professor P. Munaswamy, who heads the Department of Tamil Language.

Dr. Surya Rao, who hails from Kintali village on the outskirts of Srikakulam, was only 20 years old when he wrote the book.

“Great poets of Tamil Nadu, such as Tiruvalluvar and Mahakavi Subramaniya Bharatiyar greatly contributed to Indian literature with their simple yet profound language. With the help of my Tamil friends, I was able to study and understand the works of these great writers. This inspired me to get my book translated into Tamil with the help of Dr. Munaswamy,” Dr. Surya Rao said.

Dr. Surya Rao has also written other books such as Bala Ramayanam, Jabili Javabu and Swarajhari. His tireless efforts in working with HIV-affected patients won him the Padma Shri in 2008. Now 63 years old, Dr. Surya Rao said that parents must encourage their children to read literature and poetry from a young age.

149,2020/03/01,Will transform Dravidian University into world-class institution: Minister,"Foundation stone laid for new academic building and sports facilities

The State Government is keen on transforming Dravidian University into a world-class institution with the help of the other southern States of Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Minister for Panchayat Raj Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy said here on Saturday.

“The university will be provided the required infrastructure in a phased manner and new academic courses will be introduced,” the Minister said.

Accompanied by Deputy Chief Minister K. Narayanaswamy and Education Minister Adimulapu Suresh, Mr. Reddy laid the foundation stone for a new academic building and indoor and outdoor stadiums with an outlay of about ₹10 crore.

Addressing the teaching, non-teaching faculty and students at the newly-inaugurated M.S. Subbulakshmi Auditorium on the university campus at Kuppam, Mr Reddy said that by virtue of the university’s location at the tri-state junction, the varsity possessed an extraordinary potential to play a crucial role not only in the fields of academics and linguistics, but also as a centre of learning in science, engineering and technology.

“An action plan would be readied and submitted to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy in this regard. While it was the late N.T. Rama Rao who conceived and executed the idea of the Dravidian University in this backward region, the varsity saw fantastic growth during Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy’s government. Now, Mr Jagan is committed to continuing the legacy of YSR,” Mr. Reddy said.

Strengthening students

The Minister said that the State Government’s move to introduce English-medium education would be a boon to the students of the backward regions and lead to strengthening them with competitive skills.

Chittoor MP N. Reddappa said that the long-pending demand for a degree college at Mallanur near Kuppam would be brought to the notice of the State Government. He said that he was ready to contribute to Dravidian University’s development through his MPLADS.

Vice-Chancellor G. Lokanatha Reddy said that ₹3 crore would be spent on widening the roads on the university campus, and construction of indoor and outdoor stadiums and academic building would be expedited. “In coordination with the governments of neighboring southern States, new courses in linguistics would be introduced, apart from strengthening research activities,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/will-transform-dravidian-university-into-world-class-institution-minister/article30953847.ece

Yogi Vemana University founder and vice-chancellor Arjula Ramachandra Reddy called upon the State government to identify universities which have a potential for excellence and meet their funding requirements to boost development.

Prof. Reddy was addressing the university’s faculty members on Saturday at a seminar titled ‘Faculty’s role in university and societal development’ here on Saturday.

“As universities are at a crossroads, it is for the teaching staff to redeem the pride of such universities by adopting innovative practices and out-of-the-box ideas,” said Prof. Reddy. He said that he saw a greater need for the States, especially a newly-formed one like Andhra Pradesh, to explore opportunities towards generating employment and offering quality service to the aspiring youth.

“The State government must appoint an appropriate committee at the earliest to evaluate new universities based on their academic and research track record. With consistent financial support and refreshing research atmosphere, the State can create world-class universities,” he said. He added that several varsities are facing a shortage of funds, with the financial support from even Central agencies like DBT and DST dwindling sharply.

“The declining trend in research funding is gradually turning the universities into mere colleges,” he said.

The senior academician also suggested that every university have extension centres and incubating centres to keep an ear to the ground for generating innovative research ideas.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-urged-to-identify-varsities-with-potential-for-excellence/article30953794.ece

Leaders of Telugu Desam Party(TDP) have come down heavily on the YSR Congress Party government for its alleged ‘anti-poor’ excise policy, and called for a total ban on liquor in the State.

Addressing a media conference here on Saturday, TDP district unit official spokesman Anam Venkata Ramana Reddy alleged that the State is ruining the health of people as they were forced to consume cheap liquor following removal of reputed brands of liquor hitherto available in the shops.

“The poor quality of locally-manufactured liquor being sold in the range of ₹90 to ₹120 is affecting the health of the people,” he said, alleging that there was a nexus between ruling the partymen and manufacturers.

Consumer charges from ₹10 to ₹25 from tipplers were being pocketed by ruling party MLAs as the excise department staff allegedly remained mute spectators. “The day is not far off when the number of vithanthu(widow) pensions goes up,” he said.

He disputed the government’s claim that there was a reduction in consumption of liquor and said illicit liquor thrived going by the sale of palm jaggery.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/liquor-policy-ruining-peoples-lives-tdp/article30953779.ece

Senior medical professional and chairman of Hyderabad-based Asian Institute of Gastroenterology D. Nageshwar Reddy urged young doctors to be empathetic towards their patients, which he said would ensure their faster recovery.

Delivering his address at the 10th convocation of Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS University) here on Saturday, the Padma Bhushan recipient dwelt at length on the importance of empathy in medical care and the need for doctors to step into the shoes of their patients in order to understand their pain.

“You have been taught the science of medicine, i.e., the diagnosis, treatment and surgery, but what is not taught to you is the art of medicine, which involves empathy and care,” he said.

Dr. Reddy mentioned the world-famous painting ‘The Doctor’ by Luke Fildes, wherein a doctor is depicted in deep contemplation seated next to a young critically-ill girl as her parents look on helplessly in the background. “The painting shows the doctor’s empathy towards his patient. Your profession is incomplete without empathy. My statement might seem superficial to you, but when you practice for a long period, you will understand the importance of empathy,” Dr. Reddy said.

He later gave away degrees, doctorates and gold medals to the graduating doctors.

TTD Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy, who is also the vice-chairman of the SVIMS executive board, participated in the proceedings.

SVIMS Director and vice-chancellor B. Vengamma presented her report. Among those who received gold medals were M .Soumya (M.D. Medicine), Gorantla Mamatha (Subhashini K.

Officials of the Vigilance and Enforcement (V&E) and Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) booked 426 cases against those selling “unsafe, substandard and misbranded” items in the State.

The cases were booked in the last three years and, in a few cases, conviction was awarded under different Sections of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, said V&E Director-General K.V. Rajendranath Reddy.

“To control food adulteration, and sale of misbranded, substandard and harmful food items and products, the V&E, in association with the FSSAI, conducted 279 surprise checks on various establishments in the State in 2017, 2018 and 2019,” Mr. Reddy said.

The teams inspected sweet shops, dairy units, tea and coffee powder shops, edible and ghee outlets, restaurants, hotels and fast food centres, ice-cream parlours, cool drink shops, bakeries, packaged drinking water units, warehouses, shops and other establishments, he said.

“Officers conducted raids on wholesale shops, retail outlets, packing units, transport points and manufacturing units. As many as 426 samples of various products and food items have been collected and sent to the State Food Laboratory, Hyderabad, for analysis,” he said.

Based on the lab results, 135 criminal cases had been registered for selling unsafe food items.

Besides, 292 adjudication cases had been registered for manufacturing, storing and selling misbranded and substandard food, toned milk, ice- creams, chocolates, and other eatables.

‘Rotten dishes’

“In some restaurants, hotels, eateries and fast food centres, we found highly unhygienic conditions in the kitchen. Raw meat, seafood and chicken and cooked non-vegetarian dishes were found stored in refrigerators for more than a month. Some dishes were rotten,” said FSSAI Krishna district Assistant Food Controller N. Purnachandra Rao, who was part of the raids.

Mr. Rajendranath Reddy said the inspection teams, during raids on fruit stalls and wholesale traders, observed that some were using harmful drugs and powders to ripen fruits such as papaya, banana, mangoes, sapota and other varieties.

Krishna district Regional Vigilance and Enforcement Officer (RVEO) Venkat Reddy said in some restaurants and hotels, chefs were using adulterated edible oil and colours that were harmful to humans.

Punishment

Under Section 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, those manufacturing or selling unsafe food were liable for imprisonment of six months to life (depending on the gravity of the case), besides a fine of up to ₹10 lakh.

“Of the 426 cases, 103 were registered in Krishna district, 53 each in Visakhapatnam and Chittoor, 39 in Srikakulam and 32 in West Godavari district,” the D-G said.

“V&E will continue the raids across the State.

Leaders of the Andhra Pradesh United Teachers’ Federation (APUTF) are gearing up for a State-wide protest on March 3 for the delay in repealing of the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) and replacing it with the old pension scheme.

‘Implement PRC’

They are also upset over an “inordinate delay” in the implementation of the Pay Revision Commission (PRC).

At a meeting here on Saturday, federation’s State president Shaik Sabji and general secretary P. Babu Reddy pointed out that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had promised to the employees, during his padayatra before the elections, that he would scrap the CPS within one month of his assuming power and also implement the PRC, which had not happened so far.

Two committees were constituted for the purpose, one with the Ministers and the other with officials, and none of which had come out with any report. They said that instead of whiling away valuable time, the government should initiate immediate measures to fulfil the promises it had made.

On March 3, the leaders said that teachers across the State would take out rallies and participate in meetings.

They said that since 18 months had already passed, funds for PRC implementation should be allocated in the forthcoming budget. They said the government had dashed the hopes of lakhs of employees, teachers and pensioners, who had been eagerly waiting for redress of their issues.

Non-teaching work

They also objected to the allocation of non-teaching works to teachers due to which their daily work was adversely affected, and it might impact the academic result of the children.

Pointing to the fact that teachers had to spend long hours in updating the daily data and uploading photographs as part of government schemes, they demanded that the responsibility be shifted to the Welfare and Education Assistants appointed in Village Secretariats.

Teachers should also exempted from the Naadu-Nedu programme, and only the school management committees should be held responsible for it, they said.

Filling the vacant teacher posts in schools and drawing of an action plan for the proposed introduction of junior colleges in the government sector from the next academic year included their other demands.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/teachers-gearing-up-for-protest-on-march-3/article30953652.ece
157,2020/03/01,APSEB engineers call for speedy completion of pending projects,"In a letter, AAEEA urges Energy Secretary to drop move to sell RTPP

The APSEB Assistant Executive Engineers’ Association (AAEEA) has appealed to Energy Secretary N. Srikant to take steps for completing the construction of the 800 MW units at Dr. Narla Tatarao Thermal Power Station (NTTPS) and Sri Damodaram Sanjeevaiah Thermal Power Station (SDSTPS), and the 12 x 80 MW Polavaram hydro electric project at the earliest.

‘Unnecessary expenditure’

The association has also suggested that the A.P. New and Renewable Energy Development Corporation (NREDCAP), the A.P. Solar Power Corporation Limited (APSPCL), and the A.P. Tribal Power Company Limited (AP-TRIPCO) be merged with the AP-Genco and the State Energy Conservation Mission with the AP-Transco to curtail unnecessary expenditure by entrusting the works to the chief engineers.

In a letter to Mr. Srikant, AAEEA president N. Vamsi Srinivas and general secretary N. Lakshmana Rao stated that the government should give up the proposed sale of the Rayalaseema Thermal Power Plant (RTPP) to the NTPC by expressing willingness to run the plant (RTPP) in line with the NTPC model.

They opposed the handing over of operations and maintenance services at the SDSTPS to private players on the ground that the AP-Genco was running it efficiently with the lowest man-to-MW ratio of 0.18 in the country.

Loss to Transco

The AAEEA further said that the ‘three substations per zone’ proposal was a huge loss to the AP-Transco, and that the practice of holding monthly technical meetings with the APSEB Executive Engineers’ Association and AAEEA in the run-up to A.P. Power Coordination Committee meetings should be restored.

The AAEEA office-bearers sought action to sort out various HRD issues such as bifurcation of employees between Andhra Pradesh and Telangana power utilities, recruitments, senior-junior conflict in assistant executive engineer and assistant engineer promotions, EPF and GPF etc.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/apseb-engineers-call-for-speedy-completion-of-pending-projects/article30953609.ece

The TTD, as never before, has sanctioned a grant of ₹100 crore to the Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS), acknowledging its pivotal role in catering to the needs of the people of the backward Rayalseema districts.

Informing this to the media here on Saturday, TTD Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy said the TTD Board, during its maiden budget meeting, also approved a grant of ₹55 crore collectively to the Balaji Institute of Research and Rehabilitation for Disabled (BIRRD) hospital, SSSN Trust, and Sravanam projects.

Of this, ₹8.5 crore would be spent on creating better amenities to the patients at the BIRRD hospital and construction of new operation theatres.

Other projects

It was also resolved to take up construction of a new building for the benefit of students studying in S.V. Deaf and Dumb School (₹34 crore); a hostel for the training institute of special children at SV Zoo park (₹14 crore); widening works relating to Alipiri and Cherlopalli road (₹16 crore) and construction of a temple of Goddess Padmavati at Chennai (₹3.92 crore).

A cyber security wing would be set up with the technical support of Bengaluru-based Infosys to efficiently deal with reports being circulated on various social media platforms against the TTD.

The board also resolved to waive off the toll collected from the two- wheelers at its Alipiri checking point and, at the same time, enforce a uniform fee of ₹50 and ₹200 for light motor and heavy vehicles.

In reply to a question, Mr. Reddy said the management was awaiting a report from the MD of Hyderabad Metro Rail with regard to the feasibility of setting up a light metro rail between Tirumala and Tirupati.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ttd-sanctions-grant-of-100-crore-to-svims/article30953537.ece
159,2020/03/01,‘YSRCP leaders secretly want Amaravati as capital’,"They are afraid of voicing their opinions, claims CPI leader K. Narayana

Communist Party of India (CPI) senior leader K. Narayana on Saturday said that everyone, including leaders of the YSR Congress, wanted Amaravati to continue as the capital city of the State. However, the ruling party leaders were afraid of openly voicing their opinions, he alleged.

Addressing a roundtable meeting organised by the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi Joint Action Committee (JAC) in the city, the CPI leader said that except for Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, none of his party leaders wanted the capital to be shifted out of Amaravati.

“If you want proof, conduct a narco-analysis test on them,” Mr. Narayana said in a lighter vein.

The CPI leader said that Mr. Jagan, in a way, had united his opponents. “The Communist parties and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had always been opponents. But today, we share a common platform for the cause of Amaravati,” he said.

He said that the fight against the decision will continue, and, “if the need arises, we will not hesitate to bring governance to a standstill in the State”.

Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader Varla Ramaiah launched a scathing attack on Minister Botcha Satyanarayana for his remarks that TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu would not be allowed to step into the north Andhra region. “We have never known the culture of hurling rotten eggs and footwear on leaders in the past,” he rued.

TDP leader Vangaveeti Radhakrishna wondered why Mr. Jagan cannot follow the precedent set by his father Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy in continuing the projects instituted by his predecessor, particularly the Hi-Tec City project.

Ex gratia sought

A resolution was adopted at the meeting demanding compensation for the families of farmers who had died during the Amaravati agitation, expansion of the JAC protest programmes across the State, and spreading their protests to Hyderabad.

The leaders decided to visit Delhi and meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and other Central Ministers from March 3 to drum up support for the cause of Amaravati. Withdrawal of cases against women protesters and steps to stop misuse of SC/ST Act were among their other demands.

160,2020/03/01,BJP leaders complain of ‘volatile law & order’ in State to Governor,"They blame YSRCP and TDP for it; TDP takes Vizag issue to Harichandan’s notice

Bharatiya Janata Party MP G.V.L. Narasimha Rao met Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan at the Raj Bhavan here on Saturday and complained about the volatile law and order situation, blaming the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and TDP for it. He was pointing at the politics of confrontation prevailing in the State.

Speaking to mediapersons later, Mr. Narasimha Rao said the leaders of the two parties could make comments but the rivalry should not spill on to the streets as it would vitiate the peaceful atmosphere. The consequences thereof could be dangerous, he said, and said he also apprised the Governor of the latest developments. He observed that it was a courtesy call but he took the opportunity to throw light on the overall scenario.

Meanwhile, a delegation of TDP leaders comprising MLC B. Arjunudu, former Minister Nakka Ananda Babu, APSRTC former chairman Varla Ramaiah and others submitted a memorandum to the Governor, requesting him to look into the high-handed behaviour of the police personnel during the TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu’s visit to Visakhapatnam.

He alleged that YSRCP activists created trouble as part of a conspiracy to scuttle Mr. Naidu's ‘Praja Chaitanya Yatra’ and the police remained mute spectators. He accused some YSRCP leaders of exhorting his party cadres to prevent Mr. Naidu from entering the city.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bjp-leaders-complain-of-volatile-law-order-in-state-to-governor/article30953463.ece

Mr. Brahmananda Reddy has reportedly confessed to have handled the sale of assigned lands of over 450 acres, belonging to farmers of Scheduled Caste in the Capital area.

He also reportedly confessed about the inflow of money from former Ministers and other prominent persons to procure the lands illegally. Revenue officials and officials in the Sub-Registrar offices were also allegedly involved in the dealings.

Documents pertaining to the transactions, bank account statements and video recordings of farmers signing away their assigned lands were seized during the searches.

Another aspect of importance that came to light was that a former Advocate General has reportedly acquired lands in the Capital area through insider trading by funding his close relatives.

163,2020/03/01,NWKRTC may get road tax exemption,"23rd foundation day celebrated

Large and Medium Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar has assured to see that the government provides road tax exemption to NWKRTC for another five years along with reimbursing the subsidy arrears of students pass and fulfilling other demands.

Speaking at the 23rd foundation day ceremony here on Sunday, Mr. Shettar said that considering the dire financial status, a service-oriented public sector enterprise like NWKRTC deserves support from the government.

Measures like giving exemption from paying road tax proved to be of help to improving services. “NWKRTC was given exemption from paying road tax for a period of five years during my tenure as Chief Minister. The decision to provide exemption from paying road tax was taken ignoring the objections raised by the Finance Department and others and this bold decision has indeed helped improve the condition of NWKRTC, which was facing financial crunch,” he said.

Mr. Shettar further stated that road tax exemption was not extended after 2016 despite several pleas to the then Congress government. “I will again take up this issue with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and try to see that road tax exemption was given for another five years to NWKRTC. Similarly, I will also try to see that the student pass arrears amounting to ₹ 722 crore was reimbursed at the earliest,” he said.

Mr. Shettar said that to sort out staff crunch issue in State road transport corporations, the State government has approved a proposal to make fresh appointments to the posts of drivers and conductors. The government has given the green signal for NWKRTC to appoint 2,500 drivers and conductors, he said and suggested that the process of these appointments be completed at the earliest.

Referring to the decision to shift the services of nearly 500 long route buses from the old bus stand to the new regional bus stand at Hosur here, he said that it was necessary considering the increased traffic and congestion at the old bus stand. It was planned to shift these services out of the old bus stand a long ago but somehow it did not materialise. The public have to cooperate with the authorities in the matter, he said.

Mr. Shettar gave away gold and silver medals to the best performing drivers and other staff on this occasion.

The former Minister and MLC Basavaraj Horatti suggested maintaining professional standards focusing on business aspects in operational practices to check losses.

NWKRTC chairman V.S. Patil and managing director P. Rajendra Cholan and others spoke.

164,2020/03/01,"Mysuru’s leaf litter goes up in flames everyday, unchecked","This is causing health issues to the elderly and those with respiratory diseases

The indiscriminate burning of dry leaves and solid waste, including plastic, refuse, strewn on the roadside in many parts of Mysuru causing a blanket of thick smoke enveloping the neighbourhoods and polluting the air, has raised serious health concerns, particularly among the elderly and people with respiratory diseases.

A large volume of leaf litter goes up in flames here with no proper mechanism of recycling the organic waste.

Despite warning by the civic authorities, instances of dry leaves shed from trees and dried weeds in vacant plots, besides uncleared solid wastes, being set on fire have become more common.

Leaves falling off from trees are common in this season and one could see heaps of dry biomass in many parts of the city. The burning incidents, including at night, in public places have caused restiveness to many residents who had complained to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board for action against such incidents that are causing air pollution.

Burning waste, including leaf litter, is prohibited under the law and the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) can penalise those setting ablaze waste in its limits to address the issue. Leaf burning cases are more rampant along the Outer Ring Road and also in MUDA and panchayat areas. MCC had penalised a few persons for burning waste recently but the fine amount for individuals is meagre.

University of Mysore was also fined for having let the waste on its campus burn despite a couple of warnings. A sum of ₹10,000 was fined on the university recently.

Acting on the public complaints, the KSPCB has written to the Commissioner of MUDA and the Chief Executive Officer of Mysuru Zilla Panchayat to look into the matter and take action as the burning was causing pollution and inconvenience and health issues to the residents. “We have sought action from the MUDA and the ZP since the complaints had been received from the residents under their jurisdictions,” said Senior Environment Officer (Mysuru urban) B.M. Prakash.

The KSPCB had received complaints from areas around Bogadi such as Vijayanagar 3rd and 4th Stage, BEML Layout Second Stage, Ramakrishnanagar, and so on. Since some areas had been developed with permission from the MUDA and a few are still part of gram panchayats despite being an integral part of the city, the KSPCB wrote to the MUDA and the ZP for action.

Copies of the KSPCB letter had been forwarded to the Deputy Commissioner.

MCC Health Officer D.G. Nagaraj told The Hindu that pourakarmikas had been told not to burn dry leaves and handle leaf litter like how they clear solid wastes. “It’s a serious matter and the public can inform us if anybody sets the waste on fire in our limits. We shall penalise them for the wrongdoing.”

He said dry leaf composter have been established in many parks to address the issue of leaf litter.

As per norms, the contractors responsible for handling wastes in their wards are supposed to clear leaf litter without citing reason.

Finding a way out

Is there a way to address the problem of leaf litter? One of the solutions is to turn the leaf litter into manure by establishing composters. They act as valuable nutrients to the soil. The MCC has set up leaf composters in some parks here but it is not sufficient.

KSPCB official B.M. Prakash said: “The MCC can also think of recycling leaf litter into products that act as fuel for industries as done in the case of coffee husk.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/votu0b/article30957567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGLEAF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysurus-leaf-litter-goes-up-in-flames-everyday-unchecked/article30957569.ece

168,2020/03/01,Services of Revenue Dept. will be available at doorsteps: Ashok,"DCs will visit villages and address grievances of villagers. says Minister

The State government is embarking on a novel method to ensure that services and social security schemes of the Revenue Department are available to beneficiaries at their doorsteps, Revenue Minister R. Ashok has said.

Addressing the gathering at the birthday celebrations of Dattatreya Patil Revoor, MLA, here on Friday, Mr. Ashok said that Deputy Commissioners across the State will identify the villages of their respective districts and visit them for a day and address the grievances of the villagers.

“We have seen villagers running from pillar to post in government offices to collect documents and seek justice. Now, it is the turn of Deputy Commissioners, Assistant Commissioners, Tahsildars, Revenue Inspectors, and other officials to spend at least one day a month at a village and attend to grievances,” Mr. Ashok said.

He added that grievances related to agriculture land, official documents, schools, anganwadi centres, healthcare facilities should be resolved on the spot.

The officers, instead of a brief visit, should have to stay there for a whole day and have their lunch at an anganwadi centre or at a Dalit’s house, he said. Mr. Ashok also announced that pensions for old age, widows, and other social security will be soon linked with the Aadhaar card and the pension will be directly credited to the beneficiary’s account.

Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai praised Mr. Revoor and said that the BJP will scale newer heights in Kalyana Karnataka under his representation.

Mr. Bommai recalled how his [Mr. Dattatreya’s] father, the late Chandrashekar Patil Revoor, toiled to strengthen the BJP in Kalyana Karnataka.

“During his [Mr. Chandrashekar Patil] tenure, the BJP in Kalaburagi took control of the mahanagara palike for the first time,” Mr. Bommai said, and wished Mr. Dattatreya Patil luck on trying to repeat history.

169,2020/03/01,Hosur bus terminal to be functional from today,"It was inaugurated by Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu almost a month ago

The regional bus terminal of the North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation, which was inaugurated by Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu almost a month ago, will become functional from Sunday [March 1].

While the bus terminal was inaugurated on February 2, various technical issues had delayed the functioning of the terminal, and the delay in the widening of the Unakal-Hosur Link Road, connecting Vani Vilas Circle, had only further added to the problems.

However now, according to officials, the issues have been resolved and in all 309 buses will ply through the Hosur bus terminal and 319 buses would ply through the new bus station on Gokul Road from March 1.

As per their plan, the long distance buses will enter the Hosur terminal from the entrance opposite Mahila Vidyapeeth on Hubballi-Dharwad Road and will leave via the Unakal-Hosur-Vanivilas Circle Road.

According to NWKRTC officials, more buses will ply from the Hosur terminal once the Unakal-Hosur Link Road gets widened fully.

However that is likely to take more time than required as several families have to be relocated and the government is planning to build mutli-storey group housing project for them.

The Hosur terminal has been built at a cost of ₹65 crore. Much planning has gone into giving an aesthetic look to the terminal, which has six platforms, which can accommodate six buses at a time.

For the convenience of the passengers, the terminal has facilities like subways, three escalators, 11 lifts, ramps, and staircases. Boarding buses from the terminal will also be easy for the visually challenged persons as tract dot tiles (TDT) have been used for the floors.

Considering the need for a city (feeder) bus station, a provision has also been made for it and six city buses can be halted at a time. A foot overbridge helps the passengers to cross the busy road.

On Sunday, a formal programme will be held at the Hosur bus terminal to mark its commissioning.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gfdgkc/article30953492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hosur-bus-terminal-to-be-functional-from-today/article30953493.ece
170,2020/03/01,‘Plans to develop residential layouts will be chalked out’,"No new layouts have been formed in twin cities of late

The Hubballi-Dharwad Urban Development Authority (HDUDA) will chalk out plans to develop residential layouts in the twin cities and distribute at least 8,000 to 10,000 residential plots in the next three years, according to the new chairman of HDUDA, Nagesh Kalburgi.

Speaking to presspersons after assuming charge on Friday, Mr. Nagesh said his priority will be developing new residential layouts.

It might be recalled that HDUDA has failed to come up with any new residential layouts in the last couple of years owing to various reasons, including non-availability of land and lack of response from land owners for the offers given by the authority.

Mr. Nagesh said that the State government had approval for building houses under Group Housing Scheme and the authority planned to use the vacant sites in the layouts that were developed years ago. A plan will also be initiated to allot vacant sites in the HDUDA layouts in a month.

Mr. Kalburgi said that steps will be taken to convince farmers having land on the outskirts of the twin cities to join hands with HDUDA in developing residential layouts.

He said they contemplating offering 50% of the sites at the newly developed layouts to the land owners after purchasing the land.

To a query, he said that the new Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP) will be implemented in the twin cities in a phased manner.

To another query, he said that strict action will be taken against those officials indulging in corrupt practices. On the illegal layuts he said that a task force, comprising officials and HDUDA members, will be formed soon look into the issue and also create awareness among people about such illegal layouts.

“Stringent action will be initiated against the developers of such illegal layouts,” he said.

171,2020/03/01,Cong. leaders seek action against Yatnal,"Continuing the agitation against BJP leader Basanagouda Patil Yatnal, Congress leaders have demanded that Governor Vajubhai Vala take action against the MLA for his derogatory remarks against veteran freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy.

In a protest held on Friday near Ambedkar Circle, several leaders, including MLA M.B. Patil, Congress leader Abdul Hamid Mushrif, and former MLA C.S. Nadagouda, criticised Mr. Yatnal. In his address, Mr. Patil alleged that Mr. Yatnal spends all his time making controversial statements and creating communal disturbance.

Saying the during the course of his political career, Mr. Yatnal had criticised almost every leader of the BJP, JD(S) and Congress, Mr. Patil asked if there was anyone left for him to go after. “Tomorrow, he might criticise 12th century social reformer Basveshwara,” he said.

Accusing the BJP of not taking any action against people such as Mr. Yatnal, Parvesh Verma, Kapil Mishra and Anurag Thakur, Mr. Patil said that taking no action meant the party supported its leaders’ provocative statements.

“Doreswamy has made a tremendous contribution to the country by fighting against the British. Today, Yatnal calls such a great man a fake freedom fighter and a Pakistan agent,” Mr. Mushrif said.

Advising Mr. Yatnal to focus on the development of the city instead of making controversial statements, he said the party would continue agitations against him.

Mr. Nadagouda said that with this kind of loose talk, Mr. Yatnal was defaming the leaders of the district.

“Vijayapura district is known for some of the best politicians and people still remember them. But with such irresponsible and insensitive remarks, Yatnal is bringing a bad name to all these leaders,” he said.

He also criticised a section of the media for giving “too much publicity” to people like Mr. Yatnal and his actions.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cong-leaders-seek-action-against-yatnal/article30953477.ece
172,2020/03/01,Ban on stone-crushing turns political in Mandya,"The curbs on stone-crushing activity at a quarry owned by a Janata Dal (Secular) leader in Mandya district has turned political with the party’s national president H.D. Deve Gowda on Saturday stepping in to protest.

Mr. Gowda protested against the ban on crushing at the quarry of H.T. Manju at Shivapura, K.R. Pet taluk. The JD(S) national president inspected the quarry, interacted with people in the surrounding areas and later addressed the workers at a protest meet held at Haralahalli in the same taluk.

Horticulture Minister K.C. Narayana Gowda, representing K.R. Pet Assembly segment, had recently requested the State government to curb activities at the crusher. Mr. Narayana Gowda, earlier with the JD(S), shifted loyalties to the BJP and won in the recent byelections.

Mr. Deve Gowda accused the district administration of targeting his party workers and warned of his party escalating the issue in both the Houses during the State Budget sessions.

According to him, such measures would affect the livelihood of dependant employees.

There has been action against dozens of stone-crushing units in this region, especially in K.R. Pet, Srirangapatna and Pandavapura taluks.

173,2020/03/01,Pope expels convicted Kerala priest,"Robin Vadakkanchery sentenced to 20 years rigorous imprisonment in the Kottiyoor rape case.

Pope Francis invoked special powers to expel Kerala priest Robin Vadakkannchery, who was sentenced to 20 years rigorous imprisonment in the Kottiyoor rape case, from all priestly duties and rights.

The Thalassery POCSO court had sentenced the priest to rigorous imprisonment in three cases in February 2019, which set off the process of removing him from the priesthood.

The diocese of Mananthavady in Wayanad submitted a detailed report to Vatican on the trial and conviction in April last year and initiated action against the priest in June. The Vatican on December 5 issued a decree that permanently expelled Vadakkannchery from all matters pertaining to clergy.

The order was issued on December 5. It reached The diocese of Mananthavady handed over the order to Vadakkannchery.

The final report of the diocese, which was submitted to the Vatican, was officially released on March 1.

Vadakkannchery was posted as vicar of St. Sebastian parish in Kottiyoor, run by diocese of Manathavady in Kannur. He also served as the manager of a school attached to the church.

He was suspended from the priesthood in February 2017 after he was arrested in connection with the rape of a 16-year-old girl at Kottiyoor.

174,2020/03/01,Doctors flag attempt to exploit liking for jackfruit,"‘Jackfruit flour can overcome side effects of chemotherapy’

Doctors have flagged an alleged attempt to exploit an average Malayali’s nostalgic fondness for jackfruit in the form of a study that claimed to have found a cure for cancer in its flour.

Media reports based on the study were published to mark World Cancer Day on February 4. Regular intake of food prepared from jackfruit flour can alleviate nerve pain, numbness, and tingling of limbs or body extremities felt by patients undergoing radiation or chemotherapy, the report said, quoting researchers, who claimed to have conducted a study in a Kochi hospital.

Commercial interest

Deepu Sadasivan, co-founder and admin of Infoclinic, a social media platform of doctors, pointed out on Sunday that scientific facts had been twisted to suit commercial interests of some people.

“Those undergoing chemotherapy treatment for cancer will face many side-effects during its course. They will gradually overcome those problems in normal circumstances. Just because they consumed green jackfruit flour during the treatment does not mean that it had acted as a ‘palliative’,” he said. Dr. Deepu noted that falsifiability or the capacity for a statement, theory or hypothesis to be proven wrong, was an important part of any scientific study. “The researchers who came up with this study could not provide any such theory even after repeated queries,” he said.

Methodology

The methodology of the study was also problematic. Though it was claimed to be an “observational study”, in which the researchers do not participate, actually it was an “interventional study” as the researcher had advised the patients to consume the flour for two days along with food until the chemotherapy sessions were over. Dr. Deepu also objected to the finding that pectin, a polysaccharide present in green jackfruit flour, “reduced the side-effects caused by chemotherapy”.

Also, it had not followed the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research. “All clinical research involving human participants including any intervention such as drugs, surgical procedures, devices, biomedical, educational or behavioural research, public health intervention studies, observational studies, implementation research and pre-clinical studies of experimental therapeutics and preventives or AYUSH studies may be registered prospectively with the Clinical Trials Registry of India,” says the guideline.

There were no similarities between the two groups of patients on who the study had been conducted, Dr. Deepu added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/doctors-flag-attempt-to-exploit-liking-for-jackfruit/article30958352.ece

177,2020/03/01,Wayside encroachers to be evicted from KSTP roads in Kottayam,"Concern at the rising number of accidents involving pedestrians

In view of the rising number of road accidents involving pedestrians, the authorities have decided to evict wayside encroachments along the Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP) roads in the Ettumanoor and Carithas regions.

The decision follows a complaint to this effect, raised by Suresh Kurup, MLA, during a meeting of the District Development Committee here the other day. According to him, the presence of wayside vendors and unauthorized eateries severely affected the functioning of the educational institutions at these locations.

According to officials, the eviction drive will be conducted by a joint team of police, revenue and the KSTP officials.

Besides the unauthorized establishments, action will be initiated against those parking along the road sides, which affect the movement of pedestrians.

Earlier, the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) too had approached the Kottayam district administration with a request to clear off the wayside encroachments.

A survey carried out recently identified over 230 wayside encroachment in and around the Kottayam Town alone.

Meanwhile, Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, MLA, called for streamlining the distribution of drinking water in view of the onset of summer.

178,2020/03/01,Vatican rejects Sr. Lucy’s appeal against dismissal,"Nun says she will not leave the convent at any cost

The Congregation for Oriental Churches in the Vatican has rejected Sister Lucy Kalappura’s third appeal against her dismissal from the Franciscan Clarist Congregation (FCC) on August 7 last year. The Catholic nun of the FCC, under the Karakkamala church of the Syro-Malabar diocese, Mananthavady, was expelled for “failing to give a satisfactory explanation for her lifestyle in violation of rules.”

Sr. Lucy told The Hindu that she had got the reply from Vatican on Friday and she could not understand its content as it was in Latin. Only the covering letter of the reply was in English.

The covering letter said that her appeal had been rejected.

Sr. Lucy said the action against her was inhuman and she would fight it legally. “The decision is quite arbitrary as the Church is yet to hear me,” the nun said, adding that she would not leave the convent at any rate.

Court hearing

Sr. Lucy had submitted an appeal to the Munsif Court at Mananthavady in the district demanding a stay on the decision of the congregation to oust her from the convent at Karakkamala. “The court will consider the appeal on March 5,” she said, adding that whatever be the decision of the court, she would continue her life in the convent as a nun.

“I have served the congregation for more than 33 years and I have not done anything wrong. I have not led a life against the values of the Church. They cannot just throw me out. I will fight it legally,” Sr. Lucy said.

She attracted media attention after she came out in support of a group of Catholic nuns who protested in public against the rape of a colleague by bishop Franco Mulakkal of Jalandhar.

In September 2018, S.r Lucy participated in a public protest in Kochi, which drew the attention of her superiors, who accused her of breaching the rules of conduct of the congregation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vatican-rejects-sr-lucys-appeal-against-dismissal/article30958338.ece

180,2020/03/01,‘Suspect identification’ lands cops in trouble,"Wrong footage circulated

An attempt by the police to circulate screenshots and video footage on social media to identify an accused in a molestation case has landed them in trouble with the complainant herself failing to identify the man from the visuals.

A woman had filed a complaint with the Thamarassery police on Saturday, alleging that she was molested on board a KSRTC bus from Thamarassery to Wayanad.

The police got visuals from the surveillance camera inside the Thamarassery bus station, allegedly culled out the video footage and image of a person, based on the statement of the bus conductor, and circulated them rapidly in various instant messaging applications for identification.

This was apparently done before getting the victim’s confirmation.

Later, the police were forced to issue a request, urging social media users to stop forwarding the message.

Clarification

Meanwhile, the Thamarassery police have claimed that they were not involved in the circulation of the unverified image and videos on social media.

The police said no one had complained against the circulated images.

The request to stop related forwards was issued as another man suspected of assaulting the woman had been identified, the Thamarassery police said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/suspect-identification-lands-cops-in-trouble/article30958316.ece

182,2020/03/01,Cancellation of ITB Berlin jolt for Kerala,"World’s largest tourism trade fair was scheduled to commence on March 4

Kerala Tourism and stakeholders of the tourism industry have suffered another setback with the cancellation of ITB Berlin, the world’s largest tourism trade fair, the first ever in 54 years due to the spread of COVID-19. The news of the cancellation of the five-day fair, which was to commence on March 4, reached the State when Secretary, Tourism, Rani George was to lead an official delegation from the State to Messe Berlin.

As many 13 trade partners representing hotels, resorts, and Ayurvedic centres were part of the official delegation that was to fly to Germany next week.

Roadshows

Kerala Tourism while deciding to postpone roadshows in Amsterdam, Milan, and Madrid, scheduled for the second week of March for promoting the destination, the other day has decided to attend ITB Berlin.

“It is a big concern for the tourism industry as no one wants to miss ITB Berlin as it is a global platform to promote the destination and tourism products. Besides, Germans account for 6.04% of foreign tourist arrivals to the State in 2018 and Germany is one of the key source market for us,” Director of Tourism, P. Bala Kiran told The Hindu. Kochi-based tour operator and a member of the National Tourism Advisory Board, Abraham George, who had been attending the ITB Berlin for the last four successive years and independently marketing South India, says the setback due to cancellaton of the trade fair is huge for the travel and tourism industry. “International movement is going to be restricted to 75 per cent in the coming one year and the loss will be reflected in Kerala as well. We lost an opportunity to take advantage of the setback in China”, he added.

Anish Kumar P. K, leading tour operator and Managing Director of ravel Planners, who had taken space in the India Pavillion at ITB Berlin, said the industry had suffered another jolt.

184,2020/03/01,Rivers in Kottayam start to dry up,"Soaring temperatures have led to a drop in water levels in the rivers

As the summer expands its footprints over Kottayam, the soaring temperatures have left the district high and dry with its major drinking water sources turning to a trickle this season.

While the rivers in Kottayam typically slow down during the dry seasons, officials said this year had brought an unprecedented decline in water levels. Among the most affected include the Meenachil and Manimala rivers, which serve as the foremost sources of drinking water for the district.

Canals also dry

Stretches of these kilometres-long natural wonders are nothing but dry stone, especially in the eastern side of the district. The flow of water in most of the adjoining canals too have dried up by the second half of February.

As per estimates with the Hydrology sub division office in Kottayam, water level in the Manimala river recorded a sharp fall of 62 cms at the hydrology station in Mundakkayam.

The drop in water level in the Meenachil river, meanwhile, appears less drastic with the level of drop pegged at 15 cms and 10 cms respectively at Pala and Peroor.

“Though the flow is at its lowest over the years, the dead storage of water in the river bed and the presence of a few check-dams have reduced the season's impact on the Meenachil river,”’ pointed out an official.

Besides the rising temperature, a decline in the water storage capacity of river beds caused by the back to back floods since 2018 too have been attributed as a key reason for these rivers to dry up. While the Kodoor and Meenanthara rivers too have been witnessing lean periods, the flow of water in the Muvattupuzha river, which serves the entire Vaikom and Thalayolapparambu region, remains nearly stable.

The sluggish water flow in the rivers, according to officials, has a bearing on the ground water table of the region as well. As per estimates, water level in at least three of the 45 wells under the District Ground Water Department in the third week of February stood 1.5 meters less than the volume recorded during the same period last year .

Thirsty road ahead

“Water table in the remaining wells too have recorded a decline but by an average of 0.5 meters. Given the sharp rise in temperature that hovers around 38 degree Celsius and the corresponding rise in water intake, it is definitely a thirsty road ahead for the residents of Kottayam this summer,” said a senior official .",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/j5k8cv/article30958284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv02meenachis,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rivers-in-kottayam-start-to-dry-up/article30958279.ece

They had lived several years in conditions totally unfit for human habitation with every monsoon posing a serious threat. But the former residents of Alakkukuzhi colony, who used to call the ghetto opposite Kollam railway station their home, are a happy lot today.

The 20 families now live in a neat housing complex at Kachikadavu in Mundakkal division, a model rehabilitation project completed by Kollam Corporation as part of LIFE Mission.

And it was smiling faces who welcomed the 25 students who visited them on Saturday in connection with the LIFE Tour programme jointly organised by District Information Office and the Quilon city chapter of Junior Chamber International.

The residents shared their experiences with the students selected from various colleges, giving them a complete idea of how LIFE Mission changed their lives.

Aswathy, a student from Nehru Arts And Science College, Coimbatore, said interacting with the residents provided a more rewarding experience than reading about the project and its beneficiaries. Alakkukuzhi rehabilitation project was launched in 2019 and the total cost of the project is ₹1.7 crore.

Three cents

The housing complex at Kachikadavu has been constructed on 1.5 acres of land divided into plots of three cents.

Each house in the complex has two bed rooms, kitchen, hall, veranda and common toilet.

The construction of the project was outsourced to Phoenix, the 32-member Kudumbashree unit from Kottamkara panchayat, sources said.

It was the first big project of the all-women construction unit and it took them 1,600 working days to complete the project.

They started the project on 1 January 2018 and completed it three months before the deadline, garnering the appreciation of everyone including Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan for finishing it in a time-bound manner.

187,2020/03/01,COVID-19: many fishermen from State stranded in Iran,"Pinarayi writes to Union Minister to arrange for their safe return

Scores of fishermen from the State are among the large number of Indian fishermen feared trapped in Iran following the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak there.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has written to Union Minister for External Affairs S. Jaishankar requesting him to direct the Indian Embassy in Tehran to arrange for their safe return. In his letter, the Chief Minister said the State had received information that “more than a hundred” Indian fishermen were trapped in a place called ‘Azalur.’

Of this, 60 were reportedly from Kerala, Mr. Vijayan said.

Meanwhile, Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma said steps were being taken to collect the details of fishermen from the State and transfer it to the Indian Embassy. Airlifting the men out of Iran may be fraught with difficulties in view of the COVID-19 outbreak, but the embassy had been requested to urgently provide food and water to them, she said.

“We were informed that around 800 Indians are stranded in Iran. We are collecting the details of the Keralites,” the Minister said.

Reportedly, 17 of the men are from Thiruvananthapuram district. According to a Facebook video, several men from Vizhinjam, Marianadu and Anchuthengu in Thiruvananthapuram district in Kerala and Kanyakumari district in Tamil Nadu are among the stranded.

The Facebook video showed fishermen pleading for government assistance to return home to their families. According to them, they were stuck in their rooms due to the outbreak of the disease and faced difficulties in obtaining food and water. They were also unable to contact other Indians due to their confinement to their places of accommodation, they said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-many-fishermen-from-state-stranded-in-iran/article30957577.ece
188,2020/03/01,CB to seek custody of Poojari,"Likely to bring him to Kerala for questioning in Kochi shooting case

The Crime Branch (CB) will seek the custody of purported gangster Ravi Poojari. He is currently in captivity in Karnataka, where he is accused in several crimes, including extortion and murder.

ADGP, Crime Branch, Tomin Thachankery reportedly questioned him in Bangalore. Central agencies had recently extradited Poojari from Senegal, which was his lair since 2005. The CB wants him in connection with a 2018 bid to extort money from celebrity Leena Maria Paul.

Investigators believe that Poojari had set his sights on Ms. Paul as a likely target for extortion after she became implicated in a ₹18 crore bank fraud case. According to CB officials, Poojari employed a set of intermediaries to repeatedly coerce Ms. Paul into wiring money to an offshore account he operated in the name of others.

Poojari used his notoriety to threaten Ms. Paul with physical harm and even death. Poojari is an accused in over 100 violent crimes in the country and has 13 Interpol red corner notices against him.

When his tactic failed to work, Poojari allegedly contracted two shooters to prove to Ms. Paul that he could project his power from afar. The hitmen fired upon Ms. Paul’s beauty parlour in Kochi, but none were injured in the incident. However, gun crime worried the business community and the film industry. It also sent a ripple of alarm in the State’s law enforcement.

The CB soon identified and arrested the suspected gunmen in 2019. Officials identified them as Bilal and Bipin Varghese, both unemployed youth in their early 30s. Investigators said Bilal headed a Perumbavoor-based criminal network with links in Mangalore in Karnataka.

They said they had recovered a .32 automatic pistol and rounds from the accused. Officials are trying to trace the provenance of the firearm. The CB had been on the trail of Poojari since 2018. A team led by IG S. Sreejith and SP Merin Joseph had hired a person to translate the charges against Poojari in French. They mailed it to Senegal authorities through the National Central Bureau, the Central agency which liaisons with the Interpol.

Senegal, with which India has a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, had responded positively to the Kerala Police request. Soon, the Senegal law enforcement took custody of Poojari and initiated steps to hand him over to Indian authorities.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cb-to-seek-custody-of-poojari/article30957340.ece
189,2020/03/01,Prosecutors shoot down police move to withdraw petty cases,"They demand government clearance for the withdrawal

The attempts of State police to withdraw thousands of petty cases that are pending in trial courts have backfired with prosecutors demanding government clearance for the withdrawal.

The District Police Chiefs had approached the Deputy Directors of Prosecution asking them to issue directions to Assistant Public Prosecutors and Public Prosecutors to withdraw the suo motu/petty cases pending in trial courts by invoking Section 321 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

A large number of petty cases are pending in trial courts as processes/summons could not be served due to the wrong, defective or even incomplete address of the accused. In some other cases, the presence of the accused could not be secured despite issuing warrants. If the prosecution felt that there was no possibility of apprehending the accused or obtaining their correct address, such cases could be withdrawn, if the offence involved was of not serious nature, said a communication issued in this regard.

Most of the cases pertain to driving under the influence of alcohol, public nuisance, passing lewd comments and obscene gestures against women. Some of the offences are punishable with maximum imprisonment up to three years and fine up to ₹10,000.

In Kochi, there are 4,107 suo motu cases initiated by the police which are pending. The total number of cases that the police intended to withdraw across the State would be close to two lakh cases, sources said.

The move was initiated after the High Court Chief Justice expressed concern over the pendency of cases. A task force was also formed to look into the issue, sources said.

However, the prosecutors maintained that the withdrawal of cases could not be initiated by solely depending on the report of the police.

The arguments of the police, namely the wrong address and non-availability in the given address, are matters which are beyond the scope of verification of prosecutors. The withdrawal of cases by banking on the police reports could give rise to complaints of favouritism and corruption, and the prosecutors cannot be part of such maladministration of justice, they said.

An NOC from the State government was required in each case, failing which the prosecutors would be held liable for every wrong case of withdrawal initiated by the police, they said.

Confirming the developments, C. Sreedharan Nair, the Director General of Prosecution, said the NOC was required for the prosecutors for withdrawal of cases. The decision was aimed at reducing the pendency of cases. In some cases, the fine that could be collected would be lesser than the cost involved for competing the judicial process. Withdrawal of such cases would save time and money and reduce the pendency. The issue had been brought to the notice of the government, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/prosecutors-shoot-down-police-move-to-withdraw-petty-cases/article30957091.ece
190,2020/03/01,Assembly session likely to be stormy,"CAG report, graft charge against former Ministers to figure prominently

The 19th session of the Assembly commencing on Monday is set to take a turbulent turn with the government as well as the Opposition wielding sufficient ammunition to target each other with ease.

The Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) observations questioning the probity of the police purchases and the missing ammunition from the police bell of arms will come in handy for the Opposition United Democratic Front (UDF) to put the government in the dock. The government will seek cover under the Crime Branch investigation that has already been initiated on the issue.

Moreover, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had clarified that the natural denouement to the row triggered by the audit observations would be set by the Assembly’s public accounts committee’s findings. The government may cite the alleged leak of the CAG report before it was tabled in the House as part of its strategy to take on the Opposition. Still, the issue has sufficient grist to trigger a war of words on the floor.

The graft charges levelled against two former Ministers V.K. Ebrahim Kunju and V.S. Sivakumar will put the UDF on the defensive. The UDF may try to stave off the charges dubbing it as politically motivated and may cite the timing for launching the Vigilance probe against Mr. Sivakumar as it gathered steam immediately after the audit observations were made against the government.

The completion of two lakh houses for the indigent and weaker sections in a mission mode and the lead to set up food courts for dishing meals at ₹25 will be touted as some of the major achievements of the government. This achievement may help the government score some brownie points over its political rivals. The government may use the UDF decision to abstain from the functions held across for announcing the completion of houses to put the Opposition on the mat.

The intensifying protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the Congress refusal for a joint agitation with the LDF and looming financial crisis will figure prominently in the session and will give room for a verbal duel. Since the local body elections are round the corner, the government and the Opposition will be equally keen on officially stating their positions on a variety of issues that will have direct impact on the electorate in the floor of the House.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/assembly-session-likely-to-be-stormy/article30956900.ece
191,2020/03/01,Mangroves under threat in State,"Govt. yet to acquire private areas for declaring them as reserve forests

The delay in acquiring mangrove tracts owned by private parties by the State government to declare them as reserve forests is threatening the ecosystem in Kannur and other parts of the State.

The State government had signed an agreement with the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2002 to hand over over large tracts of mangroves to the Centre in exchange of forestland (7693.2257 hectares) sought to rehabilitate landless tribespeople in Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Palakkad, and Wayanad districts. However, even after 18 years, the agreement has not been implemented.

As many as 496 hectares of mangroves still remain in private hands in Kannur. The district has 75% of mangrove tracts in the State. Only a small area under government ownership has been declared as reserve forest so far.

K. Karthikeyan, Chief Conservator of Forest, Northern Circle, said the process for acquisition of private land had not yet begun in the district.

He, however, pointed out that the State government, under the Rebuild Kerala

initiative, had recently given administrative sanction to acquire 1,200 hectares of mangrove area in the State. A total of 19 people in Kannur had accepted to hand over land. But the process was yet to begin, he said.

Many individuals and private establishments have purchased mangrove tracts for construction activities and projects like tourist resorts in the district. Some have purchased mangroves keeping in mind the compensation to be provided by the government for acquisition.

Farmers’ protest

Recently, farmers had protested against the Forest Department for stopping them from removing mangroves to do ‘Kaipad’ paddy cultivation. The department has so far filed 19 cases, including two this year, for destroying mangroves.

Such places fell under the Coastal Regulatory Act 1(A) and no construction activities or development could be carried out in the area, said a senior forest official. However, in the name of agricultural activities, they were destroying mangroves on private plots, he added.

Member of District Environmental Committee Vinod Payyada alleged that there was government-sponsored encroachment with the help of the Tourism Department in many villages. There was massive destruction of mangroves in these areas, he added.

Mr. Payyada said that the forestland acquired for rehabilitation of tribespeople should be taken back by the Centre if the State government did not acquire mangroves to declare them as reserve forests.

District Collector T.V. Subhash said he would look into the matter and action would be taken after consulting officials concerned.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mangroves-under-threat-in-state/article30956783.ece

193,2020/03/01,Telling visitors the age-old stories of the soil,"Kerala Tourism’s storytelling projectseeks to promote experiential travel

Literature may have made popular stories that have enriched Kerala’s culture and shaped its current life over generations, but for visitors to the State, tourism always meant just a platter of exotic locales and cuisine. This is now due for a change with the storytelling tourism project treating travellers, looking for an experience of the culture and ethos of the land they visit, to the stories of the land that have stayed alive to become folklores.

Myths, life stories, agriculture, folk arts, and rituals will be presented as part of the programme and it will be an amalgamation of experiences, lives, myths and legends.

For Kerala Tourism, the State-owned Bekal Resorts Development Corporation (BRDC) is making the foray into the project in which the unwritten historical and cultural tales behind the places will be documented, collated and retold to the travellers.

“Initially, the little-known and unwritten historical tales behind Bekal will be collated to make the destinations and travel more attractive to the tourists. Later, Malabar will be covered,’’ BRDC managing director T.K. Manzoor told The Hindu.

“The idea is to make the destinations more appealing to the new-age tourists. Storytelling is a key component of experiential tourism,” he said.

The BRDC has worked out a roadmap for compiling and publishing the historical narratives and stories for the project. Workshops, seminars and community meets — nattukoottams — will be held along with special training for storytelling entrepreneurs.

As the first step, workshops will be organised among various experts from different fields such as writers and researchers. Storytelling entrepreneurs also will also be roped in. Community meets will be organised to discuss tales of the bygone era and historical records.

“We will kick off the project in Bekal in March and the storytelling will be in English. Already, there has been a small beginning to this with the BRDC’s ‘Smile’ storytelling entrepreneurs Mohan Narananthatta and G. Ambujakshan at Bekal Fort,” he added.

The dissertations prepared in the form of stories by experts will be made into books in English, Malayalam and later in other languages. A coffee table book is also being planned.

Mr. Mansoor said historical records and other remnants such as Muniyaras, Kudakkallu, Thoppikkallu, Surangas, Mukkuthi wells, ancient weapons, and coins, all of which are being lost to oblivion, would also be recorded.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/orbko/article30953580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27tvtourist,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/telling-visitors-the-age-old-stories-of-the-soil/article30953581.ece
194,2020/03/01,"CAA | Tamil Nadu CM asks Muslims not to protest, promises protection for all","Centre has given clear explanation about CAA, NPR and NRC, says Edappadi K. Palaniswami.

Reiterating that the AIADMK government would protect all people in Tamil Nadu, irrespective of caste, creed and community, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Sunday appealed to Muslims, particularly womenfolk, not to resort to agitations [against the Citizenship Amendment Act] and urged them to carry on with their normal work.

Speaking at the foundation-stone laying ceremony for a new government medical college and 700-bed hospital in Virudhunagar, he said that the Centre had given a clear explanation about the CAA, the NPR and the proposed NRC.

For its part, the Tamil Nadu government had given an assurance that it would not act in a manner that may pose threats to the minorities. Mr. Palaniswami appealed to the people to cooperate with the official machinery and ensure that the State moved forward and brought in development.

Mr. Palaniswami alleged that some outfits for political reasons indulged in misleading and spreading rumours. They should realise the consequences of such irresponsible statements and stop instigating people, he said.

Earlier in Ramanathapuram, he accused the Opposition of spreading rumours on the law and order situation when the State remained “a peace haven”. He charged that some outfits were bent upon tarnishing the image of the State government, “unable to stomach the popularity” the government enjoyed among the masses. The political opponents sought to create an impression as if things were not fine in the State.

“Don’t believe or get carried away by such false propaganda. The State is safe. The law and order is absolutely intact,” he asserted.

Rapport with Centre

In Virudhunagar, he said the cordial relations with the Central government had facilitated in bringing in a volley of mega projects to Tamil Nadu. He added the State would be on the top in the country as far as the health sector was concerned. “Today, dialysis equipment were available even at taluk level hospital. Over 65 % of the deliveries of newborn babies were recorded in government-run hospitals. This was all possible due to the concerted efforts of the government which had a good ‘rapport’ with the Centre in bringing in funds and expertise,” he said. Many steps were being taken by the State to bring down the infant and maternal mortality rate.

The Virudhunagar Medical College and Hospital would be constructed at an estimated cost of ₹ 380 crore spread over 22 acres of land on the Collectorate premises.

Responding to the appeal made by Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who was present at the function, the Chief Minister assured that the government would strive hard for a TB free State by 2025.

The Minister said Tamil Nadu was way ahead in establishing its own medical colleges and the fact that the Centre had sanctioned 11 medical colleges in the last year alone to the State was significant. The people would benefit in a big way as they would have not only experts in their locality, but get high class treatment at a low cost.

Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam said the DMK president M. K. Stalin was day dreaming about coming to power in Tamil Nadu. “This is not going to happen...I wish him good luck to remain a day dreamer for many more years,” amidst applause from the gathering. The Deputy CM also said that the State government continued to fulfil the promises made by former Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa in the Assembly and during the electioneering in 2016.

Unable to stomach the popularity, the DMK indulged in creating trouble in the State using the CAA, he charged. “We don't expect any bouquets from the DMK. At least, they should accept that the AIADMK government is implementing its promises,” he said.

Among others Tamil Nadu Health Minister C Vijayabaskar, Dairy Development Minister K T Rajenthra Bhalaji were present. The request made by Mr. Bhalaji to the CM was accepted and he made a few announcements on the occasion. Earlier, Chief Secretary K Shanmugam welcomed the gathering. Senior ministers from the cabinet, MPs, MLAs and Health Secretary Beela Rajesh were among who took part. Virudhunagar District Collector R. Kannan proposed a vote of thanks.

196,2020/03/01,"Citizenship shouldn’t be linked to any religion, says D. Raja","Constitution of India should be saved from fascism, the CPI General Secretary said

Citizenship should not be linked with any religion and India belongs to all and not to one religion, said D. Raja, General Secretary of Communist Party of India, here on Saturday.

Stating that the Constitution of India should be saved from fascism, he added that contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was not only against Muslims, but was against the poor people of the country.

He was addressing a gathering of about 10,000 people at a State level meeting organised by Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi (MJK) at Codissia Grounds in Coimbatore demanding Central Government to repeal the CAA and not implement the National Population register (NPR) and the National Registry of Citizens (NRC).

MJK leader and MLA Thamimum Ansari said that Modi-led Government implemented CAA to subvert realities such as unemployment and effect of economic slowdown on industries and other areas.

The resolutions passed at the meeting wanted the Central Government to remove Amit Shah from the post of Union Home Minister, compensation and Government job for the families of the victims of Delhi riots, withdrawal of police high-handedness on student protestors, scraping of new methods of census proposed by Central Government, Tamil Nadu Government to pass a resolution in the assembly against CAA and stringent action by the police against those creating communal disharmony.

The meeting criticized the present AIADMK Government, accusing it of not following secular ideologies of late Chief Ministers M.G. Ramachandran and J. Jayalalithaa and for supporting CAA in both houses of parliament when it was a Bill.

197,2020/03/01,Protected Special Agricultural Zone in Tamil Nadu’s Cauvery delta: Experts seek powers to implementing authority,"The Protected Special Agricultural Zone that the government created recently is meant to offer farmers of the delta region relief from further hydrocarbon exploration. While the decision itself may be labelled political, experts stress the importance of arming the implementing authority with adequate powers.

It was the 1977 Assembly election. Kuthalam, a sleepy rural constituency in undivided Thanjavur district, was witnessing a heightened poll campaign, as were many other parts of the State. But, there was a difference here. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s (DMK) candidate, R. Rajamanickam, who eventually got elected, ran his campaign on the pivot of the complaint that the Centre was “discriminating” against Tamil Nadu by paying “much less royalty for crude oil” taken from Narimanam, also located in the district.

Even though it would take several more years for the authorities to declare officially that an oil field had been discovered in Narimanam, the point made by the DMK nominee had highlighted how important the subject of hydrocarbon projects was in public discourse in the Cauvery delta even then. There is little change in this situation, even to this day. The 2017 Neduvasal and Kadiramangalam protests, which took place immediately after a massive stir in the State for jallikattu, only confirmed that hydrocarbon projects, regardless of size, would not be welcome in the area.

Prior to these events, the delta had seen an intense struggle over a proposal to implement a coal bed methane project in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts. Despite the project proponent getting an environmental clearance, the State government, based on experts’ advice, had got the project cancelled. After a lull of about two years, the delta, in mid-January this year, saw signs of another round of unrest in the wake of the Central government doing away with the need for holding public consultations for all projects — offshore and onshore oil and gas exploration.

A special zone

It was around this time and against this backdrop that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, apart from conveying his disapproval of the Central action, asked senior officials of the government to examine the idea of turning the Cauvery delta into a protected zone. In early February, he announced his government’s decision to create the Protected Special Agricultural Zone and followed it up by adopting a Bill for the same, on the floor of the House 10 days later.

“While drafting the legislation, we took due care not to exceed our Constitutional limits and step into the Centre’s domain. If you look at the Bill, its focus is agriculture, which is a State subject, and not on industries or environment,” explains C.Ve. Shanmugam, Law Minister, who also handles the portfolio of Mines and Minerals.

The Governor has also given his assent to the legislation. “There is a definite need for such a law,” says C. Ramasamy, former Vice-Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU). “In our State, it is only in the delta that you can expect consistent and reliable production of paddy (rice), while there has been a steady fall in the production of paddy in areas fed by tanks and wells. Under such circumstances, you need to keep the area safe and secure. The new law serves the purpose,” he observes.

Analysis | Countering Opposition: The Palaniswami strategy​

The Protected Agricultural Zone Development Act will prevent new hydrocarbon projects in the region. To drive home the point that the campaign against hydrocarbon projects has a sound basis, S. Ranganathan, a geologist-turned-farmer based out of Mannargudi, recalls how a fire broke out in Nallur, about 15 km near his place, in the late 1970s during a drilling exercise for natural gas exploration. “It was then that we realised that enormous quantities of surface water would be required to put out such fire and the land would virtually go waste,” he observes.

Needless to say, the farming community in the delta is upbeat about the law coming into force. Later this week, a public event is being planned in Tiruvarur to felicitate the Chief Minister.

Some not impressed

At the same time, not everyone is impressed with the efficacy of the law. “When you cannot act against existing hydrocarbon projects, I am clueless what benefit the law is going to give to farmers in the delta,” says K.N. Nehru, the DMK’s principal secretary and former Food and Civil Supplies Minister (1996-2001), who hails from Tiruchi.

P. Kalyanam, former MLA of the Kuthalam constituency, which was merged with Poompuhar and Mayiladuthurai constituencies during the 2008 delimitation exercise, wonders whether the State government is empowered to enact a law that will have bearing on natural resources such as petroleum, which comes under the Union List.

K. Balakrishnan, secretary of the State unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and former Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) representing Chidambaram constituency in Cuddalore district, finds fault with the government on a number of counts. “In the proposed Authority which will be headed by the Chief Minister, farmers are poorly represented. We do not know who will be nominated by the government,” he says.

image/svg+xml

“Besides, there must be representation for local bodies’ representatives in the Authority. As the new body is going to have the CM as the head, all its decisions will have to be implemented by the government. Instead, there can be an advisory panel, comprising experts, agriculturists and officials. The inputs of such a committee can form the basis for decisions of the government. Through this method, the government will be able to scrutinise actions of the panel,” the CPI (M) leader points out.

Without improving the Cauvery irrigation network or implementing the Cauvery modernisation project, the delta might be forced to remain like an “archaeological monument”, he adds.

However, the Law Minister, dismissing the criticism against his government, relies on the communication sent by Union Minister for Environment Prakash Javadekar on February 19 to the Chief Minister to underscore that the State government is on a strong wicket. The Union Minister had made it clear to Mr. Palaniswami on the amendment to regulations on oil and gas exploration projects that “the final decision as to whether to allow any particular [new] project in any particular region would continue to vest with the State government”.

Mr. Shamugam also points out that there are enough provisions in Environment (Protection) Act and Petroleum and Natural Gas Rules, 1959, that empower State governments to take suitable steps with regard to the provision or withdrawal of licence for industrial projects. It is through powers delegated to the State government under the Environment Act that the decisions were made regarding the Sterlite factory and ban on plastics, the Law Minister points out.

Just as agriculture is important to the State, industry is equally important, is his argument. This is why existing units in the delta cannot be made to shut down arbitrarily. This also explains the exclusion of parts of Tiruchi, Karur and Ariyalur districts, which otherwise form part of the delta.

“In any legal framework, there is always scope for improvement. The government will be at it as and when the need arises,” he says.

Authority’s role

The proposed Authority will make suggestions for fostering the infrastructure for food security, recommend schemes for irrigation and flood management, facilitate the promotion of agro-based and allied industries and come out with measures for augmenting water resources, efficient water use in agriculture including micro-irrigation, the Minister explains. As for agricultural labourers, the Authority will formulate measures to provide “sustainable employment opportunities” to them.

Notwithstanding forceful explanations of the government and its representatives on the debate over the law, there is a view among a section of the farming community that the Act is meant to serve the political agenda of the ruling party. K.V. Ilankeeran, president of the federation of farmers’ organisations in the delta, says the fact that the State government has enacted the law makes him wonder whether the ruling party will wriggle itself out of its alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party at the time of Assembly elections.

“Such an argument is far-fetched. Our regime will stick to its non-confrontationist approach towards the Centre in the remainder of its term too,” says a senior functionary of the ruling party who is considered to be close to the Chief Minister.

Farmers’ wish-list

Already, a wish-list is doing the rounds ahead of the proposed visit of Mr. Palaniswami to Tiruvarur. V. Sathyanarayanan, general secretary of the Consortium of Cauvery Delta Farmers, expects him to make announcements on the formation of a Delta Research Centre to cover issues including soil health, seawater intrusion, groundwater and sub-surface aquifer recharge. P.R. Pandian, president of the Tamil Nadu Federation of All Farmers’ Associations, who has moved the Supreme Court against the Centre’s move on public hearings, says that a campaign is on in certain quarters to the effect that land value in the delta will go down due to the State government’s latest action.

To dispel any such notion, a number of special projects and measures will have to be executed so that agriculture is not seen to be a losing proposition. He suggests that a tripartite agreement be signed between the State government, farmers and traders to ensure remunerative prices to agriculturists for their produce.

As the debate continues on merits and demerits of making the Cauvery delta a protected zone, there exists an opinion among geologists that fears or concerns of people over hydrocarbon projects in general can be easily addressed if those in charge of such projects conduct themselves in a transparent manner and reveal salient features of their projects, including technology to be adopted and safety norms to be followed.

Notwithstanding the government’s “protective measure” for the Cauvery delta, it is common knowledge that the region is at a crossroads. Recurring problems over water availability, shrinking farm labour, growing presence of ageing farmers, changes in cultivation methods and lack of remunerative prices are looming large over the farm sector. Under such circumstances, questions do arise among experts and farmers as to whether it is advisable to hamper industrialisation in the region.

In view of the delta’s importanceto the State, the region must have a vibrant farm sector, which should be supported by appropriate industries as well. And, the government, through the Act, believes that it has made a beginning in this direction, a point that its critics remain sceptical about.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ta3sfr/article30954019.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29FEBTHHYDROCARBONDEMO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/protected-special-agricultural-zone-in-tamil-nadus-cauvery-delta-experts-seek-powers-to-implementing-authority/article30954023.ece
198,2020/03/01,"In just two meetings, panel has cleared 36 projects: M.C. Sampath","The proposals involve investment of ₹15,000 crore, says Minister.

Industries Minister M.C. Sampath on Saturday said the Empowered Committee headed by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami issued clearances to 36 projects worth ₹15,000 crore in the last two meetings alone. These projects could provide employment opportunities to 23,000 people, he said.

Of the 304 MoUs signed during the Global Investors’ Meet 2019, as many as 59 projects have already begun production and 209 MoUs are in various stages of implementation, the Minister said while speaking at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) Tamil Nadu State Annual Meeting 2019-20 and the Conference on Building Endurance in a Challenging Business Environment.

Key challenge

In his keynote address, Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam said new challenges such as digital technology, e-commerce, the need for upskilling the workforce and the issue of robots replacing humans had made everyone sit up and face them. He wanted the Indian industry to be globally competitive through the constant upgrading of skills, larger investment in research and development, implementation of a labour-oriented growth strategy and the promotion of cluster-based industrial development.

“Creating jobs is one of the key challenges, and the State government is trying to address the issue by focusing on emerging areas like fintech, data centres and electric vehicles, among others,” Industries Secretary N. Muruganandam said.

“We have the maximum number of engineering colleges and technical institutions [in the country], which churn out a large number of young graduates every year. The agriculture sector cannot absorb all of them. We need to bring in more industries which can employ youngsters. Otherwise, there will be a big problem of unemployment,,” he said.

200,2020/03/01,"First read CAA, says Venkaiah","‘It is there to help persecuted minorities’

Everyone must read the Citizenship (Amendment) Act before coming to a conclusion about it, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu said after delivering a lecture as part of the Extra Mural Lectures series at IIT-Madras on Saturday.

When asked by a student what his opinion on CAA was, he said, “First study CAA.” Urging the people to acquire an in-depth understanding of what CAA and the National Population Register were, the Vice-President said they could protest if they were not convinced, but in a peaceful and democratic manner. He said the citizenship law was there only to help persecuted minorities from three neighbouring countries. “Gandhiji had expressed the need for this. The Congress Working Committee passed a resolution for this in 1947, and many parties have expressed the need [for this law] on different occasions,” he said.

Stressing the need for understanding the intention behind the legislation, he said other concerns could be addressed later. Referring to the concern raised about the exclusion of Sri Lankan Tamils from the ambit of the legislation, he said his understanding was that they preferred to go back to their country and live with equal rights there.

In his lecture, he stressed the need to “respect the mandate of people and the rule of law”. He highlighted the need for institutions like IIT-Madras to come up with innovative solutions to make agriculture viable, conserve nature and bridge the urban-rural divide.

Surprise move

Later, in an impromptu move that reminded the audience of former President APJ Abdul Kalam's style of interaction, Mr. Naidu mingled with the students after getting off the stage, taking security personnel by surprise. Though the IIT administration had planned a restricted Q&A session where the emcee alone would ask a few questions, Mr. Naidu invited anyone from the audience to raise queries. He took questions on a range of topics including CAA, students’ entry into politics, criminalisation of politics, women’s representation and even his retirement plans.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/z4ttrk/article30953753.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01VENKAIAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/first-read-caa-says-venkaiah/article30953754.ece
201,2020/03/01,Protests against citizenship law intensify across State,"Thousands take to the streets, demanding resolution against CAA-NRC-NPR

The protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act intensified across the State on Saturday as thousands took to the streets, demanding that the Tamil Nadu government pass a resolution against the CAA, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.

In Chennai, the protests at the Lala Gunda area of Washermenpet, dubbed Shaheenpet, continued for the 16th day. Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani and filmmakers Pa. Ranjith, Vetrimaaran and Ameer extended their support to the protesters.

Addressing the agitators, Mr. Veeramani criticised Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, saying, “He is asking whether any Muslim has been affected. Should we wait till Muslims are affected?”

Apart from Washermenpet, protests were held by the Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath (TNTJ) in Triplicane and Thoraipakkam.

Hundreds of Muslims and non-Muslims took part in the protests. Holding placards, they shouted anti-CAA slogans. Some protesters gathered beneath the flyover at Doveton junction. Police personnel were deployed and traffic diverted to avoid inconvenience to the public.

In Coimbatore, the Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi (MJK) held a State-level meeting at Codissia Grounds, demanding that the Central government repeal CAA and not implement NPR and NRC.

Participants of the meeting, headed by MJK leader and MLA Thamimun Ansari, demanded that the Tamil Nadu government pass a resolution against CAA in the Assembly.

Meanwhile, the Shaheen Bagh-like dharna at Athupalam in Coimbatore entered its 11th day on Saturday. Around 1,000 people took part in the dharna on Saturday.

In Tiruchi, over 500 anti-CAA protesters, who have been staging a sit-in at the Uzhavar Sandhai in Thennur, wore masks of Mahatma Gandhi, Periyar and Ambedkar, among other leaders, shouted slogans and tore papers with ‘Citizenship Amendment Act’ printed on them. S. Nisha, one of the many women who have been staying at the protest site for the last 13 days, said their spirit had only grown stronger.

Meanwhile, TNTJ members organised protests at various locations across the central districts. Members of other Islamic organisations, women and children also took part in the protests that were held at 13 locations in Tiruchi district. “If the Centre and the Tamil Nadu government continue to ignore us, we will launch a jail bharo agitation across the State,” said K. Gulam Dasthakir, district president, TNTJ Tiruchi. In Thanjavur district, protests were held at 21 places.

Protests continued in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Ramanathapuram, Madurai and Theni. Women and children took part in large numbers in demonstrations, holding placards. “At Munichalai junction, around 1,500 women and children used cardboards to shield themselves from the heat as the police had prevented them from erecting a shamiana,” a protester said.

Vellore also saw protests by TNTJ. More than 300 men and women participated in a day-long protest near Mandi Street. Addressing protesters at Vaniyambadi, Manithaneya Makkal Katchi president M.H. Jawahirullah said that while Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had passed a resolution in the Assembly to oppose “these draconian changes in the citizenship of minorities”, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu was reluctant to do the same. “The people of Tamil Nadu want him to pass a resolution to show our opposition to CAA. But he is blindly supporting the BJP’s move,” he said.

202,2020/03/01,"Activists discuss climate, development","‘Cultural shift to redefine values is needed’

Activists from various forums came together to discuss climate and development at a Climate Action Forum organised by Citizen consumer and civic Action Group (CAG), Centre for Financial Accountability, Environment Support Group and Movement for Advancing Understanding on Sustainability And Mutuality here on Saturday.

3Rs not enough

Claude Alvarez, founder, Organic Farmers Association of India, said when major development projects were being considered, the future of the displaced poor should be taken into consideration.

He said that the present set of 3Rs — recycling, reduce and reuse — would not be enough and that the public must resist, rebel and revolt.

Vettiver Collective’s Nithyanand Jayaraman said, “It is not enough if we plant trees or say no to plastics, what we need is a cultural shift to redefine values,” he said, citing examples of how vast marshlands in and around the city were being converted to make way for projects.

Ananthoo, Safe Food Alliance, said sustainable agricultural practices were necessary to manage the climate emergency. “This will help avoid pesticides and GM seeds; and ensure nutrition to the masses. At the same time, urban consumers must also think of how much goes back to the farmer or producer. They should also start supporting ecologically and economically viable projects,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/activists-discuss-climate-development/article30953461.ece
203,2020/03/01,Film critiquing Iranian death penalty wins Berlin’s Golden Bear,"Mohammad Rasoulof, whose 'There Is No Evil' explores the impact of capital punishment, was not allowed to leave the country to collect the award

""There Is No Evil,” a study of capital punishment filmed in secret defiance of Iranian government censorship by director Mohammad Rasoulof, won the Berlin Film Festival's Golden Bear award on Saturday.

Mr. Rasoulof, whose film explores the moral dilemmas thrust on those chosen to carry out executions and the consequences of defiance for them and those around them, was unable to leave Iran to pick up the award because of propaganda charges he faces in relation to earlier films.

“This is for him,” said his daughter Baran, who stars in the film and picked up the award on his behalf. Producer Farzad Pak added thanks to the cast and crew “who put their lives in danger to be in this film.”

Jury president Jeremy Irons described the film as “four stories showing the web an authoritarian regime weaves among ordinary people, drawing them towards inhumanity,” adding that the film “asks questions about our own responsibility and choices we all make in life.”

The second-place Silver Bear went to Eliza Hittman's “Never Rarely Sometimes Always!”, the story of two teenagers from the rural U.S. defying anti-abortion activists, poverty, physical and mental harassment and expensive healthcare to obtain the pregnancy termination one of them needs.

A 90-year-old-woman was reportedly raped and killed here in a village in Anumula mandal, about 40-km from the district headquarters, late on Saturday night.

The incident came to light Sunday noon when the nonagenarian’s son reported it at Haliya police station.

Police said the woman was found dead by her son in the morning, when he checked on her. In his complaint to the police, he suspected rape and strangulation, as visible from the victim’s bleeding injuries and marks on the neck.

According to Haliya police, the incident is believed to have happened around midnight. The woman has five sons and lived with each one of them by rotation. She was found dead in her shelter next to an old room in the village, with bleeding injuries that indicated rape and also had marks on her neck.

Based on preliminary findings, police suspect the victim’s neighbour, one S. Shankar, who is absconding.

“It was reported that Shankar was seen talking to her and spending time with her between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. He is a coolie, deserted by his wife, and has a record of misbehaviour with women in the village,” the police said.

Tragedy struck during the Pattana Pragathi works at Kotthur Janda in Hanamkonda on Sunday when a wall hit by an earth mover collapsed on two children killing a 5-year-old girl while they were playing.

208,2020/03/01,U.P. school peon’s house found functioning as ‘board exam centre’,"Answer sheets were being written for candidates

In a shocking case of cheating during the ongoing Uttar Pradesh Board exams, the house of a school peon had virtually turned into an exam centre, where answer sheets were being written by acquaintances of candidates prompting the district administration to blacklist the school.

Ramanand, who works at Karmayogi Shripati Babu Ucchtar Madhyamik Vidyalaya (a self-financed school) located in Bhatni area of the district, is absconding.

The incident took place on Saturday at his house when the Class X science exam was going on.

Deoria District Magistrate Amit Kishor told PTI on Sunday, “A complaint regarding the school was received that the answer sheets of science subject were being written at the house of the school peon on Saturday. The house of peon Ramanand was raided. The exam centre has been blacklisted. From next year, it will not be holding any board examination.”

Principal arrested

He added that 10 accomplices including the school principal have been arrested and action is being initiated against them. Five men and four women were found at the place during the raid. The peon, though, is absconding.

Upon interrogation, the persons who were writing the answers inside the house said their acquaintances were appearing in the examination at the centre. They also told officials that these activities were being done in connivance with the school principal and the peon.

“These people were caught red-handed writing the answer sheets of the science subject.

Scores of women who were holding a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on the Jiwangarh bypass road here for the past six days vacated the site in the presence of top district officials.

Barricades which were put up on the road in view of the protest were removed on Saturday night and traffic resumed, bringing relief to commuters.

Withdrawal of cases

Senior Superintendent of Police Muniraj said the protesters handed over a five-point memorandum to the District Magistrate, which among other points sought withdrawal of cases filed against people protesting at Jiwangarh and the Aligarh Muslim University.

The district officials with the help of political and community leaders assured the protesters that they would discuss their demands with the State government.

District Magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh announced that one of the demands of the protesters to grant financial assistance to a youth, who was seriously injured in last Sunday’s violence in Upper Kot area, has already been accepted.

Tariq Munawwar, who had sustained gunshot injuries in the violence, has been given a financial assistance of ₹two lakh.

Mr. Munawwar, whose lower part of the body has paralysed, will be provided free medical treatment at the Jawahar Lal Nehru Hospital.

Agra zone ADG Ajay Anand, who had earlier initiated a dialogue with the women protesters at Jiwangarh, said, “We had impressed upon the women protesters that since an anti-CAA protest by women was already taking place at the Eidgah grounds for more than a month now, they can join them and continue their protest there instead of blocking traffic on the bypass road, provided the protest is peaceful.”

210,2020/03/01,Mining lease holder booked for causing deaths in U.P.,"3 labourers had died after coming under debris of a boulder

A mining lease holder and other unidentified officials were booked on Sunday on charges of allegedly causing death by negligence after at least three labourers died when they got trapped under the debris of a boulder in a stone quarry in Sonbhadra.

An FIR was registered at the Obra police station in the East Uttar Pradesh district under Section 304-A of the Indian Penal Code.

Pattadar (leaseholder) of the quarry, located in Markundi near the Sharda Mandir, Suresh Keshri and other leaseholders and officials were named in the FIR filed on the complaint of one Ram Vichar. Mr. Ram Vichar's brother Chotelal was among those whose bodies were recovered from the quarry after the incident on Friday.

Seven labourers were crushed under the debris, Mr. Ram Vichar said.

Police have so far confirmed three deaths, while sources said two more labourers were still feared trapped. Two others were rescued earlier and are receiving treatment in hospital. The NDRF carried out the rescue operation along with the district administration.

CM announces aid

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced an ex-gratia compensation of ₹4l akh to the kin of those who died in the incident and ₹50,000 to the injured.

However, the administration came in for much criticism on social media after a video, whose authenticity could not be independently verified, showing a mining official allegedly tutoring the kin of one of the victim at the mortuary to not register an FIR in lieu of better monetary compensation was widely shared.

The Minister of State (Independent Charge) Basic Education, Satish Dwivedi, was deputed by the government to inspect the site and meet those affected.

When asked by journalists about the allegations against the mining officials, he said he didn't have any knowledge of it. “But if any official speaks like this, action will be taken against him,” he said.

“There is no attempt to save anyone,” he further said, when asked if there was an attempt to protect the leaseholder.

The matter would be probed and action would be taken against those responsible, he said.

211,2020/03/01,Haryana Chief Minister eyes services to increase revenue,"Proposes a whopping ₹5,200 cr. hike for social, economic and general services

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal, presenting his maiden budget as Finance Minister on February 28, refrained from imposing any fresh tax, but what went largely unnoticed is a proposed hike for social, economic and general services under the non-tax revenue head putting a burden of ₹5,200 crore on the State residents compared to the previous budget.

The proposed ₹29,383.67 crore non-tax revenue budget estimates for 2020-21 constitute 32.66% of the total revenue receipts, while the ₹19.897.77 crore non-tax revenue comprised only 24.20% of the total estimated revenue receipts for 2019-20. The percentage share of non-tax revenue in the estimated revenue receipts was 26.13 % in 2016-17, 24.84% in 2017-18, 24.04% in 2018-19.

The charges paid by the users for various social, economic and general services provided by the government constitute the non-tax revenue.

As per the budget estimates for 2019-20, the non-tax revenue from the social services was pegged at ₹4,656.55 crore, but it has been proposed to be increased by around 90 % to ₹8,931.03 crore for the current budget. Similarly, for the economic services, Mr. Lal has proposed an increase of 26.84% from ₹3,196.67 crore to ₹4,054.87 crore. The proposal for the general services under the non-tax revenue head has been increased from ₹523.51 crore to ₹599.78 crore with the hike of around 14.56 %.

Associate professor, Dhronacharya Government College, Gurugram, Anjana Nagpal, said the tax rates were already high and therefore the government had little choice but to seek to increase the revenue by way of hike in the user charges for various services under the non-tax revenue bracket.

‘Increase tax net’

She suggested that the government should increase the tax net to bring more people within its ambit and eradicate black money. “It will increase the revenues for the government without burdening the law-abiding citizens,” suggested Ms. Nagpal.

The hike in non-tax revenue could also be necessitated due to sluggish economy as suggested by revised estimates for 2019-20 budget. Also, revenue estimates for the current budget from the State Goods and Services Tax and the Sales Tax are pegged lower compared to the estimates last year, indicating that the government in not very hopeful of high tax collection. Besides, the increase in tax rates would not have been a politically correct decision.

Professor Surinder Kumar, Visiting Professor, Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development, Chandigarh said the user charges from the rich was fine but from the poor was questionable for a welfare state, adding that differential user charges were appreciated.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9qerb8/article30958364.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE01-KHATTAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/haryana-chief-minister-eyes-services-to-increase-revenue/article30958365.ece

While some members of the family stayed back at the hospital, others stayed with friends and extended family. The family members said that while they were thrilled at the arrival of baby, they were not sure when they would be able to take the newborn home.

“There is a lot of fear among the people. We are simple lower-middle-class people. We have nothing to do with politics. We just want everyone to be happy and safe.

The crowd outside the GTB hospital mortuary refuses to thin out with families still running around looking for ‘missing’ relatives on Sunday.

Small passport-type photos or crowded family photos seem to the only solace now as people line up to check the mortuary for bodies holding these pictures for hospital staff, the police and the media, hoping for some information.

“This is worse than being dead,” says Samina, sister of Salman (25), who has been missing since early last week.

“Salman worked as a labourer and had gone to Gokalpuri on February 26. He kept a phone, but it is switched off and there is no clue of what happened to him,” Ms. Samina said. She said they could not locate Salman’s body in the GTB mortuary.

Also standing outside the mortuary with his family is Shahbaz, whose son Mohammad, who works as a welder, is missing.

“He had gone to the Guru Nanak Eye Centre in Delhi on February 25 for treatment after he injured his eye during welding work. I spoke to him in the afternoon when he told us that a mob was dragging people out of the vehicles and beating them up. We haven’t had any contact or information about him after that,” said Mr. Shahbaz. The family has now requested for a DNA test of a badly burnt body found in Karawal Nagar.

The violence in the Jaffrabad, Maujpur, Babarpur, Chand Bagh, Shiv Vihar, Bhajanpura, Yamuna Vihar and Mustafabad areas of north-east Delhi has claimed at least 42 lives and left over 200 injured so far.

3 bodies recovered?

According to some reports, three bodies were fished out from a violence-stricken area on Sunday, though Delhi health authorities have not yet confirmed the recovery.

Also bound by a common sorrow of having to look for their 18-year-old sons are families of Pankaj and Bhurey Salma. “We just want the police to tell us if they are dead or alive... With every passing day, our hopes are diminishing,” Pankaj says.

214,2020/03/01,10 injured in BSF’s drug search in Tripura,"At least 10 people, including women, were injured after BSF personnel launched a coordinated search for drugs at some villages of Sonamura, a subdivision in west Tripura on Saturday, the police said on Sunday.

The police reportedly received complaints from villagers that troops assaulted them indiscriminately and destroyed household goods while searching for drugs, especially cannabis. Two of the injured were admitted to hospital.

Eye-witnesses said 14 security vehicles carrying troops from different BSF units conducted the operation for five hours. The search was called off after senior police officials intervened.

One of victims, Al Amin, said in his complaint that he saw at least 70 men in uniforms entering the houses in search for drugs. The personnel thrashed the residents, and smashed articlesforcing many to hide behind bushes to escape their ire of security men, he added.

The BSF denied beating up people or damaging property, but confirmed conducting the raids citing credible inputs.

An officer of the local police station informed that they have registered an FIR and opened an investigation based on the complaints.

215,2020/03/01,I will be first to welcome Sidhu if he joins our party: AAP Punjab chief Bhagwant Mann,"Amid speculation that the AAP is trying to woo Mr. Sidhu ahead of the 2022 Punjab Assembly polls, Mr. Mann said he has made the offer to the cricketer-turned-politician to join the party.

Aam Aadmi Party’s Punjab unit chief Bhagwant Mann on Sunday said if Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu decides to join the AAP, he would be the first to welcome him.

Amid speculation that the AAP is trying to woo Mr. Sidhu ahead of the 2022 Punjab Assembly polls, Mr. Mann said he has made the offer to the cricketer-turned-politician to join the party.

He, however, clarified that he had not held any talks in this regard with Mr. Sidhu.

“I have made the offer, but there have been no talks. Navjot Sidhu is a damn honest person; I was his huge fan during his cricketing days and used to switch off the TV whenever he got out. I am still his fan and will remain so in the future too. If he joins our party, I will be the first to welcome him,” said Mr. Mann.

The Sangrur MP said the doors of the party were open to all those who work for the welfare of the State without any vested interest.

‘Ask about Punjab’s issues’

Addressing a press conference here, Mr. Mann, however, evaded a direct reply when specifically asked if his party had approached Mr. Sidhu to join the outfit. Instead, he quipped, “Unemployment has been on the rise, prices have risen.”

When another reporter asked if Mr. Sidhu could be offered the chief ministerial post in case he joins the AAP, Mr. Mann again evaded the reply and said, “Farmers suicides have increased, water table has gone down. You (media) should ask questions about Punjab’s issues.”

“Sidhu, Bhagwant Mann, these are not Punjab’s issues. Punjab’s issues are farmers suicides, our water table going down, issues pertaining to our youth, our economy, these are the issues and you should ask me about this,” he added.

The Congress MLA from Amritsar had been incommunicado ever since he resigned from the State cabinet last year.

216,2020/03/01,"‘We will talk to those being misled on the CAA again’, says M.P. BJP chief V.D. Sharma","Newly-elected Madhya Pradesh BJP chief V.D. Sharma is reconciliatory towards minority members who quit the party en masse over the contentious citizenship law

Describing the Congress regime in Madhya Pradesh a “government of lies and deceit”, Khajuraho MP and newly-elected State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Vishnu Dutt Sharma believes electoral fortunes have turned in its favour of late. Although he downplays the organisational impact of minority members quitting the party en masse over the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the past month, Mr. Sharma offers to take the reconciliatory path of reaching out to them, bringing them back.

As the newly-elected president of the State BJP unit, what is your roadmap for the party in Madhya Pradesh?

The party’s structure in Madhya Pradesh is that of an ideal organisation. It stands on a comprehensive structure. My focus will be to accelerate ongoing work. The organisation is already strong and powerful, but we need to make it stronger.

In the past month, several members of the party’s minority cell quit the party over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Madhya Pradesh. Many have alleged the leadership refused to lend them an ear. Has the exodus affected the party’s organisation?

The attempts by the Congress and alleged Communists to mislead people are unfortunate. You can’t guess the relation of the law with minorities in India. It is only meant for the three countries where there are those who have faced religious persecution. Even Gandhi, Nehru and Indira have deemed it the government’s duty to provide refugees shelter. It is in Congress’s character to pick one section of society, lure it for vote bank politics to stay in power. There is an attempt by the Congress to destablise the country through the protests against the CAA in New Delhi and by spreading rumours among minorities.

Within the BJP, workers from minority communities perform duties with respect, and know the party accords them protection. Wherever the BJP has formed government, minorities have only moved ahead. All schemes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, based on sabka saath sabka vikas, have benefited minorities the most.

Those who had to leave the party, inevitably left it. Just four-five people leaving the party does not dent an organisation run by thousands of workers. Still, those who are being misled on the CAA, we will talk to them again so that they continue working for the party.

Even your MLA Narayan Tripathi has spoken out against the law..

Anyone can give their personal views. However, it is not like this is having a major impact anywhere. Wherever our people have made such remarks, we have spoken to them.

The Congress State government has hit out at the BJP government in the Centre for slashing ₹14,000 crore from its share in the Budget, and repeatedly cited funds crunch in effectively implementing welfare schemes. What’s your take on this?

When the Centre sanctioned 8 lakh houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to Madhya Pradesh and transferred funds, its government did not build two lakh houses by refusing to pay the matching grant. You are snatching away the right of the poor that the Centre is giving to them in the form of payment. We did not transfer houses but funds. The funds the Centre gave them, they returned a part of it unused. What’s more, they implemented the Ayushman Bharat [scheme] only after being pressed. Kamal Nath says MPs should appeal to the Centre for more funds. Has he ever spoken to the MPs? Forget that, he does not want them to be involved in any programmes. By lying, the government is shirking from its own responsibility.

You have been an active member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-backed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad for years. What significance does RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s frequent visits to the State recently hold for its people? Did it boost th eBJP’s awareness drive on the CAA?

His stay and meetings have no relation to the BJP. The Sangh has its own organisation and Mr. Bhagwat travels as per its programme. This has got nothing to do with the BJP. They have a separate agenda for the country. They have an independent functioning. RSS doesn’t work for any political party and neither advises it.

After the Vidhan Sabha loss for the BJP in 2018, its losing streak has continued even in by-elections. What is your assessment of its continuing poor electoral performance in the State? And despite efforts, why hasn’t the party been able to corner the Congress government on its reported failure to waive loans of farmers as promised before the 2018 election?

Today’s conditions are different. The State’s people have well understood the Kamal Nath government’s lies and deceit. With confidence, in the upcoming local elections, we will highlight its failures and anarchy, and the deteriorating law and order situation. It [Kamal Nath-led State government] is working on the same pattern as the Digvijaya Singh government, prompting the BJP to hit the streets.

As for the waiver, the Congress is cornered by both the BJP and farmers, who continue to be in distress. There is no region where the loan has been waived. Forget the waiver, have they even reached out to farmers in the first place? For delivering the Kisan Samman Nidhi, they refused to provide the list of farmers in the Bundelkhand region.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/6pkdvf/article30956755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VDSKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/we-will-talk-to-those-being-misled-on-the-caa-again-says-mp-bjp-chief-vd-sharma/article30956756.ece

218,2020/03/01,Board exams to resume in north-east Delhi,"The affected students can still get postponement, says CBSE

Board examinations in northeast Delhi are set to resume their normal schedule from Monday, but the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has offered a lifeline for those students who have been affected by the violence there, promising to conduct the examinations again for them on a different date.

They have been told to contact their school principals to avail themselves of such relief. This relief is available for examinations scheduled until March 7. The examinations are due to continue until March 30.

In a circular issued by CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi on Sunday afternoon, the Board explains how it has been caught between two difficult realities with regard to examination scheduling in the wake of the violence.

It had postponed the board examinations from February 26 to 29 in up to 86 centres in east and north-east districts.

“The Board is of the view that further delay in conducting Class XII examinations may hamper the chances of admissions in professional courses, i.e., medical, engineering, law, and other UG admissions. Few entrance examinations are conducted in accordance with the timelines fixed by the Hon’ble Courts and therefore dates are sacrosanct,” said the CBSE circular, noting that the prestigious JEE (Main) examination is scheduled to begin on April 3. “The Board is also clear that for candidates who are in a position to appear for the board examinations, it would be very stressful and cause immense anxiety if the examinations are further postponed.”

It added that the Delhi police are making sure security arrangements are in place for the examinations to be held safely. The Delhi government has closed all schools — which also act as examination centres — until March 7.

However, the CBSE admitted that some students are in especially “difficult circumstances”.

Ground reports show that some students have been directly affected by the violence, with family members who may have been injured or killed. Others have seen their homes destroyed or have had to flee their neighbourhoods, and have lost their textbooks and admit cards in the process. Riots and curfews have exacerbated fear, tension and mental stress among students, who may be in need of counselling.

“The incidents that have unfolded in the last few days have affected some of our students... CBSE is prepared to hold examinations at a later date for such candidates who would not be able to appear for the examinations up to 07.3.2020,” said the circular, adding that school principals and the Delhi Directorate of Education are requested to provide the lists of such students to the Board.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/5r7p8c/article30918922.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gunshots-stoneGQ975S2NL7jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/delhi-violence-further-delay-in-conducting-exams-may-hamper-chances-of-admission-to-professional-courses-says-cbse/article30956555.ece
219,2020/03/01,Congress links I-T raids to corruption probe in Chhattisgarh,"Over the last three days, the Income Tax department conducted searches at multiple locations linked to Chhattisgarh government officials and others.

The Congress on Sunday accused the Union government of resorting to “political vendetta” in Chhattisgarh by conducting income tax raids during which the CRPF assisted officials.

At a press conference here, Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala and leader in charge of the State party affairs P.L. Punia said the Narendra Modi government was following “coercive centralism” instead of cooperative federalism. They said the raids were aimed at stalling the State’s investigation into the allegations of corruption against the previous BJP government, led by Raman Singh.

“The Modi government’s so-called alliance with Central investigating agencies in the non-BJP States has been extended to include the CRPF,” Mr. Surjewala said.

In the past three days, the Income Tax Department conducted raids across the State, even covering the family of a senior IAS officer in the Congress government of Bhupesh Baghel.

“A PDS scam involving ₹36,000 crore came to light earlier. The diary, which came into police possession by chance and which has details of the scam, has been put forth for the media by Mr. Baghel, T.S. Singh Deo and myself,” Mr. Surjewala said. The “clandestine, cloak-and-dagger raids” showed that the Centre was scared, he said.

He said the deployment of a Central force without the State being informed “undermines...the scheme laid out in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, which places law and order under the State’s remit”.

Mr. Punia said the clumsy manner and timing of the raids exposed the Centre’s intentions. “No government in Indian history, before the Modi-Shah regime, can be accused of reducing the status of an elite force to that of an accompanying party for an income tax raid. No party, except the BJP, has ever used the CRPF to execute a political vendetta,” he said.

All previous governments deployed Central forces only under rare and exceptional circumstances and in public interest, he said. The Congress government saw a sign of encouragement in the raids that its own investigations into the alleged acts of corruption were proceeding in the right direction, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4dnuqd/article30891000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23SURJEWALA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/congress-links-cloak-and-dagger-i-t-raids-to-graft-probe-by-chhattisgarh-govt-slams-use-of-crpf/article30956462.ece

On his 69th birthday, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Sunday asserted that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was united in Bihar and would win more than 200 seats in the upcoming Assembly elections, due in October-November 2020. Mr. Kumar also listed the achievements of his government and formally launched the party’s campaign for the Assembly poll. Bihar has 243 seats in its State Assembly.

Also read: NPR | Why has the Bihar government said it will stick to the 2010 manual for updating the population register?

“The NDA is united in Bihar. Let us resolve to ensure that the NDA will win more than 200 seats in upcoming Assembly election in the State,” Mr. Kumar said while addressing the party’s ‘Karyakarta Sammelan’ (workers’ meeting) at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan.

Mr. Kumar’s meeting with Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Yadav in the ongoing Budget session in the State Assembly has lately fuelled speculation in the State’s political circles, but Mr. Kumar’s speech at the Sammelan dispelled it.

Poor turnout

For the past several days, the State capital has been dotted with hoardings, billboards, posters and huge arches on roads with life-size photos of Janata Dal-United (JD-U) leaders and workers. However, attendance at the workers’ meeting place was sparse.

Attendees who were brought in buses by party MPs, MLAs and State leaders for the meeting were nowhere to be seen in the numbers claimed by party leaders earlier. “Three days ago, Kanhaiya Kumar’s rally had double the crowd at the same Gandhi Maidan… it has been the most unimpressive party workers’ meeting of the JD(U) in recent times,” a shop owner near the western flank of Gandhi Maidan told The Hindu.

Tejashwi Yadav, who is currently on a ‘Berojgari hatao’ (‘remove unemployment’) yatra too posted pictures of thin attendance at the JD(U)’s workers’ meeting and termed it a “flop show”.

Party workers kept repeating the JD(U)’s new slogan “Do hazaar bees, phir se Nitish” (‘2020, once again Nitish’) at the meeting, while Opposition party leaders said, “2020, finish Nitish”.

‘Patience on CAA’

While listing out the achievements of his government in a nearly hour-long speech, Mr. Kumar also underscored that the State Assembly had recently unanimously passed a resolution against the National Register of Citizens and declared that the National Population Register would be implemented in only in the 2010 format. “So, patience should be kept on the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and other controversies be avoided until the issues are before the court,” he appealed to party workers.

He also slammed the Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD)-Congress alliance and said that when the NDA government came to power in 2005, “the rule of law was brought in the State”.

“On the crime index, Bihar’s 23rd position is among the lowest in the country...statistics of crime have gone down in the State but a few people keep posting about some incidents on their social media accounts…we all remember the Bhagalpur riots in 1989…when our government came to power, the guilty were brought to book and victims got justice,” Mr. Kumar said.

The CM also spoke about how his government had worked in the field of education, health, electricity and other sectors. “Earlier, 12.5% children did not go to school but today the percentage has come down to less than 1%...we distributed lakhs of bicycles and other facilities to school students,” he added.

PM tweets

Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had tweeted to wish Mr. Kumar on his birthday. “Greetings to Bihar’s Chief Minister and my friend, Shri @NitishKumar Ji. A popular leader who has risen from the grassroots, he’s been at the forefront of furthering Bihar’s development. His passion towards social empowerment is noteworthy.

A Maharashtra legislator has appealed to the Arunachal Pradesh government not to pursue a proposed highway through a tiger reserve.

In a letter to Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu on February 24, MLA Bhimrao Dhondibar Tapkir expressed concern over the proposal to construct the East-West Industrial Corridor through the “nationally and globally important” Pakke Tiger Reserve.

Environment and wildlife activists in Arunachal Pradesh have opposed the idea of a 40-km elevated stretch of the 692.7 km project through the tiger reserve.

“I understand the need for better road connectivity for people living in many areas across your State, but it shouldn’t come at the cost of loss of biodiversity. It is important to consider that there are no villages or towns within the area that the proposed road will pass through and there are currently existing alternate routes...,” wrote Mr. Tapkir, who represents the Khadakwasla Assembly constituency.

Pointing out that the idea of a road through the reserve would be disastrous for the existing wildlife, the MLA requested Mr. Khandu to ensure the project was shelved.

The Hindu had reported on the highway proposal after Seijosa-based green activist Tana Jorjo Tara received documents related to the project through RTI.

Three persons were killed when two goods trains of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) collided in Singrauli district of Madhya Pradesh on Sunday morning.

“The persons were operating one of the trains carrying coal from NCL mines to an NTPC plant in Rihand Nagar of Uttar Pradesh, when another train coming from the opposite direction collided into it around 5 a.m.,” District Collector K.V.S. Choudary said.

Wagons derailed

Thirteen wagons of one of the trains and an engine jumped off the tracks following the collision.

Three bodies were pulled out from the engine, said Singrauli Additional Superintendent of Police Pradeep Shende.

The deceased were identified as Rasheed Ahmed, 65, and Mandeep Kumar, 26, both hailing from Uttar Pradesh, and Ramlakhan Bais, 29, a local resident,

While the trapped bodies had been recovered from the spot, the tracks, meant only for coal transport, were being cleared of carriages using cranes and trucks, he added.

Families of the deceased may get compensation by the NTPC.

It seems the accident occurred either due to an error on part of the drivers or because of some fault in signaling, said Mr. Shende.

The cause of the accident was yet to be ascertained. “The NTPC is investigating the matter,” said Mr. Choudary.

Meanwhile, East Central Railway’s Chief Public Relations Officer, Rajesh Kumar, in a statement said the Indian Railways has nothing to do with the accident.

The accident took place in the Merry Go Round system completely owned and operated by NTPC, Rihand, he said.

A day before Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s visit to the city, the office of West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Saturday made public its communication to the State government about the “misuse of funds” for the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

A February 4 communication from the Special Secretary, Raj Bhavan, to the Principal Secretary, Information and Cultural Affairs, shows the Governor had objected to the advertisements placed by the government against the CAA.

The letter seeks details of the amount paid for these advertisement and the amount that is due to be paid, besides the names of officials who had sanctioned the advertisements. “The Governor is of the opinion that the presence of senior officials of the State in the advertisements has raised critical issues, and that is beyond their expected conduct and propriety,” it read.

The letter pointed out that the advertisements had been stayed by the High Court and a large number of people had raised the alarm at “such a misuse of public funds for furthering the political strategy or prospects of the ruling party and sought the intervention of the Governor”.

225,2020/03/01,Trafficking survivors in Bengal seek inter-State probe by AHTU,"Three of them accompanied police unit to arrest accused

Rejecting the investigation by the local police station, trafficking survivors in West Bengal are seeking probe by Anti Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) to ensure that the perpetrators are arrested.

In February 2020, Sahiba (name changed), who was rescued in 2017 from Pune, approached senior police officers of Baruipur police district in South 24 Parganas demanding that the case be transferred from the local police station to AHTU. After the unit took over the probe, she accompanied the policemen to Pune and got four of the accused arrested.

In at least two cases in 2019, the survivors hailing from South 24 Parganas approached the Calcutta High Court and got necessary directions for AHTU to investigate the matter.

Selima Khan (name changed) was kidnapped in 2012. After being rescued from Pune, she kept following the status of her case. A chargesheet was filed by the local police in September 2017. She, however, was not satisfied with the probe and sought the help of Calcutta High Court so that the probe was handed over to AHTU.

Another survivor Nilima ( name changed) was also upset that the traffickers who took her away from the State did not figure in the police investigation and approached the Calcutta High Court on the issue. The High Court in both the cases directed that a probe by AHTU should be conducted.

Both Selima and Nilima were not only successful in getting the probe conducted by the AHTU, but they also accompanied the police team when it carried out raids in Pune in 2019. One of the accused in Selima’s case was arrested during the raids.

‘Trafficking destination’

Subhasree Raptan of Goranbose Gram Bikash Kendra (GGBK), an organisation working with survivors of trafficking in south Bengal, said that the three cases highlight the need for inter-State investigation in cases of trafficking.

“In most of the cases of trafficking we come across, the survivors are rescued from a different State. In almost every case, there is need for inter-State investigation. The local police despite best efforts cannot ensure that,” Ms. Raptan said.

The activist said that after Delhi, Pune has emerged as a destination where lots of girls from Bengal are being rescued. “In the past few years we have seen 20 to 25 cases where girls have been rescued from Pune,” she said.

Activists like Ms. Raptan have been working to combat trafficking of women and girls in Bengal, which for years has remained the hub of trafficking. She said there is little clarity on which wing of the police should deal with such cases or what charges must be pressed. On many occasions when children go missing sections of kidnapping of Indian Penal Code instead of trafficking are pressed by the police.

While the latest reports of NCRB (for 2017 and 2018) reflect a drop in the number of trafficking cases in Bengal, the data on missing children indicate that the State is a hotspot for children gone missing.

Describing the Congress regime in Madhya Pradesh a “government of lies and deceit”, Khajuraho MP and newly-elected State BJP president Vishnu Dutt Sharma believes electoral fortunes have turned in its favour of late. Although he downplays the organisational impact of minority members quitting the party en masse over the contentious CAA in the past month, Mr. Sharma offers to take the reconciliatory path of reaching out to them, bringing them back.

As the newly-elected president of the State BJP unit, what’s your roadmap for the party in Madhya Pradesh?

The party’s structure in Madhya Pradesh is that of an ideal organisation. It stands on a comprehensive structure. My focus will be to accelerate ongoing work. The organisation is already strong and powerful, but we need to make it stronger.

In the past month, several members of the party’s minority cell quit the party over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Madhya Pradesh. Many have alleged the leadership refused to lend them an ear. Has the exodus affected the party’s organisation?

The attempts by the Congress and alleged communists to mislead people are unfortunate. You can’t guess the relation of the law with minorities in India. It’s only meant for the three countries where there are those who’ve faced religious persecution. Even Gandhi, Nehru and Indira have deemed it the government’s duty to provide refugees shelter. It’s in Congress’s character to pick one section of society, lure it for vote bank politics to stay in power. There is an attempt by the Congress to de-stablise the country through the protests against the CAA in New Delhi and by spreading rumours among minorities.

Within the BJP, workers from minority communities perform duties with respect, and know the party accords them protection. Wherever the BJP has formed government, minorities have only moved ahead. All schemes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, based on sabka saath sabka vikas, have benefited minorities the most.

Those who had to leave the party, inevitably left it. Just four-five people leaving the party doesn’t dent an organisation run by thousands of workers. Still, those who’re being misled on the CAA, we’ll talk to them again so that they continue working for the party.

Even your MLA Narayan Tripathi has spoken out against the law..

Anyone can give their personal views. However, it’s not like this is having a major impact anywhere. Wherever our people have made such remarks, we’ve spoken to them.

The Congress government has hit out at the BJP government in the Centre for slashing Rs. 14,000 crore from its share in the budget, and repeatedly cited funds crunch in effectively implementing welfare schemes. What’s your take on this?

When the Centre sanctioned 8 lakh houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to Madhya Pradesh and transferred funds, its government didn’t build two lakh houses by refusing to pay the matching grant. You’re snatching away the right of the poor that the Centre is giving to them in the form of payment. We didn’t transfer houses but funds. The funds Centre gave them, they returned a part of it unused. What’s more, they implemented the Ayushman Bharat only after being pressed. Kamal Nath says MPs should appeal to the Centre for more funds. Has he even ever spoken to the MPs? Forget that. He doesn’t want them to be involved in any programmes. By lying, the government is shirking from its own responsibility.

You’d been an active member of the RSS-backed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad for years. What significance does RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s frequent visits to the State recently hold for its people? Did it boost BJP’s awareness drive on the CAA?

His stay and meetings have no relation to the BJP. Sangh has its own organisation, and Mr. Bhagwat travels as per its programme. This has got nothing to do with the BJP. They have a separate agenda for the country. They have an independent functioning. RSS doesn’t work for any political party and neither advises it.

After the Vidhan Sabha loss for the BJP in 2018, its losing streak has continued even in byelections. What’s your assessment of its continuing poor electoral performance in the State? And despite efforts, why hasn’t the party been able to corner the Congress government on its reported failure to waive loans of farmers as promised before the 2018 election?

Today’s conditions are different. The State’s people have well understood the Kamal Nath government’s lies and deceit. With confidence, in the upcoming local elections, we’ll highlight its failures and anarchy, and the deteriorating law and order situation. It’s working on the same pattern as the Digvijaya Singh government, prompting the BJP to hit the streets.

As for the waiver, the Congress is cornered by both the BJP and farmers, who continue to be in distress. There is no region where the loan has been waived. Forget the waiver, have they even reached out to farmers in the first place? For delivering the Kisan Samman Nidhi, they refused to provide the list of farmers in the Bundelkhand region.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/923j1j/article30953443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VISHNUDUTTSHARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-congress-regime-built-of-lies-and-deceit-says-bjp-state-president/article30953444.ece
227,2020/03/01,Maharashtra releases second list of loan waiver beneficiaries,"Maharashtra government on Saturday released the second list of 21.82 lakh beneficiaries under the Mahatma Phule Crop Loan waiver scheme.

The Maha Vikas Aghadi government announced the first list of 15,358 beneficiaries from 658 villages on Monday. Two villages from each district were chosen for the first list of beneficiaries and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had said it was to check whether the system set up by the State government was functioning smoothly without any glitch.

“All farmers who have been mentioned in the second list will be getting benefits and in case of any difficulty they should immediately contact the government officials,” said Mr. Thackeray.

Abha Shukla, principal secretary, Cooperation department, said over 1.10 lakh farmers have been scrutinised and Sunday being a holiday, money in those accounts will start coming in from Monday.

The second list covers 15 districts fully and 13 partially due to model code of conduct in place for gram panchayat polls.

According to officials, of the 36.45 lakh loan accounts, information on 34.98 lakh accounts have been uploaded on the department’s portal.

228,2020/03/01,Maratha reservation case: Cabinet sub-committee meets Rohatgi,"SC hearing on March 18; Maharashtra government’s position strong, says Ashok Chavan

A Cabinet sub-committee headed by Public Works Department (PWD) Minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan on Saturday held a meeting here with senior counsel Mukul Rohatgi to discuss the issue of Maratha reservation ahead of the Supreme Court hearing on March 17.

Mr. Rohatgi, former Attorney General of India, and other senior counsels are representing the State in the case before the apex court.

“We have formed a team of good and senior advocates, including Rohatgi, and others. We held a meeting to ensure the preparation is good and the law holds its ground before the SC. We are sure the government’s position is strong,” Mr. Chavan told reporters after the meeting.

Urban Development Minister and Shiv Sena leader Eknath Shinde said the objective of the meeting was to ensure that there were no loopholes which may come up during the hearing in the apex court.

The State legislature on November 29, 2018 passed a Bill granting 16% reservation in education and government jobs to the Maratha community under the socially and educationally backward class (SEBC) category. The Bill was approved and signed by the Governor a day later.

In June 2019, the Bombay High Court — while hearing a bunch of petitions challenging the decision to grant 16% reservation — upheld the constitutional validity of reservation but said that the quota be reduced from 16% to 12% and 13% in education and government jobs respectively.

This was later challenged in the Supreme Court.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maratha-reservation-case-cabinet-sub-committee-meets-rohatgi/article30953517.ece
229,2020/03/01,"In three months, Maharashtra’s MVA government overcomes political challenges, gets ready to tackle finances","Bringing in more industries, increasing State revenue, and bettering relations with Centre are key issues ahead for Maharashtra government

With the three-party Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government in Maharashtra completing three months in office, the initially uncanny looking alliance of the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Congress has overcome political obstacles from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with unexpected unity.

The government is now set to face the more difficult challenge of pushing the State’s economy towards growth and bring the finances back on track.

Breaking one of the oldest Hindutva alliances in Indian politics, the Shiv Sena and the BJP parted ways the day after the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya. As the Sena joined Congress and NCP to form the MVA government based on a Common Minimum Program (CMP), the BJP leaders were confident that this, “unnatural” alliance, would not last more than three months. To corner the Sena, the BJP came up with issues like Ram temple, Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar, and fundamental differences in ideology. However, Sena president and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray not only handled the issues with care but the two other parties also ensured that the alliance was not in a jeopardy.

Numbers game

In the 288-member Assembly, the Sena, NCP and Congress have 56, 54 and 44 MLAs respectively. “No individual leader can destabilise the government due to such numbers. It makes difficult to run an ‘Operation Lotus’ like in Karnataka. The government won’t face any threat until an entire party decides to move out,” said political commentator Abhay Deshpande. In addition, the central leadership of the BJP is busy sorting out the mess created over CAA and NRC nationally and also the successive Assembly losses. “The infighting within the State unit of BJP too has begun,” he said.

Unlike the previous government, decentralisation of responsibilities in MVA government has ensured rising levels of mutual trust between all three stakeholders. Every minister is independently anchoring projects in respective departments, with negligible interference from the CM’s office.

Hindutva plank

In the ongoing Budget session of the legislature, BJP in an attempt to corner Sena, wanted to bring a resolution honouring Savarkar. Mr. Thackeray not only sidelined the request but did not even attended the Assembly on the day. Deputy CM and NCP leader Ajit Pawar praised Savarkar for his contribution to freedom struggle, but added that his party definitely has ideological differences.

Mr Thackeray will be going to Ayodhya on March 7 and neither the Congress nor NCP has opposed it. The CM has repeatedly clarified that even though there are some ideological differences between three parties, they are united on CMP. Mr. Thackeray has recently launched sharp attacks on BJP over violence in JNU and Delhi riots. He has clarified that there will be no NRC in Maharashtra and NPR will not have controversial columns. It has further cemented the tripartite alliance.

“The Sena is moving from right wing party to right of centre party. They have realised that they cannot survive in an alliance with BJP on Hindutva plank. The party is changing is strategy and it seems to be working,” said Mr Deshpande.

Challenges ahead

After overcoming initial challenges such as portfolio distribution, the CM’s inexperience in administration, and the uneasiness with new allies, the government now faces the task of bringing the economy back on track. It has announced two mega schemes such as crop loan waiver and Shiv Bhojan thaali for ₹10, with both running smoothly as of now.

The Budget will be presented on March 6. Contrary to the BJP claims, the MVA government has been claiming that actual loan taken by the State, including guarantees for various infra projects, runs into ₹7 lakh crore. With BJP government at the Centre, the extra financial help is unlikely as Mr. Thackeray has been asking for payment of GST dues. Bringing in more industries, increasing the State revenue, and tackling relations with the Centre are key challenges before the government.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wvrq03/article30953479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BMMVACELEBRATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/in-three-months-mva-overcomes-political-challenges-gets-ready-to-tackle-finances/article30953480.ece
230,2020/03/01,"BJP trying to destabilise my government, attacking federal structure: Bhupesh Baghel","Raids conducted on premises of government officials, associates

With raids on premises of government officials and associates continuing for over two days, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, has written to the Governor alleging that the BJP government at the Centre was “conspiring to destabilise” its government and attacking federalism by conducting such raids.

Stating that the raids intended to put pressure on his government, Mr. Baghel wrote, “The way it is being done along with the central paramilitary forces, it appears to be a direct attack on the Congress government inspired by political rancour.”

The irony, he added, was that the State government wasn’t even informed which agency was conducting raids. “Without the prior permission of the Chhattisgarh government, central paramilitary forces have been deployed, which is unconstitutional and an interference in its jurisdiction,” he wrote. Usually, the local police accompany income tax officials during raids.

Mr. Baghel, in the letter on Friday signed by Cabinet Ministers, urged Governor Anusuiya Uikey to intervene in the matter, so that “democracy is preserved and the elected government can function within the contours of the constitution without fear.”

Pointing out that an alleged team of income tax officials raided residences of government officials, including those attached to his office, for the second day on Friday, he said, “The Chhattisgarh government is investigating corruption of the former Bharatiya Janata Party government and has registered several cases. Rattled by this, the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre is conspiring to destabilise the Congress government.”

Mr. Baghel claimed his government, formed after Congress secured a thumping majority, had developed a unique image in the country by continuously working for people. “Our wins in byelections, urban bodies and panchayats have shocked it [BJP],” he added.

As the BJP was unable to contest the Congress through democratic means, he contended, it was resorting to unconstitutional methods “to attack the federal structure”.

“The BJP has become infamous for such vengeful acts in the world and this action has created an atmosphere of fear and terror in the country,” he wrote, adding that it was an attack on democracy, and the people would not tolerate it.

The alleged income tax teams on Thursday raided at least 25 premises linked to Chhattisgarh government officials and others on charges of tax evasion. State government officials said the teams were assisted by the CRPF, a central paramilitary force, to conduct the raids in Raipur and a few other locations.

On Thursday teams raided residences and offices of Raipur Mayor Aijaz Dhebar; joint secretary, commerce and industries department, A.K. Tuteja; and State Real Estate Regulatory Authority chairman and former chief secretary Vivek Dhand, among others. A day later officials raided the residence of, among others, Saumya Chaursia, deputy secretary in the Chief Minister’s Office.

On Tuesday, the Economic Offences Wing had registered a case against former principal secretary Aman Singh and his wife Yasmeen Singh, both considered close to the former BJP government, in a disproportionate assets case.

Panjab University clinched two gold medals on the final day to emerge the champion of the inaugural edition of the Khelo India University Games on Sunday.

Panjab’s pugilists won two yellow metals saw it finish on level terms with Pune on 17 gold medals, but its overall tally of 46 medals compared to Pune’s 37 gave it the crown. Punjabi University was third with 33 medals.

“The first edition of the KIUG has been truly successful. We aim to organise the Khelo India University Games regularly and make it, along with the Youth Games, the platform that paves the way for our future Olympic medallists.

232,2020/03/01,‘Saini Saab’ is no more,"Dronacharya awardee athletics coach trained some of India’s finest

Veteran athletics coach and Dronacharya awardee Joginder Singh Saini, who groomed some of India’s finest track and field stars, died here on Sunday due to age-related problems. He was 90.

Saini, who was chief National athletics coach for many years from the 1970s to 90s, was unwell for the past few days.

Condolences

“I am truly sad to hear of the passing away of our colleague, my chief coach and mentor, J.S. Saini,” AFI president Adille Sumariwalla said.

“He loved athletics and contributed to the Athletics Federation of India till his last day. He was my friend, philosopher and guide and helped me immensely in my role as AFI president with his sound advice,” Sumariwalla said in his condolence message.

Born on January 1, 1930 in Hoshiarpur, Punjab, Saini was a science graduate and became an athletics coach in 1954 after completing a diploma in physical education and a course in coaching at the NIS Patiala.

He became the chief coach of the then Amateur Athletics Federation of India in 1970.

Saini received the Dronacharya Award in 1997. He was the chief coach of the Indian athletics team which won 18 medals, including eight golds, at the 1978 Asian Games.

‘Saini Saab’, as he was fondly called by the Indian athletics fraternity, was involved with coaching until 2004 and since then he became an adviser of AFI.

Illustrious wards

Some of India’s finest athletes were trained by him at NIS and National camps. Saini was the one who encouraged Gurbachan Singh Randhawa, who won an Asian Games gold in 1962, to take up the decathlon.

Legendary marathon runner Shivnath Singh was among other illustrious athletes coached by him.

Dutee Chand did the double at the Khelo India University Games (KIUG) in Bhubaneswar on Sunday as she clocked 23.66 seconds to run to the gold in the 200m event.

The victory marked Dutee’s second gold in as many days, as she set a new National University record on her way to the 100m title on Saturday.

“In the 100m, you don’t have time to decide when to speed up or slow down, but in the 200m you have more time to realise when to go fast and when to relax the body,” Dutee said after the race, talking about the difference in the two events.

She added: “You need to put in a lot more effort in the 200m. Runners like me, who focus more on the sprint, find it difficult on the turn in the 200m event.

“I struggled a little bit today, but I pulled through in the end to clock a competitive timing.”

Dutee’s best in the 200m came in the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta where she ran 23s in the semifinal and went on to win the silver in the final.

The qualification mark for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics has been set at 22.80, only 0.02 shy of her best, but she has a pragmatic approach. She knows her strength and has chosen to focus only on 100m.

""The Olympic mark is 22.80 and it will be difficult for me to achieve it.

""Since I’m short, I find it difficult to pick up speed and it becomes tight in the end. It’s not that it is impossible, but it will need more time.

242,2020/03/01,Works on flyover at Kandhampatti junction nearing completion,"It will ease movement of vehicles on the Salem-Kochi Highway

The construction works of the flyover at the Kandhampatti junction are nearing completion.

Located on the busy Salem-Kochi Highway, the Kandhampatti junction is one of the busiest points on the highway in Salem. Villagers and motorists here have been demanding for steps to ease traffic movement at the junction. Besides, villagers on both sides of the highways moving towards Salem are also severely affected by the traffic congestion at the junction.

As the gaps on the highway median to make u-turn are quite far away from the villages here, two-wheeler riders used to cross the median at many points and this often led to accidents on the highway.

Following demand, the works for constructing a flyover at Kandhampatti junction began in February 2019, at a cost of ₹33 crore. Once completed, the flyover will benefit the residents of Shivadhapuram and Sidhar Kovil areas and also ease movement of vehicles on the highway.

Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami laid the foundation for the project. According to officials, the pillars and decks have been erected and works on the approach roads to the flyover are going on.

Three flyovers were constructed on this stretch, near Kurunguchavadi, at Thiruvagoundanur and at AVR roundabout to ease traffic movement on the highway. All these served as major entry points into Salem city and this often led to traffic congestion in the area.

Highway officials said that construction works for flyovers at Ariyanur and Magudanchavadi were progressing and works for flyover at Mamangam junction would begin soon.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ogl8i/article30958483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA02BRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/works-on-flyover-at-kandhampatti-junction-nearing-completion/article30958484.ece

245,2020/03/01,CCI launches brand for Indian cotton,"Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has launched “HIRA”, a brand name for the Indian cotton that it markets with specific quality parameters.

A press release from the Corporation said cotton sold under CCI-HIRA (High In Reliable Attributes) brand will have minimum trash (less than 1.7 %), low moisture and better grade.

The need for a brand was felt to assure the customers of good and reliable quality of Indian cotton. It will also help Indian cotton gain international recognition.

CCI, which is a mini ratna public sector undertaking, has procured over 60 lakh bales of cotton so far this season. Only the cotton that meets specific standards will be sold under the brand name, said the Chairman and Managing Director of CCI P. Alli Rani.

Speaking at the event, Ms. Alli Rani explained the efforts taken by CCI to ensure quality of cotton.

Atul Ganatra, president of Cotton Association of India, said government agencies like CCI and Maharashtra Federation are likely to procure over 100 lakh bales under MSP operations this season and the quality of cotton procured by CCI is good. The trade and textile industry is waiting for a reasonable rate for the cotton that the CCI is selling, he said.

Chairman of Southern India Mills’ Association Ashwin Chandran has said in a press release that CCI started enforcing the fair average quality norms from the 2018-19 cotton season. Appreciating the efforts taken by CCI for branding Indian cotton, he said the Union Ministry of Textiles also plans to launch a scheme called “Nirmal Cotton Mission” with CCI as a nodal agent. This will make Indian cotton a high quality one. Mr. Chandran appealed to the Prime Minister to also launch a Technology Mission on Cotton in a revised format to increase the productivity. He has said that by adopting the global best practices and acquiring appropriate technology, Indian cotton farmers will be able to double their income and make India a global leader in cotton textiles.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/cci-launches-brand-for-indian-cotton/article30958429.ece

Mr. Mutharasan along with Thirumurugan Gandhi, Organiser of ‘May 17 Movement’ was here to take part in the Shaheen Bagh-model protests held near Kottai Maidan here on Sunday.

Talking to reporters, Mr. Mutharasan alleged that like Gujarat, the Centre is deliberately trying to create riots across the country to divert attention from protests against Citizenship Amendment Act.

He alleged that the BJP used its pro-CAA rallies only to level charges against the Opposition. He questioned the State government for not registering a case against BJP leader H. Raja for saying riots similar to Delhi would happen in Tamil Nadu.

Mr. Thirumurugan Gandhi said that the BJP government has not passed a single law during its regime that would benefit public, so is CAA.

247,2020/03/01,Engineering sourcing exhibition from March 4,"EEPC India (Engineering Export Promotion Council) will organise an International Engineering Sourcing Show here for three days from March 4.

The event is expected to attract nearly 400 overseas buyers and 15,000 domestic visitors

S. Chandrashekar, convener of the EEPC India, Coimbatore chapter, said the exhibition will have 425 stalls. “This is the first time the event is held in a tier-two city and we have more number of stalls compared to the previous eight editions,” he said.

Nearly 40 % of the stalls are by Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises (MSMEs). All kinds of engineering products will be on display and the focus is on exports, procurements by public sector undertakings, large industries, and business among the MSMEs.

Tamil Nadu Government is the host State and will support 125 MSMEs to take part. While 40 % of the participants are from Tamil Nadu, the rest are from different States. Technical seminars will be held as part of the programme.

Mr. Chandrashekar said the exhibition will bring continuous orders for the participants. The spot orders and enquiries that will be converted to business in a year are expected to be worth ₹350 crore to ₹400 crore.

On orders shifting to India because of the COVID-19 impact in China, he said that there will be opportunities but these will have certain risks too. All orders that will involve design and product approval will take time. If China recovers, the buyers may shift back to China. The Indian Government should come out with a system to ensure that Indian companies that capitalise on the opportunities are not affected, he said.

249,2020/03/01,MMF sector expected to attract more investments,"The removal of anti-dumping duty on PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid) in the Union Budget is expected to bring in investments in the Manmade Fibre (MMF) sector and benefit the entire value chain.

Madhu Sudhan Bhageria, Chairman and Managing Director of Filatex India, told The Hindu that so far availability of raw material was expensive. It will be lower now. And this will lead to higher availability of PTA too. The entire MMF value chain will benefit. Indian weavers will be able to compete with imported fabric. The yarn producers were not planning expansion because of uncertainty on fibre availability. Now they will look at expansions. Growth in global textiles in the last 10 years, was mainly (98 %) in MMF, he said.

Mr. Bhageria added that Filatex will invest ₹100 crore next financial year to recycle PET bottles. The company plans to develop in-house technology for chemical recycling of the PET bottles.

According to a study of 45 CRISIL-rated polyester yarn manufacturers, the operating profits of the yarn producers are set to rise 15 % to 20 % next financial year because of a 150 basis points to 200 basis points spurt in operating margins due to lower raw material prices, healthy demand for polyester, and higher blending in garments and other products.

The report says that raw material cost has started moderating because the outbreak of Coronavirus is likely to impact demand for polyester yarn in China, which accounts for nearly 65 % of global demand. As a consequence, the price of PTA, a key raw material that accounts for more than half of the sales price of polyester yarn, is expected to be under pressure in the near term. Moreover, PTA capacities in Asia are set to rise 20 % over the next couple of years, which will keep prices in check.

Further, the removal of anti-dumping duty announced in the Union Budget this year will make India’s PTA imports cheaper by $ 25- $ 30 per tonne, as there will be more avenues for sourcing. Consequently, input cost for polyester yarn manufacturers will be 3 % to 4 % lower, according to the study.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/mmf-sector-expected-to-attract-more-investments/article30953573.ece
250,2020/03/01,Corporation starts fixing smart water meters at R.S. Puram,"The civic body will fix 200 meters of three varieties to study their performance

After completing most of the work on the distribution system to improve water supply under the 24x7 drinking water supply improvement scheme, the Coimbatore Corporation has started fixing smart water meters.

Sources familiar with the development said, the company that the Corporation had tasked with implementing the scheme – Suez India Pvt. Ltd. - had started the work to fix the meters on East Periasamy Road.

It would fix 200 meters of three varieties – 100 of the multi-jet variety and 50 each of ultrasonic and electromagnetic – at as many houses to study their performance. After a trial period of six to nine months, it would decide which of the meters to be used in other parts of the core city of 60 wards.

The meters would automatically transmit to a server the water consumed by the residents to arrive at the water charges.

The reason for fixing just 200 meters and having the trial period was to chose the best meter available in the market as the Corporation would be fixing thousands of meters in the 60 wards. The sources also said the Corporation had another option as well – to fix just the meters without the advanced metering infrastructure and later add it. It was the advanced metering infrastructure that helped in transmitting to the server the volume of water consumed by houses.

While this was automation on the consumption front – at the consumers’ end – the Corporation through Suez India Pvt. Ltd. - would also fix automated water meters in the distribution system to study the quantity of water flowing into tanks, the outflow, the pressure of flow and level of water in the tanks.

In R.S. Puram, the Corporation is to install over 5,600 meters.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/uvi8l2/article30953432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB01WATERMETER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corporation-starts-fixing-smart-water-meters-at-rs-puram/article30953433.ece
251,2020/03/01,"SL vs WI: Sri Lanka wins a thriller, sweeps series","Mathews’ final over does the trick for the Islanders

Angelo Mathews’ experience came to the fore as Sri Lanka kept its nerve to beat West Indies by six runs in the third and final ODI on Sunday. The win helped the islanders sweep the series 3-0.

Chasing the hosts’ 307, openers Shai Hope (72, 88b, 6x4) and Sunil Ambris (60, 60b, 6x4, 1x6) gave the visitors a flying start, adding 111.

Nicholas Pooran (50b, 61b, 3x4, 1x6) and Kieron Pollard (49, 50b, 6x4, 1x6) then sustained the momentum and it looked like the Caribbeans were on course to chase down the big total.

With West Indies needing 13 off the final over, the ice-cool Mathews was on the ball despite being hit for a four off the first delivery. Off the next, he had Fabian Allen caught at deep midwicket. Allen’s cameo had threatened to take the game away from the hosts with a cameo.

Earlier, Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva smashed half-centuries for Sri Lanka after it opted to bat. Mendis top-scored with 55 while de Silva hit 51.

Paceman Alzarri Joseph claimed four wickets as Sri Lanka was bowled out in 50 overs.

Brisk start

Avishka Fernando and skipper Dimuth Karunaratne gave the hosts a brisk start with a 60-run opening stand before the West Indies struck.

Joseph got Fernando caught behind for 28, and spinner Roston Chase caught and bowled Karunaratne for 44.

Kusal Perera, who made 44, and Mendis then rebuilt the innings during their 89-run stand to take the attack to the opposition.

The in-form Mendis, who hit a century in his team's thrashing of West Indies on Wednesday, completed his 17th ODI fifty before falling to Joseph.

Fast bowler Sheldon Cottrell bowled former captain Angelo Mathews for 12, but the rest of the batsmen kept up the charge.

Breezy stand

Dhanajaya, who completed his fifty in just 45 balls with a boundary off Jason Holder, and Thisara Perera put on 64 runs for the sixth wicket.

Joseph broke the stand with the wicket of De Silva and sent T. Perera back to the pavilion for 38, but the damage had already been done.

The scores: Sri Lanka 307 in 50 overs (Dimuth Karunaratne 44, Kusal Perera 44, Kusal Mendis 55, Dhananjaya de Silva 51, Thisara Perera 38, Alzarri Joseph 4/65) bt West Indies 301/9 in 50 overs (Shai Hope 72, Sunil Ambris 60, Nicholas Pooran 50, Kieron Pollard 49, Fabian Allen 37, Angelo Mathews 3/53).",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/y6vph2/article30958238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02KUSAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sri-lanka-wins-a-thriller-sweeps-series/article30958239.ece

BCCI chief Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah were to attend the ACC meeting.

But, over the last few days, around 730 cases of coronavirus were reported in the UAE, creating panic among travellers and locals.

Ganguly last Friday said that the next Asia Cup will be held in Dubai, paving the way for both India and Pakistan to participate in the continental tournament.

253,2020/03/01,Ranji Trophy semifinal | Porel credits it to the hard yards put in,"Ishan Porel said Ashoke Dinda, sidelined on disciplinary ground, had some inputs.

Promising seamer Ishan Porel, who claimed five wickets to enable Bengal take a substantial 190-run first innings lead over Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy semifinal here on Sunday, credited the hard yards and his growing experience for his fine showing.

“We have to run a lot. There have been four to five running sessions in a week and two-three days of strengthening. I am putting in extra time in the gym. Those things are helping me a lot.

“Am getting more experience after playing 20-odd matches. I am more confident now to pitch the ball up and get the movement. It’s happening naturally,” said Porel.

Porel said Bengal pacers’ team work helped. “If you see the Indian attack, they back and applaud each other’s performance. We are doing the same. The hard work we have put in is paying off.

“When we get the new ball, we go for the kill. If that does not happen, we try to bowl in partnerships and not leak runs.”

Porel said Ashoke Dinda, sidelined on disciplinary ground, had some inputs. “Dinda said, ‘Don’t try too much and bowl in right areas. You will take wickets.’ It helped.”

Porel said keeping K.L. Rahul quiet was an achievement. “He got out to a poor shot because we showed a lot of discipline. He took 67 balls for his 26. It was a big plus for us.”

According to Porel, a 400-plus target would be challenging for Karnataka.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kf3h66/article30957733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02POREL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-semifinal-porel-credits-it-to-the-hard-yards-put-in/article30957734.ece
254,2020/03/01,Ranji Trophy semifinal | Left is right as Saurashtra takes control,"Jackson’s knock of 103 helped Saurashtra post 304 and then the home team bowlers wreaked havoc on Gujarat’s batting line-up.

Left-arm bowlers helped Saurashtra have Gujarat on the mat on the second day of the Ranji Trophy semifinals. The left-armers scalped all but one of the 11 wickets on a day that saw saw only 196 runs scored as Gujarat was reeling at 119 for six, still 185 adrift of Saurashtra’s first innings total of 304.

Despite Sheldon Jackson (103, 204b, 15x4, 2x6) notching up his third hundred of the season and Chirag Jani (29, 123b) lending valuable support in the 103-run partnership for the sixth wicket, the left-armers took over when Jani shouldered arms to Roosh Kalaria.

Lucky break

By then, Jackson — having been given a reprieve by Parthiv Patel on 84 — had completed his 19th First Class hundred with a cut off Arzan Nagwaswalla.

Two overs later, Jackson nicked to Parthiv to give Kalaria another reason to cheer. Nagwaswalla (five for 81) then ensured the tail didn’t wag before left-arm spinner Axar Patel wound up the innings with Parthiv latching on to a difficult chance soon after lunch.

When Gujarat began, the openers’ woeful run continued with Saurashtra’s left-arm pace duo reducing the visitors to one for two in the second over.

Cartwheeling

While Jaydev Unadkat trapped Priyank Panchal in front — a decision that was not reversed by DRS — Chetan Sakariya got one to jag back from outside the off-stump to see Samit Gohel’s off-stump cartwheeling after the batsman had shouldered arms.

Allrounder Prerak Mankad then picked up the only wicket of the day by a right-armer when Bhargav Merai edged to Jackson at second slip.

The left-handed duo of Dhruv Raval (dropped by Harvik Desai off Sakariya at second slip) and captain Parthiv Patel tried to break the shackles with impressive drives and cuts off the pacers but Unadkat induced Raval into a false drive and edge was pouched at slip.

When Dharmendrasinh Jadeja got one to rise on Parthiv in his opening over and the batsman’s cut went straight to point, Gujarat was in disarray.

In his next over, Dharmendrasinh sent back Chirag Gandhi for a duck, thanks to a referral after umpire S. Ravi had failed to spot the inside-edge, to leave Gujarat in trouble at 97 for six.

Allrounder Axar and Rujul Bhatt took the team to stumps without further damage.

255,2020/03/01,ICC Women’s T20 World Cup | England beats West Indies; enters semifinal,"Sophie Ecclestone took her 100th international wicket by dismissing Anisa Mohammed.

Nat Sciver struck a half century before the spinners put up a fine bowling performance to help England seal a semifinal berth with a 46-run win over West Indies in the Women’s T20 World Cup in Sydney on Sunday.

All-rounder Sciver picked up from where she had left off in the last game to score her third half-century of the tournament and help England post 143 for five on a tricky pitch.

In reply, West Indies struggled to get going with the bat and eventually folded for 97 at the Sydney Showground, which was largely thanks to the spin trio of Sophie Ecclestone (3/7), Sarah Glenn (2/16) and Mady Villiers (1/30).

England started afresh with Tammy Beaumont joining Danni Wyatt atop the order, but the move didn’t work as the new opener was trapped in front by Shakera Selman in the very first over.

Wyatt fell to a superb catch in the deep by Hayley Matthews off Anisa Mohammed’s bowling, but in Sciver and captain Heather Knight, England had the best duo to rebuild the innings.

Having scored more than 70 per cent of their team’s runs in the tournament, the importance of Knight and Sciver was not lost on anyone, with the latter reaching her third half-century in four games.

Amy Jones, in a new role at No.6, found back-to-back off-side boundaries off Stafanie Taylor but watched Sciver finally depart for 57 in the same over. Sciver’s knock took her tournament tally to 202 runs in four matches.

Just six balls remained as Brunt joined Jones in the middle, the bowler striking boundaries from the last two balls of the innings to take England to 143 for five.

West Indies also tinkered with their top-order as Deandra Dottin opened, but her innings ended on just nine with Ecclestone having her snaffled at short mid-wicket.

Taylor struck two boundaries off Brunt to end the Powerplay but that was to be her last significant contribution as he was stretchered off the field in the eighth over.

Star leg-spinner Glenn then got into her mojo, bowling out Hayley Matthews to leave West Indies two down in the ninth over.

It was to get even better for the spin unit as off-spinner Villiers bowled a wicket maiden after taking a smart return catch off Shemaine Campbelle.

Lee-Ann Kirby (20) did her best to inject some momentum with towering sixes off Glenn and Villiers, but Anya Shrubsole ended her exploits when the big-hitter was held by Sciver at long-on.

Ecclestone then had Britney Cooper stumped while Villiers effected back-to-back run-outs of Afy Fletcher and Aaliyah Alleyne.

Ecclestone then took her 100th international wicket by dismissing Anisa Mohammed to send England into the last four.

256,2020/03/01,Ranji Trophy semifinal | Karnataka finds Porel a handful,"A total of 15 wickets tumbled on day two as Bengal were 72 for 4 at stumps.

Bengal rode on Ishan Porel’s first five-for of the season to take a firm grip over the Ranji Trophy semifinal against Karnataka at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Sunday.

Porel (five for 39) helped the host bundle out a star-studded Karnataka for a paltry 122, its worst display this season, after Bengal — resuming on 275 for nine — gathered 312 in its first innings.

Bengal, 72 for four in its second essay, enjoyed an overall lead of 262 even as 15 wickets fell on an action-packed second day.

While Anustup Majumdar boosted the Bengal batting, Porel’s contribution was his incisive bowling.

Hitting the right areas and getting good purchase, the lanky bowler cornered success instantly. R. Samarth’s leading edge and captain Karun Nair’s outside edge went to the slips in the first and third overs.

Porel was well supported by the other pacers and some sensational catching.

Karnataka took lunch at 45 for three after K.V. Siddharth fell to Akash Deep. It returned to be all out in less than two sessions.

A consistent Mukesh Kumar bowled Manish Pandey on resumption. Karnataka lost three more wickets in as many overs with Porel, who scalped three for 23 in his second spell, contributing two.

Left-handed Devdutt Padikkal and right-handed S. Sharath edged away-going deliveries, while A. Mithun pulled one to fine-leg for Porel to celebrate his third five-for.

Meanwhile, Mukesh removed a patient K.L. Rahul (26, 67b, 139m, 2x4). Akash, who dismissed an aggressive K. Gowtham (31), returned a three-wicket haul.

257,2020/03/01,Women’s T20 World Cup | Wolvaardt shines against Pakistan as South Africa enters semifinal,"South Africa posted 136 for six thanks to a late flurry from the 20-year-old Wolvaardt who scored 53; Pakistan managed only 119 for five

Laura Wolvaardt scored an unbeaten half-century to help South Africa clinch a semifinal berth with a comfortable 17-run victory against Pakistan in the ICC Women’s World T20 here on Sunday.

South Africa posted 136 for six thanks to a late flurry from the 20-year-old Wolvaardt (53 not out), who hit four boundaries in the final eight balls of the innings.

With Pakistan only managing 119 for five, South Africa earned a third successive win to join India in securing a place in Thursday’s semifinals.

Entering the game after a century against Thailand, Lizelle Lee (4) didn’t last long as Diana Baig picked up a wicket in her first over for the third game running after South Africa opted to bat.

Diana then dismissed Dane van Niekerk (3), who faced 10 balls. Marizanne Kapp ended the Powerplay with a wristy flick for a four as South Africa reached 23 for two.

Mignon du Preez looked assured in advancing to 17 but mistimed her reverse sweep off Nida Dar and played on to make it 54 for three.

Wolvaardt came to the middle and struggled to get going with Kapp (31), who holed out to long-off for teenager Syeda Aroob Shah’s maiden Women’s T20 World Cup wicket.

South Africa’s score ticked past 100 in the 17th over when Sune Luus departed for 12, looping Aiman to Omaima Sohail at point.

Wolvaardt then pierced the gap between two fielders through long-on and twice played over cover.

South Africa maintained the momentum with the ball and dismissed Muneeba Ali (12), who miscued Shabnim Ismail to mid-on in the fourth over.

Van Niekerk was agitated by a pair of misfields in her second over and responded by taking the pace off the ball to trap Nida in front as Pakistan slipped to 26 for three.

Javeria (31) though battled on, picking boundaries in three successive overs, but her 100th T20I ended in cruel fashion when Chloe Tryon deflected Aliya Riaz’s drive onto her stumps.

Aliya couldn’t get going for long and Sidra Nawaz, the wicketkeeper, was clean bowled by Nonkululeko Mlaba in the 15th over to make it 72 for five.

The six-hitting ability of Iram and Aliya kept Pakistan in the game, with both clearing the rope a few times, but their unbeaten 47-run partnership went in vain.

Brief scores:

South Africa: 136 for 2 in 20 overs (Laura Wolvaardt 53 not out, Marizanne Kapp 31; Diana Baig 2-19)

258,2020/03/01,"NZ vs IND: No blame game, says Jasprit Bumrah","Bumrah and Mohammed Shami took seven wickets between themselves to bowl out New Zealand for 235.

Jasprit Bumrah was not willing to put a number on a target the Indian bowlers would fancy defending.

“The remaining three batsmen should bat as long as possible and score as many runs as they can. Then the tail should also contribute,” he said.

Keeping focus

Bumrah said he was happy with his bowling. “I just focus on the process. Some days you get wickets, some days you don’t. I am happy to be back, playing all formats.”

On the surface here, he said, “It’s a hard surface with grass on it. There is movement and bounce for the pacemen. There is reward for if they bowl in good areas.”

After the bowlers brought the Indians back into the Test, the batting collapsed again. Bumrah was not willing to blame the batsmen. “There is no blame game in this team. We fight together.”

Also read: NZ vs IND second Test: Should have stuck at it, says Vihari

Trent Boult was the pick of the seamers for New Zealand with three wickets. “We are enjoying hunting as a pack and moving the ball around,” he said.

He complimented the Indians for bowling well in the first session. “There is always some assistance for the bowlers in the morning here,” he said.

Boult said there was no specific plan for Virat Kohli. “We just wanted to deny him runs and create pressure. He is a great player.”

Fingers crossed

The left-armer had a big smile on his face when asked about the big in-swinger that accounted for Cheteshwar Pujara. “I got the ball to move and nip around,” he said.

On New Zealand chasing a target, Boult said, “I hope I don’t have to put the pads on.”

Nice to see Virat making errors under pressure, says Boult

Forcing a world class batsman like Virat Kohli make errors after piling pressure on him was extremely satisfying, senior New Zealand pacer Trent Boult said on Sunday after his side took control of the second Test.

Boult had figures of 3 for 12 as India were reduced to 90 for six in their second innings for an overall lead of 97 runs at the end of the second day.

The hosts have successfully kept the dangerous Kohli quiet throughout the Test series, as the India skipper failed to reach even 20 runs in the four completed innings.

“He (Kohli) is one of the best players in the world, no doubt about that,” Boult said, when asked about the secret of keeping Kohli under check.

He said his team’s strategy was to put pressure on Kohli by limiting the boundary balls.

“Obviously, he is a big player for them and we just tried to put enough pressure on him, keep him quiet and soak up those boundary balls, and it was nice to see him make a few errors. We were lucky to get two that lined up and hit him on the pads nicely and it was a good feeling to see the back of him.”

Boult also seemed sympathetic with the Indian batting line-up’s woes against moving deliveries.

“Probably, they are used to playing on low and slow pitches in India and it took time for them to get adjusted. Just like if I bowl in India, it will be foreign conditions for me,” Boult said.

The 30-year-old said that conditions were favourable for seam bowling and he didn’t mind that the ball moved around through and through, which resulted in 16 wickets falling on the second day.

“Sixteen wickets, I am not sure if that’s up there with a record in Test cricket in terms of day two but the bowlers obviously pitched the ball up nicely and got rewards. Seeing the ball move around like it did, I feel we are in a decent position,” he said.

He said it augurs well for the team that the entire bowling department was contributing.

“We are all enjoying hunting out there as a pack, getting the ball to move around. I think the bowling unit is very clear about how they are trying to target the opposition.”

259,2020/03/01,NZ vs IND: Indian batsmen flounder as Kiwis exploit the conditions,"A target of 250 in the fourth innings could well be a challenge for the Black Caps.

The message from the second day’s play here was loud and clear. In conditions where the ball seam and bounce, this Indian side does not come close to being a world-beating side.

India is ranked No. 1 in Tests, but the manner in which the batsmen were dismissed in the second innings — undone by the short ball and with their footwork exposed — suggested this side is still on a learning curve in these conditions.

Flurry of wickets

As many as 16 wickets fell as the second Test moved quickly towards an early finish. On a hard pitch with grass cover, the pacemen got bounce and movement.

Only the tenacious Cheteshwar Pujara fell to a ‘beauty’. Trent Boult’s delivery, from round the wicket and wide of the crease, swung in prodigiously to go past the batsman’s defence.

First, India allowed the Kiwi tail to wag — Kyle Jamieson made a valuable 49 — for the host to finish only seven runs short of the Indian first innings score of 242.

Then, India got into all kinds of problems in its second essay to end the day at 90 for six, leading by 97.

It was baffling, why, with almost 30 minutes remaining, India sent Umesh Yadav in as night-watchman. The crafty Boult cleaned him up.

Also read: Jamieson — hungry for more

The batsmen appeared and disappeared. Mayank Agarwal was done in by a Boult delivery that swung in.

Prithvi Shaw was indecisive about swinging at a short-pitched delivery from Tim Southee and was caught out as the ball climbed.

Virat Kohli has not been picking the direction of the seam movement. He succumbed to a Colin de Grandhomme off-cutter after thrusting his pad out.

Ajinkya Rahane, reacting too early to the bounce, ended up hooking a Neil Wagner short ball onto his stumps. It was a bizarre dismissal.

Earlier, Jamieson made vital runs for New Zealand. He is someone with batting potential. He gets behind line, has a reasonable defence, uses his reach and plays his shots.

When New Zealand was 177 for eight and looking like conceding a sizeable lead, Jamieson rallied with Wagner, the 51-run partnership only ending when a leaping Jadeja plucked a catch out of thin air at deep square-leg as Wagner pulled Shami.

Even in seaming conditions, Jadeja was rarely out of the game, picking up a compelling catch at point as B-J. Watling waded into a well-pitched-up delivery from Bumrah.

Then, Jadeja had the key man, Ross Taylor, jumping out and trying to hit against the turn; he was well held by Umesh at backward point. The left-armer pulled his weight again, getting one to straighten at de Grandhomme, who looked threatening with his strokes.

The Indians were buzzing in the morning, striking early, making use of the conditions. Umesh seamed one back to win a marginal leg-before decision over Tom Blundell.

Indian surge

That was the beginning of the Indian surge. The Indian pacemen were incisive, bowling in better areas, too.

Bumrah seamed the ball from a good length.

There was bounce for him as well. It was this combination of away movement and bounce that fetched Bumrah the big fish — Kane Williamson.

Mohammed Shami was running in to a good rhythm and that was not good news for the Kiwis. Much of the paceman’s bowling hinges on the fluency of his run-up.

Tom Latham shouldered arms to a delivery outside off but saw the ball nipping back to disturb woodwork.

The left-handed Latham (52) had struck the ball crisply on both sides of the pitch, but left the arena shell-shocked.

Then, Shami found the edge of the left-handed Henry Nicholls for Kohli to pluck a fine diving catch at second slip. It took several replays before third umpire Aleem Dar was convinced the catch had been taken cleanly.

A dramatic day of fortune swings it was.

Pace trio of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav came out all guns blazing as India reduced New Zealand to 142 for five at lunch on day two of the second Test on Sunday.

New Zealand scored 79 runs in the session but Bumrah (1/35 off 15 overs) and Mohammed Shami (2/45 in 15 overs) kept up the pressure with good support from Umesh Yadav (1/32 in 14 overs), who also took a fine catch running backwards off Ravindra Jadeja’s (1/10 in 4 overs) bowling.

At the break, BJ Watling (0) and Colin de Grandhomme (8) were at the crease with the hosts trailing by 100 runs.

India had scored 242 in their first innings.

For New Zealand, Tom Latham (52 off 122 balls) scored a gritty half-century but never looked settled since the start of the morning session as Bumrah beat him on multiple occasions.

The pace trio hit the right length from the start with Yadav removing Tom Blundell (30 off 77 balls) with one that came back in with the angle as the bowler went slightly wide off crease.

Bumrah, who was deadly since morning, then removed Kane Williamson (3). The New Zealand skipper was caught in two minds to a delivery that jagged back and took the outside edge when he went for a half-hearted jab.

Ross Taylor (15) lost his patience and stepped out to hit Jadeja against the turn and the ball ballooned towards backward point with Yadav taking a well-judged catch. Shami, who has been off-colour in this tour so far, was finally back in the mix when he deceived Latham with a classic.

The left-hander was prodding to the away going deliveries and the wily speedster got one to move in. The opener shouldered his arms, not factoring in the late movement which disturbed the stumps.

Shami then got the jittery Henry Nicholls (14) with a delivery that bounced a shade more and the thick edge was taken superbly by a diving Virat Kohli at second slip.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/4kbosz/article30955382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWZEALANDINDIACRICKET,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nz-vs-ind-second-test-indian-bowlers-hit-back-with-5-wickets-before-lunch-on-day-2/article30955386.ece
262,2020/03/01,Board exams to resume in northeast Delhi; affected students can still get postponement: CBSE,"This relief is available for examinations scheduled until March 7. The examinations are due to continue until March 30.

Board examinations in northeast Delhi are set to resume their normal schedule from Monday, but the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has offered a lifeline for those students who have been affected by the violence there, promising to conduct the examinations again for them on a different date.

They have been told to contact their own school principals to avail such relief.

This relief is available for examinations scheduled until March 7. The examinations are due to continue until March 30.

In a circular issued by CBSE secretary Anurag Tripathi on Sunday afternoon, the Board explained how it has been caught between two difficult realities with regard to examination scheduling in the wake of the violence.

It had postponed the board examinations from February 26 to 29 in up to 86 centres in East and North East districts.

""The Board is of the view that further delay in conducting Class XII examinations may hamper the chances of admissions in professional courses i.e. medical, engineering, law and other UG admissions. Few entrance examinations are conducted in accordance with the timelines fixed by the Hon’ble Courts and therefore dates are sacrosanct,"" said the CBSE circular, noting that the prestigious JEE (Main) examination is scheduled to begin on April 3.

""The Board is also clear that for candidates who are in a position to appear for the board examinations, it would be very stressful and cause immense anxiety if the examinations are further postponed.""

It added that the Delhi Police is making sure security arrangements are in place for the examinations to be held safely. The Delhi State government has closed all schools - which also act as examination centres - until March 7.

However, CBSE admitted that some students are in especially ""difficult circumstances"".

Ground reports show that some students have been directly affected by the violence, with family members who may have been injured or killed. Others have seen their homes destroyed or have had to flee their neighbourhoods, and have lost their textbooks and admit cards in the process. Riots and curfews have exacerbated fear, tension and mental stress among students, who may be in need of counselling.

""The incidents that have unfolded in the last few days have affected some of our students...CBSE is prepared to hold examinations at a later date for such candidates who would not be able to appear for the examinations upto 07.3.2020,"" said the circular, adding that school principals and the Delhi Directorate of Education are requested to provide the lists of such students to the Board.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/2d7ibp/article30957351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SCHOOLKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/board-exams-to-resume-in-northeast-delhi-affected-students-can-still-get-postponement-cbse/article30957352.ece
263,2020/03/01,"Delhi violence | Situation eases, police quell rumours","At least eight people remain unaccounted for in the affected areas.

No fresh cases of violence were reported in the national capital on Sunday, a week after riots erupted in the northeastern areas.

Though four more bodies were recovered, the death toll that stood at 42 on February 28, has not been officially revised.

Even as those hit by the worst communal violence in the city since 1984 tried to pick up the pieces of their lives, at least eight people remain unaccounted for in the affected areas. Rumours of fresh violence briefly created panic in some areas in the evening but the Delhi police quickly quelled them.

Responding quickly to the volatile situation, the police tweeted: “It is to reiterate that these are all rumours.”

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, which announced the closure of entry and exit gates of seven Metro stations due to “security reasons”, reopened them within 45 minutes.

Stating that unsubstantiated reports of tension in the South East and West District were being circulated on social media, police said: “It is to reiterate that these are all rumours. Don’t pay attention to such rumours. Delhi Police is closely monitoring accounts spreading rumours and taking action.”

The police said a total of 254 FIRs have been registered in various police stations of the North East district so far with all cases related to the riots that started on February 23. Delhi Police PRO M.S. Randhawa said 41 cases had been registred under the Arms Act and a total of 903 persons had been detained, including arrested persons.

“We have received no PCR calls of rioting in the last four days. Situation is normal and under control in all violence-affected areas,” said Mr. Randhawa.

Delhi violence | Agonising wait at mortuary for missing kin | | A foot, a missing boy and bodies — the remains of the day

During the day, traffic was plying and several stores, which had been shut for a week, reopened in the riot-hit North East district of the capital. With a reduced deployment of security personnelcompared to the last few days, many residents ventured out of their homes for the first time. Shop owners reported that goods for sale were in short supply and some stores had reportedly hiked up prices.

The crowd outside GTB hospital’s mortuary however, showed no sign of thinning with families still desperately trying to locate “missing” relatives.

There was heavy police presence and barricading at Shaheen Bagh on Sunday as a precautionary measure after a right-wing outfit, the Hindu Sena, called for a clearing of the road where protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) have been sitting since December 16. The group, however, later said it had called off the “clearance call” in view of the “ongoing law and order situation” in the Capital.

The Delhi police imposed Section 144 in the area due to which a peace march planned on Sunday afternoon by the protesters of Shaheen Bagh “in deep mourning for the lives lost” and to show solidarity with all those effected by “inhumane violence” had to be called off.

The Shaheen Bagh march being called off was in sharp contrast to a march through Connaught Place on Saturday under the banner “Delhi Peace Forum” by several pro-CAA, right-wing outfits. The march which went through the heart of Delhi saw “provocative slogans” being raised. The Delhi police meanwhile said no permission had been granted for the march.

264,2020/03/01,Riot-affected lose source of livelihood,"Victims line up outside SDM office to collect government compensation

Several people on Saturday queued up at North East Delhi Sub-Divisional Magistrate’soffice following Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement of compensation to be given families of those who died in the recent violence.

From people who lost their shops in the violence to others who were the sole-earning members of the family, victims recounted how the “backbones are gone”.

Imran Khan, who ran a pathlab in Gokulpuri area narrated that all that remains of his medical store is broken doors and devices.

‘The only hope’

The 29-year-old who started the business in the area two years ago, said, “Our backbone is completely broken. I had quit my job and started this business as I wanted to do something of my own. But now all that is gone. How do I even think of resuming it? If at all we get the compensation, I can still think of something, but as of now, it looks like I have to start job-hunting again. Everything is finished.”

Rafique, a resident of Khajuri area, said that he lost approximately ₹3.5 lakh when his scrap business was gutted in the riots. “Around 2.30 p.m. on Monday, my shop got burnt down. I got a call from a tea stall owner stationed opposite to my shop who said that the mob has broken the locks of my shop. All that is left are the electric wires... the counter, bulbs, tubes, everything is gone. I have a family of seven and I am the only earning member. People said there were outsiders and that “ab toh kuch nahi hoga.” What do I do now? How am I supposed to raise my kids without work?” the 52-year-old said.

Similarly, for Sanjay Kumar Goyal, owner of a medical shop in Khajuri, this was the only source of income. “When the violence started I shut the shop and ran away. A few hours later, around 4 p.m. on Monday, it was vandalised and gutted. I had been running the shop for the last 16-17 years. Our lives are in God’s hands now,” Mr. Goyal said.

69 forms received

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the 69 families whose forms were received by authorities will be given a compensation of ₹25,000 as an emergency measure for help.

“We have already received 69 forms for the emergency financial aid needed by affected families and all of them will receive the help in cash between late tonight [Saturday] and Sunday morning so that these families can start restoring their lives. Priority is being given to families who have lost a member, is deeply injured or the house mostly burnt down,” said Mr. Kejriwal.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/i9viwv/article30954159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29DELPRIYAVIOLENCEFORM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/riot-affected-lose-source-of-livelihood/article30954160.ece
265,2020/03/01,Delhi govt. steps in to curb hate messages,"AAP govt. to issue WhatsApp number

Delhi government will release a WhatsApp number in which people can forward messages that they find online, which could potentially lead to a communal flair up, along with details of the person who shared the “inflammatory” message, said a Delhi government official.

The moves comes in the backdrop of the communal violence that took place in parts of northeast Delhi, in which 42 people have lost their lives since last Sunday.

“There is a lot of rumours still circulating on social media which is communal in nature and this is our attempt to curb it,” the official said.

Check authenticity

The government will check the authenticity of the complaints raised by people and then forward it to the Delhi Police.

“We will also follow it up with the police to make sure that they take action against it,” the official said.

The government is expected to release the number early next week.

Three appeals

“We will tell three things to the public. First, we will appeal to them not to forward every message they get. Second, we will tell them that forwarding such material can land any person in jail for up to three years under IPC 153A and 505C and IT act 66A. And third, we will urge them to forward such messages to us, along with details of the sender,” the official said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-govt-steps-in-to-curb-hate-messages/article30954146.ece
266,2020/03/01,Govt. to set up control room at Secretariat to tackle air pollution,"Planning is still in the preliminary stage, says govt. official

The Delhi government is planning to set up a control room, in the Environment Ministry at the Secretariat, to monitor air pollution and take quick actions, according to officials privy to the development.

Environment Minister Gopal Rai had also told a group of experts and officials in a conference earlier this week that the government is trying to set up a “control room” to handle “environment issues”, said the people who were part of the conference. “We are planning to set up the control room and discussions are going on about it, but it is still in the preliminary stage,” a government official privy to the development told The Hindu.

The official said that the Washington University at St. Louis, which is conducting a study on real-time sources of air pollution in the city, will submit its report in March and the control room would be established after it. “The idea is to respond quickly to air pollution depending on the sources of air pollution. We will have some staff dedicated to the control room,” the official added.

Programme details

Another official said that the control room will monitor other types of pollution also on “different screens”. It will also have details of different environment-related programmes being carried out by other organisations.

Mr. Rai had chaired the conference with experts from different institutes, including IIT-Delhi and IIT-Kanpur, on Thursday and the Environment Department will submit suggestions from the experts to the Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday or Wednesday. “The control room will also be discussed in the meeting and more details will emerge only after the meeting,” the government official said.

An aim to reduce air pollution to 1/3rd of the present level, in the course of next five years, was part of the 10-point ‘Kejriwal Ka Guarantee Card’ released by the Chief Minister in the run-up to the 2020 Delhi Assembly elections.

After coming back to power, the AAP government has said that implementing the promises in the guarantee card is their top priority.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/870j9l/article30954141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29DELPRIYAPOLLUTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/govt-to-set-up-control-room-at-secretariat-to-tackle-air-pollution/article30954142.ece
267,2020/03/01,‘Staying close to neighbourhood gives hope’,"Residents of violence-affected areas don’t prefer shifting to relief camps provided by government

While the Delhi government has set up relief camps for the north-east Delhi riot victims, several residents of the violence-hit areas on Saturday said that they preferred to stay in the neighbourhood instead of shifting to the camps.

With several NGOs and other private organisations providing relief material and basic supplies to the bylanes and interiors of many of the riot-hit colonies, many of those who have taken shelter in places close to their respective localities said that “moving further away from their homes” was not something they were willing to do at the moment.

Across the road from Shiv Vihar, several residents of the area who have taken refuge in the Indra Vihar area said that being “closer home” is what they wanted.

Bilkis, one of those who have taken refuge there said, “Our homes have been gutted. We have nothing left. We fled and took shelter here on Tuesday night and have not been able to go back home to even check if any of our belongings are left. Here we are getting supplies and volunteers are coming with help. We do not want to go anywhere else. Staying close to the neighbourhood at least gives us hope that we can visit home soon.”

The night shelter in Pushta Usmanpur, which is one of the camps listed by the government, has not seen any of the victims moving in yet.

‘Unwilling to come’

Sarvesh Pandey and Danish, the caretakers at the night shelter said, “Even though the situation is very bad, it does not look like anyone is willing to come here right now. However, if they want they can always come and take shelter here. As of now, the regulars who stay here are the only ones present.”

Meanwhile, after reviewing the relief and rehabilitation work, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to victims to return to their homes. “We request all those who have left their homes to return to their houses and live with their community with love and brotherhood. Our biggest objective is to normalise the lives of the people affected in the violence,” Mr. Kejriwal said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/q7vumy/article30954129.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29DELPRIYARIOTSAFFECTED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/staying-close-to-neighbourhood-gives-hope/article30954130.ece
268,2020/03/01,"In times of business as unusual, workers return to Labour Chowk","‘We were out of work since Monday and stepped out just to feed their families’

Pramod Kumar (45) and Parvez (48), both daily wage labourers, came looking for work at 7 a.m. and were sitting idle on a footpath in north-east Delhi’s Brahmpuri till afternoon. They remained indoors after the violence broke out and stepped out to the Labour Chowk only on Saturday as they didn’t have money left to feed their families.

Pramod has to take care of his wife and four children who reside in a rented accommodation in Sonia Vihar. He, like many others, earns ₹500 a day as is the wage decided for labourers in the area. However, from Monday, he hasn’t earned a penny and wasn’t sure if he would get work.

“People are not coming to this area to hire labourers because they are also scared. Hardly three-four people came since morning and they were not willing to pay ₹500 because they know that we’ll agree to a lesser amount because of lack of work,” he said.

Scared of what might happen to them, more than half the labourers left for their villages. A few The Hindu spoke to said that they didn’t leave because their children study here and their livelihood is in Delhi.

Among the worst affected by riots in the Capital were also labourers.

Raees (40), a resident of Brahmpuri, claimed that he had to borrow money from a neighbour to feed his two children and wife because he didn’t earn anything since Monday.

“Roti khana bhi mushkil ho gaya hai. Ek baar kha rahe hain [It’s become difficult to eat also. We are having a proper meal once a day],” claimed Mohammed Arfin, who resides in a rented accommodation for ₹3,000 a month and is from Bihar.

Quite apprehensive

What has also become a worry for labourers is who their temporary employer is going to be. Both Madan Lal and Arfin said that while they won’t deny work, they are apprehensive to be hired by a Muslim or Hindu employer respectively.

“Pata nahin jo leke jaaye vo kaisa ho, kya kare [We don’t know what kind of person will he be or what he does],” they said.

“But we all stay here as brothers. We have worked together for so many years,” they added.

Mohammed Syed, who lives alone in the city in a rented accommodation, said that for three days starting Monday, he barely ate because the hotel he used to eat was shut and the local grocery shop owners had increased the prices of items. “Price of samosa increased from ₹5 to ₹10, potato from ₹20 to ₹30 and of rice from ₹30 to ₹35. The shopkeepers said that they were getting it for higher prices because of the riots due to which they increased the prices,” he said.

A few kilometres ahead, 19-year-old Rahi sat on a bike outside his street and whiled away time with his friends. He works in a factory in Haryana and resides in Brahmpuri. “I had come last weekend but then situation got violent. I called my employer and told him that I won’t be able to come,” he said.

Many in the area shared the same emotion and said that they haven’t gone for work in nearby areas because they feared for their lives.

Shehzaade, an e-rickshaw driver, said, “I am very scared. I don’t know what kind of people will come as passengers. I won’t go till the situation is completely normal.”

Shops open shutters

In New Seelampur, many shops were seen opened on Saturday morning. The area is replete with shops owned by both Hindus and Muslims with employees from both communities.

Nitin Jain, owner of a metal sheet shop, said that he has six employees, including one from the Muslim community, who along with four others had turned up for work. “Jabbar has been working for me for 10 years. We have opened the shop today [Saturday] only and he has come. Two of my Hindu employees have gone back to their village because of the situation,” he said.

Jabbar Shah, while cutting metal sheets, said, “My parents in Bihar called me to return home, but I didn’t go because I feel safe in Nitin bhaiya’s presence.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/9hhika/article30954112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL01-LABOURERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/in-times-of-business-as-unusual-workers-return-to-labour-chowk/article30954113.ece
269,2020/03/01,‘All we want is to go back and see our burnt houses’,"Victims in Shiv Vihar claim area ‘still not safe’ to venture out

All that 69-year-old Ramzana wants is to go back to her vandalised and burnt house and see what remains of it. She hasn’t been able to go back to her Shiv Vihar residence, where she had been living for decades, since Wednesday.

Ramzana and hundreds others who resided in Shiv Vihar have taken refuge in Indra Vihar, across the road, in houses of people who have opened their doors for the victims. Their houses were burnt and looted by a mob earlier this week.

“When we tried to go back, security personnel deployed outside the street said that you can go at your own risk. We haven’t been able to go to our own houses,” Ramzana said.

Ahmadeen alias Guddu who ran an electrical shop close to his residence in Shiv Vihar said that he has little knowledge ofwhat remains in his house and shop. “My mother is diabetic, I had gone to get her medicines and some clothes but no security officer escorted me despite repeated requests. I returned. Half an hour later, I heard that a group of people misbehaved with a few who had gone to check on their houses,” Ahmadeen claimed, adding that some women were escorted by security personnel to their houses.

Recalling events

Around 20 women and children sat huddled up in a corner of a dimly lit room. They have been there for the last four days, they said.

While recounting the events which led them to take shelter in Indra Vihar, 45-year-old Mumtaz showed a large hole in the dupatta she wore; “Look at what happened when they were throwing acid...the signs are still here,” she said.

“We ran to save our lives leaving behind all our belongings. Both my husband and daughter are currently being treated for acid injuries. There is still no word on whether he’ll be able to get his eyesight back as his eyes are still bleeding. Look at what we have been reduced to,” she added.

A resident of Shiv Vihar, 32-year-old Zahida claimed that the area “is still not safe” to venture out to visit their homes.

“We have been here since Tuesday and have not been able to go back to even collect our belongings, or whatever is left. Soon after we fled, some of the neighbours informed us and showed pictures of how our houses have been gutted. Even today when a couple tried to go back home to check, they were threatened by some people and sent back. What are we supposed to do? People are saying that everything is fine now. But if it was indeed “all fine” then why would we still be here?” Ms. Zahida said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lublyf/article30954099.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL01-SHIVVIHAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/all-we-want-is-to-go-back-and-see-our-burnt-houses/article30954100.ece
270,2020/03/01,"Delhi Police failed to assess ground situation in time, says State BJP chief","Tiwari blames AAP, Cong. for not helping in defusing violence

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari expressed “deep sorrow” on Saturday over the loss of lives in the violence earlier this week and claimed the police “failed” to gauge the magnitude of the situation in time.

He accused non-BJP parties of playing a “negative” role in light of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that “snowballed into violence” in north-east Delhi.

“I don’t know what to say. Loss of so many lives is a matter of deep sorrow. It appears that the police also failed to assess the ground situation in time. It could have prevented loss of so many lives,” the Lok Sabha MP said.

He, however, asserted that the Delhi Police brought the situation under “control” as soon as 73 companies of additional forces were deployed in the riot-hit areas on February 24.

271,2020/03/01,Youth held for spreading rumours about violence,"He told police ‘three injured in clashes’

A 19-year-old youth has been arrested for allegedly spreading rumours regarding communal tension in the city, the police said on Saturday.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said the accused has been identified as Rahul Kumar from Sainik Farms.

The police said they received a PCR call on Friday night stating that a quarrel has broken out between two communities in Neb Sarai and three persons have been injured in the incident.

Caller not found

“On reaching the spot, the police could not find the caller. When contacted, the mobile phone was found to be initially busy and then switched off,” Mr. Thakur said.

The police said the forestland area was checked but it was also peaceful. There was no quarrel because of the construction of a mosque as mentioned in the call. “During enquiry, it was learnt that no one was injured and the situation was normal and peaceful,” the officer said.

It was ascertained that the caller concealed his identity and gave false information with the intention to cause problems in the area, the police said, adding that a case under relevant sections was then registered.

With the help of technical and human surveillance, the accused was traced and arrested.

272,2020/03/01,"A foot, a missing boy and bodies — the remains of the day","As violence ebbs, life comes to a standstill for family members waiting outside Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital mortuary

The Capital may be limping back to “normalcy” after three days of violence that wreaked havoc across north-east Delhi, but time has come to a standstill for the families of those killed in the communal clashes.

Even though the violence has ebbed, the scene at Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital mortuary — where a majority of the bodies of those taken in by the unbridled violence and arson is kept — is sombre. Meanwhile, several family members remain stranded in the midst of an endless wait to claim the mortal remains of their loved ones.

A foot, all that is left

For Shiv Vihar resident Saleem Qassar, all that remains of his elder brother is a foot. He said he did not have the courage to ask whether it was the left foot or the right one. He said his 58-year-old brother Anwar was gunned down and thrown into a raging fire on Tuesday morning.

A few shops opened after three days in Jaffrabad on Saturday.

“My brother was shot twice and burnt alive in front of my eyes. He was pushed into a fire after being shot and when he tried to get up, he was shot again. Of his body, only one foot remains which was picked up from the spot and ended up at this hospital. We identified it through the peculiar shape of his nails and his characteristically cracked heels,” he said. He added that the family intends to bury his brother’s foot according to religious conventions after it is handed over to them.

“I had no option but escaping to one of my Hindu neighbour’s houses who took me, my wife and children and my brother’s only child – his daughter – in. They put tilak on our foreheads and gave us saffron safas to wear on our heads to pass us off as Hindus... had they not sheltered us to 12 hours, none of us would have been alive,” he added.

Others like Mohammad Qadir from Bijnore remained suspended between hope and grief as they saw one unidentified body after the other across hospitals, seeking to track the missing family members. In Mr. Qadir’s case, his 18-year-old brother Mohammad Aftab remains untraceable since Sunday.

According to GTB Hospital authorities, 41 patients have been admitted so far and no new deaths or cases have been reported on Saturday.

While a few patients had been examined since morning, none required admission and ICU patients were stable but still not out of danger, they said. All but six bodies, however, have undergone post-mortem examination and handed over to their respective family members.

Three days in relief camp

Mr. Qadir has been sleeping at a relief camp set up by the authorities for three consecutive nights. He sets out daily to find his brother, Aftab. “We have checked everywhere but there is still no trace of him,” Mr. Qadir said, adding that he is scared of going to Shiv Vihar – where his brother was last spotted.

As reported by The Hindu on February 27, Aftab has been missing since Tuesday after having come to Delhi for a welding job.

‘Checked all places’

“I have checked all the hospitals, camps, and approached the police multiple times but they ask me to visit the police station near Shiv Park. Aftab was intercepted and beaten up by a mob with sticks while shopping at a local supplies store in Shiv Park, according to his friends. I am afraid to go there...I will not set foot in that area,” he said.

Meanwhile, Ram Kumar Paswan, a rickshaw puller, was among those awaiting possession of their family members’ remains. Mr. Paswan’s 15-year-old son Nitin had stepped out of his Gokalpuri residence to buy noodles on February 25 and never returned.

“I don’t know what he was hit with in the head — whether it was a bullet or a stone — but he didn’t return home. Someone told me to check here at the hospital after we couldn’t find him on our own for over two days. I came here on Thursday and identified the body. He was brought here alive but died during treatment. He was about to be promoted to Class IX,” Mr. Paswan said.

Jaajma, the mother of 22-year-old Mohammad Monis, a daily wage labourer from Usmanpur, burst into tears after identifying his charred body at the mortuary.

Monis’ cousin had first gone to identify the body, failing which Ms. Jaajma went in.

“He was going to Samaipur Badli to work on his uncle’s construction project... he said we didn’t have any reason to fear because he would make sure he didn’t provoke the rioters but they killed him,” Ms. Jaajma cried.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/31p5ka/article30954006.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29JAAJMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/a-foot-a-missing-boy-and-bodies-the-remains-of-the-day/article30954010.ece

274,2020/03/01,Imparting knowledge,"Thirumoolar says in the introductory portion of his Thirumandiram, that of Lord Siva’s eight students, Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana and Sanatkumara were teachers to the rest of the world. They had realisation about God and wanted the world to benefit from their knowledge, said R. Narayanan, in a discourse. Thirumoolar says that Siva, the One without births and deaths, does not show His limitless greatness easily to anyone. But He revealed it to these four sages and to Sivayoga muni, Vyagrapada, Patanjali, and Thirumoolar. Sanaka, Sanatana, Sanandana and Sanatkumara would never part from Lord Siva even for a second.

So, the Lord said that even when the whole world was destroyed in the great deluge, these four sages would be able to continue worshipping Him. Thirumoolar says that with thoughts of Siva always in his mind, he will tell the world about the Saiva Agamas. This does not mean that Thirumoolar was offering a translation of the Agama texts from Sanskrit to Tamil. Through Lord Siva’s grace, he obtained knowledge of the Agamas, and so, his sayings were original and not reproductions. Thirumoolar says that after he visited Chidambaram and saw the dance of Nataraja, he had no desire to live. And yet he lived for one crore yugas! Here ‘one crore’ should not be interpreted literally. It should be taken to mean many years. Sekkizhar, in his Peria Puranam, says that Thirumoolar lived for 3000 years, although this number is not mentioned by Thirumoolar himself anywhere in his work. As in the case of all saints, the Lord’s purpose in sending them into this world, is to get across spiritual messages to the people, and this was true of Thirumoolar too. In a verse, Tirumoolar says God sent Him to this earth, so that he (Thirumoolar) could speak in Tamil about His greatness.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/imparting-knowledge/article30957623.ece

276,2020/03/01,Injured flamingo rescued,"Four Greater Flamingos from Gujarat landed near Chellanam a few months ago

A Greater Flamingo, which was found injured at Kandakadavu near Chellanam, was rescued on Sunday.

The bird was spotted by some members of the Nature Club Team, Kumbalanghi, who took it to a private veterinary care facility in the city.

The left wing of the bird was found fractured and in a necrotised condition with less blood supply to lower area. It was administered antibiotics, painkillers and drips, said S. Sunilkumar, the veterinary surgeon who treated the bird.

The bird was stabilised and a temporary wing bandage was applied. Once the condition improves, intramedullary pinning for repairing the broken bone will be carried out. Otherwise, the injured wing may have to be amputated, the doctor said.

The bird might have got entangled in some nylon strings drawn across the shrimp farms and fractured its wings, said N.X. Robin, a member of the club, who was involved in the rescue operations.

At the same time, R. Mahesh, a birder from Thripunithura, had spotted the sick bird in the area a couple of days ago. The bird was returned to the place after being treated at a veterinary hospital. Three more individuals of the species are still there in the area, said Mr. Mahesh.

Four birds of the species had reached the area a few months ago. They might have travelled all the way from Gujrat to Kochi and are likely to return shortly, said a birder.

The bird was shifted to the animal rescue centre of the Forest and Wildlife Department at Kodanad.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/wlgefz/article30958190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ki02bird,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/injured-flamingo-rescued/article30958191.ece
277,2020/03/01,"Politics of hatred driving Indian society, says Tharoor","‘Country’s socio-economic situation extremely worrying’

The Indian society is being divided and driven by a politics which is built on a narrative based on division and hatred, Shashi Tharoor, MP, has said.

Mr. Tharoor was delivering a lecture on ‘Uncovering India’s socio-economic situation’ organised by the Indo-Japan Chamber of Commerce Kerala and Alumni Society of AOTS Kerala here on Saturday.

He said that the country was in need of a government that accepted the precarious economic situation and prepared to work with all stakeholders, not just the opposition and its wise heads like Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram but with State governments, private sector, businesses, civil society, academics, and the media in a manner that encouraged deliberations and discussions that welcomed dissent in formulating an economic policy that might work. “Sadly, that is not the case with the government that is in power today. There is no welcome of dissent but there’s a crackdown on dissent. There is no interest in discussion because the government believes that it is the repository of all wisdom and therefore there are no deliberations that go beyond mere slogans,” Mr. Tharoor said.

He said that the frustration and rage of captains of Indian industry at the government was so extreme that it was difficult to believe. The country’s socio-economic situation was extremely worrying and some would say that what was even more worrying was the picture facing the nation like the divisions, politics, nationhood, and the introduction of religion in determining citizenship that people were really questioning what it really meant to be a citizen of India.

When asked about the continuing popularity of the Prime Minister despite allegedly ridiculous decisions like demonetisation, Mr. Tharoor urged the people of the country to look at themselves and ask whether they were swayed by the propaganda about ancient glory, national security and 56-inch chest.

“Unfortunately, the people of India have voted for this government. Every country gets the leadership it deserves. The sad truth is that many people are voting against their own self interests and are doing so for reasons that have got nothing to do with the economy,” Mr. Tharoor observed.

Earlier, speaking at the plenary session of Reflections, the annual conference of Rotary International District 320, he said it was not a Hindu duty to hate other religions. Everyone should be ready to give up on narrow thinking. Relationships were paramount, he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/politics-of-hatred-driving-indian-society-says-tharoor/article30953543.ece

The anti-labour policies of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government will be taken up for detailed discussions at the national centenary conference of the All India Trade Union Congress to be held in Alappuzha from April 2 to 5.

The Union government was trying to deny workers their rights across various sectors and it would be taken up for discussions at the centenary conference, said Wahida Nizam, national secretary of AITUC, here on Saturday.

279,2020/03/01,Operation Breakthrough to focus on canal rejuvenation in phase two,"33 projects identified for works worth ₹20 crore

The district administration has identified 33 canal rejuvenation works worth ₹20 crore for the second phase of Operation Breakthrough initiative to resolve the city’s persistent waterlogging issues.

Thirty six works were completed in the first phase of the project that was launched after the city was fully waterlogged on several days during the monsoon last year.

S. Shajahan, Deputy Collector and nodal officer of the project, said that about ₹16 crore had been spent to complete the 36 works in the first phase. The focus of the second phase was on canal rejuvenation, he said.

Mr. Shajahan said that the proposed works in the second phase would come under the purview of the Disaster Management Act. Some of the canals in which rejuvenation projects would be implemented include Changadampokku thodu, Karanakkodam, Thevara-Perandoor and Edappally canals, he said.

The high-level monitoring committee formed as part of the initiative has suggested that the Kochi Corporation carry out de-silting of canals and drains. Such works, which were the responsibility of the civic body, were undertaken by the district administration in the first phase.

The corporation would have to undertake de-silting works as per the new arrangement, said officials.

District Collector S. Suhas on Saturday informed T.J. Vinod, MLA, and corporation councillors that the works under Operation Breakthrough would be completed before the start of the rainy season. Works were not fixed as per divisions under the civic body. The effort was to clear waterlogging across the city, he said.

Mr. Suhas said water flow had to be ensured and choked canals must be cleared. The directives given by the High Court had been taken into account while finalising works, he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/7z8h7c/article30953524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29ki-Breakthrough,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/operation-breakthrough-to-focus-on-canal-rejuvenation-in-phase-two/article30953525.ece
280,2020/03/01,"Dug-up roads in Kochi, suburban towns add to commuters’ woes","Trenched Vennala-Palachuvadu road not properly restored; KWA, KSEB under fire

The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) and Kerala Water Authority (KWA) are indiscriminately trenching arterial and other busy roads in Kochi and suburban towns after a lull, causing severe inconvenience to motorists and pedestrians.

The KSEB has trenched vast many roads in Palarivattom and in the vicinity of its Kaloor sub station, apart from a few other places in the city. The Vennala-Palachuvadu road that it trenched in mid-2019 to lay cables has not been properly restored, despite causing accidents and traffic disruptions. Dust emanating from dug-up stretches is another problem, causing respiratory problems to road users, residents and merchants.

The situation is such that people do not get to commute through good roads, since they are dug up during summer months and develop potholes during monsoon months.

Accidents

“Bus operators and two-wheeler riders are among the worst affected by the malady that roads in the district are witnessing, be it rain or shine,” said K.M. Navas, secretary of Kochi-based Kerala Bus Transport Association (KBTA). “Arterial roads dug up by KWA and KSEB have become all-too common in the city and suburbs like Aluva. Two-wheeler riders and others often brake suddenly or swerve to evade them, resulting in accidents. The KWA did not temporarily restore them well, even during Shivaratri, worsening snarls.”

Over half a dozen two-wheeler riders lost their life last year in the district in accidents related to dug-up or potholed roads.

Fed up with apathy of the two agencies and the PWD’s inordinate delay in resurfacing them, bus operators sent videos and photos of such corridors to the amicus curiae appointed by the Kerala High Court to file a report on the plight of Kochi’s roads. “On its part, the PWD must urgently procure a mobile patchwork repairing unit to restore roads before their condition turns from bad to worse. It can thus save the money and effort in restoring a bigger area,” Mr. Navas said.

Responding to the issue, a top KSEB official said the work on the gas-insulated sub station had necessitated digging up of roads at Kaloor, Palarivattom and other places. The work would go on till May-June, he added.

The roads dug up by KWA which have not been restored include Vyttila-Ponnurunni road, Narayanan Asan Road and the Alinchuvadu-Vennala road which is currently being trenched to lay pipelines under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation project being implemented by KWA. “Roads in Vyttila were handed over to PWD in January. Apparently, works related to Indian Navy delayed the resurfacing process,” said a KWA official.

The 1.5-km-long pipeline work in the Alinchuvadu-Vennala road (which runs parallel to NH Bypass) might be completed only by mid-April. Interconnection and testing work may take more time. Instructions would be issued to the contractor to temporarily restore the road for movement of vehicles in either direction, he said.

The PWD (roads wing) has begun restoration work of Vyttila-Ponnurunni road. “The KSEB has a week’s time more to complete cabling work in the Vennala-Palachuvadu corridor, following which the roads will be resurfaced. We have directed them to frequently sprinkle water on the dug up portion to curtail dust,” said sources in PWD.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/aswq85/article30953519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01KIROAD1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/dug-up-roads-in-kochi-suburban-towns-add-to-commuters-woes/article30953520.ece

Kamil Siedcynski, a student of Masters in Comparative Literature in Jadavpur University has been asked to leave India.

The Foreign Regional Registration Office (FRRO), which comes under the Union Home Ministry, handed the notice to Mr. Seidcynski asking him to leave India within 15 days for violating the terms of his visa.

“He's a fine scholar who does a wonderful job of translating Polish folktales directly to Bangla compared to European translations [that] usually work which is through English,” said Samantak Das, senior professor at the Department of Comparative Literature.

Earlier, a Bangladeshi student at Visva-Bharati in Shantiniketan, was asked to leave the country by the FRRO. The notice to both Mr. Siedcynski and the Bangladeshi student accused them of “anti-government activities” but did not clarify the exact nature of allegations. Allegedly, the Bangladeshi student joined the protests organised by the students and a section of Visva-Bharati teachers against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and posted images on social media.

Expressing concern over the communal clashes in Delhi, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen said on Saturday that India is a secular country and people cannot be divided on religious lines.

Addressing a press conference, he said it should be found out whether the police are inefficient or there was a lack of effort on the part of the government to tackle the violence.

“I am very much worried that where it happened is the capital of the country and is Centrally governed. If minorities are tortured there and police failed or can’t discharge their duties, it is a matter of serious concern,” Mr. Sen said at an event organised here by the Pratichi Trust.

“It is reported that those who died or were tortured are mostly Muslims. India is a secular country... we can’t divide Hindus and Muslims. As an Indian citizen, I can’t help but worry,” he added.

However, Mr. Sen said he doesn’t want to draw any conclusions without analysing the entire matter.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday hit out at Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal over the latter’s reaction to the budget. Capt. Amarinder said in absence of any real cause for criticism, the Akali leader was once again resorting to making “illogical” comments.

On Mr. Badal calling him (Capt. Amarinder) a businessman, the Chief Minister said, “Considering the wide array of business interests (cable, hotels, transport etc) in which the Badal family had involved itself during the 10 years of their rule, it is Sukhbir and his kin who are the real businessmen.”

The Chief Minister also took a swipe at Mr. Badal and Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal for deriding the ‘Ideal Chief Minister’ award recently conferred on him by the Bharatiya Chhatra Sansad.

“It is clearly a case of sour grapes for them,” he said, adding that none of the Badals could ever dream of being considered for such an honour – the reason for their angst at anyone else being awarded for their good work.

Transparent governance

“SAD is in a total disarray as a result of Sukhbir’s ineffective style of functioning,” said Capt. Amarinder, adding that as a contrast to the former Deputy Chief Minister’s style of functioning, he believed in delegating responsibilities to ensure more effective and transparent governance in the larger interest of the State and its people.

The devotees will offer a chadar (sacred cloth) at the shrine on behalf of the Pakistan government.

The pilgrims, accompanied by the Pakistan High Commission officials, reached Ajmer early morning by the Delhi-Udaipur Chetak Express train. Strict security arrangements were made at the railway station. The platform where the pilgrims alighted was kept out of bounds for other passengers.

The delegation members are staying in the Government Central Girls’ Senior Secondary School at Naya Bazaar in Ajmer. India had not granted visas to the Pakistani devotees intending to travel to Ajmer in 2018 and 2019 amid tensions between the two countries.

289,2020/03/01,"Fair highlights water conservation, higher crop yield technologies","‘Rainwater harvesting can make farming sustainable’

An agriculture fair organised at Chirawa in Rajasthan’s Jhunjhunu district over the weekend highlighted the need for water conservation and a shift towards less water-intensive crops, while calling for technological applications for higher crop yield and ensuring remunerative prices for agricultural produce.

About 2,000 farmers of the Shekhawati region, who attended the fair, apprised the experts of their difficulties in making productive use of land because of climate change and paucity of water. The fair was organised by Ramkrishna Jaidayal Dalmia Seva Sansthan in association with the State government’s Agriculture Department and Krishi Vigyan Kendra.

Jhunjhunu MP Narendra Kumar said the farmers should adopt practices such as rainwater harvesting, bio-farming, natural farming and horticulture to make their farming sustainable. “Action plans for water conservation and optimum use of water resources will depict positive results in near future,” he said.

Groundwater level

While the participants expressed concern over decline in groundwater level in the region, it was pointed out that Shekhawati’s first groundwater recharge well had been built in Chirawa tehsil’s Ismailpur village. With the construction of tankas (tanks) in houses, digging of ponds and irrigation by sprinklers, Ismailpur has emerged as a role model for water conservation.

Dalmia Sansthan’s trustee Raghu Hari Dalmia said the farmers could augment their income by sowing crops consuming less irrigation waters and joining collective efforts for water conservation. M.S. Rathore, Director of Jaipur-based Centre for Environment & Development Studies, said groundwater in Jhunjhunu district could touch rock bottom level by 2045 unless urgent remedial measures were taken. Krishna Kumar Jakhar, from Sriganganagar, said a return to the nature could provide some answers. Krishi Vigyan Kendra’s expert Ranjit Rathore said the farmers could rotate crops on the basis of availability of water.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/5roygo/article30954147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE01AGRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/fair-highlights-water-conservation-higher-crop-yield-technologies/article30954148.ece

A Delhi court on Saturday deferred to next week its judgment in the murder case of the father of the woman who was raped by expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar in Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao three years ago.

The rape survivor’s father had died on April 9, 2018, in judicial custody.

On Wednesday

District judge Dharmesh Sharma deferred the judgment, which will now be pronounced on Wednesday.

The Central Bureau of Investigation had examined 55 witnesses in support of the case and the defence examined nine witnesses. The court had recorded the statements of the rape survivor’s uncle, mother, sister and one of her father’s colleague, who claimed to be an eyewitness to the incident.

The court had on December 20 sent Sengar to jail for “remainder of his natural biological life” for raping the woman in 2017 when she was a minor.

According to the CBI, on April 3, 2018, there was an altercation between the survivor’s father and Shashi Pratap Singh.

The chargesheet filed on July 13, 2018, said the survivor’s father and his co-worker were returning to their village when they asked Singh for lift. Singh refused and an altercation ensued. Singh called his associates, following which MLA’s brother Atul Singh Sengar reached the spot along with others and beat up the survivor’s father and his co-worker.

FIR lodged

The survivor’s father was subsequently taken to the police station by them and an FIR was lodged against him. He was arrested.

The chargesheet said that all this while Kuldeep Sengar was in touch with the District Superintendent of Police and village police station incharge Ashok Singh Bhadauria. Later he also talked to the doctor who examined the survivor’s father.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/court-defers-judgment-in-unnao-murder-case/article30954145.ece

“We have assured them that the compensation under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act will be given to them but they are adamant for extra compensation,” said District Collector Ansh Deep. He said the district police have also offered to give their one-day salary to the victim’s family.

Jeetu Khateek was picked up by the Barmer Sadar police on Wednesday and he died in custody on Thursday. The police had detained him on suspicion of theft but no case was lodged against him. Khateek’s family has alleged that he was beaten to death by policemen in the police station.

The body is still at the mortuary and an autopsy has not been done.

Apart from a judicial inquiry, the matter is also being probed by Additional SP, CID-CB, Jodhpur.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/barmer-victims-family-continues-protest/article30954138.ece
292,2020/03/01,‘Aleem was killed in crossfire between rioters’,"Meerut police say December 20 protest violence victim also handled firearm

Meerut police have said Aleem, one of the five persons who died during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act violence on December 20, 2019, was killed by a bullet fired by rioters.

Investigating officer Ramsanjeevan of Nauchandi police station said the investigation was still on but CCTV footage, post-mortem examination and circumstantial evidence indicate that he was killed by three men — Anees, Mohsin, and Mehtab. “Anees and Mohsin are already in jail while Mehtab is on the run. We have added sections 301 (unintended murder), 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and 120B of IPC to the FIR,” he said.

The inspector further said a potassium nitrate test conducted on Aleem’s body for gunshot residue revealed that he had handled a firearm before death. “This indicates that he could have been killed in the crossfire.”

For a long time, the police were maintaining that Aleem was killed by unidentified men and he was brought dead to the district hospital. Mr. Ramsanjeevan said the confusion was created because earlier the FIR was lodged at the Lisadi gate police station, while Aleem died in Nauchandi police station area.

‘Bogus claims’

Supreme Court lawyer Ali Zaidi, who is arguing for the five victims, described it as a “bogus story” which is being constructed to save the culprit and senior police officers who were involved in “destruction of evidence”.

“We have lodged a complaint with the District Magistrate and Senior Superintendent of Police against police officers with video evidence but an FIR has not been registered,” said Mr. Zaidi.

Alleging role of policemen in Aleem’s death, on February 14, Salahuddin, brother of the deceased, had written to district officials that he had video evidence that Aleem was shifted to a government hospital by Meerut police in its own vehicle.

Mr. Ramsanjeevan said he didn’t receive any such video evidence.

Meanwhile, Salahuddin and Idul Hasan, father of Asif (one of the five victims), have approached the National Human Rights Commission for registration of an FIR against the police officers. “Let them come up with these stories, the truth will be revealed in the courtroom,” said Mr. Zaidi.

Additional District Magistrate Subhash Chandra Prajapati, who is conducting the inquiry in the case, said he was still waiting for any concrete evidence to reach him.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/aleem-was-killed-in-crossfire-between-rioters/article30954135.ece

294,2020/03/01,Assam lecturer held for Facebook post on riots,"He offered to resign after college principal said he was under pressure

A college teacher in southern Assam’s Cachar district was arrested late Friday night for his views against Delhi riots and the role of the Hindutva forces on his Facebook page.

His arrest was based on a complaint by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) in district headquarters Silchar, although he had deleted the “derogatory” posts and had apologised for “some irresponsible comments about a communally sensitive issue”.

Cachar Superintendent of Police Manabendra Debroy said the police acted on the complaint to pick up Souradeep Sengupta, a guest lecturer at Silchar’s Gurucharan College from his residence in the Itkhola area of the town. “He was produced in the local court,” he said. The court put Mr. Sengupta’s bail application on hold and sent him to judicial custody till March 2.

Mr. Sengupta was arrested under three sections of the Indian Penal Code and 66A of the Information Technology Act that defines the punishment for sending “offensive” messages through a computer or any other communication device. The IPC sections slapped against him include 295A, dealing with deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings.

One of Mr. Sengupta’s cousins, declining to be quoted, said trouble for the teacher began on Thursday night when one Kunaljit Dey used screenshots of the teacher’s posts and said he had insulted followers of Sanatan Dharma.

The teacher had in one of the posts sniffed a BJP-RSS design to “recreate Godhra in Delhi”.

“Dada (elder brother) deleted his posts and apologised for inadvertently hurting religious sentiments. The matter should have ended there but some 50 ABVP members stormed his college and staged a demonstration before filing an FIR,” the cousin said.

The college principal said he was under pressure to terminate Mr. Sengupta following a memorandum by the ABVP.

Abdullah’s election was set aside by the Allahabad High Court last December, and on Thursday, the U.P. Legislative Assembly also disqualified him as a member and declared his seat Suar in Rampur as vacant.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Sunday said that only the AIADMK government ensured that the fireworks industry and four lakh workers dependent on the sector were protected at all times. The government would always stand by the industry.

Speaking at a foundation laying ceremony for a government medical college and hospital on a 22-acre campus at ₹380 crore here, he said Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji accompanied a delegation from fireworks industry to Chennai. During discussions, when the delegation made a representation that the State government too implead in the case in Supreme Court, the government readily agreed and won the hearts of workers.

Striking an emotional note, he said the AIADMK and the people of Virudhunagar were so attached that they could not be separated. The government would render all possible help for the needy from the district.

Virudhunagar, an aspirational district, would benefit in a big way. The medical college and hospital was just a beginning, Mr. Palaniswami said to thunderous applause and added that many such developments would follow.

The AIADMK government, which was friendly with the masses, kept its promises. From time immemorial, since the days of Chief Minister MGR, the party always remained for the downtrodden and implemented welfare schemes in the larger public interest. The kudimaramathu scheme had come as a boon to farmers in districts such as Virudhunagar and Ramanathapuram. Today, rainwater was not only preserved, but the tanks facilitated recharging of ground water table in the region.

Showering encomiums on Mr. Rajenthra Bhalaji for his pro-active measures, he said the government would sanction funds for construction of new hospital buildings in Rajapalayam, Srivilliputtur and Sivakasi.

300,2020/03/01,Residents blame faulty drainage system for sewage overflow,"The problems has been continuing at Ismailpuram for six months

MADURAI

People living along Vaigai South Bank Road at Ismailpuram here complain that due to a faulty drainage system, sewage has been overflowing from manholes for the past six months, causing inconvenience to vehicle users and residents.

S. Anandhavalli, a furniture shop owner, said that sewage seeped out of manholes on the stretch every morning. “Wading through sewage is a major challenge for vehicle users. With the presence of an anganwadi nearby, children also face an ordeal every day. At a few instances, children have also slipped on this road,” she said.

The stretch presented a dismal sight with a mixture of slush, stagnant sewage and mounds of waste. Ms. Anandavalli also complained that conservancy workers were irregular in clearing waste from dumper bins.

Sewage stagnation had led to proliferation of mosquitoes, said V. Suresh, a resident of the area. “The stagnant sewage also poses a serious health threat to the residents. The stench from the sewage becomes unbearable,” he said.

A Corporation official said that earlier sewage from this stretch used to drain into Panaiyur channel. “However, this problem started when the sewage discharge into the channel was arrested a few months back as the civic body directed water from the Vaigai to Mariamman Teppakulam through Panaiyur channel,” the official said.

The official further said that currently sewage from the residences was pumped to Santhaipettai pumping station. “Since, the pumping station is overloaded, there is seepage from manholes. But, we have sent proposals to the Corporation authorities and the issue will be addressed within a month,” the official added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/residents-blame-faulty-drainage-system-for-sewage-overflow-madurai/article30957283.ece

MADURAI

Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple’s prized Potramarai Kulam (Golden Lotus Tank) is all set to get a makeover. Temple authorities say the iron barricade around the tank will be replaced with a stylised brass barricade.

They would be attempting to replicate the aesthetics of the pillars around the tank, said Joint Commissioner of the temple N. Natarajan. To execute the project, which is estimated at ₹63 lakh, the temple administration will outsource the design and creation of the brass barricade to craftsmen in Kumbakonam.

The last time a major renovation work was carried out was during2011-2012 when the temple authorities undertook a ₹50-lakh project to ensure permanent water storage in the tank.

Mr. Natarajan said they had also been working on replacing the existing brass barricades in Amman Sannidhi with new ones. The symmetrical brass barricades would be created at a cost of ₹40 lakh.

“The main aim is to ensure that there is improved style and proper maintenance inside the temple. We try to ensure that there is a balance between preserving culture and updating to newer materials and designs occasionally,” Mr. Natarajan said.

He added that the works undertaken under Thirupani (temple renovation) would be completed in three months.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/potramarai-kulam-to-get-a-makeover-madurai/article30957155.ece

Officials said that more than 8,000 flamingos were spotted near Kothandaramar Temple near Dhanushkodi. Rare species such as ruddy turnstone, crab plover and short-toed snake eagle were also spotted.

A.S. Marimuthu, Wildlife Warden, Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park, P. Arun Kumar, District Forest Officer, and S. Ganesa Lingam, Assistant Conservator of Forest, led the survey. Members of Bombay Natural History Society, including S. Chandrasekar and S. Jaisankar, assisted the survey.

Satish. “In Therthangal bird sanctuary, more than 6,000 birds were spotted. Also, there was a 20% increase in the number of birds spotted at these sanctuaries.”

He also added that there was an increase in nesting of migratory birds in the two sanctuaries. “More nesting of migratory bird species such as spot-billed pelican, openbill stork, painted stork and grey heron were spotted in the two sanctuaries. This increase can be attributed to the presence of well-grown babul trees. Also, following the good monsoon, there is good water storage in tanks , which were deepened and maintained well by Forest officials.”",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/more-than-70000-birds-sighted-in-sanctuaries-in-ramnad/article30956642.ece

Lakshmi Narayanan on violin.

Smrithika started with a Pushpanjali, “Gajamuha Varada Gana Nayaga,” invoking the blessings of Lord Ganesa. Next was “Sri Ganesa charanam” in raag thilana by Papanasam Sivan. She danced a beautiful piece on the presiding deity of Madurai Meenakshi “Devi nee ye thunai” again by Sivan in Keeravani. Ninrada Mayilonru by Oothukkadu Venkata Subbaier, in which the dancer described the impact of Krishna’s music on birds, animals and gopis of Vrindavan very well.

Smrithika concluded the program with a nice Thillana.

Odissi was performed by Shatabti Mallik and her disciples Sumita Pal, Debenjana Datta, Tanmay Samaddar and Debeshmita kar.

Shatabti Mallik showed an exceptional performance in which her body seems to fall into shapes and gestures required of it and at the same time exuding meaning, character and symbolism.

The group began the performance with “Dasa Mahavidya”(music composition by Guru Sulhantha) or the Ten Goddesses, ten aspects of the Devi or Shakti, the divine goddess, as described by Srimad Devi Bhagavatham.

They depicted the 10 Mahavidyas viz Kali, Tara, Tripura Sundari (Shodoshi), Bhuvaneshvari, Tripura Bhairavi, Chinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi, Matangi and Kamala very nicely.

Next they staged a pure dance “Sthayee,” with rhythmic music, which was graceful and the lyrical movements of eyes, neck, torso & feet and slowly built in a crescendo to climax in a fast tempo at the end was a visual treat.

The navarasa - the nine expressions that humans often show and finally “Dasavatara,” 10 Faces of Lord Vishnu, kind of dance composition that requires the performer to balance demanding technical effects with a clear flow of abstracted storytelling was done by the group with full facial expressions and delicately complex, resilient hand gestures conveyed the characters and emotion.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/mxdrvk/article30955936.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA01ODISSIDANCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/an-exceptional-performance/article30955937.ece
304,2020/03/01,‘People taking to the streets showshow strong the Constitution is’,"The tense situation in New Delhi since a week and violence seen in Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Milia Islamia campuses are a reflection of the Union government not hearing people and using force to silence the opposition to CAA, activist Teesta Setalvad said here on Sunday.

Speaking at an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act programme organised by Samvidana Samrakshana Samiti at Kuttar Padavu, Ms. Setalvad said that the Union government was behaving in the same way the British did following the passage of the Rowlatt Act in 1919. The British then carried out firing at Jallianwalabagh and the Union government now was doing the same to those opposing CAA, the proposed National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizenship (NRC).

No Government, she said, can change the secular nature of the Constitution that granted equal citizenship rights to all.

Ms. Setalvad said that Assam residents are facing the brunt of implementation of NRC, which was done under the watchful eyes of the Supreme Court. Following the release of the third and the final list of NRC, nearly 19 lakh of the 3.2 crore residents were left out of the exercise. This 19 lakh included Bengali Hindus, Adivasis and other communities.

“If NRC comes into effect across the country, it is not just Muslims but people from all communities will be affected,” she said.

Mr. Shettar said the air link was happening primarily because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision to see even a person wearing slippers fly. While Mangaluru is the second busiest international airport after Bengaluru in Karnataka, other places, namely Hubballi, Belagavi, Kalaburagi and Bidar, have come on the air map with the UDAN scheme.

Stating that UDAN by Mr. Modi was what the Golden Quadrilateral highway project of former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee had envisaged, Mr. Shettar noted that more flights were operating to and from his home town now. This has paved the way for industrialisation of the important city on the Bombay-Karnataka region, he said.

The recent Intra-Railway Timetable Committee (IRTTC) meeting held at Bengaluru saw approval given to the proposal by SR to operate the train, with tentative departure at 6 a.m. from Mangaluru, arrival in Coimbatore at 12.10 p.m., departure from Coimbatore at 2.30 p.m., and arrival in Mangaluru Central at 8.40 p.m. on all days except Mondays.

Yogendra Swamy from Mysuru Grahaka Parishat said SR and its Palakkad division has cited platform constraints whenever Karnataka trains, including the Yeshwantpur-Mangaluru Junction-Yeshwantpur Gomateshwara Express and the Vijayapura-Mangaluru Junction-Vijayapura Special Express, are sought to be run from Mangaluru Central. “Won’t the same constraints apply to Tamil Nadu- or Kerala-bound trains,” he asked. He also said the practice of using Mangaluru as the terminal for north Kerala should stop.

Anil Hegde of Pashchima Karavali Rail Yatri Abhivriddhi Samiti said the Yeshwantpur-Mangaluru Central Tri-weekly Express (16585) was departing Yeshwantpur at a very odd hour of 4.30 p.m. and arriving Central at 3.30 a.m. “It is only because Palakkad division’s claim that no platform is available at Central after 5 a.m.,” Mr. Hegde said, wondering how SR could find platform for Tejas Express now.

Rail activist Raveendran Nambiar from Puttur said the non-availability of platforms to start and receive Karnataka trains at Central cannot be justified as four trains leave Central towards Kerala or Tamil Nadu between 5 a.m. and 7.30 p.m.

Kukke Subrahmanya-Mangaluru Rail Abhivriddhi Samiti convener Sudarshan Puttur said the Tejas proposal has again exposed the “double standards of the SR”. “It did not allow the Mumbai CSMT-Mangaluru-Mumbai CSMT Superfast Express into Central citing platform congestion; SR started the Mangaluru Central-Coimbatore Intercity Express in the meantime,” he said.

Rail fan Dinesh Bhat from Puttur said there has been an inordinate delay in constructing additional platforms at Central. “The Tejas proposal is yet another example for SR’s stepmotherly treatment towards Karnataka,” he said.

Divisional Railway Manager of SR Palakkad division Pratap Singh Shami told The Hindu that he was not aware of the proposal. “Salem division must have sent the proposal,” he said, clarifying that Palakkad was yet to work on it.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/5gs33/article30955640.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGMNGTEJAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/mangaluru-coimbatore-tejas-express-proposal-irks-many-in-karnataka/article30953607.ece

309,2020/03/01,Garbage slip: Families unhappy with restoration works,"Urban Development Minister Byrathi Basavaraj directs MCC to commence construction work of retaining wall

Expressing their ire over the delay in restoration works, residents of Mandara Kudupu, who were affected by the garbage slip from Panchhanady landfill site following heavy rains last August, accused Mangaluru City Corporation officials of not working out the compensation package fairly.

The residents expressed their ire before the Urban Development Byrathi Basavaraj who visited the area on Saturday.

“We just see Ministers coming to this stop, pose before the media, and leave by making assurances. We have not seen any restoration work even after six months. Compensation for loss of horticulture crops and damage to houses were not worked out fairly,” said Ganesh, owner of the house from where the Minister had an overview of the damage.

Mr. Ganesh accused an official from MCC, who recently surveyed the area, of declaring more compensation to those who have suffered less or no loss on account of the garbage slip.

Another resident, Rajesh Bhat, said there was a lack of transparency about relief and rehabilitation works.

Residents, who have been moved to the quarters of Karnataka Housing Board in Kulashekara, were in a quandary as they were not asked to settle down at the quarters permanently.

Ranjit Saliyan, who is among two families living in the area, said the MCC is yet to provide proper road connectivity and other basic facilities in the area.

Pachhanady councillor Sangeeta R. Nayak said that the MCC, forthwith, has to take measures to divert the water flowing down the landfill site to prevent repeat of the garbage slip.

Expressing displeasure with the work of officials, the Minister directed MCC Commissioner Ajith Kumar Hegde to start the work on the retaining wall to the landfill site within a week out of ₹4 crore released by the government.

Compensation for loss of horticulture crops and damage to houses out of another ₹ 4 crore will be worked out in a transparent manner.

Mr. Basavaraj also directed the MCC to expedite works on providing roads and other basic facilities.

Biomining of waste and restoration works will be taken at the earliest. “If slackness continuess, I will take serious action against officials concerned,” Mr. Basavaraj warned.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/garbage-slip-families-unhappy-with-restoration-works/article30953474.ece
310,2020/03/01,Passenger car sales continue downward trend,"Consumer sentiment remained subdued; SARS-CoV-2 outbreak constrained component supplies

Wholesale sales of passenger vehicles in the country continued on a downward trend in February 2020, with major car makers posting a decline in sales as consumer sentiment remained subdued, in addition to component supply constraints due to global outbreak of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Market leader Maruti Suzuki on Sunday said its sales of passenger vehicles fell 2.3% last month to 1.33 lakh units in February 2020, as against sales of over 13.6 lakh units in the year-ago month.

While the sales of its mini segment cars (Alto and S-Presso) grew 11% to 27,499 units, that of utility vehicles (Vitara Brezza, S-Cross and Ertiga) rose 3.5% to 22,604 units. However, sales of the compact segment (such as Swift, Wagon R, Celerio, Ignis, Baleno and Dzire) declined 3.9% to 69,828 units, and sales of its mid-sized sedan Ciaz fell 17.5% to 2,544 units.

Hyundai Motor India said its domestic sales declined 7% last month to 40,010 passenger vehicles, as against 43,110 units in February 2019.

For homegrown car maker Mahindra & Mahindra Limited (M&M), passenger vehicle sales declined by 58% to 10,938 units (from 26,109 units), while sales of commercial vehicles were down 25% to 15,856 units (from 21,154 units).

‘Few more weeks’

Veejay Ram Nakra, Chief of Sales and Marketing, Automotive Division, M&M Ltd., said, “The ramp-down of BS IV vehicle production has been in line with our plan for February. However, because of the unforeseeable challenges on the parts-supply from China, our BS VI ramp-up has been affected.”

He added that this had resulted in a high de-growth in the billing volume for February and the dealer inventory was now under ten days. “Going into March, we anticipate the challenges on parts-supply to continue for another few weeks, before we get back to normalcy,” Mr. Nakra added.

‘Severely affected’

MG Motor India on Sunday announced retail sales of 1,376 units in February 2020. The company, which had retailed 3,130 units in January, currently sells two models in the country — SUV Hector and ZS EV.

“...the unforeseen coronavirus outbreak has severely affected our European and Chinese supply chains, disrupting our production and impacting our sales in February and it will continue through March. We are working towards stabilising the situation and are hopeful that reasonable normalcy will be restored by the end of March,” Rakesh Sidana, Director- Sales, MG Motor India said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/u7lero/article30346870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THMARUTI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/passenger-car-sales-continue-downward-trend/article30957985.ece
311,2020/03/01,AirAsia India Oct-Dec loss narrows to ₹123.35 crore,"For the full fiscal, AirAsia reported around 6% lower losses at ₹597 crore as against ₹633.61 crore posted in FY’2018.

Budget carrier AirAsia India narrowed its loss to ₹123.35 crore in three months to December from ₹166.15 crore in Q4FY18 owing to higher fuel and staff costs coupled with increased user charges and other related expenses, as per a company presentation.

The Bengaluru-based airline, which is a joint venture between Tata Sons and Malaysian airlines group AirAsia’s investment arm, AirAsia Investment Ltd., follows January-December financial year.

Total revenue during December quarter jumped 65% to ₹1,057.55 crore as compared with ₹641.17 crore in the same period of financial year 2018, aided by higher average fare and capacity, the airline said.

Revenue grew on the back of a 38% increase in capacity and 19% rise in average fare.

For the full fiscal, the airline reported around 6% lower losses at ₹597 crore as against ₹633.61 crore posted in FY’2018.

“AirAsia India continues to undertake continuous improvement projects to save costs on fuel. Overall Q4FY19 loss before tax narrowed to ₹1,233.6 million [123.36 crore] compared to ₹1,661.5 million [166.15 crore] in the same quarter last year,” the company said.

Its expenses also increased in tandem with the rise in revenue, it said, adding that staff costs increased 77% to ₹164.73 crore due to additional operational staff for increased number of aircraft and also forward hiring to cater to additional aircraft to be inducted in the first half of 2020.

AirAsia India flew 39% more passengers at 26.85 lakh during the quarter with a load factor of 87% as compared with 19.33 lakh passengers and 86% load factor in December quarter of 2018.

Load or seat factor is a measure of how much of an airline’s passenger carrying capacity is used or average percentage of seats filled in an aircraft.

The airline added nine new planes to take its fleet size to 28 aircraft during the quarter as against 19 aircraft in December quarter of 2018, as per the presentation.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/2t9aq2/article29240903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGAIRASIA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/airasia-india-oct-dec-loss-narrows-to-12335-crore/article30956550.ece
312,2020/03/01,Covering risk while earning money,"A combination of risk coverage, returns make it worth a while to look at ULIPs

There are a variety of life insurance policies.

While term policies cover only death risk and for a given period, whole life policies offer longer coverage periods with options like return of premium and other add-ons. It is the endowment policy that offers some return on the premium paid over and above just coverage. This return, or bonus, is a share of the returns that the life insurance company realises when it invests your premium and is usually more modest than even bank fixed deposit interest.

The Unit-Linked Insurance Policy (ULIP) offers life coverage and a larger component of investment. However, this investment is linked to the capital market returns on the premium funds that are invested. We can infer that the risk profile of this investment is pretty different from other life insurance policy bonuses because, in the case of the latter, the funds are invested according to prudential norms laid out in the insurance regulations designed for the safety of funds and not to maximise returns.

In short, ULIP returns are subject to market risk while affording an opportunity for higher returns.

It is also one policy where you, as policyholder, can choose the bouquet of investments your funds should be deployed in. Funds are usually in distinct asset classes or specified combinations of asset classes. A high-risk fund would be largely in equities where the returns can also be commensurately high. A low-risk fund would have investments largely or wholly in debt securities while a medium-risk fund would have some combination of the two.

So, the policy pays out a death benefit should the policyholder die during the policy period. If he survives, he gets the maturity value of the ULIP. The death / maturity benefit is an assured sum and unaffected by the ULIP maturity value which is nothing but the value on that date of the investments in the fund of his choosing. Even if the value of the ULIP investments are less than the sum assured, the death benefit is assured.

Carrying flexibility

ULIP has some flexibilities. You can choose any option of fund to invest in and you can switch from one fund to another as well. You can top-up your ULIP policy any time and also direct future premiums to go into a specified fund. Partial withdrawals are also possible.

Staying invested also brings loyalty additions and bonuses which add value to your investment. Premium paid for a ULIP policy has tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income-Tax Act, 1961 and maturity proceeds are tax-free under Section 10 (10) (d) subject to certain conditions.

ULIPs should be actively managed for better returns. You should study your own risk appetite, the stage of life you are in and your financial goals in order to make intelligent decisions. Some policies have systematic transfers from one asset class to another or a life-cycle-based strategy that automatically switch your funds.

Capital market investments in equities, typically, are long term in nature so you should also take a long-term view on your ULIP investment strategy given that there is a five-year lock-in period anyway.

ULIP funds of insurance companies have published track records and studying these to decide on a strategy would be a good idea.

The other important thing to track is the charges in various ULIPs. Be sure you choose one with lower charges so that more of your money is invested and earns you returns.

313,2020/03/01,Financial goals can’t be influenced by Sensex,"One needs to focus on financial menu card

‘What do you think of the market?’ is a question I most often face from viewers, readers and members of the audience, as a practicing financial planner. The reference here is to stock market and more specifically, to the Sensex and Nifty. Honestly, no one can, with accountability, can predict the future.

Let us assume because of some supernatural powers an individual knows the direction of the market. Still, is that really useful? “Son, Sensex is down 10% since beginning of the year, let us postpone your marriage plan till such time the Sensex comes back to its original level.” What are the chances a father will ever say this to his son?

Requirement of funds to fulfil our financial goals cannot be dependent on the level of Sensex. Also, while we have no control over or say in the movement of the Sensex, our financial responsibility and dreams still need to be fulfilled. Beyond a point, the level of Sensex doesn’t matter.

My Sensex

Instead of trying to gauge the level and future of the Sensex, we must focus on ‘My Sensex.’ ‘My Sensex’ is ‘My Sensible Expense.’ We can even call it our family budget or cash-flow statement. One of my lady clients once said, “Gaurav, the word budget scares the life out of me. I prefer calling it spending list. This gives me a lot of relief.” To her, budget is restrictive but spending list sounded like freedom to spend.

There is no way I would want to preach on delayed gratification, being frugal or spending versus splurging.

These are subjective. To a teenager or a young lady who has just started working, using the French cosmetic brand Estee Lauder is certainly splurging, but to a fashion model, it is an occupational need. My milkman, who delivers milk at 5 a.m., owning a bicycle is a necessity but what about a bicycle, for a Sunday ride with friends, costing ₹1.25 lakh for a college student?

What is of pivotal importance is being responsible for our expenses and owning up to such responsibility.

How a menu card works

“After entering the restaurant, the family sat at a table near the window and the waiter brought in various food items. The family consumed some of the food items, wasted a lot and paid the full amount for it.” Does this make sense? Under normal circumstances, we look at the menu card, order food items of our choice and quantity of each based on our requirements. Later, we settle the bill for the items we had ordered. This way, there is either nil or little wastage. Our family budget — or spending list — is our financial menu card.

From the list of various items on the card, we need to decide which ones and how much to spend on each.

Items to order

A financial menu card can be segregated into two main categories and into further two sub-categories. Two main categories are fixed expense and variable expenses.

Fixed expense are those expenses which remain constant e.g. house rent, school fees, insurance premium and EMIs. These are fixed and mandatory. We cannot skip them. The sub-category is fixed voluntary expenses e.g. club and gymnasium membership, subscription to TV channels, magazines, etc. Here we do have an option to reduce or skip them if we wish to.

Variable mandatory expenses are grocery, transport, healthcare, clothing, utilities etc. They keep changing by a small variation month-on-month. Variable voluntary expenses are eating out, entertainment etc.

It is completely up to the individual or family to decide how much to spend on each category. What needs to be kept in mind is there is an inverse relationship between our current expenses and future wealth creation.

Saving and splurging both give rise to similar emotions — only the order in which they emerge changes. Splurging now will give us excitement now but there will be anxiety later about the amount of wealth created. On the other hand, saving now and living frugally may give frustration now but happiness will emerge later as we will have a larger corpus in our winter years.

Don’t predict, but prepare

Avoid getting into predicting the future of Sensex or for that matter anything else. This is a futile exercise as there is nothing in our control. What is in our control is My Sensex. Spend time preparing My Sensex, my financial menu card or, as my client calls it, My Spending List.
