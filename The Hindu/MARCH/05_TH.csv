0,2020/03/05,Asian Olympic Qualifiers: Ashish Kumar makes quarterfinals,"Thumps Uulu in Asian Olympic Qualifiers

Asian silver-medallist Ashish Kumar (75kg) sailed into the quarterfinals of the continental Olympic Qualifiers for boxing with a thumping win over fourth seed Kyrgyz Omurbek Bekzhigit Uulu in the last-16 stage on Thursday.

Ashish prevailed 5-0 to set up a clash with Indonesia’s Maikhel Roberrd Muskita, who defeated New Zealand’s Ryan Scaife in his pre-quarterfinal bout.

Making the semifinals would assure Ashish of his maiden spot in the Olympics this year.

Up against a spunky rival, who he defeated in the Asian quarterfinals last year, Ashish played the waiting game to perfection, allowing Uulu to expend himself trying to connect.

Uulu swung his arms more than the Indian but it was Ashish who connected more accurately in the opening three minutes.

However, Uulu kept up the pressure in the second round as well and managed to land a couple of solid rights, which caught the Indian off-guard and led to scores being split.

Ashish’s powerful and precise right hand served him well in the final three minutes as judges ruled unanimously in his favour.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/asian-olympic-qualifiers-ashish-kumar-makes-quarterfinals/article30994057.ece
1,2020/03/05,Abhinav Bindra backs shooters to do well at Tokyo Olympics,"Says that they have to adapt to the challenges

With the spread of coronavirus wreaking havoc on the athletes’ preparations for the Tokyo Games, Abhinav Bindra, India’s only Olympic gold medallist in shooting, makes it clear that they need to deal with such situations.

“Performing at the highest level in sports require adaptability. Coronavirus or no, they are going to the Olympics. This is a situation which is new for everybody and they need to adapt to it and prepare to the best of their abilities” Bindra said at the launch of Boria Majumdar and Nalin Mehta’s book, Dreams of a Billion.

International Olympic Committee (IOC) chief, Thomas Bach, had earlier encouraged athletes to continue their preparations at ‘full steam’. And Bindra is of a similar opinion. “The Games are being prepared to be on scheduled as the IOC chief said yesterday. The best experts are monitoring the situation, there will be a time when there will be clarity. No point in speculating on whether Games will be postponed,” Bindra said.

He is also confident of Indians faring well in Tokyo. “The current lot of athletes are young and fearless. I think that’s a very happy space to be in,” said Bindra, revealing that some of them do seek his advise.

“What I can tell them is my experiences, things that I did wrong, things that I learnt. At the end of the day, they have to find their way. They just can’t follow me and copy what I did. If they have to succeed, they have to find their path,” Bindra said. “I am very open if they seek my opinion. I will not actively try to put something into their minds. But if I am asked, I am more than happy to share my experiences.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/yclxo6/article30994030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06BILLION,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/abhinav-bindra-backs-shooters-to-do-well-at-tokyo-olympics/article30994031.ece
2,2020/03/05,Former TT champion Bindu in elite panel of Blue Badge umpires,"The 38-year-old became the first woman from Kerala and second from India to be selected to the coveted panel

Former State table tennis champion M.S. Bindu has become a trail-blazer for women umpires in the State after she was made it to the International Table Tennis Federation’s (ITTF) elite panel of Blue Badge umpires.

Second from India

The 38-year-old became the first woman from Kerala and second from India to be selected to the coveted panel. Bindu, who had represented Kerala in 11 senior national TT championships, also became the second Blue Badge umpire from Kerala.

Blue badge umpires officiate in ITTF’s elite tournaments including the Olympics and World Championships. Bindu qualified as international umpire in 2012 even when she was active as a player.

However, she became a full-time umpire only after retirement and the 78th senior national championships in Haryana in 2016 was her first major assignment.

She was nominated by the ITTF to officiate in the premium junior circuit in Metz, France, in April last year which was her first international assignment. She appeared for the Blue Badge test and passed the written exam in Metz.

She officiated in the Commonwealth championships in Cuttack in July and World Junior championship in Thailand in December.

Bindu’s performance as umpire in these tournaments was evaluated by ITTF and she passed the interview which was conducted during the World Junior TT championships in Thailand to complete the Blue Badge qualification process within six months

Hardworking

“She was very hard working and dedicated when she was a player. She has shown the same traits after she became an umpire.

“It is a great achievement to achieve this within six months as normally people take more time to complete the Blue Badge process.

“I hope Bindu will inspire more women to take up umpiring,” said N. Ganeshan, ITTF’s competition manger and Bindu’s mentor.

Bindu, who is married to Kerala State Sports Council coach Jobin Christy, chose to be an umpire rather than a coach after her retirement. “I grew up watching Ganeshan as a umpire. I was always impressed by his dedication and passion and always wanted to be an umpire.

“He was the first person to encourage me to take up officiating.

“I should also thank my family and especially husband for all their support,’’ said Bindu who is awaiting her first assignment as a Blue Badge umpire.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/1u0acd/article30993709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06-Bindu,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/former-tt-champion-bindu-in-elite-panel-of-blue-badge-umpires/article30993710.ece
3,2020/03/05,Ailing Novy Kapadia awaits his long-delayed pension,"Noted sports commentator and author afflicted with rare disease

The plight of noted sports commentator and author Novy Kapadia confined to his home has left the football fraternity sad. Pictures of an otherwise vibrant Kapadia, now unable to move around even within his house without assistance, has distressed many who have known Kapadia for close to four decades.

“What pains me is the fact that Novy has not been paid his pension for more than two years,” said commentator Ghaus Mohammad, Kapadia’s partner on radio and television for more than 30 years. “His service to football is unmatched and it is time the football fraternity lends support to the man who did so much to popularise the game. This generation of football lovers owes it to him. His background of teaching ensured he had a smooth flow in his commentary and impeccable pronunciation,”

Authority

Having covered nine FIFA World Cup tournaments, the 67-year-old Kapadia is considered an authority on football in India. “Football has been a passion for me. It hurts that I can’t do my commentary now but I feel elated when my students visit me and friends drop in,” said Kapadia, who taught English at Khalsa College for 41 years and has been waiting to receive his pension for 31 months. “I have enjoyed my travels for football but now I miss all that. I am not able to step out of the house at all and have to use a walker when moving around. Football took me all over the world but that way of life has sadly come to an end now.”

Kapadia, who once owned the Ashoka Club and played active football in the local league, has been afflicted by motor neuron, a rare neuro-degenerative disease that causes the nerves in the spine and brain to lose function over time. “I have served Delhi University with all dedication and hope I get help at this stage of my life from the Government to meet my medical expenses,” he pleaded.

Technical knowledge

According to veteran football scribe Jaydeep Basu, “Novy is one of the finest grass-root reporters of Indian football. He has deep technical knowledge of football and footballers. I envy his understanding of the game and I am sad that he has been sort of neglected by the society. I am sure help will pour in for him to meet his medical expenses,” said Basu.

Football guru for some and football encyclopedia for others, Kapadia awaits to hear from the Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju, who has promised to look unto the matter.

Taking note of Kapadia’s condition, All India Football Federation president Praful Patel told The Hindu, “the sports fraternity owes a lot to Novy. AIFF will certainly help him. I will also take it up the Sports Minister.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/lo53o1/article30991864.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06KAPADIYA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ailing-novy-kapadia-awaits-his-long-delayed-pension/article30991865.ece

Mumbai is set to host the 2023 International Olympic Committee’s session after the IOC Executive Board recommended the Indian city for the annual conference.

The EB decided to put Mumbai’s candidature to a vote of the members after the IOC Evaluation Commission praised the quality of the facilities at the Jio World Centre, which is the potential venue for the meet.

The decision will be ratified at the 136th IOC session in Tokyo in July this year.

The Evaluation Commission had visited Mumbai in October last year to study the feasibility of hosting the Session in Mumbai.

“We have chosen India because it is the second most populous nation in the world, with a very young population and a huge potential for Olympic sport,” IOC President Thomas Bach said.

“We want to encourage and support the National Olympic Committee of India and all the National Federations to promote and strengthen Olympic sport in the country,” he added.

India had hosted an IOC session way back in 1983 in New Delhi.

“The year 2023 will be significant for India as it coincides with the 75th anniversary of Indian independence. Hosting the IOC Session in Mumbai would put the Olympic Movement at the heart of those celebrations,” an IOC statement said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/y5l6g0/article30988007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKNITAAMBANIWITHTHOMASBACH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/mumbai-set-to-host-international-olympic-committee-session-in-2023/article30988008.ece

The Indian team got a chance to check the quality of its doubles arsenal as Ankita Raina lost the second singles against Korea in the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania group-1 women’s tennis tournament on Thursday.

Rutuja Bhosale battled past Jang Su-Jeong 7-5, 6-4 in the first rubber. Ankita had a fight on hand against Han Na-Lae as she dropped serve early. She fought back but slipped to a quick defeat after surrendering the first set.

With tougher matches ahead, it was a good opportunity for the Indian team to put the former World No. 1 Sania Mirza on court for the doubles match.

In the other matches, China beat Chinese Taipei while Indonesia beat Uzbekistan.

13,2020/03/05,Davis Cup | India decides to keep out Nagal,"Prajnesh, Ramkumar for singles; Bopanna to partner Leander

The Indian team sprang a surprise by keeping its No. 1 player Sumit Nagal out of action, at least for the opening day, of the Davis Cup World Group qualifier to be played on indoor hard courts in Zagreb.

In the opening rubber, the 132nd-ranked Prajnesh Gunneswaran will play the 277th-ranked Borna Gojo. That match will be followed by the 182nd-ranked Ramkumar Ramanathan against the former World No. 3 Marin Cilic, who had helped Croatia win the trophy in 2018.

On the same page

“It is our strategy for the tie, and in the best interests of the team. The team is on the same page. It is not about individuals,” said Rohit Rajpal, captain of the Indian team, after the draw.

India will field Rohan Bopanna and Leander Paes in doubles against the pair of Franko Skugor and Mate Pavic.

It may be recalled that the 46-year-old Leander had won three matches in India’s shock victory over Croatia in 1995, when he outlasted Goran Ivanisevic in five sets. That has been the only meeting between the two teams in Davis Cup.

“It’s a big honour to represent the country, and a big responsibility. I am looking forward to playing with Rohan. We have had some good wins,” said Leander.

Bopanna said playing Davis Cup always meant “playing with a big heart, and playing to win.” He added that he was looking forward to playing his friends on the professional tour.

Full of confidence

Ramkumar, who was happy to get an opportunity, said he was confident of delivering the best.

“I am really happy and excited. The conditions are good for me,” he said.

The 127th-ranked Nagal may have been kept out, but could play in the tie, if needed, as there is a provision to replace the players.

The matches will be played on a best-of-three format.

The draw:

March 6: Borna Gojo vs Prajnesh Gunneswaran; Marin Cilic vs Ramkumar Ramanathan.

Fifteen Italian tourists, including the wife of an infected Italian, and eight Indians have tested positive for coronavirus on March 4, taking the number of cases to 29 in the country. Two cases with a high viral load were also detected in Telangana.

As on March 4, 23 countries, including Nepal, Vietnam and Cambodia, have shared 159 genome sequence data. At 65, China has deposited the most number of genome sequences followed by the U.S. (16), Australia (10), Japan (9) and Singapore and South Korea (eight sequences each).

Mr. Kovind wrote on Twitter: “With alertness and safeguards, we all can help contain the outbreak of COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. In a precautionary measure, the Rashtrapati Bhavan will not hold the traditional Holi gatherings.”

Less than a week ago, the High Court adjourned to April 13 the hearing of petitions seeking immediate registration of FIRs against those who egged mobs on with their hate speeches. It had seemed to agree with the government that the “atmosphere was not conducive” for action.

The measure is the most restrictive response to COVID-19 of any European nation and tougher than the closure of schools — but not universities — taken by fellow Group of Seven (G7) member Japan.

17,2020/03/05,COVID-19 | Italy doubles money pledged to fight virus,"Economy Minister said that the government would spend 7.5 billion euros for the cause

Italy said on Thursday it was doubling the sum it initially planned to tackle its coronavirus outbreak, saying funds were urgently needed to help the health service as well as families, firms and workers.

Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri told a news conference the government would spend 7.5 billion euros ($8.40 billion) and ask the European Union for the go-ahead to hike this year's deficit goal, currently set at 2.2% of gross domestic product.

The new target of around 2.5% of GDP will first need to be approved by parliament in a vote expected for next week.

Italy has been the European country hardest hit by coronavirus, with 148 deaths and 3,858 cases since the outbreak emerged two weeks ago.

On Sunday the minister had promised a smaller package worth 3.6 billion euros, a sum which the opposition and much of Italy's media deemed inadequate.

“Nobody must lose their job because of coronavirus,” Mr. Gualtieri said, promising a moratorium on credits held by banks in the worst affected areas.

The draconian measures introduced to try to contain the highly infectious disease are taking a heavy toll on an economy which was already close to recession, with a huge immediate hit to tourism.

18,2020/03/05,Is it all over for Bernie Sanders?,"Polls show his core agenda remains popular among voters

In a sudden burst of changed momentum, former U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden converted his strong victory in the South Carolina primary into a launching pad for successes in States that voted on “Super Tuesday”. Helped by a string of endorsements from withdrawn centrist candidates such as Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke, besides Democrat elders such as former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Mr. Biden managed to consolidate the hitherto divided support for the moderates and notched a series of impressive victories in the southern States and surprisingly even in liberal Massachusetts, Maine and Minnesota.

In more good tidings for Mr. Biden’s candidacy, billionaire candidate Michael Bloomberg withdrew from the race and endorsed him.

With the Democratic party establishment firmly putting in its weight behind Mr. Biden and the Vice-President managing to draw support from the same coalition that catapulted Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee in 2016 — African Americans, elderly citizens (above the age of 60), college educated white voters, a clear pathway seems to have emerged for the veteran politician who had failed in his previous two attempts for the nomination in 1988 and 2008. Meanwhile, with wins only in four States — importantly in the delegate-rich California — Senator Bernie Sanders could not carry forward the momentum he had gained after the victory in the Nevada caucus and is now relegated to an underdog rather than an insurgent frontrunner.

Also Read Biden’s comeback leaves Sanders little time to expand appeal

But are the unabashedly democratic socialist Mr. Sanders’ chances doomed? This doesn’t seem to be the case. A consolidation of the moderate vote has created an arithmetic challenge to his candidacy, which has so far garnered roughly 30% of the total votes and 40% of the total number of delegates in the primaries across the States.

Had Elizabeth Warren remained in the fray, Mr. Sanders’ support from the progressive and activist Democrats would have further been undercut, as it happened in Massachusetts and Minnesota. With Ms. Warren deciding to hang her boots, the Sanders campaign might get a boost.

The winnowing of the Democratic field to two candidates sharpens the contrast for Mr. Sanders against Mr. Biden and should bring Mr. Biden’s candidacy into the limelight, that was hitherto shared between the moderates.

Exit polls have shown that core features of Mr. Sanders’ agenda — Medicare for All, raised minimum wages, free public college tuition still gets more than majority support among Democrats, which suggests that a section of the electorate who favour this economic agenda have voted for Mr. Biden.

Battle against Trump

This is likely due to concerns about Mr. Sanders’ ability to win over the support of moderates and independents beyond Democrats in the electoral battle against President Donald Trump and here’s where the weight of the party establishment and the multiple endorsements helped Mr. Biden’s case. Polls show that undecided voters shifted onto the Biden bandwagon in large numbers not just on Super Tuesday but even in South Carolina.

Also Read Scripting an audacity of hope, the Sanders way

Meanwhile, Mr, Sanders’ trump card — his steady base and support among the youth has not really given him the advantage he has sought despite their ability to raise funds and volunteers quickly, as actual turnout numbers from this section have remained relatively tepid.

If in the coming weeks, Mr. Sanders brings forth his contrast with Mr. Biden, who despite his experience has shown an increasing penchant for gaffes and rambling speeches on the campaign trail and during debates, he does stand a chance in reversing the momentum yet again. Voters in States like Arizona, Florida, Illinois (who get to vote on March 17) and New York and Pennsylvania (April 28) will get to answer the question on who poses the strongest challenge to the prospects of a return of the Trump presidency.

19,2020/03/05,Virus leaves 290 million students out of school,"UNESCO says the outbreak’s global scale and speed of educational disruption is unparalleled

Almost 300 million students worldwide faced weeks at home with Italy and India the latest to shut schools over COVID-19 outbreak, as the IMF urged an all-out global offensive against the epidemic.

More than 95,000 people have been infected and over 3,200 have died worldwide from the virus, which by Thursday had reached more than 80 countries and territories.

The U.S. State of California declared an emergency following its first fatality — raising the U.S. death toll to 11 — and a cruise ship was kept offshore after passengers and crew members developed symptoms.

Switzerland reported its first death from the outbreak on Thursday, while Bosnia and South Africa confirmed their first cases and Greece’s cases surged after 21 travellers recently returned from a bus trip to Israel and Egypt tested positive for the virus.

Most deaths and infections are in China, where the virus first emerged late last year, prompting the country to quarantine entire cities, temporarily shut factories and close schools indefinitely.

But it has quickly spread beyond China’s borders.

Several countries have implemented extraordinary measures, with UNESCO saying on Wednesday that school closures in more than a dozen countries have affected 290.5 million children.

All primary schools in New Delhi will remain closed until the end of March to prevent the virus from spreading.

The orders came as an India-EU summit scheduled for March 13 was also postponed.

While temporary school closures during crises are not new, UNESCO chief Audrey Azoulay said “the global scale and speed of the current educational disruption is unparalleled and, if prolonged, could threaten the right to education”.

Italy on Wednesday ordered schools and universities shut until March 15, ramping up its response as national fatalities rose to 107.

South Korea — second to China in terms of infections with cases jumping past 6,000 on Thursday — has postponed the start of the next term until March 23.

In Japan, nearly all schools are closed after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for classes to be cancelled until early April.

Schools have also shut in Iran, where 107 people have died from the disease — alongside Italy, the deadliest outbreak outside China.

20,2020/03/05,U.S. Presidential Election 2020 | Elizabeth Warren ends White House bid after Super Tuesday rout,"Ms. Warren’s exit comes days after the onetime front-runner couldn’t win a single Super Tuesday State, not even her own.

Elizabeth Warren, who electrified progressives with her “plan for everything” and strong message of economic populism, dropped out of the Democratic presidential race on March 5, according to a person familiar with her plans. The exit came days after the onetime front-runner couldn’t win a single Super Tuesday State, not even her own.

For much of the past year, her campaign had all the markers of success, robust poll numbers, impressive fundraising and a sprawling political infrastructure that featured staffers on the ground across the country. But once voting began in February, she never found a reliable base of supporters as Democrats coalesced around Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, her progressive rival, and former Vice-President Joe Biden, who established himself as the leading centrist in the race.

""I refuse to let disappointment blind me — or you — to what we’ve accomplished,” Ms. Warren told her campaign staff on a call on March 5. “We didn’t reach our goal, but what we have done together - what you have done - has made a lasting difference. It’s not the scale of the difference we wanted to make, but it matters.”

Ms. Warren’s exit leaves the Democratic field with just one female candidate — Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who has collected only one delegate toward the nomination. That is a frustrating twist for a party that once boasted the most diverse presidential field in history and harnessed the votes and energy of women to retake control of the House, primarily with female candidates, in 2018.

Despite Ms. Warren’s disappointing finish, she offers the potential of a coveted endorsement to Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden, who are effectively the last candidates in the Democratic contest. She spoke with both men on March 4, according to their campaigns. She hasn’t made a decision and is assessing who would best uphold her agenda, according to a person familiar with her deliberations who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

Also read | Trump hails rival Joe Biden’s ‘incredible comeback’

In an interview after Ms. Warren’s departure was announced, Toni Van Pelt, the president of the National Organisation for Women, urged her not to back Mr. Sanders.

""She has a lot of leverage right now. We do trust her to make the right decisions on how to proceed. But we’d like her not to rush into this,” Ms. Van Pelt said. “We think that our constituents, our members, will not necessarily think of Sanders as the best choice. We wouldn’t have the Violence Against Women Act if it wasn’t for Biden’s leadership. So, we know that he’s performed. Sanders doesn’t have a record. He’s really, as far as we know, done next to nothing for women and for our issues and for the things that are our priorities.”

Ms. Warren’s campaign began with enormous promise. Last summer, she drew tens of thousands of supporters to Manhattan’s Washington Square Park, a scene that was repeated in places like Washington state and Minnesota.

She had a compelling message, calling for “structural change” to the American political system to reorder the nation’s economy in the name of fairness. She had a signature populist proposal for a 2% wealth tax she wanted to impose on households worth more than $50 million that prompted chants of “Two cents! Two cents!” at rallies across the country.

Ms. Warren hit her stride as she hammered the idea that more moderate Democratic candidates, including Mr. Biden, weren’t ambitious enough to roll back President Donald Trump’s policies and were too reliant on political consultants and fickle polling. And she drew strength in the #MeToo era, especially after a wave of female candidates helped Democrats take control of the U.S. House in 2018.

But there was also tumult, notably after she released a DNA test in response to goading by Mr. Trump to prove she had Native American ancestry. Instead of quieting critics who had questioned her claims, however, the test offended many tribal leaders who rejected undergoing the genetic test as culturally insensitive, and it didn’t stop Mr. Trump and other Republicans from gleefully deriding her as “Pocahontas”.

Ms. Warren couldn’t consolidate the support of the Democratic Party’s most liberal wing against Mr. Sanders.

Both supported universal, government-sponsored health care under a “Medicare for All” programme, tuition-free public college and aggressive climate change fighting measures as part of the “Green New Deal” while forgoing big fundraisers in favor of small donations fueled by the internet.

Ms. Warren’s poll numbers began to slip after a series of debates in which she repeatedly refused to answer direct questions about if she’d have to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All. Her top advisers were slow to catch on that not providing more details looked to voters like a major oversight for a candidate who proudly had so many other policy plans.

When Ms. Warren finally moved to correct the problem, her support eroded further. She moved away from a full endorsement of Medicare for All, announcing that she’d work with Congress to transition the country to the program over three years. In the meantime, she said, many Americans could “choose” to remain with their current, private health insurance plans, which most people have through their employers. Biden and other rivals pounced, calling Ms. Warren a flip-flopper, and her standing with progressives sagged.

Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, wasted little time capitalising on the contrast by boasting that he would ship a full Medicare for All programme for congressional approval during his first week in the White House. After long avoiding direct conflict, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders clashed in January after she said Mr. Sanders had suggested during a private meeting in 2018 that a woman couldn’t win the White House. Mr. Sanders denied that, and Ms. Warren refused to shake his outstretched hand after a debate in Iowa.

Ms. Warren got a foil for all of her opposition to powerful billionaires when former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg entered the race. During a debate in Las Vegas just before Nevada’s caucus, Ms. Warren hammered Mr. Bloomberg, and the ex-mayor’s lackluster response touched off events that ended with him leaving the race on March 4.

For Ms. Warren, that led to a sharp rise in fundraising but didn’t translate to electoral success. She tried to stress her ability to unite the fractured Democratic party, but that message fell flat.

By South Carolina, an outside political group began pouring more than $11 million into TV advertising on Ms. Warren’s behalf, forcing her to say that, although she rejected super PACs, she’d accept their help as long as other candidates did. Her campaign shifted strategy again, saying it was betting on a contested convention.

Still the longer Ms. Warren stayed in the race, the more questions she faced about why she was doing so with little hope of winning — and she started to sound like a candidate who was slowly coming to terms with that.

""I’m not somebody who has been looking at myself in the mirror since I was 12 years old saying, ‘You should run for president’,” Ms. Warren said aboard her campaign bus on the eve of the New Hampshire primary. “I started running for office later than anyone who is in this, so it was never about the office - it was about what we could do to repair our economy, what we could do to mend a democracy that’s being pulled apart. That’s what I want to see happen, and I just want to see it happen.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/drizm6/article30993329.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXELECTION2020ELIZABETHWARREN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-presidential-election-2020-elizabeth-warren-suspends-democratic-white-house-bid-reports-new-york-times/article30993330.ece
21,2020/03/05,"Putin, Erdogan hold talks over Syria conflict","Their armies are facing off in Idlib

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday began talks over a potential ceasefire in northern Syria with his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan by offering condolences over the recent killing of Turkish soldiers there.

Mr. Putin, speaking alongside Mr. Erdogan at the Kremlin, said the situation in Idlib province, where their armies are facing off in a war that has displaced nearly a million people in three months, had become so tense it required one-on-one talks.

Mr. Erdogan said he hoped the meeting, which was initiated by Mr. Putin, would agree measures to ease the conflict.

A senior Turkish official said that the two leaders were likely to agree to a ceasefire, after weeks of diplomacy failed to halt fighting between Turkey and allied Syrian rebels and Russian-backed Syrian government forces. “Political diplomacy will be more determinant today than military diplomacy,” the official said.

22,2020/03/05,ICC judges say Afghan war crimes probe must go ahead,"It can also look at possible atrocities committed by U.S. forces

International war crimes judges ruled on Thursday that a probe into wartime abuses in Afghanistan must go ahead, including looking into possible atrocities committed by U.S. forces, as they overturned a previous court ruling.

The move was immediately hailed by human rights organisations as a “pivotal moment” for victims of the central Asian country’s 18-year-war since the 2001 U.S. invasion.

The U.S. government, which bitterly opposes the probe, did not immediately comment.

“Today’s decision is a pivotal moment for victims in Afghanistan and beyond,” said Guissou Jahangiri, Deputy President of the International Federation for Human Rights. “The decision also sends a much-needed signal to current and would-be perpetrators of atrocities that justice may one day catch up to them,” Human Rights Watch’s Param-Preet Singh added.

Interest of justice

Pre-trial judges at the International Criminal Court last year rejected a demand by its chief prosecutor to open a full-blown probe into crimes committed in the war-torn nation.

Prosecutors at The Hague appealed the move, saying that the judges made an error when they slapped down Fatou Bensouda’s request by saying although it met all the right criteria and a reasonable basis, it was “not in the interest of justice”.

The appeals judges agreed with the prosecution. The prosecutor has been “authorised to commence an investigation” since May 1, 2013. “It is for the prosecutor to determine whether there is a reasonable basis to initiate an investigation.”

In fact, the appeals judges said, prosecutors could even look into possible atrocities outside of Afghanistan if they were clearly linked to its armed conflict.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/icc-judges-say-afghan-war-crimes-probe-must-go-ahead/article30993210.ece

A new draft law that could make it easier for foreigners to gain permanent residency in China has stirred up a torrent of xenophobia online.

The proposal, released by the Justice Ministry last week, has been gathering billions of views and a flood of angry posts on social media, targeting Africans in particular. “China’s forty years of family planning policy does not make it a place for foreign trash to soar,” wrote one user on the Twitter-like platform Weibo, referring to the one-child birth limit China imposed between 1980 and 2016.

The person went on to use racist language against black people, saying: “Our common Chinese ancestry will not be tainted by Africans.”

Some Weibo-users posted videos of black people apparently committing crimes in China, while a campaign to encourage Chinese women to date Chinese men, under the hashtag “China girl”, had 240 million views as of Thursday afternoon.

Another widely-shared post on Weibo read: “China is not an immigrant country.”

24,2020/03/05,U.K. court rejects Nirav Modi’s bail plea for fifth time,"The fugitive diamond merchant continued to pose a risk of absconding, says Judge

A court in United Kingdom on Thursday rejected for the fifth time the bail plea of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, who is fighting his extradition to India on charges over the nearly USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case.

Read: All you need to know about PNB-Nirav Modi case

Justice Ian Dove, who presided over the bail hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice, also concluded that the 49-year-old jeweller continued to pose a risk of absconding.

This was the fifth attempt at bail by Modi, who has been lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest in March last year and is scheduled for an extradition trial between May 11 and 15.

He appeared via videolink from prison as his legal team offered a package of “stringent” bail measures, including bail security of 4 million pound, house arrest with a 24-hour electronic tag as well as a private security guard service and a strictly monitored access to gadgets and telephones.

“There are risks involved with this applicant and the question for the court is are those risks adequately guarded against, noted Justice Dove.

Read: Why extradition of Nirav Modi would take time

“My central concern of a risk of absconding are not obviated by the measures presented,” he ruled, adding that he was unsatisfied with the arrangements presented to the court adequately contained the risks posed in the very “substantial case” of fraud and money laundering.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) barrister Nick Hearn, arguing on behalf of the Indian government, had reiterated that Modi continues to remain a flight risk and that any additional measures offered for his bail would not make a breach impossible .

Modi’s barrister, Edward Fitzgerald, argued that an offer to pay for a security guard from a reputable crisis management company offered “house arrest with effective room arrest” at his luxury apartment at Centre Point in London.

He also sought to dismiss the CPS concern of Modi continuing to interfere with witnesses due to strictly monitored access to phones and gadgets.

Health conditions

While details of Modi’s mental health were not discussed in open court, the court was told he suffers from depression and that his psychological condition was “deteriorating with the ever-increasing detention” since his arrest in March last year.

There have additionally been very disturbing number of physical attacks inside prison and he was told he was being set up for extortion, Fitzgerald added.

The Judge said he had taken those factors into account but concurred with both Justice Ingrid Simler, who denied bail at the High Court last year, as well as Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot, who had last refused Modi’s bail in November 2019.

Modi observed Thursday’s proceedings via videolink from prison and occasionally referred to some files before him.

Last week, he appeared via videolink from his prison before Judge David Robinson at the Westminster Magistrates’ Court for his routine 28-day call-over remand hearing and will next appear before the magistrates’ court on March 24.

Modi was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard on charges brought by the Indian government. During subsequent hearings, Westminster Magistrates’ Court was told that Modi was the “principal beneficiary” of the fraudulent issuance of letters of undertaking (LoUs) as part of a conspiracy to defraud PNB and then laundering the proceeds of crime.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/u8f9wx/article26677342.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIRAVMODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-court-rejects-nirav-modis-bail-plea-for-fifth-time/article30991652.ece
25,2020/03/05,"Russian, Turkish presidents meet as Syria violence continues","A Russia-backed Syrian offensive to regain control over Idlib — the last opposition-controlled region in the country — has pushed nearly a million Syrians toward Turkey

The Turkish and Russian presidents are set to hold talks in Moscow aimed at ending hostilities in northwestern Syria involving their forces along with proxies that threaten to pit Turkey against Russia in a direct military conflict

Before the latest crisis, President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had managed to coordinate their interests in Syria even though Moscow backed Syrian President Bashar Assad while Ankara supported its foes throughout Syria’s nine-year war. Both Russia and Turkey appear eager to avoid a showdown, but the sharply conflicting interests in Idlib province make it difficult to negotiate a mutually acceptable compromise.

A Russia-backed Syrian offensive to regain control over Idlib — the last opposition-controlled region in the country — has pushed nearly a million Syrians toward Turkey. Mr. Erdogan responded by opening Turkey’s gateway to Europe in an apparent bid to coerce the West to offer more support to Ankara.

Also Read UN chief urges Syria cease-fire but Russia and China oppose

Turkey has sent thousands of troops into Idlib to repel the Syrian army, and clashes on the ground and in the air that have left dozens dead on both sides. Russia, which has helped Mr. Assad reclaim most of the country’s territory, has signalled it wouldn’t sit idle to see Turkey rout his troops.

After Turkey had downed several Syrian jets, Moscow warned Ankara that its aircraft would be unsafe if they enter Syrian airspace — a veiled threat to engage Russian military assets in Syria.

Also read | Is the endgame near in Syria’s civil war?

Russian warplanes based in Syria have provided air cover for Mr. Assad’s offensive in Idlib.

Opposition activists in Idlib blamed Russian aircraft for Thursday’s strike on a rebel-held village which they said killed at least 15 people, including children, and wounded several others. The Russian military had no immediate comment on the claim, but it has staunchly denied similar previous claims insisting it hasn’t targeted residential areas.

Fighting continues

The fighting in Idlib comes as the most severe test to Russia-Turkey ties since the crisis triggered by Turkey’s downing of a Russian warplane near the Syrian border in November 2015. Russia responded with an array of sweeping economic sanctions, cutting the flow of its tourists to Turkey and banning most Turkish exports — a punishment that eventually forced Turkey to back off and offer apologies.

Turkey can’t afford a replay of that costly crisis, far less a military conflict with a nuclear power, but it has a strong position to bargain with. Moscow needs Ankara as a partner in a Syrian settlement and Russia’s supply routes for its forces in Syria lie through the Turkish Straits.

Moscow also hopes to use Ankara in its standoff with the West. Last year, Turkey became the first NATO country to take delivery of sophisticated Russian air defence missile systems, angering the United States. Turkey has put its deployment on hold amid the crisis in Idlib.

The talks in Moscow will mark the 10th encounter in just over a year between Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan, who call each other “dear friend” and have polished a fine art of bargaining.

Last October, they reached an agreement to deploy their forces across Syria’s northeastern border to fill the void left by President Donald Trump’s abrupt withdrawal of U.S. forces. Prior to that they had negotiated a series of accords that saw opposition fighters from various areas in Syria move into Idlib and in 2018 carved out a de-escalation zone in Idlib.

They blamed one another for the collapse of the Idlib deal, with Moscow holding Ankara responsible for letting al-Qaida linked militants launch attacks from the area and Turkey accusing Moscow of failing to rein in Mr. Assad.

A possible compromise on Idlib could see Mr. Assad retain control over the key M5 highway, which his forces claimed in the latest offensive. The road that spans Syria linking Damascus with Aleppo, the country’s commercial capital, is essential for Mr. Assad to consolidate his rule.

In a sign that the Kremlin firmly intends to secure control of the M5, earlier this week Russian military police have deployed to a strategic town of Saraqeb sitting on the highway to ward off any Turkish attempt to retake it.

In return, Mr. Putin could accept the presence of Turkey-backed militants in the areas alongside the border and put brakes for now on Mr. Assad’s attempts to claim full control over Idlib.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xhrpxm/article30990768.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THLTTURKISHANDRUSSIANPRESIDENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russian-turkish-presidents-meet-as-syria-violence-continues/article30990769.ece

Iran will set up checkpoints to limit travel between major cities and urged citizens on March 5 to reduce their use of paper money to fight a spreading outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed at least 107 people across the Islamic Republic.

The announcement in Iran came as Palestinian authorities said the storied Nativity Church in the biblical city of Bethlehem, built atop the spot where Christians believe Jesus was born, will close indefinitely later in the day over coronavirus fears.

Also read | India in touch with Iran to evacuate its nationals, says Health Minister

These mark the latest disruptions of life across the Mideast from the new virus, which has seen over 3,740 confirmed cases.

Iran’s Health Minister Saeed Namaki announced his country’s new restrictions at a televised press conference. He added that schools and universities will remain closed through Nowruz, the Persian New Year, on March 20.

He said people should stay in their vehicles at gas stations and allow attendants to fill their gas tanks to avoid the spread of the virus.

Iran and Italy have the world’s highest death tolls outside of China.

The Palestinian Health Ministry meanwhile said it was preventing all tourists from entering the West Bank. The ministry did not specify for how long. Most tourists to the West Bank visit the biblical city of Bethlehem, where the Nativity Church is located, and Jericho.

The measures comes after suspicions that four Palestinians had caught the new coronavirus. A Palestinian official said the four had tested positive for the virus but that the tests were sent to Israel to verify the results.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorised to discuss the issue with the media. They would be the Palestinian territories’ first cases if confirmed.

The Palestinian Health Ministry also said churches and places of worship in Bethlehem will be closed for two weeks.

Earlier on March 5, the United Arab Emirates warned its citizens and its foreign residents not to travel anywhere abroad amid the ongoing worldwide coronavirus outbreak, a stark warning for a country home to two major long-haul airlines.

The country’s Health and Community Protection Ministry warning comes as its capital, Abu Dhabi, sent 215 foreigners it evacuated from hard-hit Hubei in China to a quarantine set up in its Emirates Humanitarian City. They include citizens of Egypt, Sudan and Yemen.

Health officials warned that those travelling abroad could face quarantine themselves at the discretion of authorities. The UAE is home to some 9 million people, with only about 1 million estimated to be Emirati citizens.

The UAE is home to Emirates, the government-owned airline based at Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel. Abu Dhabi also is home to Etihad, the country’s national carrier. Both airlines have encouraged staff to take time off as international travel has dropped due to the virus.

Italy closed all schools and universities and barred fans from all sporting events for the next few weeks, as governments trying to curb the spread of the coronavirus around the world resorted to increasingly sweeping measures that transformed the way people work, shop, pray and amuse themselves.

With the virus present in more than 80 countries, Saudi Arabia barred citizens from making the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, Iran canceled Friday prayers for a second week, and leader after leader pleaded with citizens to put an end to that traditional symbol of mutual trust, the handshake.

The Italian government decreed that soccer games and other sporting events will take place without spectators until at least April 3. Italy is is the epicenter of Europe’s coronavirus outbreak. More than 3,000 have been infected and at least 107 have died, the most of any country outside China, where the illness began.

Italy also closed schools for 8.4 million students through March 15, after at least four other countries — Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Iraq — took similar action.

""I know it’s a decision with an impact. As education minister, I obviously want my students back in school as soon as possible,” said Education Minister Lucia Azzolina.

Italy, Iran and South Korea confronted fast-growing clusters of the disease that accounted for about 80% of new cases outside China, according to the World Health Organization. In all, more than 95,000 people have contracted the virus worldwide, with more than 3,200 deaths.

In the United States, the death toll reached 11.

Iran reported 92 deaths among its more than 2,900 cases, though many fear the outbreak is far bigger. Among the ill are dozens of members of the government. The Islamic republic canceled Friday prayers to avoid public gatherings.

""The virus has no wings to fly,” said Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour. “We are the ones who transfer it to each other.”

WHO said about 3.4% of people infected with the COVID-19 virus globally have died, making it more lethal than the common flu. But that figure was met with skepticism, with scientists noting that large numbers of mild cases have probably gone undetected or unreported. A study last week in the New England Journal of Medicine of data from more than 30 Chinese provinces estimated the death rate at 1.4%.

In Daegu, the South Korean city at the center of that country’s outbreak, a shortage of hospital space meant about 2,300 patients were being cared for in other facilities while they awaited a hospital bed. Prime Minister Chung Se-Kyun sought to assure people in the southeastern city, saying, “We will win the war against COVID-19.”

South Korea reported 145 new infections Thursday, raising its total to 5,766, second-highest in the world.

In Europe, officials told French soccer players to simply disperse — without shaking hands — after lining up, and referees and coaches will no longer shake hands either. In Paris, the Louvre finally reopened after closing because of fears among workers about catching the virus from visitors, but it will no longer accept cash, because of the danger of germs.

A news conference at Milan’s Triennale contemporary art and design museum looked like an exhibit itself, with journalists’ chairs spaced more than a yard (meter) apart.

In Israel, the country’s chief rabbi urged observant Jews to refrain from kissing the mezuza, the small box containing a prayer scroll that is posted by Jews on their doorposts. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also urged people to adopt the Indian greeting of ‘namaste’, with hands together, rather than a handshake.

Businesses of all types suffered a downturn as travel and tourism plummeted and worried consumers changed their habits.

“People are afraid to touch anything or take anything from us,” said Maedeh Jahangiri, a perfume seller at a mall in Tehran.

China reported 139 new cases Thursday and 31 deaths, raising its totals to 80,409 cases and 3,012 deaths. The number of cases was higher than Wednesday’s figure, but new deaths were lower, as the illness continues to decline in the country. While hardest-hit Hubei province had most of the new cases and deaths, hospitals there released another 1,923 patients who were declared cured.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday encouraged his countrymen to adopt ‘Namaste’ — the Indian way of greeting — instead of the normal handshake as one of the measures to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

At a press conference following a review meeting to fight the spread of coronavirus, Mr. Netanyahu said that several measures will be announced to prevent the spread of coronavirus but some simple measures like avoiding the normal handshake while greeting people may possibly be replaced with other forms of greetings like the Indian ‘Namaste’.

He also demonstrated at the press conference as to how the Indians do ‘Namaste’ while greeting people.

Mr. Netanyahu said that “we are in the middle of a global epidemic”, but Israel has done well as it was quick in taking action to prevent the spread of the virus in the country.

“We have had to take rigorous steps to slow the spread of the disease in Israel, we have taken select isolation and flight policies and measures for flights,” he added.

Israel has 15 confirmed cases of the deadly virus but no deaths, with some 7,000 others in home-quarantine.

Health Minister Yaacov Litzman announced a ban on public gatherings of more than 5,000 people.

“We will not hesitate to do things even if they are unpopular. I don’t want to call it an epidemic — but it’s not far from it,” he said.

31,2020/03/05,"U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom hears witnesses on NRC, CAA","‘Denying citizenship to certain group can be understood by some as a signal to carry out attacks on it’

A week after Delhi’s riots, India and Myanmar were the subjects of discussion at a hearing in Washington organised by an independent bipartisan federal government commission, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF).

In addition to discussing the Rohingya situation in Myanmar , the hearing also focussed on the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India.

While there are no automatic legal outcomes from this hearing, the hearing is another instance of the Modi administration’s record on human rights, equal protection and the rule of law coming under persistent and increasing scrutiny from the U.S. Congress and parts of the U.S. administration.

The panel of witnesses consisted of Brown University professor and author Ashutosh Varshney; a human rights lawyer from Assam, Aman Wadud both of whom spoke entirely on the Indian situation. The other witnesses were Azeem Ibrahim an author and director at the Center for Global Policy and Naomi Kikoler, a director at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

“The Holocaust is a glaring example of how denial or revocation of citizenship on the basis of ethnic or religious identity can help to foster an environment where genocide is possible,” said Ms. Kikoler , the first witness to speak.

“The Nazis sought, starting in 1933, to use a law to curtail the rights of Jews and others who were deemed ‘racially unacceptable’. They did so at first by targeting freedom of speech, assembly and the press.”

Ms. Kikoler pointed to the Nuremberg Laws that shortly followed: ‘The Right to Citizenship Law’ and ‘The Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour’.

“Overnight over 500,000 German Jews were no longer German, rather they were subjects of the German state,” Ms Kikoler said, adding that that citizenship became a “life and death” factor as the Holocaust progressed. Ms Kikoler explained that denying citizenship to certain group can be understood by some as a signal to carry out physical attacks on this group.

Mr. Varshney, who said whether the NRC comes into question or not, that it creates “an enabling atmosphere for violence.”

“Once you say a particular community is not fully Indian or its Indian-ness is in grave doubt, you begin to marginalize them in politics and you begin to generate a certain discourse against them in politics …about their loyalty, about their commitment to the nation…the way they raise their children, the way they marry.”

“The NRC exercise proved harsh on many belonging to marginalised communities. People had to sell their cattle and jewellery, lose working days to attend NRC hearings. Many experienced mental trauma because of fear of losing citizenship — and there are also reports of suicide associated with such trauma,” Mr Wadud said in his opening remarks [as per prepared testimony].

Mr. Varshney talked about four theoretically possible ways to resist the citizenship law and registration changes. One is judicial review. Second is federalism – Mr Varshey said 12 Indian states have said they will not implement the NRC. Third, non-violent protests , i.e., civil disobedience, which is legal. Fourth, international opinion; non-governmental such as what the international media is saying and the second is governmental opinion from abroad.

In response to question from USCIRF Commissioner Anurima Bhargava on the role of the judiciary in facilitating some of the processes in Myanmar and India, Mr Varshney described a mixed history “full of ups and downs” for the Indian judiciary. He said there are doubts about whether it will act independently but did not advise giving up on the judiciary.

“The reason I don't want to give up on the judiciary is that India actually has a bench system,” Mr. Varshney said. ""… depending on the nature of the bench and depending on which judges are on the bench…the decision could go in favour of citizens as opposed to the government. So …the idea of giving up on the judiciary as a principle is not a good one.”

Speaking of Foreign Secretary Harsh Shringla’s assurance to Dhaka earlier this week that the National Register of Citizens (NRC) would have no implications for Bangladesh , Mr Waded said, “So basically the intent is not deportation. So what do you want to do with these people? … If you detain …what after detentions?”

Even if the citizenship of certain groups is not impacted, there are dangers to the process, witnesses said. “Finally , even if people are not stripped of citizenship, the process of proving citizenship is very, very traumatic. The fear of losing citizenship can actually kill you,” Mr. Wadud said.

Avoid irresponsible comments: India tells USCIRF

In the aftermath of the riots in Delhi, ‘unsubstantiated’ comments should be avoided, said an official of the Ministry of External Affairs on Thursday.

“We are trying to say these are sensitive times and at this point of time irresponsible comments that are selective and not based on facts will do more damage and we expect and urge them to not make such comments. Focus at this point in time is on restoring normalcy,” said Raveesh Kumar, official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs.

Mr. Kumar said the situation in the northeastern parts of the national capital is fast returning to normalcy. He also said India has sent a strong diplomatic message to Turkey after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan condemned the killings.

“They are factually inaccurate and driven by his own political agenda. We made a strong demarche to the Turkish Ambassador here on March 3,” said Mr. Kumar about President Erdogan’s comments.

Lufthansa will ground 150 aircraft out of its total fleet of around 770 due to the coronavirus, the German airline said on March 4, confirming what company sources had told Reuters earlier. “We are dynamically adjusting our plans to reflect extraordinary circumstances,” a Lufthansa spokesman said, adding that 25 of the 150 grounded aircraft are long-haul jets.

Last week Lufthansa said it had grounded 23 long-haul aircraft.

European airline bosses warned on Tuesday that the worst is still to come for the airline industry in terms of economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak, but they predicted that travel demand could stabilise in the coming weeks.

Lufthansa Group airlines, which include Swiss, Brussels and Austrian airlines, had already said on Friday that it would reduce the number of short- and medium-haul flights by up to 25% in the coming weeks depending on how coronavirus spreads.

Lufthansa said on Monday that it was extending the suspension of flights to China until April 24, to Tehran until April 30 and reducing services to northern Italy due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Lufthansa has said it was too early to assess the impact on its earnings, which are due to be published on March 19.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4hbzm1/article30987571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GERMANY-WAGES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-lufthansa-to-ground-150-aircraft/article30987572.ece
33,2020/03/05,NATO chief warns of hard road to Afghan peace as violence soars,"The militants have ramped up violence against Afghan forces since signing a deal with Washington at the weekend, casting doubt over peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban

Western forces will only leave Afghanistan if the Taliban make good on their commitment to reduce bloodshed, the head of NATO warned Wednesday, as attacks surge.

The militants have ramped up violence against Afghan forces since signing a deal with Washington at the weekend, casting doubt over peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban, due to begin on March 10.

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that a “long and hard” road to peace lay ahead but warned the Taliban that if they reneged on the agreement, foreign forces would not leave.

“It is a very difficult situation and Taliban must honour their commitment. We need to see reduction in violence,” Stoltenberg told AFP in an interview in Zagreb, where he attended a meeting of EU defence ministers.

“We can only deliver our side of the deal if Taliban deliver their side of the deal.”

US President Donald Trump has touted the deal, signed in Doha, as a way to end the bloody 18-year US military presence in Afghanistan.

But overnight, Taliban militants killed at least 20 Afghan soldiers and policemen in a string of attacks in the latest breach of the partial truce.

Under the terms of the deal, US and other foreign forces will quit Afghanistan within 14 months, subject to Taliban security guarantees and a pledge by the insurgents to hold talks with the government of President Ashraf Ghani.

‘No alternative’

NATO, which has a 16,000-strong training and support mission in Afghanistan, has long insisted it would only leave when conditions were right -- in particular that terrorists could not use the country as a springboard for attacks abroad.

“The agreement that was signed on Saturday was an important first step, but it’s only a first step,” said Stoltenberg, who as prime minister of Norway sent troops to Afghanistan following the US-led invasion that overthrew the Taliban in 2001.

“The road towards peace will be long and hard and we have to be prepared for disappointments.”

“At the same time there is no alternative. The only way to have a peaceful solution is a negotiated agreement and to talk to Taliban.”

With an election coming up in November, Trump is keen to make good on pledge to end America’s longest war, but observers say it appears the Taliban have yet to be convinced to come to the negotiating table with Kabul.

Barely three days after signing the partial truce deal, the Taliban announced they were resuming their offensive against Afghan government forces.

In a sign of their intent, the militants have mounted 30 attacks in 15 of the country’s 34 provinces in the space of 24 hours, according to the Afghan interior ministry.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cc3mr4/article30987201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CROATIA-NATO-DEFENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nato-chief-warns-of-hard-road-to-afghan-peace-as-violence-soars/article30987203.ece
34,2020/03/05,"COVID-19 | Virus halts pilgrimages to Mecca, Friday prayers in Iran","The decisions in Riyadh and Tehran affected both Sunni and Shiite Muslims alike

The coronavirus outbreak disrupted Islamic worship in the Middle East as Saudi Arabia on Wednesday banned its citizens and other residents of the kingdom from performing the pilgrimage in Mecca, while Iran cancelled on Friday prayers in major cities.

The decisions in Riyadh and Tehran affected both Sunni and Shiite Muslims alike.

The Saudi move expands a ban last week on foreigners visiting Mecca and Medina, home to the holiest sites in Islam. That decision alone disrupted travel for thousands of Muslims already headed to the kingdom and potentially affects plans later this year for millions more ahead of the fasting month of Ramadan and the annual hajj pilgrimage.

Even after that Feb. 27 announcement, people already in Saudi Arabia could still travel to Mecca’s Grand Mosque, where pilgrims circle the black, cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims around the world pray toward five times a day. The crowds were far smaller than usual before Wednesday’s statement from an unidentified Interior Ministry official that was carried by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.

Millions attend the annual hajj, which this year is set for late July into early August, and many more visit the kingdom’s holy sites year round. Those other pilgrimages are referred to as the umrah, which drew 7.5 million foreigners in 2019 alone.

It remains unclear how the ban will be enforced. The government described the suspension as “temporary,” but gave no hint at when it will be lifted. The ban also appeared to encompass the Prophet Muhammad’s Mosque in nearby Medina.

The decision seeks to “limit the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic and prevent its access to the Two Holy Mosques, which are witnessing a permanent and intense flow of human crowds, which makes the issue of securing these crowds of utmost importance,” the Saudi government said.

In Iran, authorities halted on Friday prayers in all provincial capitals amid the country’s growing coronavirus outbreak, which has killed at least 92 people amid 2,922 confirmed cases. Iran and Italy have the world’s highest death tolls outside of China.

“This disease is a widespread one,” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told his Cabinet, according to a transcript. “It encompasses almost all of our provinces and is, in a sense, a global disease that many countries in the world have become infected with, and we must work together to tackle this problem as quickly as possible.”

The announcement came a week after a similar order affected Tehran and several other major cities.

While observant Muslims can pray at home, the devout prefer to attend on Friday prayers as a community. Iran’s Shiite theocracy also use the services to share ideological messages by clergymen selected by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

There are now over 3,150 cases of the virus across the Mideast. Of those outside Iran in the region, most link back to the Islamic Republic.

Top leaders in Iran’s civilian government and Shiite theocracy have become infected with the virus. The country stands alone in how the virus has affected its government, even compared to hard-hit China, the epicenter of the outbreak. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 90,000 people and caused over 3,100 deaths.

Experts continue to worry that Iran may be under-reporting its cases.

“The spread of the virus to almost all of Iran’s provinces leave little doubt that the authorities are struggling to contain the outbreak,” wrote Torbjorn Soltvedt, an analyst at the risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. “After a slow and politicized response to the outbreak, the government now faces a race against time to prevent a public health emergency from turning into an economic crisis.”

Authorities in Iran said they arrested a man for posting a video online of bodies wrapped in white shrouds and zipped into black body bags at a cemetery in Qom on Monday.

The video purports to show over 30 corpses waiting to be washed per Islamic tradition, with a man’s voice alleging all were “corona-infected.”

Ali Ramezani, the executive manager of the Qom cemetery, later told state television that authorities were awaiting the outcome of coronavirus tests on them before they were prepared for burial. Bodies testing positive are buried by staff wearing gloves and protective gear, and the graves are lined with lime.

“If the test results are negative, then there is no need to bury them based on the protocol for the new coronavirus and the family can receive the body of their loved ones and bury it where they want,” Ramezani said.

Eshaq Jahangiri, Iran’s senior vice president, meanwhile banned all overseas trips for officials to attend international events, the semiofficial ISNA news agency reported. That did not affect Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh, who traveled with an entourage to Vienna for an OPEC meeting.

Rouhani, in his Cabinet meeting, acknowledged the toll the outbreak was taking on the public. He called on state television to offer “happier” programs to entertain those stuck at home.

“I urge all artists, scientists, psychologists and all who can bring smiles to people’s faces, come into the social media,” he said. “Today, words that make people tired are no longer advantageous.”

In Israel, Chief Rabbi David Lau urged observant Jews to refrain from kissing the “mezuzah,” a small item encasing a prayer scroll that is attached to doorposts. Observant Jews typically touch the item and then kiss their hands when walking through a doorway.

The Iraqi Health Ministry said an elderly woman in Baghdad who tested positive for the coronavirus has died. In Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, officials said they suspected a 70-year-old man near the border with Iran also died of the disease, although authorities in Baghdad had not confirmed his infection.

35,2020/03/05,"After Biden speech disrupted, U.S. lawmakers want Secret Service to protect candidates","Mr. Biden’s remarks in Los Angeles were briefly interrupted on Tuesday night when a pair of protesters leapt onto the stage

U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday sought Secret Service protection for Democratic presidential candidates after Joe Biden’s wife and a senior staffer shielded the former vice president from protesters during a victory speech on Super Tuesday.

Biden’s remarks in Los Angeles were briefly interrupted on Tuesday night when a pair of protesters leapt onto the stage, Jill Biden and senior adviser Symone Sanders charged them and ushered them offstage.

The activists opposed the dairy industry, and protesters with the same agenda have disrupted events with Biden’s presidential rival Senator Bernie Sanders.

“We’re OK,” Biden said after the incident, which highlighted a glaring hole in security for Biden and other top contenders seeking the Democratic nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election.

A Secret Service spokeswoman confirmed that no Democratic candidate was currently being protected. Any decision to provide protection would be made by Chad Wolf, acting secretary of homeland security, in consultation with congressional authorities.

A representative for DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“The Democratic Congress is worried,” Representative Cedric Richmond, a Biden supporter, told reporters on a conference call. The U.S. House of Representatives’ Homeland Security Committee requested Secret Service protection for both Biden and Sanders.

The Secret Service provides security for the president and his family, including lifetime support for former occupants of the Oval Office. Major presidential candidates are also provided with protection on a case-by-case basis and closer to the general election.

Federal law authorizes Secret Service protection for vice presidents and their families for up to six months after they leave office.

There have been a number of serious attacks on presidential candidates in the past. Senator Robert Kennedy was fatally shot in Los Angeles in 1968 after his victory in the California Democratic primary and Alabama Governor George Wallace was left paralyzed from the waist down after being shot at a campaign appearance in Maryland in 1972.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/toaefu/article30986840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-ELECTIONBIDEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/after-biden-speech-disrupted-us-lawmakers-want-secret-service-to-protect-candidates/article30986841.ece
36,2020/03/05,Trump hails rival Joe Biden’s ‘incredible comeback’,"Mr. Trump noted that decisions by Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar to drop out and endorse Biden had electrified the former vice president’s campaign

President Donald Trump on Wednesday hailed Democrat Joe Biden’s “incredible comeback” in the primaries race and signaled how he will attack the new frontrunner, saying he was surrounded by far leftists.

“It was a great comeback for Joe Biden, an incredible comeback when you think about it,” Trump told reporters at the White House the morning after the Democrats’ Super Tuesday polls.

Biden is running as a moderate, in contrast to his leftist rival Bernie Sanders, but Trump insisted that some of the former vice president’s “handlers are further left than Bernie. That’s pretty scary.”

In his first public comments on the dramatic events of Super Tuesday -- other than a series of mocking tweets -- Trump also said that Sanders could easily have won if liberal Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren had dropped out earlier, thereby not splitting his vote.

Trump noted that decisions by two centrists — Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar — to drop out and endorse Biden had electrified the previously struggling vice president’s campaign.

Had Warren done something similar to help Sanders, then the self-described democratic socialist, who is calling for a political revolution, “would have won a lot of states.”

“She was really a spoiler, because other people got out and those votes went to Joe. Those people really helped Joe, you know, by getting out early,” Trump said.

“Had she gotten out, it would have been a very different situation, I think. It would have been a very different night.”

Trump also had a typically bitter appraisal of billionaire Mike Bloomberg’s flat performance, despite having spent a record hundreds of millions of his own dollars on creating a campaign.

Bloomberg quit the race on Wednesday, throwing his support and likely bottomless funding behind Biden.

Trump dismissed the importance of this, saying “he’s going to try and save face by putting some money into Biden’s campaign. We’ll see what happens. I don’t think that’s going to have an impact.”

“He’s doing that because he’s spiteful, he’s a spiteful guy, I know him well,” Trump said. “He made a fool out of himself.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-hails-rival-joe-bidens-incredible-comeback/article30986763.ece
37,2020/03/05,Netanyahu still short of majority after Israel’s election,"In an angry tirade, Mr. Netanyahu conceded that he did not have the parliamentary support to form a new government right away

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fallen short of capturing the majority needed to form a government, near-final election results showed on Wednesday, deepening a year of political deadlock and appearing to dash the long-serving leader’s hopes for a decisive victory as his trial on corruption charges nears.

In an angry tirade, Mr. Netanyahu conceded that he did not have the parliamentary support to form a new government right away. But he still tried to claim victory as he lashed out at his main opponent and disparaged the leading Arab party — the third largest in parliament — as irrelevant.

“This is what the nation decided,” he said. “The public gave me more votes than any other candidate for prime minister in the nation’s history.”

After failing to form a government following two general elections last year and with his legal woes closing in, Netanyahu had been hoping for a clear win in Monday’s vote. With initial exit polls predicting a near majority for Netanyahu and his nationalist-religious allies, he declared a “great victory” to thousands of jubilant supporters under a torrent of confetti on election night.

But Wednesday’s near-final tally painted a different picture. With over 99% of the votes counted, Netanyahu’s Likud led the way with 36 seats, ahead of challenger Benny Gantz’s Blue and White party, with 33 seats. Yet with his allies, Netanyahu’s right-wing camp held a total of only 58 seats, three shy of the 61 needed to form a government and no clear path to reaching the threshold. Final results are expected later on Wednesday.

In a stunning rebuke to Netanyahu, the Joint List, an umbrella group of Arab-led parties, finished third with 15 seats. It was an all-time high for the Joint List, boosted by voters furious at what was perceived as racist incitement by Netanyahu throughout the campaign against the country’s Arab minority.

“Our public feels its power and it wants to exert that power,” Joint List leader Ayman Odeh told Israeli Channel 13 TV. “We said no to Benjamin Netanyahu’s approach.”

In a meeting with his political allies on Wednesday, Netanyahu continued to portray himself as a winner, despite the likely impasse he faces.

“The Likud under my leadership became the largest party in a knockout,” he said. “The public’s decision must be respected.”

The Joint List “isn’t even part of the equation,” he said, claiming its members are hostile to the state.

While the Arab parties have never sat in an Israeli coalition, they have worked to support policies from the outside, a step they could take again if they can resolve their differences with Gantz.

Gantz also has ruled out a partnership with the Joint List, making it unlikely he can cobble together a coalition either. That means Israel appears headed for deadlock, extending nearly a year of political paralysis.

Mr. Netanyahu had been desperate for a strong showing ahead of his trial, which is scheduled to start on March 17. Installing a new government would give him an important political boost and potentially allow him to legislate his way out of the legal quagmire.

“There isn’t another politician in the world who could have won the largest number of votes after having failed twice to form a government and after having been indicted on three charges,” political commentator Ari Shavit wrote on the Makor Rishon news site. “Nevertheless, Netanyahu and his partners ought to bear in mind that their goal of 61 seats has not been achieved yet. Their hope for a decisive victory was dashed.”

Mr. Netanyahu was indicted last year on fraud, bribery and breach of trust charges in three separate corruption cases. He denies wrongdoing, saying the charges have been trumped up by a liberal media and a justice system looking to oust him. As Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu can not only use his position as a bully pulpit to rally public support but he and his allies also can try to craft legislation to delay or derail prosecution.

Under Israeli law, a sitting Prime Minister is not required to resign if indicted. But the law is fuzzy about whether a candidate for Prime Minister under indictment can be given authority to form a new government, and the country’s Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the matter.

Israel’s President will soon begin consultations with the elected parties, which then recommend to him their preferred selection to lead the government. Typically, the candidate with the most recommendations is asked to try to form a government. As leader of the largest party, that is likely to be Mr. Netanyahu, even if as in the previous two elections his path is unclear.

In a bid to break the deadlock, Likud and its allies have been trying to find ways to bridge the gap. They have talked about luring “defectors” from opposition parties who could tick the right-wing bloc’s numbers up. But so far, no one has come forward, and a number of rumoured defectors have issued statements denying the speculation.

Blue and White meanwhile said it would consider promoting legislation that would prevent an indicted prime minister from forming a government. But passing such legislation, particularly in the two weeks before the president taps a candidate to form a government, appeared unlikely, especially following an opinion against the idea by the Knesset’s legal adviser.

The most straightforward way out of the deadlock would be a power-sharing deal between Gantz and Netanyahu, whose parties together control a parliamentary majority. But Gantz has ruled out a partnership as long as Netanyahu heads Likud.

Netanyahu, on the other hand, insists on being prime minister of any unity government.

If neither candidate can form a government within the allotted time, Israel could face an unprecedented fourth straight election.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3f0yfx/article30986259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ISRAELELECTIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/netanyahu-still-short-of-majority-after-israels-election/article30986260.ece
38,2020/03/05,Turkey prepares human rights case over Greece's treatment of migrants,"As hundreds of Turkey-based migrants tried to cross into Greece again, riot police on both sides of the border fired tear gas and traded blame

Turkey said on Wednesday it was preparing a case in the European Court of Human Rights over Greece's treatment of migrants, and added the EU has so far made no concrete offer to deal with thousands trying to enter the bloc.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan met European Council President Charles Michel on Wednesday as hundreds of Turkey-based migrants again tried to cross into Greece, prompting riot police on both sides of the border to fire tear gas and trade blame.

Ankara earlier on Wednesday accused Greek forces of shooting dead a migrant and injuring others — claims Athens rejected and said Turkish police helped migrants illegally cross into its territory.

Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on broadcaster CNN Turk that officials are “making preparations” to apply to the ECHR over Greece's interventions with the migrants. The families of two people who died have authorized Ankara to do so.

He said that more than 135,000 people had so far passed from Turkey's border province of Edirne into Greece since late last week, citing what he called daily police observation.

The number was higher than other estimates.

The war of words between Athens and Ankara has escalated since last week when Turkey decided to no longer abide a 2016 deal with the European Union to halt illegal migration flows to Europe in return for billions of euros in aid.

Since then, more than 10,000 migrants from Afghanistan, Syria and other countries have been trying to breach the border.

Turkey, locked in a military conflict with Moscow and Damascus in Syria's Idlib region, fears another wave of Syrian refugees after already hosting some 3.6 million. It wants the EU to more forcefully back it in Syria and deliver more funds.

Ibrahim Kalin, Turkey's presidential spokesman, told reporters in Ankara that Michel made “no concrete proposition” on migrants to the EU in talks with Erdogan but added: “We hope they somehow formulate this plan soon and get it to us so we can quickly realise it in the event we reach agreement.”

He said Turkey does not consider its decision to encourage migrants to cross over into the EU as “political blackmail” as some European officials have said.

“It is a double standard that the European Union can mobilise hundreds of millions of euros to Greece within days, but uses bureaucracy as an excuse when it comes to Turkey,” Mr. Kalin added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i877to/article30986096.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GREECETURKEYMIGRANTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/turkey-prepares-human-rights-case-over-greeces-treatment-of-migrants/article30986097.ece
39,2020/03/05,"U.S. lawmakers agree $8.3 bln COVID-19 response Bill, House to debate","The Bill would devote $8.3 billion for government-sponsored initiatives, including expanding testing for the virus, which has infected at least 129 people in the United States

Legislation to control the spread of coronavirus and develop vaccines for the highly-contagious disease is set to move through the U.S. House of Representatives after congressional negotiators on Wednesday struck a deal on its provisions.

The Bill would devote $8.3 billion for government-sponsored initiatives, including expanding testing for the virus, which has infected at least 129 people in the United States. Two more deaths were reported on Wednesday, increasing the toll to 11.

The House aimed to pass the measure on Wednesday with White House backing. The Senate would then take up the Bill, aiming to send it to President Donald Trump this week for signing into law.

“We must quickly enact this legislation. Lives are at stake,” House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, a Democrat, said in a statement.

As the House prepared to debate the bill, the top four Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress received a classified briefing about contingency plans for Congress if there was a coronavirus outbreak in Washington.

An estimated 3 million people come through the Capitol Visitor Center each year.

Following the meeting, they brushed off reporters' questions on whether plans were needed for Congress to meet somewhere else or whether public access to the Capitol might eventually be curtailed.

Representative Matt Gaetz, after a separate closed briefing for Republican lawmakers with Vice President Mike Pence about coronavirus preparations nationwide, compared the House chamber to a “petri dish” for incubating germs.

“We all fly in these dirty airports, we touch and selfie everyone we meet and then we congregate together,” the Florida congressman said.

Under the bill, over $3 billion would be devoted to research and development of coronavirus vaccines, test kits and therapeutics. No vaccines or treatments for the virus are currently in place, but patients can receive supportive care.

Gaetz said that while the United States is gearing up in the production of virus test kits, “We're not where we want to be. The vice president made that very clear that we've got to get more test assets in place.”

In a bid to also help control the spread of the virus outside the United States, $1.25 billion would be available for international efforts.

The fast-spreading virus that emerged late last year in central China is now in some 80 countries, having killed 3,000 worldwide and rattled financial markets.

State and local governments would receive $950 million to support their work in combating the respiratory disease.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, a Republican, called the bill “an aggressive and comprehensive response” to the crisis.

It would provide far more money than the $2.5 billion requested by the Trump administration.

Included is more than $300 million to help cover costs of any vaccine for those who cannot afford it. The Department of Health and Human Services would be authorized to ensure vaccines' affordability in the commercial market.

Democrats and Republicans disagreed on the total amount of spending in the bill, with Republicans citing about $7.8 billion as the total due to a different accounting method for one provision.

Other provisions in the bill: -- $2.2 billion in public health funding for prevention, preparedness and response, including the $950 million to bolster state and local government efforts -- Nearly $1 billion to help procure drugs and medical supplies -- Small businesses impacted by an outbreak could qualify for low-interest federal loans.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nmv0x1/article30986068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-CHINA-HEALTH-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-lawmakers-agree-83-bln-covid-19-response-bill-house-to-debate/article30986090.ece

Coronavirus has spread to almost all of Iran's provinces but the country will get through the outbreak with a “minimum” number of deaths, President Hassan Rouhani said on Wednesday.

“This disease is a widespread disease,” he said during a Cabinet meeting, according to the official presidency website.

“It has reached almost all our provinces and in one sense it's a global disease.”

The health ministry said on Tuesday that 92 people had died so far from coronavirus, one of the highest death tolls outside China where the epidemic originated late last year. It said 2,922 people had been infected with the disease.

Among those infected is first vice president Eshaq Jahangiri, the IranWire news site reported, citing an “informed source”. There was no immediate confirmation from officials.

Several Iranian officials have come down with coronavirus and one senior official died from an infection on Monday.

The Islamic Republic has cancelled Friday prayers in all provincial capitals this week because of the coronavirus outbreak, state television reported on Wednesday.

Rouhani said Iran would get through the outbreak with a minimum number of deaths and in the shortest period of time thanks to the skills of its doctors and nurses.

He took a jab at an American offer to help with the outbreak without mentioning the United States directly.

Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States had offered to help Iran with the outbreak.

“They've appeared with a mask of sympathy that 'we also want to help the people of Iran',” Rouhani said. “If you are really telling the truth, then lift sanctions from medicine.”

President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from a multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran in 2018 and reimposed sanctions which have hammered Iran's economy.

U.S. officials have said that the sanctions do not target medicine for Iran, a point Iranian officials dispute.

Video aired on state television of Wednesday's Cabinet meeting showed Rouhani and ministers in a larger room than the usual venue for the weekly gathering.

IranWire reported that Jahangiri was quarantined last week after a government meeting on combating coronavirus that was attended by several ministers and senior officials.

Separately, Bahrain on Wednesday reported three new coronavirus cases, raising its total number to 52.

Oman also reported three new cases - two Iranians and one Omani, raising its total number to 15, according to the Omani health ministry. All three cases were related to travel to Iran, the ministry said.

And the Dubai Health Authority reported on Wednesday that a 16-year-old student had tested positive for coronavirus, raising the total number of cases in the United Arab Emirates to 28.

Three family members and a neighbour of an infected New York man have tested positive, bringing the total in New York state to six, officials said. About 1,000 people in suburban Westchester County north of the city where the family lives were under self-quarantine orders because of possible exposure to the virus, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said.

“We are, if anything, being overcautious. Mr. Cuomo said.

On the West Coast, Los Angeles officials announced six new confirmed travel-related cases in Los Angeles County, including three people who had been to northern Italy, one of the places hardest hit in the global outbreak of the virus that causes the respiratory disease called COVID-19.

Of the six, only one has been hospitalized. The other five are recovering in home isolation.

Los Angeles County declared a local emergency and a public health emergency intended to expand and hasten preparedness efforts.

In Washington, U.S. lawmakers reached bipartisan agreement on an $8.3 billion emergency bill to help fund efforts to contain the virus, a congressional aide said. The bill would be introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives later on Wednesday.

Once the full House approves the bill, the Senate is expected to act quickly so that President Donald Trump can sign the measure into law, putting funds into the pipeline to fight the virus.

More than $3 billion would be devoted to research and development of coronavirus vaccines, test kits and therapeutics. And in a bid to also help control the spread of the virus outside the United States, $1.25 billion would be set for international efforts, the aide said.

The administration is working to allow laboratories to develop their own coronavirus tests without seeking regulatory approval first, U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said.

The latest data https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed 129 confirmed and presumed cases in the United States, up from the previous 108.

They were 80 reported by public health authorities in 13 states plus 49 among people repatriated from abroad, according to the CDC website.

Classes cancelled

On Tuesday, officials said a man in his 50s who lives in a New York City suburb and works at a Manhattan law firm tested positive for the virus, the second identified case in the state.

The four new cases include three family members of the man, who is hospitalized, and a neighbour. Health authorities said one of his children was a student at Yeshiva University, which cancelled classes as a precautionary measure.

The hospitalized patient had not travelled to countries with large numbers of cases. The outbreak began in China in December and is now present in nearly 80 countries and territories, killing more than 3,000 people. The first New York case, reported last week, was in a woman who had returned from Iran, where at least 77 people have died.

Mr. Cuomo said about 300 students from New York’s college systems, SUNY and CUNY, were being recalled from five countries — China, Italy, Japan, Iran and South Korea — and would be flown on a chartered plane and then be quarantined for 14 days.

North Carolina became the 13th state to report a case on Tuesday. The person had visited a nursing home in the Seattle area of Washington state, where nine out of 27 cases reported as of Tuesday were connected to the long-term facility for the elderly. Nine people have died in the Pacific Northwest state.

The Seattle area has the largest concentration of coronavirus cases detected to date in the United States.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nmv0x1/article30986068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-CHINA-HEALTH-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-virus-hits-new-york-los-angeles-areas-us-congress-to-provide-emergency-funds/article30986069.ece
42,2020/03/05,Top French court deals blow to Uber by giving driver ‘employee’ status,"The ruling could upend the U.S. firm’s business model and potentially require it to pay more taxes and benefits such as paid holidays

France’s top court has recognised the right of an Uber driver to be considered an employee, a ruling that could upend the U.S. firm’s business model and potentially require it to pay more taxes and benefits such as paid holidays.

The decision by the Cour de Cassation could also have ramifications for France’s wider “gig economy”, as other taxi and food delivery apps from Deliveroo and Just Eat-Takeaway to UberEats rely heavily on self-employed riders to conduct their business without having to meet a range of employee costs and benefits.

The Cour de Cassation upheld a previous decision by a court of appeal, saying the Uber driver could not qualify as a self-employed contractor because he could not build his own clientele or set his own prices, making him a subordinate of the company.

“When connecting to the Uber digital platform, a relationship of subordination is established between the driver and the company,” the court said in a statement.

“Hence, the driver does not provide services as a self-employed person, but as an employee.”

The decision could pave the way for other drivers to ask for a reclassification of their work relationship with Uber, which, under the current framework, does not pay a wide range of taxes that fund France’s welfare system.

“It’s an entirely different business model (for Uber),” said Cşdric Jacquelet, a partner at Proskauer law firm in Paris.

“It requires much more legal and human resources, at a much higher price,” he added, saying that Uber might now review the conditions under which its drivers perform their service so that they can no longer claim to be employees.

The decision also follows a series of legal challenges to Uber and similar companies from Brazil to Colombia and the United States itself.

California, where Uber is based, recently passed a law aimed making it harder for apps to classify their workers as independent contractors rather than employees. .

“The ruling does not reflect the reasons why drivers choose to use Uber: the independence and freedom to work if, when and where they want,” Uber said in a written statement.

“Over the last two years weve made many changes to give drivers even more control over how they use Uber, alongside stronger social protections,” it added, noting the court’s decision would not lead to an automatic reclassification of drivers.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pwnxhv/article30985635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UBER-COURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/top-french-court-deals-blow-to-uber-by-giving-driver-employee-status/article30985636.ece
43,2020/03/05,This closed Facebook group for women has evolved as a space for free expression,"The group, started by Anjali Manoj, has women from across the world as members

One can’t help but laugh when Radha Nair writes about how her help catches a frog in her bathroom. On another day, the city-based children’s author leaves you teary-eyed when she remembers how she dealt with the assassination of her father, a career diplomat, in Ottawa in 1961.

If Cindu Vijay, an architect in Kozhikode, inspires you with her never-say-die spirit after she was diagnosed with cancer, Nisha Kiran, a home chef, can give a lesson or two for those dealing with depression.

This is all happening in Her Trivandrum, a private Facebook group for women, originally meant to be a space for women in the capital city “to network and connect with each other”. But one-and-half years down the lane, it has members from across the world and their number stands at 6,750 and counting.

Anjali Manoj, the lone admin of the group, is happy that it has become THE space for women. On March 7, the eve of International Women’s Day, Anjali launches a new Facebook page, Hers To Share, which can be accessed by all Facebook users. This public page will have those articles posted on Her Trivandrum that the members wish to make public.

From the first meet-up of Her Trivandrum members held in 2019 | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

Looking back at the journey of Her Trivandrum, Anjali, a journalist-educator-entrepreneur, says that some unpleasant experiences on social media forced her to think about launching a women’s forum.

“Whenever I posted a query, friend requests or unwanted opinions used to pop up often. I even felt unsafe after I got comments on my private messenger. That’s when I hit upon the idea of a closed group where women can ask or express anything, without being judged or questioned. I expected only a few women from the city to join it. But the network just got bigger and bigger with women from across the globe joining in,” says Anjali.

Besides women staying in the city and those who’ve got a connect with it but are not living here, the group has members who have no relation with Thiruvananthapuram as well. And from a forum to seek help or advice related to topics such as family, children, housing, food, fashion, travel, art, culture, nature, business and health, it has evolved into a space to discuss subjects such as depression, relationship goals, mental and physical health, personal insecurities, domestic abuse and more.

The members, who are between the age of 20 and 70-plus, include homemakers, professionals, self-employed women, entrepreneurs, students, painters, performers, poets and photographers.

Support system

“This has evolved as one strong support group as the members encourage one another. There is a positivity in this forum. We have several senior citizens who are active on the platform even though they may not be stepping out of their homes,” Anjali adds.

According to 73-year-old Radha, the group has introduced her to a lot of “dynamic” women. “There are many whom I admire. It is heart-warming to read stories about women who’ve battled odds and how some of them have just refused to give up. Women feel safe and secure to discuss their problems and ask for recommendations,” says Radha.

Conditions apply The group is only for women. A new member is added only if an existing member recommends her name. Only those posts approved by Anjali would be visible on the page.

Members can choose not to reveal their identity and can post as ‘Anonymous’. The group doesn’t entertain hate speech, bullying, foul language and posts related to politics and religion. Negative comments and impostors will be removed. Advertisements are allowed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, that too only if there is a proper contact number.

Anjali spends 12 to 15 hours a day, starting from 6 am, to check the posts. Even when she is travelling, she keeps a tab on the page. Every day, she approves at least 25 posts, which is less than the number she rejects!

Cindu Vijay, a Kozhikode-based architect, calls Her Trivandrum the “most supportive group” she has come across. Having been part of several women’s forums, Cindu says that she can share those things on the page which she is not comfortable talking on any other platform. “Domestic abuse was one such issue. There is a lot of empathy in the group which is needed instead of sympathy,” says the 52-year-old.

As for Cauvery Kesavasamy, a freelance writer, it was “the kindred souls on the group” that made her feel at home in the capital city when she returned to live here after a decade. “I got best friends, opportunities to work and even ventured out of my comfort zone when it came to food and social life,” says Cauvery, who recently posted about how she fell down from an electric train onto the railway track. “It was the 10th anniversary of that accident and I felt like revisiting it,” adds the 33-year-old.

Dubai-based Nithya Rajkumar, a fashion retail professional and photographer, says that she receives constant support and encouragement from the members. “Behind successful women, there are many wise, charming and compassionate women. This has been a space for me to reach out to many people, especially when I was involved in gathering support and goods for those affected by floods in Kerala,” says Nithya. While depression has been a widely-discussed topic, learning disabilities and behavioural issues in children have also been taken up with members coming forward to support each other.

Gopika Raj, a 24-year-old English teacher from Toulouse, France, feels that the camaraderie within the group makes it a safe platform to share one’s thoughts about anything, without fear of judgements. “The posts are written by women of all ages and are often eye-opening as well as entertaining. It’s beyond beautiful that all of us are doing our humble bit to open up and discuss the simple joys of everyday life, from sharing recipes to bringing up sensitive topics that were kept under wraps for eons,” says Gopika over email, referring to her posts on body positivity and sexuality. “When I wrote about the latter, this heterogeneous tribe of womenfolk were overwhelmingly open minded and understanding. We trust the unthreatening nature of the group enough to let loose our thoughts, into the minds and newsfeeds of others too!” she says.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/ennqxn/article30990231.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvmanjali1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/her-trivandrum-is-a-closed-facebook-group-for-women-from-across-the-world/article30990233.ece
44,2020/03/05,Chennai Horse Show calls the city to experience the sport of horse riding,"Watch equestrians and their four-legged friends jump high, trot and show off their skills at the Chennai Horse Show this weekend

Fifteen-year-old Tiyasha Vathul, astride her horse, leaps over a multi-coloured hurdle in a show of absolute control and poise. Sporting a helmet, riding boots, gloves and a coat, the Junior National Equestrian Championship Winner 2019 is effortlessly in control of her horse at the grounds of the Chennai Equitation Centre. She is one among the top riders from South India who will attend the Chennai Horse Show-CEC SAK Equestrian Championships this weekend, that invites people across the city to familiarise themselves with the sport that is often considered as ‘niche’ or inaccessible.

Spread over three days, the show will have a mix of competitions and other entertaining events aimed at the non-rider fraternity. This is the first time that Chennai Equitation Centre (CEC) is hosting an event in their home ground, located at Sholinganallur. “All the big shows have been happening at Bengaluru since the past two or three years. We usually take our horses there. But this year, we thought we should bring it to Chennai,” says Isabelle Futnani, part of the organising team at CEC, who is an international dressage rider and coach herself.

Riders and their horses from Bengaluru, Puducherry, Coimbatore, Hyderabad and elsewhere will be competing. Some of the names to look out for are Nitin Gupta (National Champion 2019) and Rishab Mehta (three times National FEI World Jumping Challenge Winner) from Bengaluru’s Club URB, Issac Koshy (National rider) from Madras School of Equitation. From CEC, Tiyasha, along with Bharat Manoharan, Aditya Krishna and Pradhyutha will compete.

Events to look forward to Pas-Deux-Run Dressage Open:

It will have a team consisting of one rider and one runner who are required to complete a dressage test together. The performance will be judged on synchronicity, accuracy and impulsion.

Jump-Ride-Run 100 cm Open

This event is an obstacle course divided in three sections for a team comprising three people — jumping a 100-cm high hurdle with the horse, riding a bike through an obstacle course and running through an obstacle course.

Fancy Dress competition

This will see the rider (below 18 years of age) and horse sporting matching outfits and decorations, followed by a ramp walk.

Pony-Riders-Fun Event

This is for pony-riders who will be led by a groom. They have to complete a number of challenges on the course and show their coordination skills. Participants from outside are given a chance to compete on ponies from CEC.

From the many curated events, says Isabelle, seven events have been designed around show jumping, in which the horses and riders are required to jump (usually within a time limit) over a series of obstacles. There are also events designed for children below the age of 12.

“We have people joining from the Army and police along with their horses. They will be competing with teenagers and other men and women in the same categories. The competitions are all about how well you have put your skills in place. It has very little to do with physical strength. It is mostly about your focus,” says Isabelle.

The main show will include the three events for competition: Eventing, Dressage and Jumping. For this, riders from across the city are welcome to register. “So far, 50 horses will compete from CEC and an additional 50 horses have registered from outside the club,” she says.

The Chennai Horse Show will remain a free event, in an attempt to encourage people to cultivate interest in the sport. “It’s still a very small community. And many people have a lot of misconceptions about the animal and the sport. So we expect that when people see children doing the sport effortlessly, it will generate a lot of interest among the crowds. They are also welcome to interact with the horses and familiarise,” says Isabelle adding that this year, a footfall of 200 to 300 is expected.

Chennai Horse Show will be held from March 6 to March 8 at Chennai Equitation Centre, Sholinganallur.

47,2020/03/05,Eight PSBs announce share swap ratios,"Move comes ahead of ēmergers

With the March-end deadline for the biggest-ever amalgamation scheme approaching, eight state-owned banks on Thursday announced swap ratios for the proposed mergers.

Punjab National Bank (PNB), in a regulatory filing, announced the share exchange ratio in accordance with the scheme of amalgamation, as it is set to merge Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) and United Bank of India (UBI) into itself with effect from April 1.

PNB’s board, in its meeting on Thursday, had approved for amalgamation of OBC and UBI, Punjab National Bank said in a BSE filing.

According to the swap ratio, 1,150 equity shares of PNB are to be exchanged for every 1,000 equity shares of Oriental Bank of Commerce, while 121 equity shares of PNB are to be swapped for every 1,000 equity shares of UBI. A Grievance Redressal Committee headed by Vijay Kumar Vyas, retired judge of Rajasthan High Court, has been set up to address the grievances of shareholders. The committee is intended to address those shareholders who either individually or collectively hold at least 1% of the equity capital of any of PNB, OBC or UBI; or 100 shareholders acting collectively, of any of PNB, OBC or UBI.

“The board of directors of the bank...have fixed Wednesday, March 25, 2020, as record date for issuing and allotting equity shares of the PNB to the shareholders of OBC and UBI as per the share exchange ratio,” PNB said in the filing.

Meanwhile, Andhra Bank on Thursday also announced the swap ratio for its merger, it said in a filing. Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank are to be amalgamated into Union Bank of India with effect from April 1, 2020.

Andhra Bank said, “Further, the board of directors of the bank at its meeting held on March 5, 2020, has approved the equity share exchange ratio for amalgamation of Andhra Bank into Union Bank of India for 325 equity shares in Union Bank of India for every 1,000 equity shares in Andhra Bank.”

Union Bank, in a separate exchange filing, said its board at its meeting on Thursday had also approved the equity share exchange ratio. It includes 325 equity shares of Union Bank of India for every 1,000 shares in Andhra Bank and 330 shares in Union Bank for every 1,000 equity shares in Corporation Bank.

Also, for Syndicate Bank’s merger into Canara Bank, the share swap is 158 equity shares of Canara Bank for every 1,000 equity shares of Syndicate Bank.

The lenders, in their respective filings to the exchange, said their boards had approved the amalgamation of Syndicate Bank into Canara Bank.

For these two banks, an expert committee (Grievance Redressal Committee ) is to be headed by K.N. Keshavanarayana, former judge of the High Court of Karnataka, to address the grievances of minority shareholders.

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday had okayed the amalgamation of 10 public sector banks to create four large state-owned lenders with effect from April 1, 2020.

According to the mega consolidation plan, OBC and UBI will merge into PNB; Syndicate Bank into Canara Bank; Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank into Union Bank of India; and Allahabad Bank into Indian Bank.

After the mergers, there will be seven large public sector banks (PSBs) and five smaller ones.

Last year, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank were merged with Bank of Baroda. Prior to this, the government had merged five associate banks of SBI and Bharatiya Mahila Bank with the State Bank of India.

The anchor bank, Punjab National Bank, will become the country’s second largest bank, with business size of ₹17.94 lakh crore after SBI, which has business of over Rs 52 lakh crore.

Bank of Baroda will become the third largest bank, followed by Canara Bank, Union Bank of India, Bank of India, and Indian Bank.

The other PSBs are Central Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, UCO Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, and Punjab and Sind Bank.

Shares of PNB on Thursday closed at ₹44.90 on the BSE, up 1.01% from the previous close, while Union Bank of India’s shares jumped 8.25% to ₹39.35 apiece. Canara Bank rose marginally by 0.40% to close at 139.45 apiece.

PSB shares zoom

Meanwhile, shares of select public sector banks rose up to 16% on Thursday after the Union Cabinet approved amalgamation of 10 state-owned lenders with effect from April 1.

Oriental Bank of Commerce advanced 15.89%, Syndicate Bank jumped 10.53%, Allahabad Bank 9.23%, Andhra Bank 3.91%, United Bank of India 3.31% and Corporation Bank 2.14% on the BSE.

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved amalgamation of 10 public sector banks, including Allahabad Bank, Andhra Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), to create four large state-owned lenders with effect from April 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.

The merger would result in creation of seven large PSBs with scale and national reach, with each amalgamated entity having business of over Rs 8 lakh crore.

48,2020/03/05,Zydus Cadila to launch drug for NASH,"Firm working on vaccine for COVID-19

The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved Zydus Cadila’s new drug application (NDA) for Saroglitazar for treatment of Non-Cirrhotic, Non-Alcoholic SteatoHepatitis (NASH) in India, making it the first-ever drug in the world for treatment of the disease.

NASH is a progressive disease of the liver, which starts with fat accumulation in the liver known as Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), leading to cirrhosis and liver failure.

Sharvil P. Patel, managing director, Zydus Cadila, said “There are 50 to 70 million NASH patients globally. So, the global market size will be around $30 billion to $45 billion. India accounts for one of the highest for NASH cases. Our new drug will be available in India in the next three months and will stop deterioration of liver for NASH patients. This drug will become our largest brand.”

This is a large unmet medical need as there is currently no approved drug anywhere in the world for the treatment of NASH, a disease that is highly prevalent, with 10% to 30% of the global population being affected by it. The prevalence of NASH in India is estimated to be among nearly 25% of the population.

NASH ranks as one of the major causes of cirrhosis, behind hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease. Liver transplantation is the only option for managing advanced cirrhosis with liver failure.

Pankaj Patel, chairman, Zydus Group, said, “We are happy that our efforts to discover and develop a novel drug for patients living with NASH, an unmet healthcare need globally, have been successful. Saroglitazar will provide hope and new lease of life for millions of patients in India suffering from NASH.”

Saroglitazar was launched in India in September 2013 for the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia in patients with Type-2 diabetes not controlled by statins alone.

When asked about COVID-19, Mr. Patel said, “For coronavirus, we are developing a vaccine as well as a diagnostic set. We are also working on a drug for coronavirus.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/zydus-cadila-to-launch-drug-for-nash/article30993800.ece
49,2020/03/05,"Blackstone keen to invest in India’s stressed assets, says Schwarzman","Chairman of the PE major wants Indian banks to follow U.S. model

Blackstone, one of world’s largest private equity (PE) majors, is bullish to invest in India inspite of the economic slowdown in the country.

Blackstone has identified “stressed assets” and warehousing as the new areas of investment, besides focus on technology and real estate, according to its chairman, CEO and co-founder Stephen A. Schwarzman.

Hinting at buying stressed assets, Mr. Schwarzman said, “Issues with India are more about slowing economic growth and limited credit extension by the banking system and neo banks, and that should create more need for owners of companies to look for other sources of liquidity. For us, if there is something very attractive here... we’ve a lot of long term confidence in India. So, we will be very active buyers or lenders in this market.”

Blackstone has so far invested over $15 billion in India since it started Indian operations in 2006. Most of its investments includes PE play in enterprises, and bets on realty, of late. “Blackstone India will be focussing on the real estate sector to create spaces that can be hired by IT companies and also warehousing space going forward,” Schwarzman said.

To a query by The Hindu, Mr. Schwarzman declined to comment if he will play the role of a negotiator in the U.S. - India trade deal. Mr. Schwarzman played a key role of a negotiator in the U.S. -China trade deal. Mr. Schwarzman is not happy with the liquidity crisis in the Indian banking system and wants Indian banks to follow the U.S. model.

SBI Cards is the second-largest credit card issuer in the country with a market share of 18% on the back of almost 10 million cards.

SBI, which has a stake of 74% in the card company, would be offloading 4% stake by way of the offer while private equity major Carlyle will be diluting its stake by 10% (it currently holds 26% stake).",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sbi-cards-ipo-subscribed-more-than-22-times/article30993698.ece
53,2020/03/05,NSE told to submit road map for diluting stake in CAMS,"Practical issues in divesting entire stake at one go, SEBI told

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has directed the National Stock Exchange (NSE) to submit a plan for diluting its entire stake in Computer Age Management Systems (CAMS) — the country’s largest share registrar and transfer agent (RTA).

The stock exchange had about 37% stake in the RTA and had told SEBI it would not be able to divest completely at once and hence would soon be submitting a road map for diluting the entire stake for the necessary regulatory approvals, a senior SEBI official said.

“The exchange has said that there are practical issues in divesting the entire stake at one go. So, we told them to submit a road map for divestment that we can approve,” the official said, adding that the bourse was yet to submit its plan of action for the stake sale.

The latest development follows the SEBI directive of February, wherein the watchdog stated that NSE acquired the stake in CAMS without prior regulatory approval and hence needed to divest the stake. “SEBI, vide its letter dated February 4, 2020, has inter alia noted that NSE should have obtained prior permission of SEBI for acquisition of stake in Computer Age Management Services Limited (CAMS), an associate company, through its subsidiary namely NSE Investment Limited in FY 2013-14 and has directed NSE to divest its stake in CAMS within a period of one year including certain restrictive directions in relation to the said stake in CAMS. The company is doing the needful in this regard,” said NSE, as part of its financial results statement for the period ended December 31, 2019.

Interestingly, CAMS, which has a market share of nearly 70%, has already filed its document for an initial public offer, which is likely to be around ₹1,500 crore in size. Once the draft document gets the final regulatory approval, the promoter shares, which includes NSE’s stake, get locked in for one year, which could derail the stake sale process of NSE to comply with the SEBI directive.

“We will take a considerate view on the matter so that none of the processes gets delayed,” the SEBI official quoted above said.

Apart from NSE, the major shareholders of CAMS include Warburg Pincus, Faering Capital, ACSYS Investments and HDFC Group.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/7b3mr0/article30993677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06BUNSE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/nse-told-to-submit-road-map-for-diluting-stake-in-cams/article30993678.ece
54,2020/03/05,Yes Bank put under moratorium till April 3,"Deposit withdrawal capped at ₹50,000; board superseded by Reserve Bank of India

The government has put private sector lender Yes Bank under moratorium till April 3 and capped the deposit withdrawal at ₹50,000 after severe deterioration of the bank’s financial position. The decision was taken by the government after an application from Reserve Bank of India (RBI), a gazette notification said.

Following the moratorium, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) superseded the board of the bank and appointed Prashant Kumar, the deputy managing director and chief financial officer of State Bank of India (SBI), as the administrator. Mr. Kumar resigned from SBI to take up the role of the administrator.

While assuring depositors of the bank that there was no need to panic, the central bank said that it would explore and draw up a scheme in the next few days for the bank’s reconstruction or amalgamation, and with the approval of the government, it said it would put the plan well before the end of the moratorium period of thirty days. During the moratorium period, the bank cannot grant or renew any loan or advance, or make any investment, but would be allowed to make certain expenses like salaries of employees.

The withdrawal limit will be relaxed for depositors who need money for medical treatment, education, marriage or other ceremonies and any other unavoidable emergency. In these cases, depositors will be allowed to withdraw up to a maximum of ₹5 lakh.

RBI said that the financial position of the bank deteriorated as it failed to raise capital to address loan losses, which resulted in rating downgrades and triggered invocation of bond covenants by investors, and withdrawal of deposits.

“The bank has also experienced serious governance issues and practices in the recent years which have led to steady decline of the bank,” the RBI said.

The central bank said it was in constant engagement with the bank’s management to find ways to strengthen its balance sheet and liquidity. While the bank management had indicated that it was in talks with various investors for capital raising, those plans did not materialise. The regulator said it had given adequate opportunity to the bank to draw credible revival plan, which, however, did not materialise. “In the meantime, the bank was facing regular outflow of liquidity,” RBI said, while giving its reasoning for its suggestion to the government for the moratorium.

While the moratorium was announced after close of trading hours, Yes Bank shares had already shot up 26% after reports of a bail out plan led by the SBI.

SBI board gives nod

Meanwhile, the SBI board, at its meeting on Thursday, gave in-principle approval to explore investment opportunities in Yes Bank.

The lender confirmed this in a reply to the exchanges late on Thursday and said that no negotiations had taken place yet.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cm3r9w/article30993657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06THBUYESBANK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/yes-bank-put-under-moratorium-till-april-3/article30993658.ece
55,2020/03/05,GM unveils new electric vehicle platform to take on Tesla,"In a major challenge to electric car leader Tesla, General Motors announced it has created a new electric vehicle battery that offers up to 400 miles of range and will be cheaper to produce than today’s batteries

In a bid to take on Electric Vehicle (EV) maker Tesla, the largest automaker in the U.S. — General Motors (GM) — is mulling to spend $20 billion and showcasing roughly a dozen of products to assure investors that it is serious about embracing an electric future.

In a major challenge to electric car leader Tesla, General Motors announced it has created a new electric vehicle battery that offers up to 400 miles of range and will be cheaper to produce than today’s batteries.

The new battery cells will hold enough energy to potentially power a car for 400 miles or more on a single charge, the company has announced. That’s slightly more driving range than any car Tesla offers. Tesla claims a range of 390 miles for the latest version of its Model S Long Range sedan, CNN Business reported on Wednesday.

The new batteries are said to be unique because of the “large-format, pouch-style cells,” compared to cylindrical cells, which according to GM enables them to be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the battery pack.

“GM is building towards an all-electric future because we believe climate change is real,” GM CEO Mary Barra said during a presentation for media and investors, according to the CNN Business report.

The automaker has said it plans to release 20 electric nameplates by 2023 and will publicly unveil three of those vehicles in the months to come: the Cadillac ‘Lyriq’ EV crossover in April and two electric versions of GMC’s Hummer in May.

This will be followed “soon after” by the Cruise Origin, a shared, electric, self-driving vehicle developed by Cruise (a majority-owned subsidiary of GM) and Honda, according to The Verge.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tn8hhi/article30989810.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05NETGENERALMOTORS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/gm-unveils-new-electric-vehicle-platform-to-take-on-tesla/article30989811.ece

Salaried employees are set to get 0.15% less in interest on provident fund deposits for 2019-2020, with the Central Board of Trustees of the Employees’ Provident Fund on Thursday reducing the interest rate from 8.65% to 8.5%.

The Board also ratified the restoration of normal pension after 15 years from the date of commutation — a move that will benefit about 6.3 lakh pensioners who had opted for commutation on or before September 25, 2008, the statement said.

Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) India on Thursday said it has entered into a partnership with Tata Power for end-to-end electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions.

As part of the association, Tata Power will provide charging solutions for JLR in India across its retail network of 27 outlets in 24 cities and at customers’ residence and/or office.

Tata Power will be responsible for providing a range of AC and DC chargers, starting from 7 kW to 50 kW capacity, JLR India said in a statement.

“The partnership with Tata Power will be a tremendous value addition for JLR customers as it provides a one-stop solution to their charging needs and also provides easy accessibility to the wide network of public charging infrastructure being set up by Tata Power across India,” JLR India President and Managing Director Rohit Suri said.

This tie-up is one step forward in creating the right ecosystem enabling a simple and hassle free charging experience for owners of company’s first electric vehicle, the Jaguar I-PACE, which makes its debut in India later this year, he added.

“As India’s leading integrated player in the EV charging space, we will provide JLR’s EV customers with easy, ubiquitous and seamless charging experience at their homes, offices and public places,” Tata Power Company CFO and President Ramesh Subramanyam said.

This partnership is also an endorsement of JLR’s faith in Tata Power’s ability to deal with the electrified range of vehicles that it will bring into India, he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/article17867310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07IN%20JLR,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jlr-joins-hands-with-tata-power-for-electric-vehicle-charging-solutions/article30988862.ece
58,2020/03/05,Bombay HC dismisses Chanda Kochhar’s plea against termination of employment by ICICI bank,"The court said that the petition was not maintainable as the dispute was contractual and concerns a private body.

The Bombay High Court on Thursday dismissed a petition filed by Chanda Kochhar against her termination as the managing director and chief executive officer of the ICICI Bank.

A Division Bench of Justices N.M. Jamdar and M.S. Karnik accepted the bank’s contention that Ms. Kochhar’s petition was not maintainable as the dispute was contractual and concerns a private body.

The bank’s counsel Darius Khambata had earlier argued that a judicial review cannot be incurred under Article 226 of the Constitution, which empowers high courts to issue directions, orders or writs in such a matter.

The bank sought dismissal of Ms. Kochhar’s petition.

Ms. Kochhar was terminated from the ICICI Bank months after she voluntarily left the second largest private sector lender.

The high profile former banker moved the High Court on November 30, 2019, challenging termination of her employment by the ICICI Bank.

She contended that the bank also denied her remuneration and clawed back all the bonuses and stock options between April 2009 and March 2018 for her alleged role in granting out of turn loans worth ₹3,250 crore to the Videocon Group which benefitted her husband Deepak Kochhar.

Chanda Kochhar’s counsel Vikram Nankani earlier argued that her termination came months after the bank approved her voluntary resignation on October 5, 2018 and therefore, the termination is “illegal, untenable, and unsustainable in law.”

The ICICI Bank then filed an affidavit, contending that the reliefs in the petition are not maintainable and it deserves to be dismissed as ICICI is a private bank and is administered under the Companies Act, not the state or its agency.

Mr. Khambata argued that ICICI is a private banking company and Ms. Kochhar’s petition seeks to contest what are purely private contractual terms.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/h0bgt5/article30988823.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI1242019000100BTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bombay-hc-dismisses-chanda-kochhars-plea-against-termination-of-employment-by-icici-bank/article30988824.ece
59,2020/03/05,COVID-19 | Rajya Sabha erupts on cow urine claims,"No controversy should be created on the sensitive issue: Venkaiah Naidu

The government should come up with a clarification on various claims by some BJP leaders that cow dung and ‘gomutra’ (cow urine) can ward off coronavirus, NCP MP Vandana Chavan told the Rajya Sabha on Thursday. She was reacting to Health Minister Harsh Vardhan’s statement on the steps taken by the government to contain the spread of COVID-19.

She was ticked off by Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu who said no unnecessary controversy should be created.

Ms. Chavan said, “Sir, there has been a talk that using gomutra and cow dung cakes etc. is useful in eradicating it [the coronavirus]. I think scientific research needs to be done.” Before she could complete her sentence, she was interrupted by Mr. Naidu.

“It is up to the people, we are not here to force anything on them,” the Chairman told her, leading to uproar from members. Mr. Naidu said no controversy should be created on such a sensitive issue. “It is your belief,” he said. Speaking to The Hindu outside Parliament, Ms. Chavan said: “... The government should not allow any one to spread such misinformation,” she said.

Assam BJP MLA, Suman Haripriya, told the State Assembly on Monday, “We all know that cow dung is very helpful. Likewise, when cow urine is sprayed, it purifies an area... I believe something similar could be done with ‘gomutra’ and ‘gobar’ to cure coronavirus.” Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on the same day had said the virus could be eliminated by practising Yoga.

Trinamool’s stand

Trinamool Congress Parliamentary Party leader Derek O’ Brien said, “We assure the Centre of all cooperation to protect mothers, children, brothers and sisters of our country, and not to get into a situation of panic.” Elaborating his statement outside Parliament, he said, “At the same time, we must also think about mothers, sisters, children, brothers who died last month in Delhi genocide without having the virus.”

Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh suggested that thermal scanners be put up at different gates in Parliament. “People from many States and guests from foreign countries come here,” he said.

MPs from Tamil Nadu, Vaiko (MDMK) and Vijila Satyanath (AIADMK) raised the issue of 900 Indian fishermen stranded near the Iran coast because of COVID-19. Of these 700 are from Tamil Nadu.

Sanitisers, masks

TMC MP Sukendu Sekhar Ray suggested that since hand sanitisers and masks are being sold at exorbitant prices, the government should ensure that these were distributed through PDS all over the country at affordable price. DMK MP Tiruchi Siva suggested that masks should be distributed in airlines.

A 16-year-old Indian girl in Dubai has tested positive for COVID-19 infection. She contracted the infection from her father who travelled overseas, said the Dubai Health Authority.

Health officials here confirmed on Wednesday that coronavirus was detected in a girl who attended the Indian High School in Dubai, Al-Arabiya website reported.

62,2020/03/05,"Pleas challenging CAA to be heard after Sabarimala reference case, says CJI Bobde","The nine-judge Bench is expected to start hearing the Sabarimala reference from March 16.

Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde on Thursday clarified that the challenge raised against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) will have to wait till a nine-judge Bench of the court wraps up hearing a reference made in connection with the Sabarimala case on the ambit and scope of religious freedom practised by multiple faiths across the country.

Review and reference: On Sabarimala review pleas

The nine-judge Bench is expected to start hearing the Sabarimala reference from March 16.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal made an urgent oral mention before Chief Justice Bobde to list the CAA case before they become infructuous, especially with the National Population Register (NPR) exercise commencing in April.

The CAA fast-tracks citizenship-by-naturalisation process for persons from six religious communities, other than Muslims, who have fled persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Lawyers for the petitioners have argued that NPR data would be used to prepare a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC). The NPR-NRC is considered a harbinger-cum-facilitator for the operation of the CAA. Over 140 petitions have been filed against the CAA in the apex court.

In January, the court responded to the apprehensions about the NPR-NRC-CAA link, with an assurance that the CAA was “uppermost in everybody's minds”. The court then refused to stay the Act without hearing the government first.

No govt response yet

On Thursday, over a month later, the government is yet to file its response to the CAA challenge in the Supreme Court. Attorney General K.K. Venugopal said the government would be filing its reply in a few days.

Mr. Sibal pressed for “some interim orders”, but Chief Justice Bobde asked him to mention the case again when the court reopens after the Holi holidays.

The petitions against the CAA have argued that a law that welcomes “illegal migrants” into India selectively on the basis of their religion is against principles of secularism, right to equality and dignity of life enshrined in the Basic Structure of the Constitution.

The petitions said the Act selectively agreed to grant citizenship benefits to illegal migrants from only three countries. Besides the new law did not impose any requirement on illegal migrants to prove their claim of religious persecution or even a reasonable fear of it.

They argued that the legislation effectuated discrimination on the basis of the intrinsic and core identity of an individual, that is, his religious identity as a Muslim. While Muslim migrants would have to show their proof of residency in India for 12 years, the law allowed persons from the six communities - Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians - to be naturalised in five years' time.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ivkogu/article30993543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THBOBDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sabarimala-before-caa-says-cji/article30993544.ece

64,2020/03/05,CIC chief to be sworn in on March 6 after two-week delay,"Understaffed Information Commission has been headless for two months; CVC appointment yet to be notified.

The next Chief Information Commissioner, Bimal Julka, will be sworn in by President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday morning, more than two weeks after he was chosen by a high-level selection panel chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

However, the appointment of Sanjay Kothari as Chief Vigilance Commissioner, which had been decided by the panel at the same meeting on February 18, is yet to be notified.

Scrap Sanjay Kothari appointment as CVC as process is vitiated, says Congress

The Hindu reported on March 3 that the official notification of both appointments had been delayed because of a delay in the process of finding a replacement for Mr. Kothari, who is currently secretary to the President. The Congress has also objected to Mr. Kothari’s appointment, claiming that it violates procedure, and is mulling possible legal action.

The delay is particularly critical at the Central Information Commission, which has been headless since its previous chief Sudhir Bhargava retired almost two months ago. In fact, Mr. Julka’s term will last less than six months, as he is due to retire in August.

Many cases pending

The CIC, which is the final appeal body under the Right to Information Act, is chronically understaffed, with five vacancies in its 11-member body, including four positions that have not been filled in more than two years. The failure to appoint Commissioners hampers the process of clearing RTI complaints and appeals, resulting in more than 35,000 pending cases.

RTI activists have also noted that the Centre has failed to follow the Supreme Court’s directions with regard to CIC appointments, as it has not made public information on the applicants and short-listed candidates.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k19f5s/article30993509.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THBIMALJULKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cic-chief-to-be-sworn-in-today-after-two-week-delay/article30993510.ece

On his recent visit to Kolkata, Mr. Modi said at a public event that lack of “cut money” was probably the reason the Trinamool Congress government was desisting from implementing the welfare schemes.

Sources in Mr. Birla’s office said he was particularly aggrieved by disruptions that continued on Tuesday after he held an all-party meeting in his chambers that morning and assured members of a discussion on the Delhi riots on March 11 in return for the Opposition’s cooperation to clear important government business.

“On Tuesday itself, the incident involving women MPs of the Congress and the BJP occurred, with a repeat on Wednesday. These were unprecedented scenes. This was after the Opposition assured the Speaker [of cooperation],” a close aide to the Speaker said.

Whenever there were stand-offs of this kind in the past, other Opposition parties tried to broker peace. This time, however, the battle lines are clearly drawn. Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav was one of the few who managed to meet Mr. Birla in the last two days. No one is sure how this stand-off is to be ended. The suspension of seven Congress MPs and the constitution of a committee to go into the incidents that led to the suspension are only likely to harden stances across the Treasury-Opposition divide.

Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said it was a “government decision” and not one taken by the Speaker.

“This is dictatorship. Why did they not suspend me. I was also there,” said Mr. Chowdhury. “We got to see the spirit of revenge in the House. The order was given to suspend seven of our MPs for the session by a chairperson, not the Speaker.”

Supporting the Congress, BSP MP Danish Ali said, “How can one presiding officer take a disciplinary action against a member’s misbehaviour when the Speaker was not there? The BJP doesn’t believe in democratic tradition.”

Calling it ‘unprecedented,’ Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said the government was in favour of an enquiry committee on the incident and was even going to push for the termination of “the Congress MP’s membership who had actually snatched the papers meant for Rama Devi, the presiding officer at 2 p.m.”

71,2020/03/05,Justice Muralidhar clears the air on his transfer from Delhi HC to Punjab & Haryana HC,"A controversy erupted after the Centre issued Justice Muralidhar’s transfer notification on February 26

Justice S. Muralidhar on Thursday cleared the air over the controversy on his transfer from the Delhi High Court to the Punjab and Haryana High Court, saying he had replied to Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde’s communication that he was fine with the proposal and had no objection.

The controversy erupted after the Centre issued Justice Muralidhar’s transfer notification close to midnight on February 26 — the day a Bench headed by him pulled up the Delhi police for failing to register FIRs against three BJP leaders for their alleged hate speeches which purportedly led to the recent violence in northeast Delhi.

Justice Muralidhar, 58, who received a grand farewell on Thursday from a huge gathering that included judges and lawyers, said he wanted to clear the confusion on his transfer and narrated the sequence of events from the time he received the Chief Justice of India’s (CJI)communication till February 26.

The Supreme Court collegium, headed by the CJI, had in a meeting on February 12 recommended the transfer of Justice Muralidhar to the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

Also Read Ashok Gehlot questions Justice Muralidhar’s transfer

Justice Muralidhar was number three in the Delhi High Court, his parent high court as a judge.

Explaining the transfer process, he said the five-member collegium sends to the Centre a recommendation that a judge of a high court should be transferred to another high court. The judge concerned is not at this stage under orders of transfer. That happens only when the collegium’s recommendation fructifies into a notification.

“In my case, the collegium’s decision was communicated to me by the CJI on February 17 by a letter which sought my response. I acknowledged receipt of the letter. I was then asked to clarify what I meant. As I saw it, if I was to be transferred from the Delhi High Court anyway, I was fine with moving to the Punjab and Haryana High Court.

“I, therefore, clarified to the CJI that I did not object to the proposal. An explanation for my transfer reached the press...on February 20 quoting ‘sources in the Supreme Court collegium’, confirming what has been indicated to me a couple of days earlier,” he said.

The CJI’s letter, dated February 14, was delivered to Justice Muralidhar on February 17, the day when the family’s pet Labrador Sakhi breathed her last.

He said February 26 was perhaps the longest working day of his life as a judge of the Delhi High Court, where he has spent 14 years on the Bench.

He said it began at 12.30 a.m. with a sitting at his residence with Justice A.J. Bhambhani, under the orders of Justice G.S. Sistani, to deal with a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by Rahul Roy seeking safe passage of ambulances carrying the injured riot victims.

“When I received a call at my residence from the lawyer for the petitioner, I first called Justice Sistani to ask what should be done, knowing that the Chief Justice (CJ) was on leave. Justice Sistani explained that he, too, was officially on leave the whole of February 26 and that I should take up the matter.

“This fact is stated in the order passed by the Bench after the hearing. Later that day, upon urgent mentioning, as the de facto CJ’s Bench, Justice Talwant Singh and I took up another fresh PIL on the CJ’s board seeking registration of FIRs for hate speeches. After the orders passed on that day, the above two PILs remained on the CJ’s Board,” he said.

Justice Muralidhar ended the speech saying the notification which was issued close to midnight on February 26 did two things.

“First, it transferred me to the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Second, it appointed me to a position from where I can never be transferred, or removed and in which I shall always be proud to remain. A ‘former judge’ of arguably the best high court in the country. The High Court of Delhi,” he said, following a standing ovation by all the judges and the gathering, including his family members, former judges, lawyers, court staff and media persons.

Justice Muralidhar’s mother, wife Usha Ramanathan, former Delhi High Court Chief Justice A.P. Shah, senior advocate Shanti Bhushan and former Delhi University VC Upendra Baxi were also present.

Bidding adieu to Justice Muralidhar, Delhi High Court CJ D.N. Patel said his absence would be felt institutionally as well as personally.

Delhi government Standing Counsel (Criminal) Rahul Mehra termed Justice Muralidhar as a “highly intellectual, courageous, upright and incorruptible judge” and sang the Bengali song ‘ekla chalo re' to describe him.

Mr. Mehra said he joins the Delhi High Court Bar Association in “strongly condemning” Justice Muralidhar’s transfer.

A controversy had erupted in 2018 when Justice Muralidhar had quashed the transit remand order by a trial court and directed the release of rights activist Gautam Navlakha from house arrest in the Koregaon-Bhima violence case.

In October 2018, a Division Bench headed by Justice Muralidhar had also convicted 16 former policemen of Uttar Pradesh in the Hashimpura massacre case. He was also heading the Bench which in the same year had awarded life imprisonment to Congress leader Sajjan Kumar and sent him to jail in one of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.

Justice Muralidhar began his law practice in Chennai in September 1984 and he shifted to the Supreme Court and the Delhi HC in 1987.

In response to an unstarred question on Wednesday, the Law Ministry said ‘the matter is under consideration’.

“In order to ensure preparation of an error free electoral roll, and to prevent duplication of entries, a proposal to amend the Representation of People’s Act 1951 to enable linking of the electoral data with the Aadhaar system has been received from the Election Commission,” the Law Ministry said in its reply.

Government officials asserted that the issue had come up about three weeks ago in a meeting between Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sunil Arora, Election Commissioners Ashok Lavasa and Sunil Chandra and Secretary Legislative Department G. Narayana Raju when they had discussed pending electoral reforms.

One of the arguments being made in favour of the move is that it may allow migrant labour and workers to vote even if they are away from their homes at the time of elections.

Former CEC H. S. Brahma told The Hindu that the process of seeding Aadhaar with the voter ID card had started in 2012 during his tenure but was subsequently stalled because of a pending litigation on Aadhaar.

Students and traders rejoiced the resumption of access to the social media in Kashmir after a seven-month-long gap, as Internet service on fixed-line broadband connection was also restored on Thursday. Several political parties termed the government move “a positive step”.

“The restoration of broadband Internet connection and access to the social media platforms will allow me to connect with my customer base again. These seven months have not only dented our online platforms’ prospect but forced many youth to leave the Valley. Hope the brain drain will stop and the youth will again come up with innovative online platforms,” Haseeb Ashai, founder member of Lalchowk.in, Valley’s rare online books dealer, told The Hindu.

All social media platforms, especially the popular Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp, saw hyper activity with netizens uploading photographs and congratulating one another for being able to connect again online.

Internet and later social media platforms remained out of bounds for locals in Kashmir since the Centre decided to end J&K’s special status on August 5 last.

Women’s Collective resume activism

The Kashmir Women’s Collective, an initiative to document any abuse against women in Kashmir, also resumed online activism. “After seven months, we are glad to connect with you online. Our work on ground never stopped. We faced multiple challenges but we derive our courage from women who even in these hard times reached out to us, sharing with us the warmth and strength,” tweeted the official handle of the initiative.

The restoration also brought cheer on the faces of the students. “We were not able to access education-related websites and connect with friends to discuss subject-related queries,” said Tania Khan, a student of Class 10.

Hundreds of schools started activating online parent-administration interfaces on WhatsApp to re-establish the round-the-clock connect.

CPI(M) leader M.Y. Tarigami said people in J&K had to undergo immense sufferings due to the communication blockade imposed by the government. “The unprecedented Internet gag has been witnessed nowhere in the democratic world. It is because of strong protests raised by social groups, Opposition parties, mass organisations, writers and intelligentsia at national level that the 2G services and social media has been restored now,” he said.

Former PDP leader Altaf Bukhari, welcoming the move to lift curbs on the social media, said, “People, especially the youth of J&K, were feeling discriminated in the absence of being connected with the outside world through the use of modern day technological facilities.”

79,2020/03/05,"NPR data useful for welfare schemes, says Union Home Ministry","It tells parliamentary panel that date and place of birth of parents will complete data for all households.

The Union Home Ministry has informed a parliamentary panel that it proposes to collect details on additional questions such as “date and place of birth of parents” in the National Population Register (NPR) to “facilitate back-end data processing and making the data items of date and place of birth complete for all household[s]”.

Read: Citizens can skip question on place of birth of parents in NPR form, says Centre

The Ministry said there was a need to update the NPR to “incorporate the changes due to birth, death and migration”. “Aadhaar is individual data, whereas NPR contains family-wise data,” it said.

“Various welfare schemes of the State and Central governments are generally family-based, for which NPR data may be used,” it said.

Though the final NPR form for 2020 has not been made public, on February 18, Ministry officials informed the panel that “during the update of NPR 2020, it is proposed to collect data on some additional items like place of last residence, mother tongue, Aadhaar number (voluntary), mobile number, passport (Indian passport holder), voter ID card, driving licence number, date and place of birth of father and mother”.

The submission was made in response to a question by parliamentary committee members on the new questions in the form.

West Bengal, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Puducherry, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Delhi have demanded that either the NPR be scrapped or the update be done using the 2010 form.

The Centre has proposed that the next phase of NPR will be conducted along with the house listing and house census exercise between April and September.

Ministry officials said, “The date and place of birth of parents were collected in NPR 2010 as well for all parents who were enumerated within the household. For parents living elsewhere or expired at the time of enumeration, only the names were collected...”

The parliamentary committee on Demands for Grants of the Ministry, headed by Congress leader Anand Sharma, said there was dissatisfaction and fear among the people regarding the upcoming NPR and Census. “The Committee also feels that these apprehensions should have been duly ventilated in the media. The MHA must consider some way out so that the Census goes smoothly. Otherwise, there is quite a chance of the entire process being stymied in many States,” the panel said in its report tabled in the Parliament on Thursday.

The committee also remarked that it was “not quite convinced with the reply of the Ministry that the Aadhaar is an individual data and in order to create a family database, NPR exercise has been undertaken”. The committee had enquired about the possibility of using Aadhaar database for updating NPR without undergoing fresh exercise to prevent duplication of efforts and expenditure.

“The committee would like the MHA to explore the feasibility of using the Aadhaar metadata for the Census and updation of NPR in 2020-21. Further, the committee recommends that all the States/UTs should be fully convinced on various issues pertaining to the NPR which commences in April to have a national consensus so that there is absolute clarity and no apprehension among remaining people across the country which will help in conducting these exercises in a smooth manner,” the panel said in its report.

More than 75 people have been killed in various incidents after the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was passed in the Parliament on December 11. Several States including Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have witnessed protests against the CAA and the legislation’s link with the countrywide proposed National Register of Citizens and the NPR.

He said the Indian medical team was likely to set up its first clinic at Qom to start screening for coronavirus.

Health Minister Harsh Vardhan sought to allay fears saying the government is taking all steps to prevent spread of coronavirus and the scale of interventions has been increased in alignment with the evolving situation in India where 28,529 people have been brought under community surveillance and monitoring.

Making a suo motu statement first in the Rajya Sabha and then in the Lok Sabha on steps taken to contain the virus, he said as on March 4, 29 positive cases have been reported in the country.

Official sources on March 5 said one more case of novel coronavirus was reported in Ghaziabad and the middle-aged man had a recent travel history to Iran.

The Health Ministry said in addition to COVID 19 cases related to travel, some cases of community transmission have also been observed and so it has been decided to involve district collectors and States have been asked to form rapid response teams as the district, block and village levels.

It also said that India has imposed additional visa restrictions on people travelling from or having visited Italy and South Korea, making it mandatory for them to submit certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19 from laboratories authorised by the health authorities of their countries.

This will come into effect from 0000 hrs of March 10 and is a temporary measure till cases of novel coronavirus subside, the Ministry said in a travel advisory.

The government has already suspended all regular visas/e-visas granted on or before March 3 to nationals of Italy, Iran, South Korea, Japan who have not yet entered India in view of the emerging global scenarios regarding COVID19 disease.

According to the advisory, the government has also suspended visa on arrival (VoA) issued on or before March 3 to Japanese and South Korean nationals who have not yet entered India.

Amid reports of the coronavirus outbreak in China affecting the Indian pharma industry, Union Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister Sadanand Gowda said that there is no shortage of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients for at least three months.

Explained: Why is COVID-19 not a pandemic yet?

Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients are the raw materials required to produce medicines. They are also referred to as bulk drugs.

Meanwhile, 14 Italians, who are among those who have tested positive, have been shifted to the Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon from an ITBP quarantine centre.

The hospital issued a statement on March 5 morning, saying these patients are housed on a completely separate floor, which has been quarantined and has no contact with the rest of the hospital.

There is a dedicated medical team wearing protective gear looking after these patients. All items used on the floor are isolated to that floor.

The isolated floor will completely contain the disease even with these asymptomatic persons. All other hospital operations are operating as normal, and there is no increased risk to patients, visitors or staff, the statement said.

Twenty-one Italian tourists and their three Indian tour operators were shifted out from an ITBP quarantine centre here on Wednesday as they were exposed to novel coronavirus.

An affected Italian couple is being treated at Jaipur's SMS medical college.

Uttar Pradesh Health Minister Jai Pratap Singh said 175 people have been tested so far for coronavirus in the state with 157 of them showing no sign of the infection.

Of the remaining 18 tested, six are from Agra and one from Ghaziabad, he said, referring to the seven cases which have tested positive.

The reports of the remaining 11 are yet to be received from NIV, according to the Minister.

Seven persons from three families have been isolated at home at Seoni in Madhya Pradesh for suspected exposure to the coronavirus following their return from Italy last month.

Though none of them exhibited symptoms of the infection, the step was taken as a precaution as Italy is the worst-affected country in Europe from the coronavirus, an official said.

81,2020/03/05,SC refuses to allow Delhi violence victim to intervene in hate speech case of activist Harsh Mander,"The Delhi Police had on Wednesday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court against Harsh Mander and sought initiation of contempt proceedings against him

The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to allow a victim of the recent Delhi violence to intervene in a matter in which the Centre has raised the issue of alleged hate speeches by activist Harsh Mander during anti-CAA protests.

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves mentioned the matter before a bench headed by Chief Justice S. A. Bobde and said the riot victim wanted to intervene in the Harsh Mander case, which is scheduled to be heard on Friday.

“We will not allow you to intervene,” Mr. Bobde told the advocate.

Mr. Gonsalves said he had seen the video of an alleged hate speech by Mr. Mander and wanted to place it on record.

“We had asked the solicitor general to put it (video of alleged hate speech by Mander) on record. We don’t need you in that proceeding,” the Chief Justice of India (CJI) said.

When Mr. Gonsalves said he had appeared for Mr. Mander before the high court in the Delhi violence matter, the bench said, “You can appear for him here also.”

The Delhi Police had on Wednesday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court against Mr. Mander and sought initiation of contempt proceedings against him for alleged “derogatory remarks” making insinuations against the apex court and its judges.

The affidavit was filed after the Centre’s allegation before the Supreme Court that Mr. Mander, who has sought registering of FIRs against some BJP leaders for their alleged hate speeches that purportedly led to the violence in Delhi, himself had made certain objectionable remarks against the top court, “majesty of law”, the government and Parliament.

The Supreme Court had taken strong note of the Centre’s allegations and not only refused to hear Mr. Mander’s counsel Karuna Nundy till the issue of his alleged hate speech is “sorted”, but also kept his petition to itself while transferring other pleas related to the violence to the Delhi High Court.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had referred to some of the alleged hate speeches delivered by Mr. Mander during the anti-CAA protests and at the Jamia Millia Islamia on December 16 last year.

He had read out in court certain excerpts from alleged speeches of Mr. Mander and said they included objectionable statements about the apex court, Parliament and the government.

The apex court, in May least year, had come down heavily on Mander for seeking recusal of the then CJI from hearing his PIL saying it would not allow anybody to “browbeat” and “damage the institution“.

The then CJI Ranjan Gogoi had struck off Mr. Mander’s name as the petitioner and had rather appointed his lawyer Prashant Bhushan as the amicus curiae in the case.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/h3b7f5/article30986457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th04-kdr-SC---DG3576UIF73jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-refuses-to-allow-delhi-violence-victim-to-intervene-in-hate-speech-case-of-activist-harsh-mander/article30991156.ece
82,2020/03/05,Pleas challenging CAA to be heard after Sabarimala reference case: SC,"Senior advocate Kapil Sibal sought urgent hearing of matters related to the Citizenship law

The Supreme Court on Thursday said it will hear pleas challenging the constitutional validity of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act after arguments in the Sabarimala reference matter are over.

A Bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde said this after senior advocate Kapil Sibal sought urgent hearing of matters related to the CAA while stating that the Centre had not filed a reply in the matter so far.

He said the case needs to be listed for hearing at an early date so that it is does not become infructuous.

Attorney General K.K. Venugopal told the Bench, also comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and Surya Kant, that the Centre would be filing a reply in a few days.

Mr. Sibal said certain interim orders are required to be passed in the case.

The apex court said it would consider this and granted liberty to Mr. Sibal to mention the matter again after the Holi break.

A nine-judge Bench is re-examining various religious issues, including the entry of women into the Sabarimala temple and mosques, and the practice of female genital mutilation in the Dawoodi Bohra community.

The CAA, which was notified on January 10, grants Indian citizenship to non-Muslim minorities — Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians — from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh who had migrated to India till December 31, 2014, following persecution over their faith.

The top court, on December 18 last year, had decided to examine the constitutional validity of the CAA while refusing to stay its operation.

While hearing a batch of petitions, the top court had on January 22 made it clear that the operation of the CAA would not be stayed and gave the government four weeks to respond to the pleas challenging the CAA.

The court had also said that the pleas concerning Tripura and Assam as well as the matters related to Uttar Pradesh, which is going ahead with the implementation of the CAA without framing any rules, could be dealt with separately.

It had also said that the modalities of hearing the batch of petitions on the CAA would be decided in-chamber and the court may fix them for day-to-day hearing after four weeks.

President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 on December 12, turning it into an Act.

Several petitions have been filed challenging the constitutional validity of the CAA. Among those who have filed pleas are the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, RJD leader Manoj Jha, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi.

The IUML said in its plea that the CAA violates the Fundamental Right to Equality and intends to grant citizenship to a section of illegal immigrants by making an exclusion on the basis of religion.

The petition had alleged that the government’s CAA was against the basic structure of the Constitution and intended to explicitly discriminate against Muslims as the Act extended benefits only to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians.

83,2020/03/05,COVID-19 | Narendra Modi’s Brussels visit put off as virus cases rise to 30,"Ghaziabad man tests positive; States asked to form rapid response teams.

Owing to the recent global COVID-19 outbreak, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Brussels has been rescheduled, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday. This, with India reporting another confirmed novel coronavirus case from Ghaziabad, taking the total to 30.

To prevent the spread of the virus, the Delhi government has now ordered immediate closure of primary schools in the capital till March 31. “All Delhi government, aided, private and schools run by civic bodies will remain shut,” said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia. Delhi has also suspended biometric attendance.

Responding to questions about the India-EU summit, MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar told journalists that it was decided that delegates should not travel to each other’s countries.

Mr. Kumar said the summit would be rescheduled to a mutually convenient date, which was yet to be decided. The summit was expected to take place at the EU office in Brussels on March 13. On March 4, 10 new cases of coronavirus were reported from Brussels, taking the total number of cases in Belgium to 23.

He also said no case of any Indian being affected by the virus in Iran had emerged, and embassies across the world were on the job to help Indians.

Steps suggested

The Union Health Ministry on March 5 confirmed that India had a total number of 30 positive cases of COVID-19. “A man from Ghaziabad, with recent travel history to Iran, has tested positive for the virus, taking the total number to 30. We have now asked the States to form rapid response teams at district, block and village levels to contain the spread,” said a release by the Health Ministry.

The cases that India has reported so far include “three cases from Kerala, who have now been discharged. In addition, there are three cases from Delhi-NCR, [two with travel history from Italy, and one with travel history of Iran]; six contacts of the first Delhi case with travel history of Italy; one from Telangana with history of Dubai travel and Singapore contact; 16 Italians and one driver[Indian] who was with the Italian tourist group,” the Ministry said.

The two suspected cases of Telangana have tested negative at NIV, Pune. Also, the 14 Italian cases, and all Indian patients are stable and being monitored, according to the Ministry.

Minister’s statement

Making a suo motu statement first in the Rajya Sabha and then in the Lok Sabha on steps taken to contain the virus, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said a total of 6,49,452 passengers had been screened at airports till date from 6,550 flights. In addition, there were 29,607 persons under the IDSP community surveillance and contact tracing.

“With the increase in the number of cases in addition to visa restrictions already in place, passengers travelling from /having visited Italy or Republic of Korea and desirous of entering India will need certificate of having tested negative for COVID-19 from the designated laboratories authorised by the health authorities of these countries,” the Health Ministry said. This would be enforced from March 10 and was a temporary measure until COVID-19 cases subside.

The Delhi government’s health officials said five persons who came in contact with the Paytm employee had been tested and quarantined till their results come in.

Stock of raw materials

Assuring that India has sufficient stock of active pharmaceutical ingredients — raw materials needed to make medicines — to last the next three months, Chemicals and Fertilizers Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda said he was heading a task force to increase API production with schemes for specific drug manufacturing parks, so that India becomes self-sufficient in this regard.

The coronavirus outbreak in China has disrupted supply chains for APIs and speaking at an industry event in Ahmedabad, Mr. Gowda said the export ban on 26 APIs for common medicines was imposed to ensure that there was no domestic shortage due to the coronavirus outbreak.

84,2020/03/05,Nirbhaya case | Supreme Court to step in if convicts are not hanged on March 20,"Will promptly decide the government’s appeal for permission to separately hang them to death, the Suprenme Court says.

The Supreme Court on March 5 made it clear that any delay in the scheduled execution of death sentence of the four Nirbhaya gang-rape case convicts on March 20 will see the court itself step in on March 23 to promptly decide the government's appeal for permission to separately hang them to death.

The assurance from a three-judge Bench led by Justice R. Banumathi came while addressing the government's apprehension that chances are high that one or other of the four convicts may turn up in court before March 20 with a new plea and further delay the execution.

“I am no astrologer... but they [convicts] will find something to delay the March 20 execution... I am not in a hurry to execute them, but the system is suffering when the punishment keeps getting postponed. The convicts have been taking the system for a ride... Even now, it has been over two years since their review petitions were dismissed by the Supreme Court,” Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta submitted.

At this juncture, Justice Banumathi turned to the convicts’ lawyers to come prepared on March 23 as the court would not entertain any requests for adjournment. The court would examine the government's appeal to hang them separately even if it involves an “extended hearing” on March 23, Justice Banumathi assured.

The Bench was hearing an appeal filed by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Delhi government for permission to separately hang those among the four convicts who had exhausted their remedies in court and before the President.

The apex court hearing came within an hour of a trial court issuing a fresh death warrant to execute the four men on March 20 at 5.30 a.m. The death warrant was issued after the President rejected the mercy plea of Pawan Gupta, who was the last among the four convicts to seek pardon for the crime of brutally gang-raping a 23-year-old paramedical student in December 2012.

As of now, all the four — Gupta, Mukesh Kumar Singh, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Kumar Singh — have exhausted their available legal and constitutional remedies. Gupta may, however, approach the Supreme Court to challenge the rejection of his mercy plea.

‘Exploitation of system’

The Solicitor-General argued how the convicts have “exploited the system” for all these years to delay their punishment. He found fault with the way the sessions court kept extending their execution dates. He submitted that the Delhi High Court, on February 5, 2020, ordered the convicts to exhaust all their remedies within seven days. The convicts, in turn, defied this order by approaching the apex court and the President. The trial court towed along by deferring their execution dates. The previous death warrant had their execution fixed for March 3. But this had to be put off when Gupta filed a curative petition in the Supreme Court followed by a mercy plea before the President.

Mr. Mehta said it was “dehumanising to keep them [four convicts] under such threat. None of statutory provisions say they cannot be executed separately. Only the trial needs to be held simultaneously”. A 14-day interval followed the dismissal of each individual mercy petition. The simultaneous execution of the four would happen only after the 14-day interregna for all of them were over.

“So, ideally, if there are four convicts and 14 days each, the total number of days required is 56. But in this case, it has dragged on for almost a year now... At least, Mukesh and Vinay should be allowed to be executed immediately”, Mr. Mehta submitted.

At this, Justice Banumathi said the court intended to lay down the law on whether convicts in one case can be executed separately.

“In this case, there are only four...” Justice Banumathi began to say, before Mr. Mehta completed her flow of thought by adding “yes... but what if there were 20 convicts in a case?”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4t1crt/article30990698.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI2172020000171B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhaya-case-supreme-court-to-step-in-on-march-23-if-convicts-are-not-hanged-on-march-20/article30990699.ece

Suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain was arrested by the Delhi police on Thursday in connection with the murder of Intelligence Bureau staff member Ankit Sharma in northeast Delhi during the recent riots.

He had applied for anticipatory bail at the Karkardooma court, and a decision on his plea was to be announced by the magistrate on Thursday. In between, he reached the Rouse Avenue court to surrender and moved an application claiming that he was facing threats. The court rejected the application, saying the matter did not fall under its jurisdiction, said a police officer.

Mr. Hussain was taken into custody from the Rouse Avenue court premises and was taken to the Sunlight police station for further investigation, the officer said.

The councillor had been absconding. His last location was traced at Jamia Nagar on March 1.

“We are waiting for the forensic report of the materials seized from Mr. Hussain’s building after the violence. The report on liquid-filled bottles and other materials is awaited,” said the officer.

The officer added that the police obtained several videos in which people were seen throwing stones from the terrace of Mr. Hussain’s house. They would gather details of these people.

89,2020/03/05,"Create right perception about force using technology, Doval tells young SPs","If police ‘fails’ to enforce law, democracy fails: NSA Ajit Doval

National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Thursday said the responsibility of police officers was not just to maintain law and order but also create “right perception” about the force using technology. He, however, cautioned that it should be totally credible and not “propagandist”.

Addressing around 150 young Superintendents of Police at the third such conference in Gurugram’s Apparel House, Mr. Doval felt that technology could play an important role in “perception management” and not just finding solution to the routine problems related to policing.

“In a democracy, it is extremely important that you should not only be totally dedicated to the law and do things fairly and objectively, but you are seen as credible,” said Mr. Doval in his around 30-minute address.

It was the responsibility of senior officers to create the right perception about the force through social media or their contacts. It was the perception that provided confidence to people, enhanced their trust and made their lives psychologically more secure. People felt safe when they had the perception that the police were honest, alert, efficient, objective, professionally competent and friendly, he stated.

Mr. Doval, a 1968 batch IPS officer, said that in the face of a problem, there were a few constants that one could not change, and the variables. Technology helped convert the constants into the variable and augmented the capability of the police. He also emphasised the need to define the problem first to find a solution to it.

90,2020/03/05,"Social scientists, economists demand halt to NPR data collection","They want exercise to be de-linked from Census 2021

A collective of economists and social scientists has published a joint statement demanding that data collection commissioned as part of updating the National Population Register (NPR) be stopped and that it be de-linked from the ongoing Census 2021 data-gathering exercise.

“There is a real danger that the concerns around the National Population Register and the fears that are growing among substantial sections that investigators can determine whether a respondent’s citizenship is “doubtful”. This possibility has already led to widespread public distrust and suspicion about the NPR, and it is not at all clear that there are any benefits from the NPR at the present juncture,” the nearly 100 researchers have said in a statement.

“It is essential to ensure that the exercise of data collection for Census 2021 is absolutely safe, comprehensive and uncontaminated by any other factors,” they added.

Conducting NPR along with the Census also violates Clause 15 of The Census Act 1948 that bars anyone from accessing “any book, register or record made by a census officer in the discharge of his duty”. It also violates the provision in the same clause that “no entry in any such book, register, record or schedule shall be admissible as evidence in any civil proceeding other than a prosecution under this Act,” the statement added.

The signatories span a range of institutions from the Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University, Azim Premji University, The Indian School of Business, Hyderabad to international establishments such as the Oxford University and the New York University.

There have been widespread protests across the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019 and the proposed National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC). West Bengal and Kerala have suspended work related to the preparation and update of the NPR.

The NPR, a register of residents of the country with demographic and biometric details, was supposed to be prepared between April 2020 and September 2020 ahead of the Census slated for 2021. Preliminary work on the NPR has begun in several States.

Here is the full statement by the collective of economists and social scientists:

We are economists and social scientists who are deeply concerned about the major implications for the Indian statistical system, of the attempt to combine data collection for the 2021 Census of India with that for the proposed National Population Register.

The Census of India, which provides a basic household and population listing based on anonymous data, is an essential requirement for the country and provides the statistical basis for all assessments of the conditions of the population and for necessary social and economic policies. The Census data are also important in enabling central and state governments to exercise their basic functions and meet their responsibilities to the people. It is therefore essential to ensure that the exercise of data collection for Census 2021 is absolutely safe, comprehensive and uncontaminated by any other factors.

However, there is a real danger that the concerns around the National Population Register and the fears that are growing among substantial sections that investigators can determine whether a respondent’s citizenship is “doubtful”. This possibility has already led to widespread public distrust and suspicion about the NPR, and it is not at all clear that there are any benefits from the NPR at the present juncture. Conducting NPR along with the Census also violates Clause 15 of The Census Act 1948 that bars anyone from accessing “any book, register or record made by a census-officer in the discharge of his duty”. It also violates the provision in the same clause that “no entry in any such book, register, record or schedule shall be admissible as evidence in any civil proceeding other than a prosecution under this Act”.

We therefore demand that, in order to preserve the integrity of Census 2021, it should be completely delinked from any NPR exercise. In any case, any attempt at data collection for the NPR should be abandoned at present.

93,2020/03/05,Bombay and Delhi IITs among world’s top 50 tech institutions,"JNU is India’s best in arts and humanities category

The Indian Institutes of Technology, Bombay and Delhi, have both broken into the world’s top 50 engineering and technology institutions, according to a key global ranking released on Wednesday.

In fact, five IITs — including Kharagpur, Madras and Kanpur — made it into the top 100 list in that category of the QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) World University Ranking by Subject for 2020. IIT-Bombay was ranked at 44, while IIT-Delhi stood at 47.

However, engineering and technology was the only major subject group where Indian institutions were able to crack the elite top 100 tier. Overall, 12 institutions from the country were ranked in the top 500 in this category alone.

In the natural sciences category, three Indian institutions made it to the top 200: IIT-Bombay at 108th rank, closely followed by the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, at the 111th position, while IIT-Madras scraped in at the 195th rank.

Jawaharlal Nehru University remained the country’s top institution in the arts and humanities category, with a global ranking of 162, followed at a distance by Delhi University (DU) at 231. However, DU topped the social sciences and management category, with a global ranking of 160, followed by IIT-Delhi at 183.

94,2020/03/05,Freedom in the World 2020 report ranks India among least free democracies,"BJP government’s “alarming” policies draw comparisons with Chinese repression

India has become one of the world’s least free democracies, according to a global survey, which warned that “the Indian government’s alarming departures from democratic norms under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could blur the values-based distinction between Beijing and New Delhi.”

The Freedom in the World 2020 report ranks India at the 83rd position, along with Timor-Leste and Senegal. This is near the bottom of the pile among the countries categorised as “Free”, with only Tunisia receiving a lower score. India’s score fell by four points to 71, the worst decline among the world’s 25 largest democracies this year.

Also read: Retrieving ideas of democracy and nation

The annulment of autonomy and the subsequent shutdown of Kashmir, the National Register of Citizens and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, as well as the crackdown on mass protests have been listed as the main signs of declining freedom in the report, released on Wednesday by Freedom House, a U.S.-based watchdog, which has been tracking global political and civil liberties for almost half a century.

“These three actions have shaken the rule of law in India and threatened the secular and inclusive nature of its political system,” said the report. “While India continues to earn a Free rating and held successful elections last spring, the BJP has distanced itself from the country’s founding commitment to pluralism and individual rights, without which democracy cannot long survive.”

The report noted that India has long been seen as a democratic counterweight to China and hence a strategic partner for the United States in the region. However, that view is changing, with India attracting criticism similar to that levied against China.

“Just as Chinese officials vocally defended acts of state repression against Uighurs and other Muslim groups before international audiences in 2019, Modi firmly rejected criticism of his Hindu nationalist policies, which included a series of new measures that affected India’s Muslim populations from one end of the country to the other,” said the report.

The report slammed the internet blackout in Kashmir, terming it the longest shutdown ever imposed by a democracy. It said freedom of expression was under threat in India, with journalists, academics and others facing harassment and intimidation when addressing politically sensitive topics.

The report derives its methodology from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. It covers 195 countries, awarding scores based on political rights indicators such as the electoral process, political pluralism and participation and government functioning, as well as civil liberties indicators related to freedom of expression and belief associational and organisational rights, the rule of law and personal autonomy and individual rights.

India scored 34 out of 40 points in the political rights category, but only 37 out of 60 in the civil liberties category, for a total score of 71, a drop from last year’s score of 75.

The report treats “Indian Kashmir” as a separate territory, which saw its total score drop precipitously from 49 to 28 this year, moving it from a status of “Partly Free” to “Not Free”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/1lvgcd/article26030904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19THiStock-940573444-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/freedom-in-the-world-2020-report-ranks-india-among-least-free-democracies/article30988277.ece

Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal and a few others have been booked by the ED in a money laundering case even as the agency is conducting searches at his premises, officials said on Thursday.

They said a criminal case against the former chairman of the airlines has been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after taking cognisance of a recent Mumbai Police FIR filed against him.

Also read | Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal not cooperating in probe: Centre tells High Court

The Enforcement Directorate carried out raids at Mr. Goyal’s premises in Mumbai on Wednesday and also questioned him after filing the case, they said.

The action is continuing, they added.

The Mumbai Police FIR pertains to charges of alleged fraud by Mr. Goyal and others against a Mumbai-based travel company.

Mr. Goyal has earlier been grilled by the central probe agency in a case filed under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in September last year.

The agency had carried out similar raids, under the FEMA, in August last year against Mr. Goyal, his family and others.

ED has alleged in the past that the businessman’s empire had 19 privately-held companies, five of which were registered abroad.

The agency is probing charges that these firms allegedly carried out “doubtful” transactions under the guise of selling, distribution and operating expenses.

The ED suspects that expenses at these companies were allegedly booked at fake and high costs and as a result, they “projected” huge losses.

Alleged shady aircraft lease transactions with non-existent offshore entities are also under the ED scanner and it is suspected that Jet Airways made payments for lease rental to “ghost firms”, which purportedly routed the ill-gotten money in Mr. Goyal’s companies.

A full-service carrier, Jet Airways shut its operations in April last year after running out of cash.

A month earlier, Mr. Goyal had stepped down as the chairman of Jet Airways.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3celb1/article29351218.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NARESHGOYAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-books-former-jet-airways-founder-naresh-goyal-for-money-laundering-conducts-raids/article30987757.ece

Officials of the Department of School Education and Literacy in the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development have sent a letter to the Chief Secretaries of all States to take steps to educate students on protocols to be followed to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

In a letter dated March 4, Secretary Amit Khare advised the Chief Secretaries of all States and Union Territories that all schools should raise awareness among their students about the spread of such infections.

The letter has provided detailed instructions: “create awareness about preventive interventions such as frequent hand wash, respiratory etiquette (using handkerchief over mouth while coughing/sneezing, use of tissue paper or using the sleeve of shirt covering the upper arm, staying away from school when sick, avoiding public gathering etc.) to help preventing/reducing transmission.”

It further adds that these methods would not only help to prevent the spread of COVID-19 but also other communicable diseases, particularly flu-like illnesses.

The COVID-19 has struck at the time when the Central Board of Secondary Examination’s class X and XII public exams are being held. The CBSE, on Wednesday, permitted students to carry face masks and hand sanitisers into examination halls.

The J&K High Court on Wednesday directed the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to ""to identify the protocol and take steps to evacuate Indian students stranded in Iran"".

The court also directed the MEA to ensure availability of ""required material, including masks, medication and essential commodities including food etc."" to all Indians, especially the stranded students.

Around 300 students from J&K are believed to be stranded in Iran. Many students in the past two weeks uploaded SOS videos online, seeking help from the Centre in their evacuation.

The court said the MEA, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and Ministry of Civil Aviation should “identify the protocol” for the evacuation. It was hearing a petition filed by Dr. Zahoor Hussain Mir, whose niece, Heena Sugra Shabnam, studies medicine in Iran's Tehran University. ""Shabnum was supposed to return to home on February 26 on vacation.

The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) wants insurers to expeditiously handle hospitalisation claims pertaining to COVID-19.

“Where hospitalisation is covered in a product, insurers shall ensure that the cases related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shall be expeditiously handled,” the regulator said. On Wednesday, it issued guidelines for handling such claims, which came into immediate effect.

The costs of medical expenses during the course of treatment, including the treatment during quarantine, should be settled in line with the applicable terms and conditions of the policy contract and the extant regulatory framework, general manager (Health), D.V.S. Ramesh said in the circular.

The IRDAI also advised the companies that all the claims ought to be “thoroughly reviewed by the claims review committee before repudiating them.” Noting that insurers are introducing products for various specific diseases, including vector-borne diseases, it urged them to design products covering the costs of treatment for COVID-19.

Senior executives of insurance companies also issued statements on COVID-19 claims.

SBI General Insurance Head-Underwriting and Reinsurance Subramanyam Brahmajoysula said, “Claims due to coronavirus are payable, provided the person concerned is hospitalised for at least 24 hours. Most of the health insurance policies in India do not cover outpatient treatment. However, if coronavirus is declared a pandemic by the WHO or the Indian government, claims might not be payable as such claims are excluded under many health insurance policies.”

Brakes on travel cover

Travel cover is a segment of insurance business that has started feeling the heat of the coronavirus outbreak.

Fifty-year-old Venkateswara Rao has tried all ways, including putting up of electric fence, bursting of crackers and placing of colourful sarees to keep at bay animals straying into his field in remote Gangavaram village of Prakasam district.

In the process, the farmer with just one acre of land ended up spending about ₹80,000 to save his crops, but without getting the desired result. So is the case with another farmer K. Anji Reddy, who has grown bengal gram in his two acres of land as it had always proved to be tough to stave off intruding animals like monkeys, bandicoot rats, and deer.

A novel device developed by Electronics and Communication Engineering(ECE) students of QIS College of Engineering and Technology under the guidance of their department head Ch. Hima Bindu has come as a big boon for the farmers of the village, near S.N. Padu, about 20 km from here.

“Now we are able to stave off the wild animals straying into our fields without harming them or we ourselves getting injured while bursting crackers under pitch dark condition late in the night,” says a farmer, B. Hanumantha Rao, who is happy with the intrusion-free farming.

The device made with PVC pipes by the members of the ECE Students Research Club triggers exothermic reaction when the chemicals in it is ignited with a gas lighter. The released gas produces a big sound and scares away the animals, which do not dare to visit the farm once again, explain club leaders B. John Rohith and P. Chandrasekhar.

Free of cost

To start with, the device developed on trial and error method, has been provided free of cost to scores of farmers in the village.

“We can supply any number of canon guns for interested farmers from other villages for a price of ₹600 each,” says Dr. Hima Bindu.

“We are in the process of developing upgraded version of the canon gun with electronic sensors attached to it to trigger chemical reaction automatically when animals stray into farms,” she says.

They have got an invitation to give a presentation on the device at IIT, Kanpur tech fest later this month, say the proud members of the club with more than 60 students. Other devices developed by them include a water filter and Kisan cutter, they add.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/xg06z9/article30994072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06VJPAGEDEVICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/this-device-proves-to-be-a-boon-for-farmers/article30994073.ece
100,2020/03/05,Ashok’s family to move HC on Sanchaita’s appointment,"State government has violated all norms, allege TDP leaders

The family members of former Union Minister P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju are expected to file a petition in High Court seeking stay on the appointment of Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju, daughter of former MP P. Ananda Gajapathi Raju as chairperson of MANSAS ((Maharaja Alak Narayana Society of Arts and Science) Trust. Mr. Ashok Gajapathi Raju, who is currently in New Delhi, is likely to come to Vizianagaram shortly to discuss the issue with legal experts and confidants of his family.

Addressing the media here, TDP MLC Dwarapu Reddy Jagadish, TDP district president Mahanti Chinnam Naidu said that the State government violated all the norms of the Society Act and appointed Ms. Sanchaita as chairperson although her mother Uma Gajapathi Raju took divorce from Ananda Gajapathi Raju in 1991.

“MANSAS Trust has high reputation in the region and Mr. Ashok Gajapathi Raju is highly respected person. He was removed as chairperson of the trust. Moreover, only male members of PVG family are supposed to be the chairpersons of the trust as per its by-laws. The State government violated all the rules and regulations and it would be challenged in High Court,” said Mr. Jagadish.

Differences in family

The State government issued a GO 74, dated March 3, 2020, appointing Ms. Sanchaita as chairperson, replacing former Union Minister P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju who was the chairman of the trust since 2016. Mr. Ashok Gajapathi Raju’s daughter Aditi Gajapathi Raju is currently director of the board. There have been serious differences among the family members of the two brothers for the last few years after the death of Ananda Gajapathi Raju. Ms. Sanchaita has come to limelight just before the elections and campaigned for the BJP in the State. Along with the Endowments Department, the trust controls 108 temples, including Simhachalam Devasthanam, and 14,800 acres of costliest lands in Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam districts. The trust also looks after several educational institutions including MR College, and MVGR College of Engineering.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ashoks-family-to-move-hc-on-sanchaitas-appointment/article30994062.ece
101,2020/03/05,"Monitoring panel reads riot act to schools, junior colleges","‘Institutions collecting advance fee will not be spared’

The Andhra Pradesh School Education Regulatory and Monitoring Commission (APSERMC) has warned schools and junior colleges in the State against advance collection of fee for the coming academic year.

Formed by the Jagan Mohan Reddy government immediately after coming to power to streamline the educational sector, the commission is also endowed with judicial powers to crack the whip when necessary. In the first of the 13 district-level meetings planned with stakeholders to fix the tuition fee from LKG to Intermediate, the commission members on Wednesday sat with the representatives of aided, unaided, corporate schools and junior colleges, parents and social activists.

Inputs sought

V. Narayana Reddy, a retired professor of anthropology at SV University and B. Eswaraiah, formerly associated with Rishi Valley School, who represented the commission, sought inputs from the participants, when the schools proposed to categorise themselves into rural and urban schools for fixing the fee. On the other hand, the junior colleges opted to be divided into five categories — rural, semi urban, urban, tribal and metropolitan areas. It was in this connection that Prof. Reddy issued a stern warning to the institutes not to collect fee in advance before the fee was fixed, terming it ‘illegal’ and making them liable for action. He also informed the parents to bring such demands to the commission’s notice.

As the Intermediate examination began today, the panel members, along with the Regional Inspection Officer M. Krishnaiah, visited SV Junior College for checking the presence of drinking water and medical facilities.

They interacted with students from the TTD’s School for Deaf and Dumb, who they found were bubbling with enthusiasm for a flying career.

Later, accompanied by Regional Joint Director B. Venkatakrishna Reddy, they had midday meal along with the students of the Padmavathipuram government school.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rfwzkz/article30988659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05VJPAGE5REGULATORYPANEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/monitoring-panel-reads-riot-act-to-schools-junior-colleges/article30988660.ece
102,2020/03/05,AKNU to set up museum on folklore of Godavari districts,"Assistance of Culture Ministry is being sought, says V-C

The Adikavi Nannaya University (AKNU) is all set to set up a dedicated museum on the folklore of East and West Godavari districts on the university campus at Rajamahendravaram in East Godavari district.

Speaking to The Hindu over the phone, AKNU Vice-Chancellor M. Jagannadha Rao said: “A decision has been taken to set up the folklore museum on our campus with the assistance of the Ministry of Culture. Our team has been entrusted with the task of working on the project.”

“The academicians, folk artists who participated in the closing ceremony of the two-day national seminar on folklore knowledge and impact of globalisation have strongly advised the need for an initiative to set up the folklore museum,” said Prof. Rao.

“The university will offer a suitable site on the campus for setting up the museum that is to primarily house documents and folk instruments.”

Financial aid

Referring to the financial aid being offered by the Ministry of Culture for preserving the folklore knowledge, Prof. Rao said the Central government could offer up to ₹ 3 crore for projects such as this.

“We want to explore the opportunities to set up the folklore museum. It is a fact that migration in the rural Andhra Pradesh is said to be the prime reason for poor patronage of folklore literature,” the Vice-Chancellor said.

Responding to AKNU’s proposal, many literary organisations have promised necessary support.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pyljp2/article30988647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05VJAKNUV-C,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/aknu-to-set-up-museum-on-folklore-of-godavari-districts/article30988648.ece
103,2020/03/05,"Sailajanath slams Jagan on SCS, NPR","CM urged to bring pressure on Centre for special category

What happened to the oft-repeated promise of Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy of getting Special Category Status for Andhra Pradesh, if people send enough number of YSRCP members to the Lok Sabha, asked APCC president Sake Sailajanath on Wednesday.

At the party workers’ meeting here, Mr. Sailajanath asked Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy: “Now you have 22 MPs in the Lok Sabha, why are you not putting pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NDA government to grant SCS for the State?”

Alleging that there was a tacit understanding between the YSRCP and the BJP, the Congress leader said it was ludicrous to say after a Cabinet meeting that it would ask the BJP government not to implement the National Population Register survey to be conducted from April 1 with the existing set of questions, while it needs to just issue a Government Order stalling the exercise in A.P. The Chief Minister was speaking of Muslims losing confidence if such an exercise was taken up with question number 15 and 16 explicitly seeking the date of birth and place of birth of one’s father, but he did not restrict the District Collector from giving a statement on the NPR exercise.

“This shows the duality of the YSRCP government on the issue and it must forthwith issue a gazette notification saying the Citizenship Amendment Act, National Register of Citizens and National Population Register will not be implemented in the present form,” Mr. Sailajanath said. Had the YSRCP not voted for the CAA, people could have believed it, but it was talking in a different tone to just pacify the people’s feelings, he alleged. The NPR was the first step towards NRC and everyone can see the fate of 18 lakh people from Assam, who lost their citizenship, though they were Hindus, he added.

104,2020/03/05,‘Ensure BCs get their due in local body elections’,"Naidu asks YSRCP govt. to file SLP in Supreme Court

Telugu Desam Party president N. Chandrababu Naidu has urged Chief Minister Y.S .Jagan Mohan Reddy to file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court to reinstate the 34 % quota for the backward classes in the local body polls and assured that the TDP would support such move.

In a letter addressed to the CM, Mr. Naidu said that as per the AP Panchayat Raj Act 1994, Section 15 clause 2, BCs have been provided 34 % reservation in the post of Sarpanches, 34 % for Mandal Parishads under Section 152 Clause 1 (A) and 34 % reservation for ZPTCs under Section 180 Clause 1 (A).

Local body polls were held in 1995-96, 2000-2001, 2005-2006 and 2013-14.

‘Unilateral decision’

“The provision of 34 % reservation for BCs has helped many BC leaders to achieve social and political advancement. Further, the Supreme Court has upheld the then State government’s decision to have 60.55 % reservations for BCs in the year 2013-14. We condemn the decision of the State Government not to contest the decision of Supreme Court scrapping the 34 % reservation and going ahead with 24 % quota for BCs and we also oppose the move to take unilateral decision without consulting the BC groups and opposition parties . We urge the State government to file a SLP immediately in the Supreme Court,’’ said Mr. Naidu.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/csqtiw/article30988553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05ONGNAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ensure-bcs-get-their-due-in-local-body-elections/article30988554.ece

The Cabinet has decided to keep the National Population Register (NPR) process “in abeyance” in the State till the Centre reverts to the 2010 questionnaire. The Cabinet, which met under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Wednesday, also adopted a resolution requesting the Central government to change the NPR questionnaire and also remove the apprehensions among “crores of people” on the issue.

Disclosing the details of the Cabinet meeting, Information and Public Relations (I&PR) Minister Perni Venkataramaiah (Nani) said that the people were apprehensive of questions in the NPR. New questions have been added in the present NPR. The people wanted the government to continue the questions listed in the 2010 NPR, but the Central government decided to go ahead with its plans.

Awareness

The Cabinet felt that it was not just to forcibly impose the NPR on the people. “The onus is on the Centre to remove the apprehensions and create awareness among people on NPR. We are only asking the Centre to fulfil its responsibility,” he said.

The Minister said the Centre had made a decision and was asking the States to implement it. “When crores of people of the State are scared…we have the right to safeguard people’s interests. As we are the implementing agency, we have decided to keep the process in abeyance till the Centre concedes our request,” he asserted.

Asked if the State has the power to overrule the Centre’s decision, the Minister said, “We felt it is just. If we don’t have power,we will see.”

Mr. Jagan had on Tuesday said that the government would introduce a resolution in the Assembly during the upcoming session requesting the Central government to revert the conditions in NPR to those prevailing in 2010.

He had tweeted, “Some of the questions proposed in the NPR are causing insecurities in the minds of minorities of my State. After elaborate consultations within our party, we have decided to request the Central Government to revert the conditions to those prevailing in 2010. To this effect, we will also introduce a resolution in the upcoming assembly session.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cabinet-decides-to-keep-npr-process-in-abeyance/article30985176.ece

As many as 5,42,202 students appeared for the Intermediate Public Examinations (IPE) on the first day on Wednesday across Andhra Pradesh. No untoward incidents were reported from any of the centres barring three cases of malpractice.

According to Board of Intermediate Education (BIE) officials, out of 5,63,944 students scheduled to appear for the examinations, 21,742 students remained absent. BIE officials arranged 1,411 centres across the State and had ensured tight security at all the centres.

Invigilators booked three cases of malpractice on the first day of the examinations on Wednesday, officials said.

Medical facilities, drinking water, transportation and other facilities were provided to students, BIE officials said.

Testing times

An atmosphere of nervousness prevailed at many examination centres, with many students arriving well ahead of time before the start of the examination. At some centres, however, there were a few latecomers who were seen making a dash at the last minute.

Examinations were also conducted for vocational courses on Wednesday.

Dealing with latecomers

Students have been asked to arrive at the examination centres an hour ahead of the commencement of the exam.

Speaking to The Hindu, BIE Secretary V. Ramakrishna said that instructions were issued to the Chief Superintendents and the invigilators to not apply the ‘One-minute rule’ strictly to all cases. If some students arrive late at the exam centre, the Chief Superintendent will use his/her discretion and will take a decision on whether or not to allow the student into the centre, Mr. Ramakrishna said.

Mr. Ramakrishna appealed to all the student to make use of ‘Know Your Seat’ and ‘Centre Locator APP’, which will be easier for them to trace and identify their seating position in advance.

“We have arranged for proper desks and uninterrupted power supply at all examination centres in the State. Authorities will monitor the situation at each centre through the CCTV cameras arranged at the centres,” the Secretary said.

“We will start letting students inside the centres half-an-hour before the start of the exams so that there will be no hurry,” Mr. Ramakrishna said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/fpervw/article30985160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05VJPAGE3INTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/542-lakh-students-appear-for-intermediate-exams/article30985161.ece

The National Water Development Agency (NWDA) had proposed nine links, which would take place in two phases.

The present proposal is to link the Godavari (Akinepalli) Nagarjuna Sagar Project Tail Pond with the Cauvery (Grand Anicut). Surplus water will be taken from the Akinepalli barrage on the river Godavari and transferred to the Nagarjuna Sagar Project in the Krishna basin.

The State Government announced on Wednesday that eight suspected cases of COVID-19 have been reported across hospitals in the State, where they are currently undergoing treatment in special isolation wards.

In Visakhapatnam, five suspected cases were reported on Wednesday and they were admitted to the Chest Hospital. Eluru, Vijayawada and Kakinada reported one suspected case each, and all three were admitted to the respective district government hospitals, according to an official release.

All of the five suspected cases in Visakhapatnam have a travel history — three of them had visited Singapore while two had visited Bahrain in the recent past. Those in Kakinada, Vijayawada and Eluru had arrived from South Korea, Germany and Muscat respectively, officials said.

“Isolation wards have been set up in all 13 districts, and protocols for transport of samples, screening and investigation have been tightened. Waste disposal systems too have been strengthened by setting up Rapid Response Teams,” Minister for Health Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas said in a press release issued on Wednesday.

The State Government has also set up control rooms that will function round the clock, and individual protection kits, N-95 masks and triple-layer masks have been stocked.

So far, 65 passengers out of 281 have been kept under observation at their residences. Two persons have been admitted to hospital and their samples tested negative.

Sleuths of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) reportedly conducted searches on the houses of AgriGold chairman and directors here on Wednesday.

Police registered cases against AgriGold in different police stations across the State and shifted all the cases to the Crime Investigation Department (CID) five years ago, when the management reportedly failed to repay the deposits.

CID officials registered about 15 cases and arrested about 22 persons.

Investigation officers had arrested its chairman Avva Venkata Ramarao, directors A. Venkata Seshu Narayana, Seetaram, Hema Sundar and other representatives of AgriGold Group of Companies.

Many of them came out on bail and investigation is under progress.

About 140 persons, including some depositors and agents have died, and the government gave ₹7 crore compensation to the bereaved families.

The management had reportedly floated about 15 companies in different States.

According to the AgriGold Customers and Agents’ Welfare Association, the company established some 27 years ago, had collected about ₹7,625 crore from 32 lakh customers, of which 19.52 lakh customers were from Andhra Pradesh. They invested ₹3,957 crore in the company.

833 properties identified

CID had identified about 833 properties owned by AgriGold Group of Companies.

The company has properties in seven other States, the investigation officers said.

As the State police has been investigating the multi-crore scam, the ED searches raised the eyebrows of many and created confusion among the customers, who have been waiting for the return of their hard-earned money for the last five years.

The ED officials who raided the houses of the directors seized some documents and records.

114,2020/03/05,"Insipid Budget, says MIA","The stakeholders in the commerce and industrial sector have termed the State Budget 2020-21 as insipid.

The Mysore Industries Association Chairperson Vasu said there are more negatives than positives in the Budget and described it as lacking in imagination.

The MIA said though the State government has announced that a global investors’ conference will be held in November, there is no corresponding policy initiative or incentive to encourage the industries.

Similarly, the Budget is silent on the development of the industrial cluster in Mysuru while it has not announced the release of ₹2 crore for the export centre, said Mr. Vasu.

Suresh Kumar Jain, Secretary of MIA and representing MSMEs, said the Budget is silent on the long pending demand for a helipad at the industrial area either in Hootagalli or Metagalli. This was imperative for large industries to thrive as commuting from Bengaluru airport to Mysuru, that takes almost 5 hours in one direction, was a discouraging factor.

115,2020/03/05,Garment workers’ demand,"The announcement of “Vanitha Sangathi”, to provide free monthly bus passes to one lakh women labourers working in garment factories in Bengaluru, has been widely welcomed by the workers in Mandya and Ramanagaram districts. Nevertheless, they expressed their displeasure over the Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa restricting the benefits to Bengaluru.

There are a good number of garment factories operating in Channapatna, Ramanagaram, Bidadi, Magadi, Kanakapura, Mandya, Maddur, Srirangapatna, Nagamangala and other parts of Mandya and Ramanagaram districts. Nearly, 30,000 women, from teenagers to elderly women, from both the districts are working there, said Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) leader Shalini. The lack of proper transportation facilities has been prompting them to travel in three-wheelers.

Many had lost their lives in road accidents in recent years, said Sharmila, a workers’ leader at a factory in Maddur. The government should extend the benefits to workers across the State, she added.

According to Malini, a member of All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) in Ramanagaram, the workers will submit a memorandum to Mr. Yediyurappa shortly demanding the extension of the “Vanitha Sangathi”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/3pe2s2/article30993897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MANDYAWOMEN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/garment-workers-demand/article30993898.ece
116,2020/03/05,A disappointing farefor Mysuru on infrastructure front,"It gets nothing by way of special allocation in the Budget

The State Budget for 2020-21 tabled in the Assembly on Thursday has been a disappointing fare for Mysuru city / surrounding regions none of which finds a direct mention under any of the major or minor schemes.

The city figured only twice in the entire Budget the details of which are in the public domain. Apart from a grant of ₹2 crore for the documentation of traditional tribal medical systems and practices and establishing processing units of select medicines, Mysuru gets nothing by way of special allocation.

The second time the city figures in the Budget is the announcement of an allocation of ₹80 lakh for the purchase of printing machines for the Government Braille Printing Press in Mysuru.

Among the infrastructure projects for which the State government’s intervention was anticipated was the land acquisition and transfer to the Airport Authority of India for the expansion of the Mysuru airport.

This was imperative for the runway extension and required acquisition and transfer of 115 acres of land for the first phase of the expansion. But it finds no mention in the Budget though Mysuru MP Pratap Simha had submitted a memorandum underlining its importance.

Similarly, Mr. Simha had sought financial allocation for starting the Mysuru (Belagola) - Kushalnagar stretch of the railway line which has received administrative approval from the Railway Ministry but the project is yet to get started. For, the State government has to procure land and also commit itself to meet 50 per cent of the project cost for the railway line to be viable. But there is no mention of the same in the Budget.

Interestingly, the speech of the Chief Minister clearly mentions that land will be provided free of cost to Dharwad-Belagavi railway line through Kittur and the State government has agreed to bear 50 per cent of cost of the works. In addition, it has also promised to enhance the capacity of rail line in the ghat region between Sakleshpura and Subrahmanya stations by the Hassan-Mangaluru Rail Development Corporation (HMRDC). However, no such assurances have been held out for either the Mysuru airport or the Kushalnagar railway line.

Though officials here said that these are sanctioned projects and hence funds would be made available through extra-budgetary resources a budgetary allocation would have helped expedite the commencement of the project.

Though there is a sizeable allocation of ₹500 crore for the tourism sector, the allocation is for the entire State and despite Mysuru being a major tourist destination, there is nothing specific for the region.

Similarly, a special grant was sought for the golden chariot for Chamundeshwari temple of which there is no mention. But this may be tapped from the allocation made for development of nearly 25,000 temples and other monuments in the State, or the project may be dropped.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9ya8e/article30993880.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MYSAIPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/a-disappointing-fare-for-mysuru-on-infrastructure-front/article30993881.ece
117,2020/03/05,No major announcements,"The Budget presented by the Chief Minister, B.S. Yediyurappa, on Thursday has largely disappointed the people of Mandya and Ramanagaram districts. The proposal of implementing “Jaladhare” scheme, with the assistance of Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, is the only project that Mr. Yediyurappa has announced for his native district Mandya. Nevertheless, he has not specifically announced the sum that would be allocated.

Mandya district, considered as the ‘sugar bowl’ of southern Karnataka, had been expecting some major announcements from Mr. Yediyurappa as he is a native of Bookanakere of K.R. Pet taluk in the district.

Revival of the government-run Mysugar mill and cooperative sector Pandavapura Sahakari Sakkare Kharkhane (PSSK) sugar mill, renovation of canals, rejuvenation of lakes, special packages to boost the rice mill/aalemane (traditional jaggery making units), establishment/development of industrial areas, encouragement to industrial sector, improvement of infrastructure at tourism places, special packages to the drought-hit farming sector and announcement of industrial parks were some of the expectations.

Ramanagaram

The Budget has proposed to establish a silk worm processing centre on public-private partnership (PPP) model at Kanva Farm in Ramanagaram district, with a target of processing 30-32 tonnes of silk worm larvae a day. According to its ‘electric vehicles and energy storage policy’, the government has proposed to establish an “electric vehicles and energy storage manufacturing cluster” at the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) area in Harohalli of Ramanagaram taluk. A sum of ₹10 crore has been earmarked for this purpose.

The government has proposed to establish a “waste to energy” power generation centre, of 11.5 mega watt capacity, with the joint partnership of Karnataka Power Corporation Limited and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike in Bidadi of Ramanagaram at an estimated cost of ₹210 crore.

‘Good move’

The Shivamogga District Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SDCCI) has welcomed the announcements to boost tourism in the district.

J.R. Vasudev, president of SDCCI, said allocation of funds for upgradation of amenities at Jog Falls and to develop a tourist circuit with Jog Falls as its epicentre is a good move. Allocation of ₹5 crore for development of Tyavarekoppa tiger and lion safari was an important announcement.

To address the monkey menace in Malnad region, the State government is establishing a monkey park where the monkeys that raid agriculture fields would be shifted.

An all-woman crew was in charge of the Mysru-Bengaluru Tipu Express on Thursday as part of the International Women’s Day 2020 campaign launched by the Indian Railways.

It is being held from March 1 to 10 and the Mysuru division is organising various activities including health checkups, yoga camps, trekking, cultural and sports competitions, to build a gender-equal workplace and to salute the spirit of women empowerment.

119,2020/03/05,Film city: Mysuru’s loss is Bengaluru’s gain,"Yediyurappa announces project in capital city with private participation at a cost of ₹500 crore

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has announced a film city of global standards in Bengaluru. In his budget for 2020-21 presented on Thursday, Mr. Yediyurappa said the film city would be established at a cost of ₹500 crore with private participation in Bengaluru.

However, he has not allocated funds to the project and it seemingly is going to be a “private-funded” facility. The government may consider giving land to the project.

Even as finer details of the announcement are awaited, Mysuru seems to have lost the race in getting a film city in its neighbourhood.

Confusion had surrounded the project with plans to shift it from Mysuru after H.D. Kumaraswamy, former Chief Minister, had announced the setting up of a film university in Ramanagaram. The reports had forced former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who had announced the project, to intervene and urge Mr. Kumaraswamy to keep the project in Mysuru since land needed for it had been handed over to the authorities.

Himmavu, near Mysuru, falling under Varuna constituency which is represented by Mr. Siddaramaiah for two terms and now by his son Yathindra, was identified for the project. But efforts to move it closer to Bengaluru, the hub of the Kannada film industry, continued after Mr. Siddaramaiah’s tenure ended. One of the reasons cited for moving the project to Ramanagaram was that the industry and people dependent on it were based in Bengaluru and it was convenient for them if the project was developed closer to the capital.

After the BJP government came to power, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan had spoken about setting up the film city in Bengaluru, creating doubts about the project in Mysuru. The stakeholders here had launched an online campaign to keep Mysuru as the site for the project. But the Dy.CM succeeded in bringing the project to Bengaluru.

Mysore Travels’ Association founder president B.S. Prashanth, who had launched a online campaign for keeping the film city in Mysuru, said stakeholders would continue to bring pressure on the government to keep the project in Mysuru.

Memorandum submitted

Director-producer S.V. Rajendra Singh Babu had submitted a memorandum to Mr. Yediyurappa’s office sometime ago urging him to retain Mysuru as the location for the film city. Many from the industry had been in favour of Mysuru, he had claimed.

Mysuru has an 80-year-old history of film-making and it’s rare to find 250 shooting venues in a radius of around 25 km. Mysuru alone had 16 palaces. A Hollywood film was shot in Mysuru in 1946 and the director of the film had apparently described Mysuru as one of the best locations for outdoor shooting, Mr. Babu had stated in his letter.

The film-maker had also suggested that the government consider setting up the projects in Bengaluru and Mysuru for giving bigger advantage to the film industry.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/film-city-mysurus-loss-is-bengalurus-gain/article30993240.ece

121,2020/03/05,New policy to be evolved for reviving farm sector,"Water conservation schemes get prime focus in Budget

In a bid to revive the agriculture sector, the budget presented by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday, has proposed to bring in a new agricultural policy.

The policy, among other things, would prescribe measures to encourage water security, concepts of land bank and mass cultivation, besides micro irrigation, processing of farm produce and marketing. Of course, the bigger intention has been to provide a status of industry to agriculture and horticulture, notes the budget.

The Chief Minister has also proposed to waive interest on defaulting farm loans obtained from cooperative bodies for purchase of farm equipment. A sum of ₹466 crore has been provided for the scheme, which is estimated to help about 92,000 farmers. He has also proposed to provide an interest exemption to the extent of 5 per cent on loans taken by areca growers upto a maximum loan amount of ₹2 lakh from cooperative bodies.

The State is also set to announce another policy which would prescribe crops suitable for specific regions based on recommendations by the Land Resources Registry, availability of water and soil health.

REWARD project

Karnataka being a State that has large tracts of drought-prone land, it appears that the budget has given importance to efficient utilisation of water as well as conservation of water and rainfed farming activities. This is evident with the State announcing that it would take up a World Bank funded new multi-state watershed area development project (REWARD) for the next six years to assist farming on 10 lakh hectares of land.

Similarly, a feasibility report is set to be prepared to turn the flood-irrigated command areas of various irrigation projects into Israel-model micro-irrigation systems, even as a target of bringing an additional one lakh hectares under irrigation has been set for 2020-21.

The budget has also announced that the Jalamrutha project will be implemented in 810 small watersheds covering four lakh hectares in the next three years to promote water conservation and rainwater harvesting.

This is in addition to the water audit programme to budget the water consumption and reduce water scarcity through “Jalagrama Calendar” to be taken up in all the villages. Similarly vented dams have been proposed in the coastal region and Western Ghats area.

Mobile clinics

As part of efforts to take farm extension services to farmers’ doorsteps, it has been proposed to launch “mobile agricultural health clinics” for soil and water testing besides providing various technical information relating to insecticides and diseases. These mobile units will visit the villages and take up on-the-spot testing of soil and water. But there is no mention of size of the scheme and financial allocation.

To address the issue of post-harvest losses in the horticulture sector, the budget has proposed to establish 10 cold storage units with a capacity of 5,000 tonnes each under public-private partnership model in the APMC yards at a cost of ₹75 crore.

It has also proposed to strengthen the HOPCOMS besides utilising the Krishi Rail scheme of the Centre to transport flowers and horticultural produce from Bengaluru to Delhi, Mumbai and Thiruvananthapuram.

To encourage small and marginal farmers to shift to horticulture, it has announced an incentive of ₹5,000 per hectare to such farmers.

The cultivation of Teff, Chia and Quinoa too has been brought under “Raitha Siri” scheme under which incentive would be provided for cultivation of drought-resistant varieties like minor millets. Similarly, ₹200 crore has been earmarked for encouraging organic farming.

As many as 40 demonstration centres would be set up in different areas of the State to create awareness among farmers about best agricultural practices, new technologies and post-harvest management.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/new-policy-to-be-evolved-for-reviving-farm-sector/article30990097.ece

124,2020/03/05,Karnataka budget: Petrol and diesel prices set to spiral up,"This is to compensate cut in GST, 15th Finance Commission allocation: CM

The BJP government’s first full-fledged Budget this term, presented by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa amidst an “unprecedented magnitude of economic difficulties” in the backdrop of economic slowdown, has hiked tax on petrol and diesel by 3 per cent and excise duty on Indian-Made Liquor by 6 per cent to compensate sharp reduction in State’s share in the Central pool of taxes as well as allocation in the 15th Finance Commission.

Though the Chief Minister termed the Budget for 2020-21 as “inclusive, balanced and development-oriented”, it would translate to spike in prices of commodities and travelling with hike in petrol and diesel prices by ₹1.60 per litre (from 32 to 35%) and ₹1.59 per litre (from 21 to 24%), respectively, in a cascading effect.

Effective from April 1

Hike in fuel prices would come into effect from April 1, 2020, while new liquor prices would come into effect from July 1, 2020. The hike in fuel and liquor prices is expected to mobilise nearly ₹3,000 crore to the State exchequer.

During his 110-minute Budget speech, Mr. Yediyurappa admitted to the decline in economic growth rate by 1 per cent, from 7.8% in 2018-19 to 6.8% in 2019-20. The State’s share in Central taxes reduced by ₹8,887 while the GST compensation reduced by ₹3,000 crore, totalling ₹11,887 crore in 2019-20.

There would be a reduction of ₹11,215 crore in the State’s share of Central taxes in 2020-21 following reduction in allocation by the 15th Finance Commission. Likely increase in expenditure of ₹10,000 crore for 2020-21 towards salary, pension, and interest on loans was another reason cited for hike in fuel and liquor pries.

Cut in Central funds seems to have impacted the expenditure on subsidy to basic necessities such as food, electricity, housing, and education under various schemes. The estimated subsidy has come down by ₹2,212.21 crore, from ₹25,688.12 crore in 2019-20 to ₹23,475.91 crore in 2020-21. The subsidy for food and housing declined by ₹1,209 crore and ₹807.1 crore, respectively.

The size of the Budget at ₹2,37,893 crore is 1.6% larger than 2019-20. With a revenue surplus estimated at ₹143.32 crore, the fiscal deficit is expected to be ₹46,072 crore, which is 2.55% of the GSDP.

For stimulating economic growth through various industrial and development projects across the State, a whopping ₹55,732 crore has been aside for the next fiscal year. While ₹4,552 crore has been set aside for conservation of culture, heritage, and natural resources, ₹8,772 crore set aside for development of Bengaluru.

Unlike the previous Budgets which were presented department-wise, Mr. Yediyurappa in his Budget, overall 7th Budget, spelled out various programmes and schemes in the six major sectors to ensure social justice on the eve of 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

Noting that agriculture is the foundation for all other professions, he announced a slew of measures to boost farm productivity, which included formulating a new agricultural policy, ₹500 crore for Kalasa-Banduri Nala project and ₹1,500 crore for the Yettinahole project.

A sum of ₹32,259 crore was allocated for agriculture and allied sectors.

Recognising the importance of OBCs, Mr. Yediyurappa announced funds for various community-based corporations, Christians, and development of slums. A total of 15.88% (₹37,783 crore) of the Budget amount has been allocated to 953 programmes for women.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-budget-petrol-and-diesel-prices-set-to-spiral-up/article30989446.ece

The Kerala High Court has directed the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) to file in two weeks an affidavit containing the details including its recruitment policy, the actual requirement of drivers and the basis on which the requirement is arrived at.

Justice A.K. Jayasankaran Nambiar on Thursday also directed the Corporation to furnish the details regarding the number of schedules being operated by it, the current driver-schedule ratio and the basis of its fixation.

Drivers and schedules

The court asked the KSRTC to indicate in the affidavit the basis on which the reduction in the ratio between the driver and schedules was brought about. Besides, the affidavit should contain the relevant portion of any report relied upon for arriving at the ratio reduction.

The KSRTC should also give the details regarding the drivers being engaged on a daily wage basis and should also state as to whether such appointments were only for filling leave vacancies or for making up for the shortfall on any given day for operating the schedules, the court ordered.

Moreover, the affidavit of the KSRTC should indicate the number of drivers who have retired or have left the service for other reasons from January 1, 2020 till date, the court said.

PSC rank list

The court issued the directives on a writ petition filed by Nideesh Kumar and other candidates on the PSC rank list for KSRTC drivers, seeking a directive to the PSC to advise candidates from the rank list published on August 23, 2012 to fill the 2,455 vacancies reported to the PSC.

KSRTC submission

Meanwhile, in a fresh affidavit, the KSRTC submitted that it had decided to reduce staff strength in all categories to bring it on a par with the national average staff strength.

127,2020/03/05,Sabarimala ropeway’s eco impact in focus,"‘Project consultant failed to consider uniqueness of site’

The work on the Sabarimala ropeway project, for transporting goods between the Sannidhanam and Pampa, is unlikely to commence this year too, with the Forest Department finding faults with the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) submitted by the Kochi-based Eighteenth Step Damodar Cable Car Private Ltd. The department has raised certain crucial questions on the environmental impact of the ropeway.

At a public hearing at the collectorate here recently, Assistant Conservator of Forest C.K. Haby stated that the consultants had failed to consider the “uniqueness of the project site in the Periyar Tiger Reserve, the safety and security aspects as well as the custom and beliefs as mentioned in the Sabarimala Master Plan.” The minutes of the hearing, signed by Collector P.B. Noohu, quotes Mr. Haby as saying that the “consultants never consulted the Forest Department on the matter.” According to Mr. Haby the advantage of the proposed ropeway over the present tractor transport system is not clear as the pollution load due to tractor movement has not been assessed.

Moreover, the impact of large-scale removal of earth and cutting of trees has not been quantified. The time required for restoration of the forest and the measures to mitigate the environmental impact have not been assessed, he said.

Mr. Haby said the “Forest Department has doubts over the reliability of the EIA report.” The Collector too raised apprehensions about selecting the Pampa hilltop as the terminal base station, as even parking of vehicles is not permitted in the area following the deluge of August 2018.

Company’s version

Uma Nair, company spokesperson, has clarified that trees would be cut at the pillar points. There would be 19 pillars for the proposed ropeway and trees coming in the endangered category, if any, could be protected by rearranging the pillar positions. The company is ready to conduct an additional study at the earliest to quantify the pollution caused by the tractor movement. However, the details pertaining to the earth removal and its impact could be assessed only after the soil test, she said.

Ms. Nair said special care would be taken to ensure that elephant routes and animal crossing paths were not affected.

The Health Department has initiated measures to arrange antivenom at the Community Health Centre (CHC) at Perumbalam island, Shanimol Usman, MLA, has said.

In the event of a snakebite, the patient needs to be rushed to a hospital having antivenom.

“The residents of Perumbalam depend on jankar and boat services to reach the mainland.

This results in enormous loss of time in providing medical assistance to the victim. It is even more difficult to transport the patient to a hospital as jankar and boat services come to a halt at nightfall.

I raised the issue with the Health Minister and the government has taken steps to store anti-venom at the health centre,” Ms. Usman said.

131,2020/03/05,Rajkumar death: report to be submitted before July 5,"Panel collects 54 documents, statement from 54 witnesses

The K. Narayana Kurup Commission inquiring into the custodial death of Kolahalamedu resident Rajkumar would submit its report before July 5.

Talking to press persons after collecting the evidence at its sitting at the PWD Rest House, Thodupuzha, on Thursday, he said the commission had clear evidence on the circumstances that led to the torture and death of Rajkumar. The panel so far collected 54 documents and took statement from 54 witnesses.

It would also take statement from 20 more witnesses. Though notices were issued, a few persons, including the first accused and the then sub inspector at the Nedumkandam police station, did not appear before the commission. Mr. Narayana Kurup said the panel enjoyed the powers of a civil court and the action against those who had failed to appear before it would be considered. He said another sitting would be held in Kochi.

Doctor and vicar

Those appeared before the commission were the doctor who had treated the victim when he was brought to the Peerumade taluk hospital from the sub-jail, the vicar of St. Sebastian’s church at Wagamon where the body was buried, and the victim’s neighbours at Kolahalamedu where he was brought after the police arrested him. It was with the aim to recover the money he had collected from the public in the name of Haritha Financiers that he was brought there.

It was alleged that the police had assaulted him at Kolahalamedu in the hope of recovering the money they had believed was kept there. The vicar was a witness when the body was buried at the cemetery and when exhumed for re-post-mortem. The commission took his statement also.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rajkumar-death-report-to-be-submitted-before-july-5/article30993990.ece

The fire in the main Pongala hearth was transferred to the small hearths prepared by the devotees on the temple premises and on the wayside.

The line of devotees offering the Pongala extended beyond Kumbazha junction, 6 km from the temple, and up to Kaduvakkuzhy on the Puthukkulam Road.

The deity was taken out in a decorated palanquin-type carriage in a procession for accepting the Nivedyom offered by the devotees outside the temple.

133,2020/03/05,Phase III of Life Mission soon,"List of 7,400 beneficiaries drawn up for the housing scheme in Alappuzha

The third phase of the Livelihood Inclusion and Financial Empowerment (Life) Mission, a housing project of the State government, is all set to kick-start in the district.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will lay the foundation stone for the construction of a housing complex at Paravoor here at 11.30 a.m. on Sunday. The third phase of the Life Mission is aimed at providing houses to those who have neither a home nor land.

P.P. Udaya Simhan, district coordinator, Life Mission, said they had drawn a list of 7,400 eligible beneficiaries of the total 19,000 who had applied for inclusion in the third phase.

Earlier, the State government had accorded administrative sanction for construction of four apartment complexes in different parts of the district in the third phase of the project. Apart from Paravoor, housing complexes will be constructed at Thazhakara, Pallipad and Mannancherry.

Mr. Udaya Simhan said the housing complex at Paravoor would be constructed on 2.15 acres of land for 156 families. The land has been provided by the Alappuzha municipality.

At a cost of ₹35 crore

“The complex with two seven-storey blocks will be constructed at a cost of around ₹35 crore. The 500-sq.ft. units will have two bedrooms, a kitchen, hall, among other facilities,” he said. Besides, a hi-tech anganwadi, drinking water facility, waste treatment system and park would be set up.

The complex at Thazhakara would be constructed on revenue land, which could accommodate 140 families. The flats in Pallipad and Mannanchery would be constructed on the land provided by the respective panchayats. Each flat could house 44 families. Apart from these, houses will be constructed under cluster/housing complex schemes in other parts of the district.

The Life Mission has taken up the construction of 19,309 houses in the first two phases. Of the total houses, 15,884 have been completed so far.

Officials said that the rest of the houses would be completed before the end of March.

1,618 houses

In municipalities, the highest number of 1,618 houses were completed in Alappuzha. Among grama panchayats, Mannancherry remains on top with construction of 415 houses.

134,2020/03/05,Second phase of vigil against COVID-19,"21 home nurses who were working in Italy have been told to remain in home isolation

AS the COVID-19 scare refuses to die down, the Health Department has commenced the second phase of its preventive action against the spread of the disease.

63 in isolation

According to officials 63 people, including 21 people, who work as home nurses in Italy have been directed to remain in home isolation in the second phase.

The officials have been monitoring the health condition of the people in home isolation on a day-to-day basis.

In the first phase, 125 people, including six students who were airlifted from Wuhan in China recently, were advised to go on isolation. Among them, all but one has completed their quarantine period.

Jacob Varghese, District Medical Officer (DMO), has advised people from COVID-19-affected countries to stay at home for at least 14 days even if they exhibit no symptoms.

“People from such countries should contact the Health Department officials right at the time of their arrival.

If anyone has symptoms similar to that of COVID-19, they must either contact the Government Medical College Hospital (Sajith Kumar - 94472 39277) or the District General Hospital (Sindhu G Nair - 94473 47282),” the DMO said.

The DMO has also advised those in home isolation to avoid taking part in public functions or adopting public modes of transportation for travel.

They have been requested to consume hot water and avoid frozen food, besides rinsing their throats with saline water.

Apart from the Government Medical College Hospital and the General Hospital, the Health Department is planning to set up more isolation wards in taluk hospitals and 10 private hospitals in the district.

Ambulances

Minister for Culture A.K. Balan said on Thursday that he had taken up the issue with Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran. The Indian Society for Cultural Cooperation and Friendship deplored the decision of the MVD personnel and asked the government to return the money collected as fine to the drama troupe.

Meanwhile, AMVI Sheeba, who inspected the vehicle of the drama troupe in the wake of accidents, clarified that ₹24,000 was not the sum of money collected as fine and that it was the size of the two boards in sq cm.

136,2020/03/05,Ire over MVD action against drama troupe vehicle,"Fine slapped on vehicle for sporting oversized board on top

Various cultural organisations came up in protest against the action of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD), which slapped a fine on a vehicle of Aswathi Theatres, Aluva, for displaying a board with the name of the theatre group on top.

Condemning the action of the Assistant Motor Vehicle Inspector, who slapped a fine of ₹24,000 alleging that the board was oversized, the Purogamana Kala Sahitya Sangham (Pukasa) here on Friday asked the department to rethink its action.

“It is learnt that the fine was levied as the board displayed on the vehicle was oversized. Even if it is true, the department should be ready to relax the fine. Theatre groups in the State are not earning huge sums of money. Many are struggling to survive. They are functioning for social development. They deserve support and consideration of the government,” said the Pukasa in its press release.

“Even our current Budget shows that the government is ready to support theatre groups,” the release added. The organisation urged the MVD to ease the fine slapped on Aswathi Theatres.

The Kerala Kala Samkarika Vedi also protested against the step taken by the MVD. The theatre workers in the State were struggling to make both ends meet. It was inhumane to slap such a huge fine on them, it said. The theatre group was on its way to Chavakkad.

Street play

Staff Reporter writes from Palakkad: The Samskarika Sahithi staged a street play near stadium bus-stand here on Thursday in protest against the Motor Vehicles Department slapping a fine of ₹24,000 on a theatre group’s vehicle for fixing a drama poster on it.

The drama wing of the Samskarika Sahithi demanded that the department withdraw from the move to tarnish the cultural and theatre firmament of the State. Lawyer Gireesh Nochulli and Bineesh Kadur led the protest street play. Sahithi district chairman Boban Mattumantha inaugurated the protest.

138,2020/03/05,Action plan for tackling heat,"Collector asks District Disaster Management Authority to prepare project

The District Disaster Management Authority has been asked to prepare a project to tackle calamities such as sunstroke, sunburn, fire accidents, and forest fire.

District Collector S. Shanavas on Thursday asked the authority to prepare a project with coordination with various departments.

Regulate work hours

School assemblies where there is possibility of sunstrokes should be avoided or cut short.

Head teachers should take precautions to avoid circumstances for sunstroke/sun exhaustion.

Awareness should be given for teachers and other school staff on first aid in case of sunstrokes.

Work hours should regulated as part of avoiding heat casualties. Break should be given between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. Labour officers should visit work stations and ensure that preventive measures against heat incidents have been initiated, the District Collector said. Availability of medicines and services of doctors should be ensured at health institutions under local self- governments. It should be ensured that there is no power failure at hospitals, he added.

Vehicles that distribute drinking water should be strictly monitored. The officials concerned should examine the sources of drinking water and ensure quality. GPS data of the vehicles should be strictly monitored. Preventive steps should be taken to avoid shortage of drinking water. Projects to make available drinking water in public places should be formed with the support of local bodies.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/etqkpl/article30993821.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tv-suncol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/action-plan-for-tackling-heat/article30993822.ece
139,2020/03/05,Govt. orders inquiry into leaks from PHQ,"‘Divulgence’ of CAG’s communication to Police dept. in public domain

The Kerala government has ordered an inquiry into the leakages of sensitive information and documents from the Police Department to the public domain. The inquiry team comprises at least three Home Department officials.

The probe will focus on the “divulgence” of communications send by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) to the police on topics relating to the utilisation of modernisation funds for the acquisition of sensitive equipment.

Law enforcers believe that the “calculated leaks” had exposed technical specifications of classified equipment, including that acquired for VVIP safety and Sabarimala temple security.

Nature of leaks

The police had told the government earlier that the cyclical nature of the leaks to a set of television news channels had imperilled the confidentiality of the law enforcement and signalled a conspiracy to undermine the department's leadership.

Home department officials privy to the procedure said at least a few officers and a private agency with links to the media were likely to be caught up in the investigation.

A preliminary inquiry by the police intelligence had covered much ground. By some accounts, special branch officials had tracked down the sources of the leaks by analysing mobile phone calls and identifying digital communication patterns.

They said the current inquiry might be a precursor of possible departmental action or perhaps even criminal charges.

Security compromise

The investigation would also reportedly focus on whether there was any infringement of the Official Secrets Act or any compromise on aspects of State and national security.

The CAG’s damning report faulting the police for misusing modernisation funds to purchase luxury vehicles and build well-appointed villas for ranking officers had put the government on the backfoot.

The CAG had also pointed out that the police headquarters had violated store purchase rules and norms set by the Central Vigilance Commission to acquire equipment through total solution providers in both the private and public sector.

Seemingly stung by the CAG’s findings and allied media reports, the government had recently announced a commission headed by a retired High Court judge to frame a set of rules to enable the police to acquire essential equipment expeditiously.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-orders-inquiry-into-leaks-from-phq/article30992977.ece

141,2020/03/05,BJP rejig turns out to be a fiasco,"Senior leaders express resentment on being deprived of their due

Reorganisation of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State unit has ended up in fiasco with some of the senior leaders expressing resentment on being deprived of their due and a host of others waiting in the wings to take on the leadership in due course.

The decision to have K. Surendran as State president and carve out a new team to bolster the organisation ahead of the local body and Assembly elections has suffered a blow with simmering differences in the party coming to the fore.

The first to fire a salvo against the decision was State spokesperson and one of the senior most leaders M.S. Kumar. He instantly reacted once the list of office-bearers was released by the State leadership here on Thursday.

In a letter shot off to Mr. Surendran, Mr. Kumar said had the leadership consulted him, at least over telephone before making the announcement, it could have been avoided.

He expressed difficulty in holding the post of State spokesperson offered to him. “I am forwarding this letter within 30 minutes after the announcement either to correct or repeal the decision. On failing to do so, this may be treated as my resignation,” he said.

The State leadership is understood to have informally decided to have Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders Valsan Thillenkeri and C. Sadanandan, and Mr. Kumar and C. Krishnakumar as general secretaries. But in due course, a patch-up formula evolved and M.T. Ramesh, who had overtly aired his dissent against Mr. Surendran, was made general secretary and Mr. Sadanandan vice president. The national leadership had its nominee George Kurien as one of the general secretaries.

The decision to retain Mr. Kumar as spokesperson along with three others was seen as the national leadership’s bid to sideline him and he left in protest.

Certain other leaders who had aired their differences of opinion in Mr. Surendran taking over as president have been accommodated as vice presidents. The party currently has 10 vice presidents.

The State leadership explained the reorganisation as an inclusive process as it comprised representatives of all communities. Due representation has been given to all sections. It dubbed as unfounded reports of schism and dissidence in the party.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bjp-rejig-turns-out-to-be-a-fiasco/article30992239.ece
142,2020/03/05,Govt. invokes ESMA against KSRTC drivers,"Opposition walks out in protest against govt. response to strike

The government has invoked the provisions of the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) against at least a score of Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) employees responsible for the flash strike that caught citizens off guard here on Wednesday.

It had come under severe criticism for the administration’s ‘failure’ to resolve the impromptu revolt that disrupted life in the capital for over five hours. The issue reverberated strongly in the Assembly on Thursday.

The United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition walked out in protest against the government's ‘indifference’ to the plight of stranded commuters and motorists. Participating in an adjournment debate on the topic, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the government's ‘belated response’ had caused the death of an ailing commuter.

The administration remained unconcerned, as aberrant drivers parked buses in the middle of thoroughfares, blocking the movement of vehicles, including ambulances.

Mr. Chennithala said Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran, the City Police Commissioner and the District Collector remained oblivious to the ‘anarchy and lawlessness’ on the streets.

The government behaved like a modern-day Nero, the Roman emperor who infamously played the violin when the capital burned.

The Opposition spotlighted the absence of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Mr. Saseendran in the Assembly and resented the fact that the government had tasked Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran to reply to their charges. They objected to Mr. Surendran's riposte that a ‘backbencher’ had pressed the motion.

Mr. Vincent said the issue broke out when the police sided with the private bus operator against the KSRTC. He alleged that some officers were on the payroll of individual operators.

They had maltreated a transport official who penalised a private bus crew for encroaching on KSRTC routes and timings to poach passengers.

Mr. Surendran said the government was against unannounced strikes that inconvenienced the public. Moreover, the police had registered cases against erring KSRTC employees. They had booked them for obstructing their duty and other allied crimes.

Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan rejected the adjournment motion.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-invokes-esma-against-ksrtc-drivers/article30991761.ece
143,2020/03/05,11-year-old visually-challenged Ibin conquers Periyar in the company of his teacher,"They covered the 600 m of the deepest stretch of the river, which has a maximum depth of 30 feet at one point, in 22 minutes flat

Swimming across the deepest stretch of Periyar on Thursday morning, 11-year-old Ibin C. Thomas never for once looked daunted.

Neither could anyone gauge that the youngster who was calmly wading through the water was visually-challenged. For the seventh standard student from the School for Blind, Aluva, who fought the loss of sight at the age of four to make his mark in arts and cultural field, the conquest of Periyar was another proud moment to cherish.

Making the moment special was his school headmistress Jiji Varghese who chose to swam across Periyar with her student.

Mimicry midway

“They covered the 600-metre of the deepest stretch of the river, which has a maximum depth of 30 feet at one point, in 22 minutes flat. Ibin was so composed and cheerful that he even chose to exhibit his mimicry skills imitating varied sounds while swimming. He kept calling out to me and I kept him on course,” said an elated Saji Valasseril who trained both of them and swam alongside them even as a country boat manned by volunteers carrying life jackets and buoys accompanied them.

Ibin walked into the embrace of his equally proud father C.M. Thomas as he completed the challenge successfully, “He was very enthusiastic and excited in the lead up to this day. He now eyes to swim across Vembanad Lake,” said Mr. Thomas who is also the PTA president of his son’s school.

Buoyed by the impressive feat of Ibin, Mr. Thomas now wants every student of the School for Blind to be trained in swimming. He felt that it will come in handy with floods becoming a recurring phenomenon in this part of the world,

In fact, the haunting memory of parents of 30-odd children of her school separated from their wards when Aluva was marooned in the deluge of 2018 was what prompted Ms. Varghese to take to swimming along with her student.

Mr. Valasseril, who has been giving free training to people of all age groups for the last 11 years, is now looking to train all 70 students of the School for Blind. Since 2010, he has trained over 3,000 people and more significantly, over 1,000 among them swam across Periyar.

Manoj, another 11-year-old visually-challenged student, had swam across Periyar under the tutelage of Mr. Valasseril last month and he is now eyeing to train around 1,000 during this vacation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/njcs38/article30990507.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/swimjpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/11-year-old-visually-challenged-ibin-conquers-periyar-in-the-company-of-his-teacher/article30989361.ece

The execution of the second phase of the Thiruvalla bypass that passes through the core area of the Ramanchira wetland needs much care and foresight to avert calamities, say A.J.John, psychiatrist, T.K.Koshy, and Jossey, Ramanchira Protection Council (RPC) leaders.

Developers have already started construction work at Ramanchira. Two streams that act as flood escape routes from the Ramanchira wetland to the opposite side of MC Road are under threat of conversion.

A sizeable stretch of the Ramanchira stream has already been converted or encroached upon. Repeated pleas to protect the wetland and the stream have not been acted upon, the RPC leaders said.

“Development sans practical wisdom, vision, and common sense will do more harm than good. Favouritism and corruption further worsen the situation, ultimately making the development project itself a public nuisance and threat to the ecosystem,” they said.

The council leaders said the perennial stream had been a key groundwater replenishment source in the locality and should be protected at any cost.

Filth from drains

The filth from drains in the town was being let out into the stream, polluting wells in the locality. Complaints raised before the civic body and the taluk administration too had failed to yield a positive impact, they said.

No action had been taken on an RPC memorandum to Mathew T.Thomas, local MLA, Cherian Polachirackal, municipal chairman, and to the Thiruvalla Sub-Collector seeking their immediate intervention to protect the natural stream and the wetland, they alleged.

Panel’s stance

They said the council was not against any development project or the much sought-after Thiruvalla bypass. But the authorities should take steps to protect the natural stream and other flood-escape routes, while executing the project.

Revenue authorities and the civic body should take necessary steps to survey the stream, demarcate its boundaries, and restore it to the original position without delay.

Seeks MLA’s intervention

The RPC leaders demanded that the local MLA should take immediate steps to ensure effective protection of the natural stream.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/go1j5u/article30987655.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tvpt-stream21,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/steps-sought-to-protect-stream-wetland/article30987656.ece

146,2020/03/05,Geotextiles for farming,"Ithikkara block panchayat shows the way

After their success with soil-less farming, Ithikkara block panchayat has now started using geotextiles for the healthier growth of crops. This breathable organic cover is expected to prevent soil erosion while ensuring proper irrigation and weed control.

“We have placed this eco-friendly sheets made of coir on one acre behind the block panchayat office. The land was separated at different levels before covering it with geotextlies as this method is ideal for contour farming,” says S.Laila, Ithikkara block panchayat president.

Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) workers will be in charge of cultivating vegetables in the land and the project is being implemented with the support of Coirfed.

Job scheme workers

“The workers were given training in geotextile installation and a 10-member MGNREGS group will taking care of all the farm activities. We will follow the organic method as it is also an attempt to ensure the availability of safe vegetables,” Ms. Laila adds.

Tubers in first phase

Totally biodegradable, geotextiles will stabilise the soil along with fostering its fertility. Apart from protecting the soil, the sheets will eventually turn into organic manure, making the soil more nutrient rich. While allowing water to pass through and blocking rapid moisture evaporation, the porous fabric will will also protect the soil surface. In the first phase of the project, tubers, including yam, taro, purple yam and tapioca, will be planted along with curry leaves.

The block panchayat started soil-less farming in 2019 as part of the Poshakasree project, which turned out to be a huge hit among farmers. “A mix of coir pith compost, waste paper, and cow dung powder is used for cultivating vegetables in this method. You can place growbags layered with these anywhere and opt for wick irrigation or any other system.”

“We are planning to extend it to all wards and also anganwadis,” Ms. Laila says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/br42tn/article30987642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tvgeo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/geotextiles-for-farming/article30987643.ece

The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has directed the State government to submit a comprehensive report on the difficulties faced by students and teachers of single-teacher schools in the State.

The intervention comes in the wake of reports that children’s education has suffered after a teacher of a single-teacher school in the Agasthymala hills in the district went on a hunger strike in protest against lack of salary for five months.

Denial of learning opportunities to children for any reason, including disruption in teachers’ salary, could not be justified. According to the reports, there were 270 single-teacher schools in the State. The nearly 5,000 students and teachers in these schools were facing hardship. The General Education Department should intervene in the matter immediately so that the educational rights of children could be protected, commission chairperson P. Suresh said.

151,2020/03/05,A bus service spreads road safety message,"TV screen fitted in the front shows pictures and messages on road safety

When bus operators take to heart traffic safety awareness, bus journey can become a pleasure.

P.K. Mohammed Shafi, a bus operator, introduced a unique concept in bus transport when he launched his new bus on the Manjeri-Tirur route on Wednesday.

Instead of placing religious symbols in the front of the vehicle, Mr. Shafi placed the front page of the Indian Constitution in Malayalam in the space.

Mr. Shafi’s Laverna bus will continue to spread the messages of road safety every day.

All passengers who travelled on Laverna on Wednesday were given booklets about road safety. The first day’s ride was free as well. A television screen fitted in the front shows pictures and messages on

road safety frequently. A road safety personal message by filmmaker Siddique is the highlight of a series of messages on the TV screen.

The bus has a water kiosk in it. Fitted with GPS, the bus announces the names of places it passes through. Laverna claims to be totally student-friendly. “We don’t want the students to be harassed. We are

offering free ride for all students up to the 7th Standard. And higher students will have to pay their concessional rates only. We will never discriminate against them,” said Mr. Shafi.

Inaugurating the service at Tirur bus-stand, Sub Collector Rajeev Kumar Choudhary called upon other services to emulate Mr. Shafi’s initiative on road safety. He said road safety had become a matter of utmost importance.

DySP Suresh Babu, Joint Regional Transport Officer M. Anvar, and Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School Principal, Sr. Ancilla George, spoke.

Mr. Shafi had been in the news a few months ago when he plied his bus on a hartal day to help the students who were writing their exams on the day.

152,2020/03/05,"Not satisfied on one issue, says Rajinikanth after meeting with RMM members","But satisfied with many things, says the actor

Superstar Rajinikanth on Thursday chaired a meeting with the functionaries of Rajini Makkal Mandram, a forum founded by him to facilitate his political entry.

Chairing a meeting of RMM district secretaries to discuss the launch of his political party and work that has already been done in this connection, Rajinikanth said he answered lots of questions from the functionaries.

Read: Opposition parties are misleading the public about CAA, NPR, says Rajinikanth

The RMM, which came into being in 2018 is a launch vehicle for the actor’s political party.

The actor said he was ‘disappointed’ over a particular thing during his interaction with functionaries of Rajini Makkal Mandram.

He, however, declined to specify what his disappointment was. The top star, who is expected to foray into politics, said he recently told a delegation of Muslim religious leaders to hold a dialogue with the Centre over their concerns on the CAA and NPR and assured his support in their effort.

Chairing a meeting of RMM district secretaries to discuss the launch of his political party and the work that has already been done in this connection, Mr. Rajinikanth said he answered lots of questions from the functionaries.

Asked when he will launch his political party, he told reporters: “Only to discuss about all such things, I met the district secretaries after a year. There were lots of questions and I answered them.

“We exchanged views on many things. They were all very much satisfied. But on a matter, I did not have much satisfaction. It was only a disappointment. I don’t like to reveal what it is. I will tell you when the time comes.”

Asked if his disappointment was a political disappointment or one related to the present political ecosystem, he said: “It is a personal (at the individual level) disappointment.”

Even as the actor was answering the question following the interaction, his fans could be heard loudly asking when he was going to launch the party.

'Pleasant meet'

He described his recent meeting with Muslim religious leaders as “a very pleasant meet”, and said they underscored that brotherhood, love and peace should prevail in the country.

“They said they are ready to do all it takes for peace and wanted my support. I said definitely I will be with them in their effort,” he said.

The actor said he wanted the religious leaders, “not politicians,” to hold consultations on their apprehensions over the CAA and the NPR and then meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shan.

Mr. Rajinikanth said he assured his support to Muslim leaders over efforts to have talks with the Centre and added that it will be a good course of action.

To a question on the possibility of him joining hands with his actor-politician Kamal Haasan, he said: “Only time will give an answer.”

Asked about the growth of the Mandram’s activities and interactions, the actor said it cannot be divulged.

On the ‘disappointment’ remark by the actor, political commentator Sumanth C Raman said, “it is very difficult to keep on prolonging the element of suspense,” hinting at the actor’s political entry expected by his fans for about 20 years.

Rajini Makakl Mandram was launched on January 1, 2018 immediately following the actor’s announcement that his political entry was a certainty.

153,2020/03/05,Court directs Director General of Police to act against both pro & anti-CAA protesters in TN,"Mere registration of FIRs will not do, disperse the crowd or take the protesters into custody, say Madras High Court judges

The Madras High Court on Thursday, directed the Director General of Police to see to it that no more agitations, either for or against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), take place in the State in public places without valid permission.

Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy said there was no point in the police merely registering First Information Reports (FIRs) against the protesters without taking further steps to alleviate the inconvenience faced by schoolchildren and others.

The orders were passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by Hindu Munnetra Kazhagam president K. Gopinath, also an advocate from Tiruppur, complaining about anti CAA protesters squatting on public roads and not allowing free movement of traffic.

Responding to the PIL, State Government Pleader V. Jayaparakash Narayan told the court that the police had registered more than 20 FIRs against both pro and anti-CAA protesters and that charge-sheets had also been filed in some of the cases.

Expressing their dissatisfaction over mere registration of cases without taking active steps to disperse the protesters squatting on public roads, the senior judge in the Bench said, “If they don't move, take them into custody.

154,2020/03/05,River linking: CM writes to Andhra govt.,"Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Wednesday said that he had written to his counterpart in Andhra Pradesh requesting a discussion on the implementation of the Cauvery-Godavari river interlinking project.

“The interlinking of Cauvery and Godavari is my dream project and once implemented, the State will get approximately 200 tmc (thousand million cubic feet) of water,” he said here.

Works for preparing the Detailed Project Report are progressing and Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have come together to implement this project.

“I spoke with the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and requested an appointment to discuss the project. As a first step, two Ministers, D. Jayakumar and S.P. Velumani, have been sent to Andhra Pradesh today (Wednesday) to meet the Chief Minister and give my letter,” Mr. Palaniswami added.

He has also sought an appointment with the Telangana Chief Minister.

Once the project is implemented, water will be drawn from the Cauvery, between Mettur and Tiruchi, through lift irrigation for a distance of 50 km, for use in dry areas. Mr. Palaniswami said that the Centre has estimated the project cost at ₹64,000 crore.

The CM laid the foundation stone for the ₹565-crore Sarbanga lift irrigation project on the banks of Mettupatti lake in Eruppalli panchayat, in the presence of Ministers and AIADMK legislators. He said that 100 dry lakes in the Sarbanga basin would be filled with surplus water from the Mettur dam and they would, in turn, improve groundwater levels in the area.

Mr. Palaniswami added that the Mettur surplus water scheme would be completed in 11 months. He appreciated government officers for their work, which had helped complete various development projects within the stipulated time.

155,2020/03/05,New industrial estate at Perundurai in the works,"It will come up on 1,000-acre area, says Industries Minister

The government is planning to develop an industrial estate at Perundurai through the State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (Sipcot), Industries Minister M.C. Sampath has said.

Inaugurating a three-day International Engineering Sourcing Show, organised by EEPC India here on Wednesday, he said the estate would come up on an area of more than 1,000 acres.

Addressing the media, he said the project would mark the second phase of the Perundurai industrial estate. The first phase was fully occupied. The second phase would house industries from different sectors, the Minister said.

The State government is focusing on Chennai and Coimbatore for industrial development. A Fintech City is being set up in Chennai at a cost of ₹270 crore. Ford has established a research and development facility at a cost of ₹1,500 crore in Chennai. The Chief Minister would inaugurate a biotechnology park in Coimbatore shortly. It would have 10 to 12 floors. A portion of the space would be dedicated to biotechnology while the rest would go to the IT sector. The park was developed at a cost of ₹80 crore.

On the Tamil Nadu Defence Corridor, Mr. Sampath said the State government would soon create a cell with a special officer. “We have a base for defence products. We should motivate the industry further and come out with schemes to attract investments,” he said.

In the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, the coir industry in Pollachi is facing challenges due to a drop in coir fibre exports to China — its main buyer. When asked about this, Mr. Sampath said two rounds of discussions were held with the Chief Minister on this issue, and steps would soon be taken to ensure that the sector is not affected further.

Minister for Rural Industries and MSME P. Benjamin said the Tamil Nadu government was planning to set up industrial parks in Chennai, Kancheepuram, and Tiruvallur for micro enterprises. If there was such a demand for Coimbatore, it would be taken up with the Chief Minister, he said.

The State government has taken several steps to benefit MSMEs. The two global investors’ summits that were held in the State have attracted ₹15,710 crore in investments from 11,058 MSMEs. Since May 2018, when the MSME single window portal was launched, 54 approvals have been provided online.

Union Commerce Secretary Anup Wadhawan said that for the country to achieve the $1-trillion export target, collective efforts were needed. The country should have an investor- and manufacturing sector-friendly environment. The Central government had taken several steps to improve the ease of doing business. Special Economic Zones had been a success for some sectors. Similar state-of-the-art facilities were needed for manufacturing as well, he said.

The Centre had recently engaged with export promotion councils to discuss the impact of COVID-19. If there were any threats to the supply chain, the councils should address them, work jointly and source the required materials for their members, he said.

Rajendra Kumar, MSME secretary, Government of Tamil Nadu, said, “We have seen a significant jump in new MSMEs in the State this year. Tamil Nadu is a prime destination for investments.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/sb50vy/article30985629.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05ENGINEERINGSOURCINGSHOW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/new-industrial-estate-at-perundurai-in-the-works/article30985630.ece

DMK leader M.K. Stalin on Wednesday demanded action against Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji following the attack on Karthik, a journalist who works for the Tamil magazine Kumudam Reporter, in Sivakasi on Tuesday night.

In a statement, Mr. Stalin claimed that Mr. Karthik was attacked after he published a report on an alleged confrontation between the Minister and Sattur MLA Rajavarman over the appointment of officials in Aavin.

“The attack is against the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution, and Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami should act impartially and take action against those responsible,” he said.

Alleging that the activities and public speeches of Mr. Bhalaji were disturbing communal harmony and inciting violence, Mr. Stalin said the Minister also had a habit of targeting DMK men without any fear for the sake of cheap publicity.

“He speaks in an intimidating tone, saying he will attack, beat and chop off the tongue [of critics]. Why is the Governor maintaining silence?” the DMK leader asked and urged the Chief Minister to put an end to the ‘excesses’ of the Minister.

She also accused the DMK of trying to turn Tamil Nadu into a protest zone till the next Assembly elections in the pretext of opposing the CAA.

159,2020/03/05,State’s outreach to neighbours raises river-linking expectations,"CM keen on clinching consensus with A.P., Telangana on Cauvery-Godavari project

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s outreach to his Andhra Pradesh and Telangana counterparts over the linking of Cauvery and Godavari rivers has raised expectations of the project taking off soon.

Speaking at an event in Salem on Wednesday, Mr. Palaniswami said he was keen on arriving at a consensus with Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Telangana CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao on the details regarding the sharing of water resources at the earliest. His task may turn out to be easy, given the fact that Mr. Reddy and Mr. Rao had, during a six-hour-long meeting in Hyderabad in mid-January, already arrived at an understanding on the diversion of Godavari water to Krishna river, according to an official of the National Water Development Agency (NWDA), a Central government organisation entrusted with the task of preparing proposals for linking rivers.

As per NWDA’s draft detailed project report (DPR), Tamil Nadu will get 83 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft) at its border with Andhra Pradesh. The quantum will be 57 tmc ft at the Grand Anicut — a major regulator on the Cauvery. The State government would prefer the Kattalai barrage in Mayanur to the Grand Anicut, as it feels it can optimise the benefit of water transfer.

The NWDA’s draft report talks of diverting, through a canal-cum-pipeline, the surplus water of the Godavari, either from the Inchampalli barrage or the Janampet barrage, from where water will be conveyed to the Nagarjuna Sagar on the Krishna and the Somasila dam on the Pennar. The proposed alignment will also pass through Swarnamukhi, Araniar, Palar and Pennaiyar rivers before terminating at the Grand Anicut on the Cauvery. Initially, a total of 247 tmc ft will be drawn from the Godavari. If the drawal point is near Inchampalli, Andhra Pradesh will get 81 tmc ft, Telangana 66 tmc ft and Tamil Nadu 83 tmc ft. If it is Janampet, the three States will get 108 tmc ft, 39 tmc ft and 83 tmc ft, respectively.

Four other States – Karnataka, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh – are also involved in the river-linking project. Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh have sent their responses to NWDA, as have Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, whereas three other States, including Telangana, are yet to provide their views to the central agency. An official of NWDA said the three States were being persuaded to give their inputs on the draft DPR so that the report could be finalised as soon as possible.

When asked whether Mr. Palaniswami was pushing the project with an eye on the 2021 Assembly election, S.

A little over a year after the #MeToo movement sparked a revolution, filmmaker Ruchi Narain feels liberated. The 44-year-old firmly believes the phenomenon has encouraged women to talk about things — among themselves and on public platforms — like they never did before. “Forget about a serious incident like assault, I’m talking about simple day-to-day stuff, casual sexism which everyone has to deal with,” says the director with extreme deliberation. Up until recently, micro-aggressions have been largely tolerated, but there’s a change now that cannot be overlooked. “The reason why people haven’t spoken up for years is because they want to get on with their ambitions,” says Narain. “[Women] are here because we want to work, we want to express and create. We are not here to do any activism.”

Questions and answers

The director and screenwriter is sitting alongside actor Kiara Advani, talking to The Hindu, about the duo’s upcoming Netflix film Guilty and its position in a post-#MeToo society. Based in a Delhi University milieu, the whodunnit focuses on the perspective of a woman (played by Advani) whose boyfriend is accused of sexual assault.

Likening the hotheadedness of her character to Shahid Kapur’s Kabir Singh (who she starred alongside), Advani prepped for her role by meeting assault survivors. In Guilty, her character Nanki is accused of intimidating the alleged victim, an uncomfortable position in a time when women are expected to stand up for each other. Though the actor faithfully played out Nanki, she’s aware of the politics and complications surrounding the movement, including the magnitude of false accusations. “Of course, we all want justice, but I think there are deeper issues that need to be tackled,” says the 27-year-old actor talking about the perils of a patriarchal society. “It is good that the conversation started, but where is it leading to? I wish I had these answers.”

Truth foretold

Narain, who echoes the sentiment, intuitively predicted the public discourse that sexual misconduct would have in the future. Guilty has been the culmination of that foretelling. “I’d told Karan [Johar] I want to write a film about rape seven years ago,” says Narain adding that it was evident to her that there would be a clash between women who have been brought up to be empowered and the current state of society which hasn’t progressed as fast. In the time since, horrific gendered crimes brought problems surrounding women’s safety to the forefront. The #MeToo movement, then becomes an ongoing catalyst in taking the discourse further. “As a woman with so many ambitions, [I] was not able to get to go where I wanted to because of a kind of push back [from society],” says Narain. “I wanted to make a film which tackled the complexities and the confusions not just of women but also men who are part of the same society.”

As our chat winds to an end, both Advani and Narain stress that Guilty will elicit discomfort in its audience, both during and after its viewing. They might not even agree with its resolution. That’s exactly what the director wants so that the important discourse can continue, in spite of the embers of the movement cooling. But before we part, it’s Advani who emphasises, “I feel like women have each others backs now, and we’ve come so far, but we still have a long way to go.”

161,2020/03/05,"Director Hardik Mehta: 'Kaamyaab' is about the connection between the grammar of Hindi cinema, and its audience","The filmmaker’s love for mainstream Hindi films from the 80s and 90s is evident in his ode to the ‘side actor’, says Anahita Panicker

Whether it was Lata Mangeshkar’s voice warbling ‘Maar Diya Jaye’ or film composer Gustavo Santaolalla’s haunting strings, director Hardik Mehta always had music playing on his set for Kaamyaab. “See? I always keep a speaker with me,” he laughs, pointing to the portable speaker sitting between us as we chat about his latest film.

His debut feature Kaamyaab releases in theatres this week, after having travelled the festival circuit and premiering at the Busan International Film Festival. The dramedy revolves around Sanjay Mishra’s Sudheer, a 65-year-old has-been side-actor who tries his hand at acting again when he realises he needs one more role to complete a neat filmography of 500 performances. For Mehta, the film is a tribute of sorts to those recognisable faces, popular in the 80s and 90s, whose stories hovered in the margins of the hero’s tale. “I thought why don’t I tell a story about these faces I have grown up seeing?” says the director, “[From] Bob Christo who would be a foreign smuggler [to] Razak Khan [who would appear] chewing paan.”

Delving into the evident typecasting these “character actors” face, Mehta says that in an effort to not waste film reels and save up takes for the lead actors, side-actors would be cast based on characteristics or dialogues that made them popular – reducing the number of takes they would need to get their scene right. “For comedy they would cast Mehmood or Mukri, and if [they wanted] a drunkard, they would call Keshto Mukherjee,” he says. While Kaamyaab offers a light-hearted treatment of these actors’ place in mainstream Hindi cinema, didn’t the director encounter threads of resentment in these stories? He admits that the story came to him a few years ago when he saw Ramesh Goyal on a BEST bus. “He was [with] Aamir Khan in Sarfarosh (1999), [and here] he was fighting with the conductor?” says Mehta, finding the image surreal. During his research for the script, the director spent time with numerous actors including Birbal, Manmauji and the late Viju Khote. But something Goyal mentioned stayed with the director, “He said, “arre hum toh kaamyaabi ke kinaare hi reh gaye, yaar (I got stranded on the banks of success, friend).”

Memories of cinema

Although the film’s title is inspired by this forlorn sentiment and the nostalgia of similar 80s Urdu titles, Kaamyaab also declares the actors’ success – being indelible parts of audience’s memories of Hindi cinema. It’s this reminiscence that weaves itself into Mehta’s treatment of the narrative. “[The film] is about the memory of mainstream cinema – the connection between the grammar of Hindi cinema, and its audience,” says Mehta, explaining that the homage to “character artistes” borrows the same language that carved their space in mainstream cinema – from typical music to visuals that were shorthand for emotions and plot points.

Mehta’s love for Bollywood is obvious. But he sought out his love for filmmaking after leaving his work as a dairy technologist for Amul in Surat to become a copywriter. Mehta’s stint as a copywriter made him realise that his love for arts – from photography to music and writing – came together in cinema. “Training as a filmmaker is being interested in other arts,” says the director. Though he went on to make the award-winning documentary short Amdavad ma Famous (2015) and the Amit Sial and Khushboo Upadhyay-starrer The Affair (2017), pursuing filmmaking seemed risky. Everyone around him was buying a car, going to the USA, and settling down. “But I had to take it up,” says the director before chuckling, “so that one day they will all comment on my Facebook saying, ‘Shah Rukh Khan is presenting your film?’”

Shifting tides

Mehta’s directorial process of offering music and photography to draw out performances has found its way on the sets of his next too – the horror-comedy starring Rajkummar Rao and Janhvi Kapoor Rooh Afza. For the cast and crew, he plays the eerie soundtracks of Pan’s Labyrinth (2006) and Shape of Water (2017). Mehta has also co-written the True Detective-style noir cop drama Patal Lok which is an Amazon series.

Considering that Kaamyaab’s trailer had settled on the YouTube trending page when it was released, I ask Mehta, if he feels the tide has shifted. That is, are character artistes finally getting their due? “I don’t know,” he replies pensively, “Everyone watches everything on YouTube. [And though] I can’t expect a number [of viewers] like Baaghi 3, I’m happy [they release] on the same day. It’s a sign – while Baaghi 3 is your hero, the important sidekick is Kaamyaab.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/eexdbu/article30993429.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6bm-pg5-Kaamyaab-4,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-important-sidekick-is-kaamyaab/article30993430.ece
162,2020/03/05,"The characters resonated with me: Tanel Toom, director of 'Truth and Justice'","The director talks about the challenges of adapting the Anton Hansen Tammsaare novel, the journey of the protagonist, Andres, and more

Truth and Justice, director Tanel Toom’s visually stunning epic, spanning the years 1872 to 1896, went on to become the highest grossing film of all time in Estonia, even surpassing The Avengers. The film also made it to the 2020 Oscars shortlist for International Feature Film Award, giving the 37-year-old his second brush with the Academy (he was nominated in 2011 for his short film The Confession).

The film, based on the eponymous 550-page novel written in 1926 by Anton Hansen Tammsaare, tells the story of farmer Andres Paas (Priit Loog) and his wife, Krõõt (Maiken Schmidt), as they arrive at Robber’s Rise to create a new life there. Krõõt isn’t as convinced about the marshy land but still toils alongside her husband. Convinced that a ditch will drain the water, Andres asks his neighbor Pearu (Priit Võigemast) to share the cost, despite warnings that Pearu is not one to be trusted. As life goes on, Andres changes from the man he once was.

Tanel, whose film was screened at BiFFes, spoke to MetroPlus.

Excerpts:

What made you decide to adapt the story for film and what changes did you have to make?

When I read the book, I was affected by how contemporary the struggles of the novel’s characters were and by how strongly they resonated with my pursuit for self-fulfillment. The way Andres never ceases the non-stop drudgery to acknowledge what he has achieved or to say a good word to his loved ones reminded me a lot of my father. And myself too.

There have been many attempts to make it into a film before. The first year, I was only working on structure and choosing the main events for the film. My intention was to maintain the essence of the story and tell it in the most effective and exciting way.

Initially, it seems like Pearu is the villain and but as the film progresses, we see that it is actually Andres who is increasingly blind to his many faults…

Yes, that was one of the things that I was initially excited about – Andres’ character arc and in the end is he a better man than Pearu? We all change. And we do because of the environment, the people we meet, the events and conflicts that happen to and around us. Although Pearu might be one of the most visible reasons, I think he is not the only one who pushes Andres for change. The land that doesn’t obey Andres’s will, the fact that he still hasn’t got an heir... all this creates disappointment. Of course, the nature of the character’s change is not just determined by the external events and conflicts that happen to us but are in close relationship with our nature. We might act very differently in similar situations. Andres is a rational and dogmatic man who is obsessed with justice and being right. This is actually the main source of the conflict as this determines how he deals with Pearu and also with his land.

Religion is a major theme in the film. But it seems Andres has a contradictory relationship with his faith…

There are a lot of people who do find consolation and help from the Bible while looking for guidance and answers. But Andres is not looking for answers. He knows he is always right. He just needs proof to show others and to confirm it to himself. And he is using the Bible for that. I think it’s not just about the book but about the person who is reading it. Andres is having a very unhealthy relationship with the Bible. He’s abusing that book. And this is something that has been happening for thousands of years — wars and conflicts because of religion. Sadly, it’s nothing new.

The film did extremely well in Estonia, surpassing even The Avengers. Were you at all surprised?

I was ready to get beaten and kicked out of the country. You have to be. The fact it is based on a well-known book doesn’t guarantee you success. There are even more reasons it might flop as everyone has a version of their own in their heads how this story should be. We were lucky; it did unbelievably well. But filmmaking is always a gamble, you never know the outcome. And I think you need that uncertainty. That keeps you on your toes and pushes you to do a better job. That is important. Because lazy filmmaking is the worst kind of filmmaking.

What was your experience like in Bengaluru? Did you get a chance to watch any Indian films?

I have been in love with India for quite some time now. The food, the culture, the people... This is not my first trip to India but it is my first time in Bangalore. And I love it. My stay was so short and schedule so packed that unfortunately I didn’t have a chance to see many films. But I love Indian movies. I’ve been saying for years that one day I’d really love to do a Bollywood movie.

163,2020/03/05,Actor Muhammed Musthafa makes his debut as a director with ‘Kappela’,"Anna Ben, Roshan Mathew and Sreenath Bhasi play the lead roles in the Malayalam film

Malayalam cinema has many actors who have successfully forayed into direction. Muhammed Musthafa is the latest to join the list. The actor, who won special jury mention at the National Film Awards (2015) for his role as a vulnerable youth in Ain directed by Sidhartha Siva, is making his début as a director with Kappela that reaches theatres today.

He says that the movie “takes up a subject that is relevant.” Without giving anything away about the storyline, he adds, “It’s an issue that the young generation can relate to and therefore the story revolves around a group of youngsters.”

The three main characters are Jessy (Anna Ben), Vishnu (Roshan Mathew) and Roy (Sreenath Bhasi) who hail from different backgrounds. Jessy belongs to a family that is into agriculture in Poovaranmala, on the high ranges of Wayanad.

A happy-go-lucky girl, who hasn’t cleared her Plus Two, Jessy is in love with Vishnu, an autorickshaw driver in Malappuram. Roy is a management graduate from Kannur who is on the lookout for a job. The film begins with Jessy’s journey to Kozhikode to meet Vishnu; Roy lands in the city for a job interview. Their paths intersect, resulting in a series of incidents. In between, the narrative cuts back to the past of the two male characters.

“Besides Kozhikode, the film travels through Wayanad, Malappuram and Kannur as well,” says Musthafa, a native of Kozhikode.

As for naming it Kappela, which means chapel, Musthafa says that he wanted a title that doesn’t have predictability. “However, there is a dilapidated chapel near Jessy’s home, that is special for her in as it is a special space for her,” he adds.

As an actor Musthafa came into the limelight as a contestant of Best Actor, a reality show on Amrita TV. He was active in theatre then alongside pursuing his career as a photographer. He forayed into cinema with Paleri Manickyam…. and have worked in films such as Penpattanam, Sakhavu, Loham, Urumbukal Urangarilla, Gambinos and Sathyam Paranja Viswasikkuvo?

He stresses that a highlight of the movie will be the performances of the lead actors. “Ever since the trailer came out, I have been getting calls complementing me for the choice of the three main actors. Anna was perfect for the role of this girl from a middle class family. Roshan and Sreenath were deliberate choices because they are unpredictable actors. They don’t carry the image of typical heroes and therefore can play any role. People don’t have any preconceived notions about the characters they play,” he adds.

Musthafa adds that it took nearly three years for him to arrive at the final draft of the screenplay in the company of co-writers, Nikhil Vahid and Sudhas V. “The project got pushed also because there was a delay in getting the right cast,” he adds.

Behind the camera

The 38-year-old brings with him the experience of assisting Ranjith in Njaan and Loham. “I made my début in cinema in his Paleri Manickyam: Oru Pathirakolapathakathinte Katha. Since I have a background in photography as well, I was always curious about what goes behind the camera. That’s when I evinced interest in assisting him and he took me on board,” he adds.

Since then, Musthafa says, he has been searching for the right script. “The subjects that I had in mind needed a big canvas. I understood that I had to gain more experience to helm those projects. So I decided to start with a simple plot and that’s when I got the thread of Kappela. Even when there were several challenges during the making of the film, what kept me going was the subject itself,” he adds.

Sudhi Koppa, Navas Vallikunnu, Sudheesh and Vijilesh are also in the cast. Sushin Shyam is the composer, with Jimshi Khalid cranking the camera.

“Be it music, cinematography, editing, art direction or sound mixing, I have got the best hands for the job and that makes me happy about the final product,” he says.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kii084/article30990725.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvmkappela,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-muhammed-musthafa-on-his-directorial-debut-kappela/article30990727.ece
164,2020/03/05,Sahir Ludhianvi: Waiting for that dawn...,"In times of turmoil, one can find solace in songs of Sahir Ludhianvi

Daring to express the most complex human emotions, poets are God’s special creatures. Go down the lanes of history, words of rulers have died with them, but verses of poets remain alive as they communicate everlasting truths that most are unable to hear and imbibe. Every age gives rise to a few great poets who make us discern the imponderable mysteries of the universe through a spontaneous overflow of emotions. And without a doubt, in the post-Partition era, such a profound voice was Sahir Ludhianvi.

His unique ability to serve unvarnished truths set Sahir apart as a people’s poet who inspired the finest ideals of mankind and many of his verses such as “Tu Hindu Banega Na Musalman Banega, Insaan Ki Aulaad Hai Insaan Banega” (Dhool Ka Phool) have acquired iconic status because of their lucid distillation of eternal wisdom. His stirring verses like “Ye Duniya Agar Mil Bhi Jaye To Kya Hai” and “Jinhein Naaz Hai Hind Par Wo Kahan Hain” (both from Pyaasa), “Aurat Ne Janam Diya Mardon Ko, Mardon Ne Usey Bazaar Diya” (Sadhana) or “Wo Subah Kabhi To Aayegi” and “Chino-Arab Hamara, Hindustan Hamara” (both from Phir Subah Hogi) are part of folklore since they knocked hard at social inadequacies as well as political and affluent classes.

Not that he spared the common citizens for their culture of hypocrisy, dogma, and hate. Several songs like “Bane Ho Ek Khaaq Se” (Aarti), “Khuda-e-Bartar Teri Zameen Pe Ye Jung Kyun Hai” (Taj Mahal), “Insaanon Ne Paise Ke Liye” (Paisa ya Pyar) and “Bataa Ae Aasman Wale” (Marine Drive) are critical of their follies! But the masses still adored him because he held a mirror to their anguish as well as shortcomings in a transparently, honest manner.

If a poet is to influence, enlighten and motivate, Sahir did it with remarkable distinction. Even in the throes of passion, this finest of romantic poets did not forget his duties and responsibilities. Ponder over just one sample: his unusual rejoinder “Par Thehar Wo Jo Wahan… Phir Teri Maang Siataron Se Bhari Jayegi” to his beloved when she beckons with “Aaj Ki Raat Badi Shokh Badi Natkhat Hai” (Nayi Umar Ki Nayi Fasal). His bosom is not short of love but devotion to a cause makes him plead with her to “wait till he had built houses for those sleeping on the footpath as well as helped the poor that are denied even shrouds for their corpses”.

Expression of pain

Guru Dutt and Mala Sinha in Hindi film ""Pyaasa"".

A rarer expression of solace is difficult to find except in Sahir’s “Tum Mujhe Bhool Bhi Jao” (Didi) wherein he reminds the beloved that in a world afflicted with hunger and thirst, love is not the ultimate necessity!

Seeing or reacting in a manner different from the ordinary came naturally to Sahir. Abhorrence to constrictions of social customs, luxury, opulence and decadence made him a rebel of sorts and a saviour of the downtrodden. That is why for him Taj Mahal was not a monument of love but a grotesque advertisement of a king: “Ek Shahenshah Ne Daulat Ka Sahara Leke, Hum Gareebon Ki Mohabbat Ka Udaaya Hai Mazaak” (Ghazal). Time and time again, through various pertinent metaphors, he made us realise our fates were intertwined with each other and “Ye Ishq Ishq Hai” (Barsaat Ki Raat) is the perfect example of how this visionary could articulate similarities and synthesis of cultures and how love alone made us worship stones as incarnations of Gods.

As one re-engages with thousands of Sahir’s verses in his centenary year, it becomes evident that the poet sought equality, justice, peace and prosperity for all. Every genre came easy to him and be it bhajans, sufi songs, ghazals, nazms, love ballads or qawwalis, Sahir embellished each with a thought that was not just vividly different from the rest of his milieu but also immensely lyrical and awe-inspiring.

Though he did write quite a few patriotic songs, he remained a steadfast pacifist who always advocated love and understanding rather than war: “Khoon Apna Ho Ya Paraya Ho, Nasle Aadam Ka Khoon Hai Akhir, Jung Mashirk Mein Ho Ke Magrib Mein, Amne Alam Ka Khoon Hai Aakhir” (Shed the blood of our own or a stranger, It is ultimately the blood of mankind, Be it a war in the east or west, It is ultimately the murder of peace and tranquillity).

As fear and prejudice haunt the lanes of Delhi once again, it would be wise to remember the sane advice of Sahir that war (killing) is itself a problem and can never resolve our problems.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/53fqgj/article30990624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06DFR-21,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sahir-ludhianvi-waiting-for-that-dawn/article30990627.ece
165,2020/03/05,Mollywood director Sajin Baabu tastes success with ‘Biriyani’,"The film won the Special Jury Award at the 12th Bengaluru International Film Festival 2020 conducted by the Karnataka State Chalachitra Academy

Film director Sajin Baabu’s elation is evident in his voice. Biriyani, his third film as director, won the Special Jury Award at the 12th Bengaluru International Film Festival 2020 conducted by the Karnataka State Chalachitra Academy, which concluded on March 4. The citation said that it was a “powerful portrayal of the struggles and plight of suppressed women of the society.” Biriyani was among 13 movies screened in the competition section for Indian films. Sajin’s first film Asthamayamvarey had won an award at the same festival in 2015.

Biriyani was premiered in the Asiatic Film festival in Rome and it had won the Netpac award for the best film.

Narrated from a woman’s perspective, Biriyani is about the persecution her family faces when her brother is radicalised and goes missing. Film actor Kani Kusruti plays the lead role of Khadeeja in the film.

In an earlier interview to MetroPlus, Sajin had said: “For a couple of years now, the media has carried reports about youngsters being radicalised and travelling to countries in West Asia to join the Islamic State; some have been arrested, some are missing. I wanted to find out what happens to the families of those men. How have they been treated by neighbours, society, government and community? How have they sustained themselves? The questions haunted me,” says Sajin.

The film director recalls that after the award presentation, he was able to have a chat with the jury members and they congratulated him for his “bold choice to make a film on a theme that is not often discussed”.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fq7zd4/article30990478.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvmSajin,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mollywood-director-sajin-baabu-tastes-success-with-biriyani/article30990479.ece
166,2020/03/05,Director-writer Sean Anders: ‘It would be fun to see Daniel Day-Lewis do a comedy’,"The 'We’re the Millers' filmmaker on family being a common theme in his films, whether comedies get due recognition, and if he agrees with Martin Scorsese’s statement on superhero outings

Sean Anders, director and screenwriter, is perhaps best known for We’re the Millers, where a ragtag foursome form a family of sorts, Horrible Bosses 1 (in which three friends decide to get rid of their bosses) and 2, Daddy’s Home 1 and 2, Mr Popper’s Penguins and Instant Family, which deals with the subject of adoption.

With 15 years in the industry, Sean has worked with comedic actors such as Will Ferrell, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Sudekis, as well as Mark Wahlberg.

Sean spoke to MetroPlus over the phone about family, recognition for comedies and more.

Family seems to be a common theme in many of the films you have written and directed. Is that something that you consciously look to explore or are drawn to?

Oh yes, very much. I come from a pretty interesting family (laughs) and I have a pretty wonderful family of my own now. It is the most important part of my life and it always has been and so it just comes out in the writing.

Was there any particular real-life inspiration for the Horrible Bosses films?

Well, we were writing the sequel to the movie. The premise had already been established about having a horrible boss. When my writing partner, John Morris, and I came in to work on the sequel, we wanted to focus on the idea of the little guy being trounced by the 1%, the big, powerful people (laughs). And how these three guys who didn’t have much power at all, might make some bad choices but ultimately stand up to the more powerful character.

In your opinion, are comedies and comedic actors given the recognition they deserve?

(laughs) Oh no, not at all. I think there is a trade-off with comedy. I think comedy connects better with the average person. Your movies are potentially viewed by a lot more people and appreciated by more people. The downside is that you don’t generally get appreciation from critics or awards. Of course, everyone would love to have appreciation from both sides. But given the choice, I would rather be appreciated by the audience than award shows.

What do you think is the reason for that gap?

Let me put it this way. I think everybody in the industry understands that comedy is difficult. There is that old saying, “Dying is easy, comedy is hard.” I guess it is because comedies are generally not considered terribly important because they don’t always tackle huge, important issues. When people have worked all day, doing the real work of keeping the world moving and they want to come home, unwind and have a laugh, they will got to a theatre and do so. That is where comedy provides something really important. Because dramas and other movies tend to tackle bigger, more important issues, they tend to get more of that critical attention. And maybe rightly so.

Superhero films were not considered award worthy till this year with Joker. Do you think, there will be a shift in how comedies are perceived as well?

No (laughs). I think that this is just the way things work. Joker got recognised because it got into some dark and very interesting territory. Unfortunately, you can’t make a movie like Taxi Driver any more and have it connect with a really large audience the way that movie did. I think Todd Phillips wanted to make his Taxi Driver and I think he knew he had to do it through the medium of superhero movies because that seems to be the only way that a movie can connect to a global audience.

Do you agree then with Martin Scorsese’s statement that Marvel films aren’t cinema?

Well, for some reason, right now we’re in an era where superhero movies are just making tons of box office. So, I think it is great that people like Todd Phillips are taking the superhero character in a new and interesting direction and use that to get other points across. It is not just people in capes solving crimes or defeating galactic bad guys. It is a different world right now. We were just laughing the other day that Kramer vs Kramer (1979) was the number one box office hit of the year in America. It just feels like that could never happen again. It just seems like that is now reserved for Marvel and Star Wars.

There are comedic actors who have done dramatic roles eg. Jim Carrey but is there any dramatic actor you would like to see in an out-and-out comedy?

Oh gosh, yeah (laughs). Daniel Day-Lewis. He is so intensely serious in every film that he does, it would be really fun to see him do a comedy. And I bet he would be hilarious especially if he was playing a guy who was comically serious.

Sean Penn has become an incredibly serious guy. I think he always has been. His Jeff Spicoli (from Fast Times at Ridgemont High) character is still one of my all-time favourite comedic characters anyone has ever played (laughs). I think Meryl Streep is really funny when she does comedy.

168,2020/03/05,"'Gatham', a psychological thriller, made by U.S-based students and IT professionals","A group of techies hope to get an India release for their movie that has been shot at Lake Tahoe in California

A group of U.S-based students and IT professionals — all in their late 20s have made a film titled Gatham and its director Kiran Reddy informs us that they are looking for distributors here. Guntur-born Kiran completed his BTech in Hyderabad and moved to the U.S. where he met like-minded people with whom he formed a team to pursue the passion for films. Completely self taught, the friends made a few short films.

A couple of Kiran Reddy’s short films A Winter To Remember and Where is Ayush? won awards. A short film that he submitted in 2015 fetched him the second best award. He adds, “Directors Harish Shankar and Merlapaka Gandhi who were in the U.S. saw the film and said the content had scope and we could develop it into a full length film and that’s how Gatham took shape. It’s a psychological thriller. A person who forgot his past wakes up from coma and struggles to know about himself. His girlfriend is the only one who has information about him. He wants to meet his parents and they set out on a journey. The car breaks down and this is when a third person offers help. What happens there after is a spine chilling journey, with twists and turns,” says Kiran.

Team behind ‘Gatham’

In August 2018, the ground work for Gatham started and by December they were done with their pre-production that included finalising the cast, crew and locations. The shoot began during Christmas break as they needed a snow backdrop. Lake Tahoe in California was the centre of action and accurate weather predictions helped them plan their shooting schedules well, says Kiran.

This six-member team want to release it in India and the U.S. They outsourced sound design from Chile. Sri Charan Pakala who scored music for Adivi Sesh’s films like Evaru and Goodachari came on board. Manojh Reddy, DoP of Aswathama and Masthies, a web series by Krish, worked with them. Rakesh who acted in 40 short films in India and Pujita, a student from India star in the film. Pujita happens to be the great-granddaughter of director KV Reddy (Mayabazar).",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sopdkh/article30989837.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym05Kiran-Reddyjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/gatham-a-psychological-thriller-made-by-us-based-students-and-it-professionals/article30989839.ece

The Batman director Matt Reeves has once again taken to Twitter to surprise fans by unveiling the first look of the Batmobile from Robert Pattinson’s upcoming new film.

The movie, which began after Ben Affleck quit the role of the caped superhero, has a planned release date in 2021, and director Reeves continues to excite fans with sneak-peeks at DC’s most popular franchise.

First, Reeves released a video that offered a glimpse into Pattinson’s Batsuit. Next, images from the shooting were released that offered a better look at the Batman costume as well as the Batcycle.

Now, new official photos give us a look at the iconic Batmobile, that seems to have undergone quite a few changes from ones seen in earlier Batman movies. Along with the Batmobile, the photos also give abetter look at Pattinson's full costume, including the Batsuit's cape, which was missing in the earlier video that Reeves put out.

Reeves posted three photos on Twitter of Pattinson in full Batman costume standing next to the Batmobile.

Meanwhile, the cast for The Batman has added two more actors: Teen Wolf stars, twins Max and Charlie Carver in mystery roles.

Apart from Robert Pattinson, the other actors on board earlier were Colin Farrell as Penguin, John Turturro as Gotham mob boss Carmine Falcone, Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth, Paul Dano as Riddler, while Zoe Kravitz will play Catwoman. Jeffrey Wright as Commissioner Gordon, Peter Sarsgaard as Gotham District Attorney Gil Colson, and Jayme Lawson as Gotham City mayoral candidate Bella Reál are other key developments.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bwph5s/article30989458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/batman,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-batman-director-matt-reeves-reveals-first-look-of-new-batmobile-from-robert-pattinsons-movie/article30989459.ece
170,2020/03/05,"‘Gramavrikshathile Kuyil’ follows the poetic and personal journey of Kumaran Asan, says director KP Kumaran","The film stars composer-singer Sreevalsan J Menon as the poet

Although Kumaran Asan is one of Kerala’s greatest poets, no feature film has been made on his life. KP Kumaran’s Gramavrikshathile Kuyil is the first film on the legendary poet and social reformer. The film, which has KG Jayan and Santhosh Raman behind the camera, sees singer and music composer Sreevalsan J Menon donning the role of Asan. The project that has long been on the mind of the director “took its present shape during the last one year, especially after the socio-political turbulences relating to caste, religious beliefs and rituals that shook Kerala society. Till then, it was kept in abeyance due to reasons like funds, the generation gap that divides the present generation from Asan, and so on. But in the present-day Kerala context, I felt a kind of urgency to talk about this man. I was always fascinated by poetry, especially that of Kumaran Asan and Vyloppilly. But beyond Asan’s scholarship and poetic contributions, it is Asan the individual who enchanted me,” says Kumaran. Excerpts from an interview with the director:

Why Kumaran Asan and why now?

As a person following the socio-cultural and political happenings in Kerala, I am amazed by the way he saw and confronted the world of his times. Asan was born in 1873 and his creative life began at the beginning of the 20th century. It was during the period between 1903 and 1924 that he was most active and rose into prominence. He translated Soundaryalahari, Vivekananda’s Rajayoga, the play Vichitravijayam and so on. He was the editor of Vivekodayam magazine for 15 years and was a member of Praja Sabha and later the Legislative Assembly. He also ran a tile factory. He was close to Sree Narayana Guru and almost became a sanyasin, but opted for married life.

He engaged in all of these while writing some of the greatest poetic works and playing a crucial role in the establishment and development of Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP), for which he travelled extensively across Travancore, Kochi and Malabar. He was also someone who always lived amidst enemies, especially from his own community. It is all these factors that prompted me to make a film on Asan, despite the hurdles of finance and market.

This is not a conventional biopic in the sense of a chronological account of his life, but depicts his inner life and struggles.

It is impossible to bring in all the aspects of Asan’s life into one film. Moreover, we don’t have enough authoritative and reliable information about his personal life. People know him primarily through his poems and his personality is very much present there, especially in his later poems. It is debatable whether my film is a biopic. I have, however, brought in all the important events in his life: his early education, his encounter with Guru and his life after that, and major events in the last years of his life. A major part of the film is about the last few years of his life. This period is crucial on various counts: firstly, he gets married, which is a turning point in his personal life, and his relationship with Guru. By opting for marriage, Asan ventures into another phase of his life and is on his own, he has neither Guru or the Yogam to fall back upon.

Why the title Gramavrikshathile Kuyil?

I took the title from a poem by Asan, a metaphorical poem about his life, where he is the bird, and the village tree is the Yogam, and the sage is Guru. In this film I use four of his major poems written during this period: Chinthavishtayaya Sita written in 1919, Duravastha, Chandala Bhikshuki and Karuna. These are very important poems; their content is radically political and they are poetic. The film follows the poetic and personal journey of Asan through all these poems.

So, Asan’s poetry constitutes a prominent thread of this film?

To make a film by including all the facets of a personality like Asan and all the people and events he was associated with is either impossible or absurd. A film demands a certain kind of narrative precision and expression through visual and oral elements. When you are portraying a poet through film, his poems should be central. But how do you represent present poetry in film? My focus was on creating evocative visuals that would resonate Asan’s poetry: it could be landscapes, waterfalls, the sea, lakes, paintings... For instance there is a poem titled ‘Garisopa’ where the poet, along with Dr Palpu’s family, journeys to see a waterfall. Here the basic visual elements are the waterfalls and the forest. Likewise there is reference to the sculptures at Ajanta and Ellora, which I have used in the film. So, my attempt was to combine words and images in an evocative manner and thus to find a new narrative and visual synergy, rather than one representing the other ‘faithfully’. Though I had a complete script with me, I had to find evocative visuals to go with it. So I used paintings and sketches, archival footage on Calcutta [Kolkata] city of that period etc.

One major visual motif of the film is water. Was it a conscious choice?

Yes, it was. There is even a specific mention about that in the film, where Asan talks about his lifelong relationship with water. Moreover, the use of water bodies and their shimmering presence in various forms also give the film a certain visual feel and mood. Asan was born near the sea, the name of his native place is ‘Kayikkara’ which is a combination of kayal (backwaters) and kara (land). Later when he joined Guru, the Aruvippuram ashram too was along the Neyyar river. Finally, he met with his death in the waters. In a scene, Asan says, ‘Periyar river looks placid on the surface, but carries many turbulences beneath’. So, water acts not only as a visual motif but also flows as a philosophical and metaphorical undercurrent through the film.

Asan is a poet who taught us to love, for love in various forms and moods are present in Asan poems...

Yes, Asan is a poet of love, who dealt with love in various contexts and expressions. He also used an array of terms like premam, anuragam, sneham, priyam, anpu, pranayam and so on to denote the various shades of love. But in my film, the focus is more on the political and humanitarian issues that Asan’s poetry dealt with.

For instance, he made a frontal attack on caste system much before Ambedkar. There is a scene in my film where Asan ruminates upon his condition while walking along the walls of the Fort in Thiruvananthapuram. He says I am a well-known poet and member of the Praja Sabha, but I am not allowed entry into the Fort, and I quote his poem where he asks how many Perumals, Sankaracharyas, Thunchans and Kunjans will it need to liberate his land from casteism. So my focus is on how Asan used his energies as a poet, social activist and legislator to fight the evil of caste.

In your film there are no well-known actors... most of them come from different backgrounds and are new to cinema. Was it a conscious decision?

I made a conscious choice of casting fresh talents, as I didn’t want any kind of star image to eclipse that of Asan. Luckily Sreevalsan Menon resembles Asan. The heroine of this film is also a fresh face; she has acted only in one film before this. Pramod Raman, television journalist and writer, plays the role of Murkoth Kumaran in the film. So there are familiar faces in the film. I avoided the stars as I wanted Asan to be the central character and the only star in this film.

How do you think this film about a great poet will be received by the contemporary Malayali audience?

Actually we have forgotten Kumaran Asan. I think there is no other Malayali who has contributed so deeply to our culture and politics like Asan. I consider the film a curtain raiser to the rich and complex personality of Kumaran Asan.

Where do you place this film in your oeuvre?

It is a film that gave me great satisfaction. Through this film I intend to address a generation of Malayalis who grew up listening to or reading Asan’s poetry.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pfmvh9/article30981667.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvfAsan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kp-kumaran-on-his-movie-about-poet-kumaran-asan-gramavrikshathile-kuyil/article30981669.ece

172,2020/03/05,"Shane Nigam issue ends as AMMA, KFPA reach an agreement","The Malayalam actor will complete his movies 'Veyil' and 'Qurbani' between March 2 and April 18

The long-drawn saga involving actor Shane Nigam was eventually resolved amicably after the Association of Malayalam Movie Artists (AMMA) and the Kerala Film Producers Association (KFPA) reached an agreement settling the issue at a meeting held here on Wednesday.

Mr. Nigam was asked to complete the two films featuring him in the lead — Veyil and Qurbani, the production of which have been in a limbo since the controversy erupted last year — between March 2 and April 18.

“It was decided that he will not act in any other movie before the completion of these two films. He will, however, be free to commit films,” said M. Ranjith, president, KFPA.

Compensation

It was also agreed that Mr. Nigam would pay a compensation to the producers of the two movies for the loss caused by the disruption in production. While AMMA general secretary Edavela Babu chose not to disclose the compensation amount, Mr. Ranjith said the actor would pay ₹16 lakh each to the producers of both films. The compensation would either be paid in cash or would be deducted from the actor’s remuneration. The producers had initially demanded ₹1 crore from the actor and threatened to abandon both the films.

He said that the actor had already agreed to forgo his demand for an excess ₹15 lakh for completing the dubbing for another movie, Ullasam.

Asked whether the agreement would mark the lifting of the ‘undeclared ban’ on the actor, Mr. Ranjith said there was never a ban but only non-cooperation, which, he said, would no longer be there with the resolution of the issue.

He further said that producers would hold another meeting with AMMA to discuss ways to resolve various problems faced at the sets of film shoots. Asked about the formulation of any code of conduct for actors, Mr. Ranjith said all such things would be decided after the meeting.

Mr. Nigam ran into trouble towards the end of last year after he initially made a social media post alleging a death threat from the producer of Veyil. The problem accentuated when the actor shaved off his hair, which threw a spanner in the continuity of the film, following which the film’s producer, Joby George, lodged a complaint with KFPA.

Since the controversy erupted last October, Mr. Nigam has had only one release — Valiyaperunnal.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5az97d/article30270666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11TVSHANE,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/shane-nigam-issue-ends-as-amma-kfpa-reach-an-agreement/article30988866.ece
173,2020/03/05,No Time to Die: James Bond movie release pushed back seven months amid coronavirus,"The release of Daniel Craig's last outing as agent 007 will be postponed from the start of April until November, producers said

The global release of the new James Bond film No Time to Die was postponed on Wednesday by seven months amid the coronavirus disruption that has closed movie theaters in China and caused widespread headaches for other Hollywood productions.

The release of Daniel Craig's last outing as agent 007, being distributed internationally by Universal Pictures , will be postponed from the start of April until November, producers said.

“After careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace, the release of NO TIME TO DIE will be postponed until November 2020,” a posting on the official James Bond Twitter account said.

The posting made no specific reference to coronavirus but follows reports in entertainment trade media last week of the cancellation of plans for the film's red carpet premiere in China, Hollywood's biggest overseas market.

Movie theaters have been closed in China since January and other nations, including Japan, South Korea and parts of Italy, are also closing theaters in a bid to stem the spread of the virus.

The Bond franchise is one of the movie worlds most lucrative, with 2015's Spectre raking in $880 million at the box office worldwide, while Skyfall in 2012 grossed more than $1 billion globally.

No Time to Die cost an estimated $200 million to produce and was due to open in movie theaters from April 2 after a world premiere in London on March 31.

The James Bond postponement followed coronavirus disruptions to filming new movies and TV shows and delays in releasing U.S. movies in China.

A planned three-week shoot in Venice, Italy, for Tom Cruise's new Mission: Impossible film was postponed last week due to the outbreak, and producers of the CBS television global competition show The Amazing Race said last week they had temporarily suspended filming of a new season.

James Bond fan sites had also written to the studios behind the film this week, urging for a delay.

“With the coronavirus reaching pandemic status, it is time to put public health above marketing release schedules and the cost of cancelling publicity events,” fan website MI6-HQ.com wrote in an open letter.

“We have all waited over 4 years for this film. Another few months will not damage the quality of the film and only help the box-office for Daniel Craig's final hurrah,” the letter added.

Wednesday's post said the film will now be released in the United Kingdom on November 12 and in the United States on November 25.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vjjvfb/article30986100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-THAILAND-HEALTH-VIRUS-FILM,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/james-bond-movie-release-pushed-back-seven-months-amid-coronavirus/article30986101.ece

The Budget session of the State Legislature to take up the annual statement of accounts of Telangana for 2020-21 will begin with Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan’s address to both Houses- Assembly and Council- at 11 a.m. on Friday.

This will be the first time that Ms. Soundararajan will come to the Assembly after assuming office in September. Her address will be followed by meetings of the Business Advisory Committees of both the Houses separately to decide duration and agenda of session.

Indications, however, were that the motion of thanks to the Governor’s address will be taken up on Saturday and closed with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s reply the same day. Finance Minister T. Harish Rao will present the Budget, his first, on Sunday after which the House will adjourn for holiday on account of Holi on Monday and regular business taken up thereafter. Legislative Affairs Minister V. Prashant Reddy will present the same in the Legislative Council. The session is likely to continue for two weeks, sources said.

The Chief Minister has already held detailed review meetings on the shape of Budget with senior officials over the past few days. On Wednesday, he called on the Governor to handover the text of her speech.

The Budget session is going to be held for the second time in less than six months as the earlier one for 2019-20 took place in the second week of September. In the Budget presented by the Chief Minister in September, the outlay was scaled down from ₹ 1.82 lakh crore envisagde in the Vote on Account Budget presented in February, 2019 to ₹ 1.46 lakh crore, which was 9.1 % lower than the revised estimates of 2018-19. It is in this context that the size of the Budget now has assumed significance in the backdrop of economic slowdown. The government had already announced that it will move resolutions opposing National Population Register, National Register of Citizens and Citizens Amendment Act in the Assembly. The new Revenue Act and some other legislations were also likely to be moved.

176,2020/03/05,Revanth Reddy remanded in 14-day judicial custody,"Malkajgiri MP accused of taking aerial photo of a farmhouse without owner’s consent

Malkajgiri MP and TPCC working president A Revanth Reddy was remanded in judicial custody till March 18 by a local court in Rangareddy district on Thursday.

He was one of the accused in a case registered at Narsingi police station of Cyberabad for allegedly taking aerial photographs of a farmhouse in Janwada by using a drone camera without permission.

After attending the Lok Sabha session Mr. Reddy returned to Hyderabad on Thursday afternoon. The sleuths of Cyberabad Special Operations Team and Narsingi police who were waiting for him at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport whisked him away in a vehicle. He was taken to the Narsingi police station, where investigations quizzed him before producing before a magistrate.

On Wednesday, the Cyberabad police arrested six people in connection with the case, while Mr. Reddy and his brother Krishna Reddy were ‘absconding’.

They were booked under section 188, 287, 109,120 (b) of Indian Penal Code and section 11(a) R/W 5A of the Aircraft Act for capturing images of the farmhouse using drone by violating the privacy of individuals, police said. Mr. Reddy alleged that the farmhouse belongs to IT and Industries Minister K.T. Rama Rao’s family.

Speaking to The Hindu, a senior official said the MP did not appeal for bail when he was produced before the magistrate. He was shifted to Cherlapally Central Prison.

Meanwhile, Cyberabad police issued a statement stating that Mr. Reddy surrendered at Narsingi police station and argued with the police on how his name was in included the case.

“He was explained about his involvement and evidence available and he refused to cooperate with the police.

Senior leaders of the Telangana Congress condemned the ‘illegal’ arrest of Malakjgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy by the Narsingi police and demanded unconditional release of the MP.

In separate statements here, TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka, AICC secretary Sampath Kumar, former minister Shabbir Ali and former MP Mallu Ravi said his arrest reflects the “dictator’s rule in Telangana”. They alleged that the Indian Constitution is not followed here and the police is following “Kalvakuntla Constitution.”

How can a Parliament member be arrested for questioning the government and exposing the misrule of the government, they asked. They said it was time intellectuals and educated sections understand the seriousness in which Telangana has been thrown into. If this rule continues no one in the State can open their mouth and question the misdeeds of the government.

Mr. Sampath Kumar said that TRS has the habit of suppressing all the voices that question and he was also a victim of that in the last session. “We will fight for Revanth outside and it was foolish for the government to think that it can suppress all voices by arresting Revanth.” If an MP is arrested with such contempt for law people should realise the dangerous situation they are living in here, he said adding that Congress would continue to fight.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-condemns-revanths-arrest/article30993257.ece

180,2020/03/05,Congress gears up for Assembly sessions,"To focus on farmers and unemployment issues

Partial disbursal of Rythu Bandhu money, government’s failure to implement farm loan waiver as promised in the last elections and unemployment will be high on the agenda of the Congress party in the Assembly session starting on Friday.

The Congress Legislature Party (CLP) will meet on Friday to give a final shape to its agenda. The party is also keen on forcing the government to adopt a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), changes to objectionable content in the National Population Register (NPR) and also the National Registry of Citizens (NRC).

Rythu Bandhu scheme that fetched votes for the ruling party in the rural areas is partly implemented and the funds were being released only when elections were around, the Congress alleged citing how money was credited into the accounts of farmers in Huzurnagar byelections a couple of days before the voting day.

Similarly, the government also issued a GO to release money for Rythu Bandhu a few days before the Municipal elections. But Congress says money was released only to a few farmers while the message was sent as if the entire farming community was covered. TPCC president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy had repeatedly said the scheme was an election gimmick and in the TRS second term not even 50% of the farmers have been covered in both kharif and rabi seasons.

That the government did not even discuss the farmers issues in the Collectors’ conference is an indication of its efforts to suppress the farmers issues, feels TPCC working president and Malakjgiri MP Revanth Reddy. “Telangana stands third in the suicide rate of farmers in the country with NCRB report revealing that 5,912 farmers committed suicide in the last six years. But that is conveniently pushed under the carpet.”

CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka says the unemployment rate is increasing rapidly in the State with no effort from the government to create opportunities. Thousands of youngsters in every village are getting addicted to cheap liquor unable to find employment and this will lead to huge social unrest in the future.

But, he says, the government is never open for a discussion on the issue in the Assembly. “I will continue to raise the issue as it is not confined to one party or individual but about the social tensions it might create in the near future.”",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/1tj00y/article30993534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06LEGISLATIVEASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-gears-up-for-assembly-sessions/article30993173.ece
181,2020/03/05,Two samples from TS test negative for COVID-19,"State fully prepared to face any adversity: Minister

In a huge relief to people of Telangana, two women from the State whose swab samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune have tested negative for coronavirus (COVID-19).

One of them is a software employee who works at a company in Raheja Mindspace. She has travel history to Italy. Another is a sanitation worker of Apollo Hospitals who came in contact with the index (first COVID positive) case from Hyderabad.

Holding the test reports issued by NIV in his hands, State Health Minister Eatala Rajender said “Telangana people are lucky. The two samples tested negative for COVID-19. But we are not going to relax. Our efforts and committee’s work will continue”. No other sample from the State was sent to the NIV for tests.

Telanganites including officials in the State government were anxious for the past two days about the results of the samples. In fact, a software company in Hitech City sent emails stating that an employee tested positive for the virus. Software employees from at least four companies were evacuated on Wednesday from the building. However, the messages proved to be false as she tested negative.

When asked whether any action would be taken against the company, the Health Minister said that State IT Principal Secretary Jayesh Ranjan will deal with it.

Quoting Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, Mr Rajender said that 10,000 beds in private hospitals will be taken if the need arises. “If there is further need, then our double bedroom houses which are all ready can be used. Around 80,000 beds will fit into it,” the Health Minister said, adding that they have the required workforce, infrastructure to face any adversity.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/two-samples-from-ts-test-negative-for-covid-19/article30993169.ece

183,2020/03/05,Granite industry hit by COVID-19,"Units in erstwhile Karimnagar district depended on exports to China

Granite industry, which is the biggest employer after the Singareni Collieries Company Limited in the integrated Karimnagar district, is reeling in crisis following the outbreak of COVID-19 in China and other parts of the world.

As a result of the outbreak of the disease in China exports to that country have stopped and no buyers are coming from China to purchase the granite from the district. As a result several granite quarries have stopped production and laid of several thousands of labourers, most of who have migrated from Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Bihar and other parts of the country.

The Karimnagar district is known for its varieties of granite like Maple Red and Tan Brown. Incidentally, China is a major buyer of the granite from the district for over two decades. Every month around ₹ 100 crore worth granite (over 30,000 cubic meters of raw granite) is exported to China. Following the outbreak of COVID 19, neither is any buyer coming from China to the district nor is any Indian businessman going to China to do trading.

There are around 70 granite quarries and over 200 polishing factories in the district. Due to lack of business, the factories are closed and the owners are unable to repay the bank loans as they are yet to receive payments from China, which is around ₹ 120 crore. Industry sources said that several factories in China are closed and hence they were unable to get their payments.

The lack of business has resulted in several thousands of labour force being unemployed and many have already left to their native places and some others are seeking employment in the construction sector in the district.

Managing director of Sri Venkatesh Granites (SVG) Venugopal Karwa said that they had already stopped night-shift and reduced the production during the morning shift as there was no export market. “We are running the quarries and factories with reduced staff as there was very less market in the country,” he said and added that the granite industry solely survives on the export market to China.

He appealed to the government to step in and support the granite industry by reducing the bank interest rates and reduction of royalty charges to bail it out of the crisis and also help the labour force secure employment.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/6eohmj/article30993026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06GRANITEQUARRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/granite-industry-hit-by-covid-19/article30993027.ece
184,2020/03/05,Electrocution of poacher rings alarm bells for Forest Department,"The four-day-old incident occurred in area where tigers roam

Poaching in the forests of Kagaznagar Forest Division in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district has certainly come down drastically in the last few years of dedicated work done by the Forest Department, but there still is scope for improvement. A four-day-old incident which has come in the open only on Thursday makes it imperative for enhanced vigil on known poachers and their activities in order to keep up the tempo towards protection of wild animals.

Poachers from Achilli village in Sirpur (T) mandal (Vempalli forest section) had set up electrified wire around an agricultural field close to the forest area with an intent of killing wild animals, on the intervening night of March 1 and 2. But, fate had different plans and one of the three culprits, Lavudia Naresh, hailing from the same village got caught in the wire and was electrocuted.

According to Kagaznagar DSP B. L. N. Swamy, a case has been booked against the two others for negligence causing the death of Naresh. “They had electrified the wire intending to kill wild animals,” he disclosed as he referred to the crime details.

The incident has sent alaram bells ringing as the electrified trap could have resulted even in killing of a tiger. Kagaznagar forest division is teeming with migrant tigers, a couple of which are said to have gone resident and are moving in the area.

The Forest Department is very serious about controlling killing of wild animals through setting up of electrified wires in agriculture fields or forests. The Department has performed well in this regard is evident from the sharp decline in poaching of wildlife even for the purpose of meat.

Apparently, the fear of being accused of negligence had some forest officials and staff at field level ‘staging’ seizure of snares and wires from the same place, a day before the death of the poacher. “The officials manipulated the date and timing in a camera and took photographs with snares to prove that they were active and alive to the threat of poaching in the area,” alleged an official.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bkpxsx/article30992682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06TIGER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/electrocution-of-poacher-rings-alarm-bells-for-forest-department/article30992683.ece

Twenty six persons, including prime accused Vadde Yellaiah, accused of involvement in the murder of Yarkaram village’s TRS leader Onteddu Venkanna last month, were remanded in judicial custody on Thursday.

The former sarpanch was reportedly chased down and hacked to death in Yarkaram under Suryapet Rural police limits, in the wee hours of February 15.

According to the complaint filed by Boddu Kiran, cousin of the victim and eyewitness to the incident, “Vadde Yellaiah along with others attacked Onteduu Venkanna with sticks and knives. The attack was for political reasons and over past disputes.”

District Superintendent of Police R.

186,2020/03/05,Adivasi farmers taste success with polyhouses,"First such venture in arid tribal area in State

The two huge whitish tent like structures made of polyethylene make for a strange sight in the semi-arid tribal land in Adilabad district. The structures which are visible clearly from the higher ground of the degraded hill not far from Markaguda village in Indervelli mandal are polyhouses established by two local Adivasi farmers for cultivating horticulture crops in the technology driven modern method.

Establising a nearly ₹ 34 lakh project was absolutely unthinkable in the poverty ridden area but Kumra Keshav Rao and Arka Jangu have done the unthinkable, a first for Adivasis in the State, and went for one polyhouse each to cultivate horticulture crops on an unusually larger scale. What is more, the business they have done so far has given them the confidence that they will succeed.

“There was a lot of help we received from the then District Collector Jyoti Buddha Prakash in 2017 which resulted in erection of polyhouses in an extent of one acre each September-October last year. While the department offered a subsidy of 95 %, the Integrated Tribal Development Agency, Utnoor, under the then Project Officer R.V. Karnan contributed the remaining five % of the amount on our behalf,” recalled Mr. Keshav Rao, a Raj Gond aboriginal.

First crop

“Our first crop is cucumber of the kheera-dosa variety and we have sold about ₹ 1.5 lakh and ₹ 80,000 worth of it in the first month. The business has definitely given us hope that we will succeed,” asserted Mr. Jangu, a Pardhan tribal, as he talked of the project evidently comparing it with his earlier long experience as a farmer in the traditional mould.

“The polyhouse saves the crop from bird pestilence and dust, protects against any diseases,” the farmers were unanimous in their observation. “These factors help in the crop growing properly,” they added.

Trained farmers

“They are disciplined and hard working farmers which is why the department has sanctioned such a project in their names,” opined Adilabad District Horticulture and Sericulture Officer Sham Rao Rathod as he vouched for the farmers’ efforts. “We have not only trained them in every aspect but linked them with marketing avenues too,” the official pointed out about the seriousness of his department in making the ‘venture’ a success.

“We had first given them the green shade nets to get accustomed to raising horticulture crops in controlled climate. They were successful and deserved the help they got for establishing the polyhouses,” recalled Horticulture Officer G. Srinivas Reddy of his association with farmers in the tribal belt.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/u47t3e/article30992405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06POLYHOUSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/adivasi-ryots-taste-success-with-polyhouses/article30992406.ece
187,2020/03/05,Farmer attempts suicide at Siddipet MRO office,"Alleges his land has been forcibly taken away by officials; district respresented by CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao, and FM Harish Rao; latter orders an inquiry

A farmer attempted suicide at the Siddipet (Rural) Mandal Revenue Office (MRO) office on Thursday. In a quick response, Finance Minister T. Harish Rao immediately ordered an inquiry into the incident.

The incident created ripples as it happened in the district headquarters being represented by both Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Mr. Harish Rao.

Overpowered and stopped

According to sources, Kasula Kishtaiah of Mittapally village in Siddipet urban mandal has arrived with a petrol bottle threatening to immolate himself alleging his land was forcibly taken way by officials. Revenue officials alerted the police who rushed to the spot, overpowered the farmer, and took the petrol bottle away from him.

Responding to the incident, Mr. Harish Rao has directed Collector P. Venkatarami Reddy to conduct an inquiry and submit a report immediately.

Skyhigh land prices the reason

The Collector in turn spoke to the RDO K. Ananta Reddy who informed that Mr. Kishtaiah was allotted three acres of land in 1977 and he had sold the same to another farmer in 2012, which was illegal. The same land was taken back by officials. As land rates in the area have skyrocketed, now the farmer has been alleging that officials were taking away his land.

Mr. Ananta Reddy said that enquiry is on and action will be taken against those responsible. He said they held counselling for the farmer and sent him back.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/zh2xc9/article30993366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06FARMER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/farmer-attempts-suicide-at-siddipet-mro-office/article30990648.ece

191,2020/03/05,COVID-19: Telangana Health officials look for treatment lessons from Kerala,"As the infectious disease is spreading aggressively, COVID-19 positive patients are scared for their lives leading to high levels of stress

At a time when Telangana Health officials are bracing up to treat more patients and track all close contacts of COVID-19 positive patients, health officials from Kerala — where three COVID-19 positive patients were successfully treated — have lessons to offer, which could give huge assurance to patients and suspects.

Apart from medicines administered as part of symptomatic treatment for COVID-19 patients, the Kerala officials said that relieving stress among patients whose anxiety levels will shoot up, nutrition and warm oral fluids, psychological counselling and emotional support, are part of the treatment.

Kerala’s Nodal Officer for Public Health Emergencies (Corona & H1N1), Dr. Amar Fettle said that besides giving symptomatic treatment such as paracetemol, they dedicated a team of counsellors who provided psychological support.

As the infectious disease is spreading aggressively, COVID-19 positive patients are scared for their lives leading to high levels of stress. The official said that the stress could worsen cold.

“The counsellors were trained about COVID-19, and questions that patients might frequently ask. Each patient had a dedicated counsellor to gain trust over time. Besides, all doctors gave huge emotional and psychological support. They were trained how to manage patients, how to behave to allay anxiety (among patients),” Dr. Amar Fettle said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/474yjx/article30975688.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04CORONAVIRUSCOVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telangana-health-officials-look-for-treatment-lessons-from-kerala/article30987626.ece
192,2020/03/05,Stages of bias in Urdu poetry rendered in India and Pakistan,"Indian and Pakistani societies, two bastions of Urdu poetry, inflict subtle discrimination on women poets

We are living in times when “Dadis (grandmas) of Shaheen Bagh” daily shatter all manner of glass ceilings and barriers, yet some stereotypes refuse to go away. Take the case of women poets in Urdu. While Urdu poetry itself attracts enthusiastic mixed audiences across the Hindustani speaking regions, a curious gender divide trips up women poets.

Delhi-based poet Ameeta Parsuram ‘Meeta’ is known for her ghazal writing and her annual event “Bazm” in the Capital, an evening she describes as aimed at preserving the traditional form of ghazal gayaki. Pointing out “subtle discrimination”, she says that for every 10 male poets at a given mushaira (festival of Urdu poetry), there would be on average “two or three or fewer” women. “And it’s not as if there are not enough women poets!”

Harder time

Gauhar Raza, another successful Delhi-based poet, agrees that women have a harder time than their male counterparts in getting recognised for their literary skills. “Yes, creating space in any field of art and literature is far more difficult for women in a male dominated world,” he says. “Urdu poetry world is not free of this exclusivity.”

Over years of observation, Ameeta finds that audience reaction to women poets too is often one of “lower energy or indifference,” or of “looking at her as a woman, followed by applause suggestive of ‘celebrating the woman’ — almost as if she was there to entertain them, while ignoring the poet.” Worse, there are occasions like last year when popular male poet Manzar Bhopali made shockingly derogatory remarks about women reciting at mushairas from a public platform in Bhopal.

At the other extreme is the “Khawatiin ka mushaira” (mushaira for women poets), which Ameeta calls “regressive” and “worse than even tokenism”.

Raza feels, “Since there is no mushaira called ‘Mardon ka Mushaira’ or ‘Hazraat ka Mushaira’, it is derogatory to call any mushaira ‘Khawatiin ka Mushaira’.”

Mushairas must not be differentiated by gender, “even if the majority or all participant poets are women,” he avers. When a poet is introduced with emphasis on the gender instead of the quality of the work, “The broad message is ‘it is primarily a display of poets, judge their work on a different parameter’.”

Interestingly, Pakistani poet Kishwar Naheed says there are very few mushairas in her country only for women, though they may be held on occasions like March 8 or February 12, designated as Pakistani Women Day. “TV channels often hold such mushairas,” she says, but adds, “Male writers, when invited as listeners, do grumble and try to make jokes. In grand (main) mushairas, quite a few participate and are appreciated.”

Ameeta asserts she has never accepted an invitation to a ‘khawatin ka mushaira’. “At no point can a poet ignore the nagging feeling that she occupies this platform more for being a woman than a poet.”

When a woman’s work does get published and she becomes a literary celebrity, “Often people or literary establishments (controlled by men) talk of it as a special case, as if she achieved whatever she did because of being a woman,” says Ameeta.

Even content is judged according to the poet’s gender. Ameeta cites Pakistani poet Parveen Shakir, whose themes such as the desire for love and intimacy, sexuality, injustice and gender discrimination attracted censure. “To begin with from her own family members — it is common knowledge her father did not want her to write love poetry — and then from the masses.”

Ameeta says Shakir’s nazm “Misfit” represents “the inner struggles, pains and angst of any woman of her times, who dared to express her desires, complaints, ambitions, etc. She shares in this nazm how such a woman faces the consequence of feeling guilty. Parveen Shakir paid a heavy price for her rebellious poetry, which aimed at changing the image of the ‘ideal Muslim woman’.”

Ironically, remarks Ameeta, the same poet denounced by patriarchal reactionaries for being too outspoken was criticised by feminists for also writing ‘weak’ love poetry, “completely overlooking that individual and political cannot be separated. My question is, do men ever go through such internal conflicts to create a space for their creativity?”

Along with Shakir, poets like Kishwar Naheed and Fahmida Riaz have been resolutely pushing the envelope, says Ameeta. “Kishwar Naheed has agitated many minds and evoked reactions by presenting in her work a woman who is powerful, has a mind of her own, defies the mould.”

With poets from various communities taking to writing Urdu Shayari, and women constantly breaking stereotypes, would the “ideal Muslim woman” image not become obsolete?

“Times have changed, no doubt, but when it comes to the relationship between a woman and the society, the concept of the ‘ideal woman’ has not changed. It has simply expanded to include more features like ‘she earns too’. But even today a ‘good’ woman is expected not to assert, leave alone demand!”

Meanwhile, women mostly remain primary caregivers to children and family elders, notes Ameeta. “Would that not have implications for the larger chunk of their experiences and their poetry?” But here, the ‘good’ woman’s writing is not accepted as universal enough.

“For a long time, creative work based on women’s perspectives, experiences and sensitivity has been trivialised. According to Ada Jafari, the first shayra to ever write about herself as a wife and a mother, thus impacting the existing idiom for women’s writings, ‘Patriarchy has suppressed women writers and their poetry’.”

Ameeta even quotes a journalist in a south Indian publication who disparagingly referred to the use of the first-person pronoun (the third person is considered more dignified): “I is the resort of neurotic women poets.”

Even “honest and mature poets” feel “good poetry has to be about the bigger issues, issues beyond the individual,” recounts Ameeta. When women write on ‘universal’ themes, “the accusation which follows is that they are trying to be different, trying the masculine terrains! Their authenticity is questioned too,” she says, wondering why poetic themes need be categorised by gender.

Naheed says, “Male writers till recently never approved of or appreciated women's themes. Women poets take up universal as well as themes ingrained in the conflict between man and woman. Right from terrorism to child abuse to honour killings — [these] are more relevant subjects for women poets.” She says while male Pakistani writers do agree these are worthy subjects, they don’t explore them themselves. But, observes Naheed, when women do, like when she and fellow Pakistani poet Fahmida Riaz write on themes related to girls’ education, menstruation, marriage and divorce, the “male critics write a one-liner just naming the women poets.”

Naheed says this discrimination is limited to the subcontinent. Still, Raza sees a hopeful change. “Women poets have created spaces for themselves and their merit has been recognised,” he states. “Many of them have refused to be recognised as 'khawatiin' and the quality of their work speaks loud and clear.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/o8igub/article30991670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/naheed-main,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/stages-of-bias-in-urdu-poetry-rendered-in-india-and-pakistan/article30991674.ece
193,2020/03/05,Kerala artist E H Pushkin’s exhibition of drawings shows how art is an egalitarian refuge in a polarised society,"‘Sign Here’, an ongoing exhibition of over 40 drawings at Suryakanti Art Gallery in Thiruvananthapuram, drives home the point using minimal strokes

An abstract portraiture of a “fallen” human head bears the weight of what appears to be a boulder. Titled ‘Sign In Refugees’, the drawing, done with an evocative adherence to minimalism, is meant to signify what has become of man today.

“The amorphous dark object denotes burdens and concerns, such as misconceptions, misleading beliefs and even our identity, that are imposed on us right from birth,” says artist E H Pushkin. “We don’t realise that we don’t need most of these,” he adds.

‘Sign Here’, Pushkin’s ongoing exhibition of over 40 drawings at Suryakanti Art Gallery, drives home the point in minimal strokes. There are no superfluous embellishments, no forced commitment to employ garish colours to capture the attention. Rather, the thrust is on the message and the subtext, which are delivered to be pointed, best embodied in the technique employed. In fact, Pushkin trades the brush for ink pen to create his subjects in this series of works chiefly on an expressionistic style, while resorting to the use of water colours only to breathe further life into them.

“A principal reason why I have used a fountain pen for the works is that it allows me the freedom to select the type of ink depending on its colour and consistency to suit a particular drawing. Also, I wanted the strokes to be sharp,” says Pushkin, adding that he has used “Indian-made” ink for its thickness.

‘Sign Here’ comprises works the artist produced in a span of three months, from November last year to January. Pushkin says the title for the collection is meant as “an exhortation to people to come and subscribe to the idea of art”, which in his opinion is “a secular, accommodative refuge for all.” He wants to demonstrate how art possesses more than enough room to show “compassion” for every being.

Pushkin says one of the pieces, titled ‘Sign Here 4’ in the series, sort of proved prescient for him. It depicts an abstract human head face down on bare ground, blood dripping from a wound on the forehead. “It was drawn two months ago to highlight a sense of anxiety and tensions pervading in the current society. Soon enough, we started hearing about the riots,” says Pushkin, a resident of Kattakkada.

Another work, categorically titled ‘You Can Seek Refuge in Art’, is “an expression of the power of art.” It depicts a radius-topped entranceway bearing a conical object. “It signifies the door of art that always remains open and lets in all without any discrimination. The horn-like component is representative of art’s own defence for self-protection. It can also be construed as a peaceful weapon and a weapon for peace,” explains Pushkin, alluding to the instances of muzzling the right to free speech and expression.

Despite a predominantly abstract style, Pushkin finds ample scope to pay his obseisance to Nature and its significance and indispensability.

194,2020/03/05,Artist Venu Kotheril’s second coming with his new collection of paintings,"‘Transcending hues’, his collection of paintings in oils and acrylics, signalled the resurrection of an artist taking up the brush after a long interval of nearly 30 years

When Venu Kotheril woke up from his nearly three-decade-long creative and artistic hibernation, the world around him had changed considerably. Nevertheless, that change has not completely hampered his bold strokes or his burst of amorphous shapes in oils and acrylics on canvas and paper.

‘Archaic Dreams’, his last exhibition in 1990 at the then House of Soviet Culture in Thiruvananthapuram, has a soothing palette with the dominant shade being blue. One of the untitled works in oil from that collection, in a pleasing melange of pastels, leads the way to a new collection of works, ‘Transcending hues’, in which shades of brown and orange give way to swirls and swathes of green and blue. “I had not painted for more than 25 years and had completely moved away from colours and canvas. A series of mishaps caught me unawares and I was caught in the affairs of the mundane and I felt that the artist in me had been erased. However, my friend and well-wisher G Sreekumar never gave up on me. Unobtrusively, gently, he brought me back into the artistic community by making me a part of MV Devan Kalagramam, Pallimon, Kollam,” says the soft-spoken Venu.

The artist agrees that his second coming as an artist has been deeply influenced by his work as a curator at the Kalagramam. “It is inevitable. We are all influenced by what we see around us and when I started painting again, I took time to rediscover my style,” he says.

Nebulous shapes vaguely resembling various images of everyday life seem to tease the viewer’s imagination even as those shapes seem to dissolve or flow to create new experiences for the viewer. “I was inspired by conch shells, butterfly pea flowers (Shangupushpam) and paper boats. The fascination with conch shells continue. I feel their presence when I paint,” he explains.

In a new light

The conch shells acquire a new dimension and structure in his work as he sees them through his creative lens. His angst, anger, apprehension, confusion, empathy and unconventional outlook are expressed in the striking slashes of colour and shapes that fill his canvas. It is as if the artist is trying to make his way through the murky world to find his space and his mode of expression. Venu’s inner conflicts are reflected in his works. Poetry, he says, inspires him and he adds that like a poet struggles to find the apt word to capture his feelings, Venu strives to express his poetry in colours and shapes and it is a struggle until he finds one that best captures his visual verses. Perhaps, it is serene meditative pauses that find expression in contours in shades of green and white punctuated with blue.

While many of his new works are in oil, a few smaller ones in size are acrylics on paper and canvas. Filled with an exuberance and vitality, the acrylics are a collage of frenetic strokes that hint at the artist’s spontaneous outpouring of creative expressions in paint. Over the last two years, Venu has painted more than 200 works and he hopes to have another exhibition of some more of his creations.

Also included in the exhibits are some of his drawings in pen and ink. Fluid, confident lines depict the young artist, a product of the College of Fine Arts, at his peak. However, in a fit of disenchantment, he decided to walk away from it all and travelled to different places in India in search of a greater meaning. Once he returned to his home in Kollam, his turmoil resulted in him separating himself from art, his lifeline.

The resurrection of the artist was evident during the exhibition at the Lalitakala Akademi gallery in Thiruvananthapuram.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/z95wux/article30988099.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv06tvfvenu13,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/artist-venu-kotheril-takes-up-the-brush-after-30-years/article30988100.ece
195,2020/03/05,Anti-CAA protest: Calcutta High Court stays leave India notice to Polish student,"He has learnt from his mistake, lawyer tells court.

The Calcutta High Court on Thursday stayed the “Leave India” notice issued by the Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office (FRRO), Kolkata, to a Polish student. He was asked to leave last month after he allegedly participated in a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

After hearing the counsel representing the student and the government, Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya restrained the government from executing the notice till March 18.

Kamil Siedcynski, a student of Masters in Comparative Literature at the Jadavpur University in Kolkata, was given the notice on February 14.

The student’s counsel Jayanta Mitra said the students had joined other students in a visit to the New Market area and participated in the protest ‘unwittingly’. He pleaded before the Court that only a few months of his masters programme are left, he has learnt from his mistake and will not repeat it. Mr. Siedcynski has been studying in India since 2016 and had obtained a post graduate diploma from the Visva Bharati University.

Last month, the FRRO Kolkata Office had issued a similar notice to a Bangladeshi student at the Visva Bharati University Santinketan for allegedly participating in an anti-CAA protests.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7s82c6/article25798853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CALCUTTAHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/anti-caa-protest-calcutta-high-court-stays-leave-india-notice-to-polish-student/article30993600.ece

197,2020/03/05,Two arrested for thrashing 2 youths for ‘cow slaughter’,"The arrests followed the wide circulation of a video showing the two youths being hit with sticks by a group of at least six persons in Sikandrabad area on March 2.

The Uttar Pradesh police on Thursday arrested two persons for thrashing two youths and spreading a 'false' story of cow slaughter in Bulandhshar.

The arrests followed the wide circulation of a video showing the two youths being hit with sticks by a group of at least six persons in Sikandrabad area on March 2. The two had claimed that while assaulting them, the assaulters accused them of cow slaughter and hurled communal abuses at them while referring to the Delhi violence.

While declaring the arrest of two of the five persons named in the FIR, a senior Bulandhshar police officer said the accused had “come up with a false story” of cow slaughter.

Bulandhshar ASP Gopal Krishan Chaudhary said the accused knew of a dead cow lying near a ground where they would often play cricket. “So they came up with a false story to spoil the atmosphere”, he said, adding that a police team instantly reached the spot upon hearing about an assault and alleged cow slaughter. The police recovered the skull of a cow from the spot while the carcass had been eaten by dogs. After investigation, it was found that the carcass was five days old and the cow had a “natural death”, the officer told media.

Upon questioning the arrested persons, Mr. Chaudhary said, they mentioned that Pradeep and Sachin had some dispute with the two youths over payment at a hotel.

The arrested persons were identified as Karan alias Vipin and Badal alias Vinendra. A case under attempt to murder, rioting, criminal intimidation and kidnapping for murder against five persons and another unidentified accused was registered earlier.

In one video widely shared on social media, the two youths, one of them bare-chested, were seen being punched, kicked and hit with a lathi by the men, later identified as the accused, in an undisclosed location next to a car bearing a Delhi number plate.

Later, in another video, one of them, identifying himself as Umar, is heard saying the assaulters intercepted their car and pulled them on the road while they were going to a cold storage. He alleges that the assaulters used communal slurs and referred to the violence in Delhi while abusing and threatening them with dire consequences.” They had hammers, axe and knives and also threatened to throw acid on us”, he states.

In a cryptic sentence, he suggests that they were targeted over allegations of cow slaughter. “Shouldn't we have blood on our hands [if we indulged in cow slaughter]”, he asks.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/two-arrested-for-thrashing-2-youths-for-cow-slaughter/article30992461.ece
198,2020/03/05,"Dabholkar murder: CBI recovers firearm from Thane creek, sends it for ballistic test","The weapon will be sent for ballistic tests which will give a clear picture whether it was used in Dabholkar’s murder or any other case.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing the 2013 murder of rationalist Dr. Narendra Dabholkar, has recovered a firearm from a creek in Maharashtra’s Thane district.

Sources in the agency, speaking on condition of anonymity, said only a ballistic report from forensic labs would reveal whether or not the weapon was the one with which the eminent rationalist was killed.

Officials, however, have not divulged details of the kind of firearm they have retrieved nor details about the search operation.

In April last year, the CBI had told the Bombay High Court that it was taking help from foreign experts and divers to salvage the murder weapon used to kill both Dr. Dabholkar and veteran Communist leader Govind Pansare, who was shot in Kolhapur in February 2015.

In July 2018, the CBI had disclosed before a Pune court that Sharad Kalaskar — named as one of two assailants by the agency — had allegedly dismantled four countrymade pistols and thrown the arms in the water in creeks in Greater Mumbai and Thane, while suggesting that one of the firearms among them could possibly have been the weapon used to kill Dr. Dabholkar.

Then, on May 25, lawyer Sanjeev Punalekar (who is counsel for the right wing Sanatan Sanstha) was arrested along with Sanatan Sanstha member Vikram Bhave by the CBI after the agency alleged that the duo had participated in the conspiracy to murder Dr. Dabholkar.

Mr. Punalekar, who was later released on bail in July that year, was charged with destruction of evidence and for advising Mr. Kalaskar to allegedly destroy the murder weapon.

In his statement to the CBI in 2018, Mr. Kalaskar had allegedly said that Mr. Punalekar, known for his statements against Dr. Dabholkar, had asked him to destroy the weapons.

According to the CBI, Mr. Kalaskar had further revealed that it was the Thane-based Mr. Bhave who had allegedly planned the reconnaissance and had even pointed out Dr. Dabholkar to the assailants. The agency claimed that Mr. Bhave had also planned the getaway route for the shooters after the crime.

Motorcycle-borne assailants had killed Dr. Dabholkar on August 20, 2013, with a 7.65-mm countrymade pistol when he was taking his morning stroll on the Omkareshwar Bridge in Pune. Mr. Pansare, and his wife Uma, were similarly shot at close range from two 7.65-mm countrymade weapons. The same modus operandi was used in the murders of scholar-rationalist M.M. Kalburgi, who was killed by two unidentified assailants outside his home in Dharwad in Kanataka, as well as senior journalist Gauri Lankesh, who was shot to death outside her Bengaluru residence in September 2017.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/y1y3ko/article26668418.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BMNARENDRADABHOLKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dabholkar-murder-norwegian-technology-ukrainian-divers-help-cbi-recover-weapon-from-seabed/article30992106.ece
199,2020/03/05,"261 lions, cubs died in Gujarat in last two years","In addition, 250 leopards and their 90 cubs also died in the last two years in Gujarat

Over 260 lions and their cubs died in different parts of Gujarat in the last two years, the Gujarat government told the Legislative Assembly on Thursday.

Of these, 11 lions and six cubs died due to “unnatural” causes, such as getting hit by a train or falling into a well, the government said.

Replying to a query by Congress MLA Vikram Madam, State Forest Minister Ganpat Vasava said in a written reply that total 138 lions and 123 cubs died in 2018 and 2019.

In addition, 250 leopards and their 90 cubs also died in the last two years in the State.

Of these, 79 leopards and 16 of their cubs died due to unnatural causes, Mr. Vasava said.

On a sub-question about the steps being taken by the government to prevent unnatural deaths, Mr. Vasava listed several measures, including appointment of veterinary doctors as well as trackers, building of parapets around wells near forest, fencing along the railway tracks, construction of speed breakers on roads passing through sanctuaries.

He added that a state-of-the-art hospital is also being constructed at Sasan-Gir to provide timely treatment to lions and other old animals.

200,2020/03/05,14 to 15 BJP MLAs in touch with us: Jayant Patil,"The Maharashtra minister’s comment came in the wake of the Congress’ allegation that the BJP was carrying out an “Operation Lotus” in Madhya Pradesh to bring down the Kamal Nath government.

Maharashtra Minister Jayant Patil has claimed that 14 to 15 BJP MLAs from the State are in touch with the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi, but the ruling alliance is not willing to commit the mistake of “poaching” Opposition leaders.

Mr. Patil’s comment came in the wake of the Congress’ allegation that the BJP was carrying out an “Operation Lotus” in Madhya Pradesh to bring down the Kamal Nath government in that State.

Mr. Patil, who is the Maharashtra NCP chief, also accused the BJP of being desperate for power.

“Fourteen to fifteen MLAs of the Opposition party are in touch with us even today. We have to do their works as we share good relations with them [the MLAs concerned]. We understand their mindset,” Mr. Patil told reporters on Wednesday outside the State Legislature complex in Mumbai.

“Yet, it is not right to poach legislators...We don’t intend to make that mistake. Our focus is on ensuring our government sustains,” he added.

The BJP emerged as the single largest party in Maharashtra after the Assembly polls in October last year.

But, it failed to form government after the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena snapped ties with it over the issue of sharing the Chief Ministerial post.

The Congress on Wednesday alleged “poaching” bid on its MLAs and allies by the Opposition BJP in Madhya Pradesh.

The BJP, however, denied any move to topple the Kamal Nath government – which is surviving on support of over half a dozen independent, SP and BSP MLAs – and asked the ruling party to keep its own house in order.

“People are urged not be give ear to rumours. There is nothing to panic,” Mr. Khan said.

Officials said around 200 people who have travel history to coronavirus-affected countries or had contact with people from such countries have been identified. Twenty-one suspected cases have been tested till date and “no positive case has been reported so far across J&K”, a senior official said.

He said a “100% self-declaration at the airports of Jammu and Srinagar will start from Thursday to trace any such person having travel history to the affected countries.”

“Further, check points for passengers travelling by road have been set up at Lakhanpur and Lower Munda (Zig) to identify individuals with travel history to these countries,” the official said.

Financial Secretary in the Health Department Atul Dulloo reviewed arrangements at the GMCH during a visit to the hospital.

203,2020/03/05,BJP’s ‘fever’ to destabilise Opposition govts rises when RS polls near: Congress,"It accuses BJP of ‘abducting’ 14 lawmakers of the ruling coalition in Madhya Pradesh

The Congress on Thursday accused the BJP of ‘abducting’ 14 lawmakers of the ruling coalition in Madhya Pradesh and alleged that the ruling party’s “fever” to destabilise Opposition ruled State governments rises when Rajya Sabha elections are due.

The Congress claimed that though the BJP held some MLAs hostage in a five-star hotel in Manesar, Haryana, and lured them, most of them voluntarily came back to its fold.

“The atmosphere created by the BJP in the country is to target and break Opposition leaders with threats of raids and force them to join or ally with it so that they can form a government”, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad told reporters at a press conference.

“In States where other parties have formed governments, the BJP’s aim has been to destabilise them. And we know that this fever to destabilise State governments rises when Rajya Sabha elections are around”, he said.

In April, three Rajya Sabha seats are falling vacant in Madhya Pradesh. They are currently represented by Digvijaya Singh of the Congress and the BJP's Satyanarayan Jatiya and Prabhat Jha.

While both the Congress and the BJP are assured of one seat each with 58 first preference votes, a fight is on for the third seat. The ruling coalition has a clear advantage over the third seat if there are no defections.

“What is going on in Madhya Pradesh is not a first. It is perhaps the third or fourth attempt. We condemn this and if this goes on, we will take strict action against it. We urge other parties to join us in this fight. We have never done politics of this kind where we scare and intimidate people to join us”, Mr. Azad said as he listed other instances when the BJP formed governments despite not getting clear mandate

“The BJP has been systematically destroying democracy in every State since it came to power. It started with Arunachal Pradesh, then Karanataka and then recently in Himachal Pradesh, despite the BJP not being in majority, a BJP CM took oath”, he said.

Congress leader Randeep Surjewala said, “11 mafias have been identified and are being reigned in by the Congress. They had been active for 15 years. The Vyapam scam is unravelling. So, this is a conspiracy to bring the Madhya Pradesh government down”. He asked the BJP to answer who paid the bills for ferrying Congress MLAs by a special plane and their five-star hotel stay”.

Congress leader in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said “the sinister designs of the BJP in breaking State governments will not succeed”.

204,2020/03/05,Will announce details of trust to build mosque in Ayodhya after Holi: Zufar Farooqui,"The chairman of Waqf Board said the meeting discussed other issues related to the Waqf and action taken on them.

Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board on Thursday said it would announce sometime after Holi the details of the planned trust for the construction of a mosque in Ayodhya.

Waqf Board chairman Zufar Farooqui told this to reporters after a meeting of the board in which, he said, the issue of the formation of the proposed trust was not discussed today.

“The issue of the proposed trust for the construction of a mosque as well as an Indo-Islamic research centre, a hospital and a library on the five-acre plot allotted following the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict was not on the agenda of the meeting today,” said Mr. Farooqui.

He said the meeting discussed other issues related to the Waqf and action taken on them.

“Details about the trust and its members will be announced through a press conference after Holi,” he said. Holi falls next week on Tuesday, March 10.

The Waqf Board, after its last meeting on February 24, in which it had decided to accept the five-acre land given by the State government for building a mosque in Ayodhya, had also said it would soon set up a trust for the construction of the mosque.

The Board had also decided to build an Indo-Islamic research centre, a public library, a charitable hospital and other useful facilities on the land besides the mosque.

In a historic verdict in November on the Ramjanmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute, the Supreme Court had ruled in favour of the construction of a temple. It had also ruled that an alternative five-acre plot must be found for building a mosque within Ayodhya.

In 1992, the 16th century Babri mosque that stood on the disputed site in Ayodhya was demolished by karsevaks, claiming that originally there was a Ram temple at the spot.

Soon after last year’s verdict on the Ayodhya land dispute, there were suggestions that the Sunni board should not accept the plot.

There were also suggestions that instead of a mosque to replace the demolished Babri Masjid, the Muslim community should build a public facility such as a hospital.

Based on the Supreme Court verdict, the Centre had asked the Uttar Pradesh government to allot five acres of land to the Sunni Waqf Board. The Uttar Pradesh Cabinet made the allotment after its meeting of February 5.

The allotment letter is for a plot at Dhannipur village in Ayodhya’s Sohawal area, on the Ayodhya-Lucknow Highway, about 20km from the district headquarters.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4wqzc7/article30990856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BABRI-MASJID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/will-announce-details-of-trust-to-build-mosque-in-ayodhya-after-holi-zufar-farooqui/article30990530.ece
205,2020/03/05,"Create right perception about force using technology, Ajit Doval tells young SPs","People felt safe when they had the perception that police were honest, alert and friendly, he says

National Security Advisor Ajit Doval on Thursday said the responsibility of police officers was not just to maintain law and order but also create “right perception” about the force using technology. He, however, cautioned that it should be totally credible and not “propagandist”.

Addressing around 150 young Superintendents of Police at the third such conference in Gurugram’s Apparel House, Mr. Doval felt that technology could play an important role in “perception management” and not just finding solution to the routine problems related to policing.

“In a democracy, it is extremely important that you should not only be totally dedicated to the law and do things fairly and objectively, but you are seen as credible,” said Mr. Doval in his around 30-minute address.

It was the responsibility of senior officers to create the right perception about the force through social media or their contacts. It was the perception that provided confidence to people, enhanced their trust and made their lives psychologically more secure. People felt safe when they had the perception that the police were honest, alert, efficient, objective, professionally competent and friendly, he stated.

Mr. Doval, a 1968 batch IPS officer, said that in the face of a problem, there were a few constants that one could not change, and the variables.

206,2020/03/05,260 from Assam who fled to Meghalaya jungles to escape violence rescued,"BJP MLA Ashok Kumar Singhi had taken the lead in rescuing them after he came to know many of them were from his area

At least 260 people from Assam, who hid in the jungles of Meghalaya for five days to escape communal violence that left three people dead, have been rescued by security forces.

Differences over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the introduction of inner-line permit in Meghalaya triggered a clash between members of the Khasi Students' Union and non-tribal people in East Khasi Hills district's Ichamati on February 28.

The violence in and around Ichamati, near the Bangladesh border, spread to other areas, including State capital Shillong, forcing the authorities to impose curfew and restrict mobile Internet services in six districts.

All of them – from western Assam’s Dhubri, Goalpara and Kokrajhar districts – were working in the unorganised sector in Sohra (Cherrapunjee), Ichamati and other areas of East Khasi Hills district affected most by the violence.

Assam’s Inspector-General of Police Deepak Kedia said a team of Assam and Meghalaya police brought the stranded people to Guwahati on Thursday morning.

“We are in constant touch with the Meghalaya police to bring back more stranded people. Some among the rescued said there are many who have taken refuge in police stations and Border Security Force camps in the hill State,” he told newspersons.

The police declined to quantify the affected people but BJP MLA Ashok Kumar Singhi said there were some 1,500 people waiting to be rescued from the violence-hit areas.

Mr. Singhi, who represents the Bilasipara East Assembly constituency in western Assam, had taken the lead in rescuing the people after he came to know many of them were from his area.

“I met Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and he instructed the State police to bring the people back to safety. Our police have been doing this in coordination with their Meghalaya counterparts,” he said.

The rescued people narrated their ordeal. “We left our jobs and places of stay soon after violence broke out. Many of us hid in the jungles for four-five days without anything to eat. Some of us took refuge at a police station but were not even offered water, let alone food,” one of them said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/260-from-assam-who-fled-to-meghalaya-jungles-to-escape-violence-rescued/article30989481.ece

The CPI (M), the main Opposition party in Tripura, launched street protests against what it called “planned carnage in Delhi” and demanded the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah for his “failure to save the lives of innocent people”.

Leaders who joined a protest rally in Agartala on Wednesday demanded a probe by a judicial commission under the supervision of the Supreme Court to “uncover conspiracies and unmask conspirators” involved in the riots in the national capital.

CPI(M) State secretary Gautam Das, former Lok Sabha member Shankar Prasad Datta, party’s Central Committee member Roma Das and former Deputy Speaker in Assembly Pabitra Kar led the rally which ended with a street meeting.

At the meeting, Mr. Das termed the tragic incidents in Delhi “State-sponsored carnage with involvement of the ruling dispensation”.

“Entire conspiracy to organise riots was hatched after the BJP faced a humiliating defeat in Delhi Assembly elections. The results in Delhi reflected determination of democratic, secular and peace abiding people to defeat communal forces,” Mr. Das added.

Fear has gripped the people living along the international border in Manipur over COVID-19, notwithstanding a statement by Health Director K. Rajo that so far nobody in the State had contracted the virus.

Meanwhile, reports in Imphal said on Wednesday that some border villages had blocked approach roads to prevent entry of outsiders infected with the virus.

217,2020/03/05,"COVID-19 effect: in holiday season, travellers look at safe destinations","Kashmir, Andamans could be surprise choice, say travel agents

Travellers to and from India seem to be in a wait and watch mode before finalising their summer vacation plans. With more cases of exposure to novel coronavirus (COVID-19) being detected, holiday bookings have turned to temporary reservations and those that are fully refundable.

The Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI) has written to foreign airlines so that there is one common policy on refunds and rescheduling of tickets, given that the issue is not economic or political in nature.

Data shows a fall in fresh bookings to affected locations and a 20-30% drop in airfares to south-east Asia, south Europe and Italy. While South Africa seems to be in demand, Australia is less appealing due to the bushfires.

According to AI-based travel app ixigo, Andaman and Nicobar islands, Goa, Pune, Jaipur, Guwahati have seen a 25-30 % increase in interest among those looking to travel this vacation season. TAAI expects Kashmir to be a surprise domestic destination that will open up with specific push from the government along with the Andamans where a spike in booking interest was being seen.

“Currently, there are cancellations and postponement of trips. People are postponing their trip by two months because there is a general confidence that things will tide down by then. How really serious things are no one honestly knows. Our request is that travellers listen to advice from travel agents and government communication,” said TAAI national vice-president Jai Bhatia.

Yatra.com said that due to the prevailing situation of Coronavirus in different locations across the globe, there many destinations across the globe were expected to face a drop in tourist arrivals due to advisories issued by various governments.

“Southeast Asia and Italy being one of the most preferred destinations for Indians, we anticipate a drop of about 20-25% in future bookings, though it is too early to predict,” said Sabina Chopra, co-founder and COO, corporate travel and head industry relations, Yatra.com.

Ms. Chopra explained that people were wary of making fresh bookings to the affected locations and airfares to these destinations have dropped by 20-30%. “We have received about 35% of cancellation queries from travellers planning their trips to foreign locations during holiday season. Summer travel is the peak travel period in India, where travellers with their friends and families look forward to exploring different destinations,” she said.

Yatra.com said it was advising and helping customers to postpone their travel dates. and book their tickets accordingly. “Travellers are now looking at alternate foreign destinations from India, such as Sri Lanka and Bhutan for summer travel. There is a hike in enquires to domestic destinations such as Andaman and Nicobar, Goa, Ujjain and cities in the north-east,” Ms. Chopra said.

ixigo which announced a full refund for all bookings to China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iran, Italy, Spain, Singapore, South Korea and Japan on Wednesday said that the policy was applicable on both one-way and return bookings for travel dates upto March 31 as several airlines have temporarily suspended/cancelled operations to certain parts of South-East Asia and Europe.

“With public health officials in many countries advising caution against travelling, ixigo has seen a spike in travellers changing their immediate travel plans. “The health and safety of our customers is always our top priority. In the context of this global emergency, we have rolled out a policy to help travellers who wish to cancel or postpone their trips in a hassle free way. We are providing a no-questions asked full refund on the countries most impacted by COVID-19, irrespective of the airline’s own policy, in this regard. We will continue monitoring the situation and extend the waiver, if the need arises,” said Aloke Bajpai, co-founder & CEO, ixigo.

As for the impact of the virus outbreak on travel, Rajnish Kumar, co-founder and CTO, ixigo, reiterated that while a slowdown in the top countries impacted was visible, there was still a demand for travel to other areas. “On the international front, people are still actively booking their vacations to places like Sri Lanka, Maldives, Vietnam, Thailand and Bhutan. We expect the situation to improve closer to the summer travel season,” Mr. Kumar said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-effect-in-holiday-season-travellers-look-at-safe-destinations/article30985504.ece
218,2020/03/05,This improvisation workshop in Chennai bridges music and movement,"The improvisation workshop at March Dance 2020 hopes to bridge disciplines of dance, theatre, music and more

Dynamic. Flow. Accent. Counterpoint. These are all essential to improvisation in any art form, but do these words mean the same for a musician, a theatre artiste, a dancer or an actor?

A workshop, led by theatre practitioner and visual artist Pravin Kannanur, and musician Maarten Visser will discuss improvisation, as a mode of listening and responding between practitioners of different art forms. Open to artists and performers across disciplines, amateur or professional, this workshop is part of March Dance 2020, a contemporary dance festival organised by Basement 21 and Goethe-Institut.

“We look at improvisation as the basic process of creation,” says Pravin, explaining that it is how most artists find a way to create interesting new work. “At this workshop, we start by looking at certain concepts present in the various arts, and then work with each of those.”

Take, for instance, the concept of silence. For a musician, it fills the space between movements, and for a theatre artist, it draws rapt attention to pregnant pauses. “We will try to figure out how to best understand a concept in each of the disciplines,” says Pravin.

Maarten will lead the musical component of this improvised collaboration. “Once I understand what these themes mean to the artist or the dancer, and I become aware of what the visual component is, I respond to it and make music along with it,” he says.

This is the second iteration of the workshop. In its first run last year, the idea of an ‘interdisciplinary dictionary’ was proposed. The terms ‘counterpoint’, ‘pulse’, ‘accent’ among others were scrutinised across practices. “We are trying to put together a dictionary of inter-disciplinary terms, though it may not be an actual physical book, but online,” says Pravin.

“The word dynamic, for instance, can be explained in its musical sense — in terms of sound. For an actor, it is the use of volume — shouted vs whispered. The equivalent for a dancer would be to work with physicality: bigger or smaller gestures,” he explains.

This year, the participants will also work with a larger compositional idea of the graphic score. “Maarten and I do something called a score painting, where he designs a graphic score to a work of mine,” he says. It is music, written visually, along with the dancers’ movement translated on canvas. Maarten explains further, “We plot pitch, lower to higher against time, so the score goes left to right. The darker the markings are, the louder it gets.” For the score last year, he plotted music along with the dancers’ movements across an auditorium.

So the person creating the graphic score will have to work with both the dancer and the musician. The workshop this time, will enable participants to create their own mini scores. This could help provide them a critical starting point for the larger tasks of directing, choreographing or even scripting.

Dancers, theatre practitioners, and musicians interested in movement and visual languages can apply to this workshop, which will be held at Goethe-Institut from March 16-March 20, and March 23-March 25.

219,2020/03/05,Bharatanatyam exponent Malavika Sarukkai delineates the dualities,"Based on the Bhagwat Gita, in “The Battle Within”, Bharatanatyam exponent Malavika Sarukkai explores the constant tussle between confusion and clarity

Malavika Sarukkai’s art has often transcended the boundaries and grammars of Bharatanatyam and come to represent a wholesome interpretation of some of the most complex philosophical texts. She does not transcend these boundaries because they limit her, rather, it is striking to see how much more Bharatanatyam is capable of when it comes to truly be expressional. In her latest production called “The Battle Within”, Sarukkai undertakes the enormous task of rendering a dramatic interpretation inspired by the Bhagavat Gita. A creative work that works within and without the structures of Bharatanatyam, Sarukkai says that it is also a product (and process) of her own journey as a dancer and choreographer. “I try to reflect on where I am today. Bharatanatyam is singular, in a way, which is why I have called this a dramatic interpretation because it is not a margam or the rendering of two or three “items”. The overall patterns of Bharatanatyam work on different terrain. I want to say I went ahead with an intuition,” says Sarukkai.

The process, she says, has been a staggering one, wherein she explores the dualities of humankind through Arjuna and Krishna played by Sarukkai herself. The landscape itself has been treacherous and a deeply confusing one for her. “It has been full of high intensities, like you would climb atop a Himalayan peak and all you see are more peaks! There is a crisis in the beginning leading to further crises. Playing the two characters together is something I found daunting,” she adds. But Gita as a text is not new to her, and it was almost as if it was lingering in the background through her life, through her mother. Often, her mother would read passages to her and discuss the philosophy of the Gita with Sarukkai. A concluding thought she arrived at was this: “how do we become the right actor and take the right action?”

One wonders why she chose to play both characters herself.

“I think ‘intention’ is a terribly critical word for me. I find there is a constant tussle between confusion and clarity, that even if one finds clarity for a brief passing moment, one loses it easily too. It is the predicament of human life. When I began to explore the emotions of Arjuna, I understood that Krishna was not merely the charioteer of the vehicle but also Arjuna’s inner self. For instance, Arjuna has seen Krishna as both beautiful and terrible. He sees the vishwaroopam, his glory and undergoes a moment of vismaya or magic. But then, he decides to go into the battle anyway as the vengeful warrior. The revelation here is that one does not immediately transform the moment one sees the truth,” says Sarukkai.

Simply put, the battle of Kurukshetra is a battle of the self with the ego, the demonic and divine forces within oneself. Often, such works of art become extraordinarily taxing on the artiste’s mind too, and Sarukkai was not an exception. She claims that as the work progressed, there were moments of questions and doubts that crept into her mind, which she had to consistently resolve before taking a step further.

She says, “There were moments when I would feel completely disconnected and moments when it all came together. If I knew how much it would demand from me, I would have taken a few steps back because I have never done anything so raw and concentrated. These emotions were/are fierce, terrifying but also funneled.”

Personal discourse

Besides the obvious difficulty of playing two characters, a major one has been the different energy levels she has had to switch between. She also sees the two as masculine/feminine, self/ego, conscience/desires and the many other binaries of mankind, which often get blurred too. The discourse itself became predominantly personal for the artist. “Do we go beyond the Bhagavat Gita apart from looking at Arjuna as the warrior and Krishna as God? I do not think we do. To me, this resonates with the kind of chaotic mess that we are in and whether we are really capable of changing ourselves. Krishna is the moral compass here and our conscience,” adds Sarukkai.

In a highly stylised form, “The Battle Within” integrates visual inputs on 3D screens, extensive sound and light effects alongside Sarukkai’s choreography. She has collaborated with artist Sumantra Ghosal for the creation of the piece. The sound and light design are by Sai Shravanam and Niranjan Gokhale respectively, music by Murali Parthasarathy and costume by Sandhya Raman.

Opener Janneman Malan struck a sparkling unbeaten century to guide South Africa to a six-wicket win over Australia in the second ODI here on Wednesday which sealed 2-0 victory in the three-match series.

Australia, which chose to bat, was all out for 271 as Lungi Ngidi completed career-best figures of six for 58. Malan anchored the South African reply, taming his usual swashbuckling style to score 129 not out off 139 balls and lead the home side to victory with nine balls to spare.

As the Indian women’s cricket team gears up for its maiden T20 World Cup final, it has a piece of advise from Sachin Tendulkar — stay in the moment and be positive.

“Go out and give your best — that is what my message to them (is). Don’t take any pressure, though it is easier said than done.

“I genuinely want to tell them that just stay together, you don’t need to spend time with outside world. If you are in company of each other and keep talking positive things because good things have happened to our team,” Tendulkar said.

“I have been following their performances and they have inspired so many youngsters... It is about bringing laurels to our nation and you can come back (with the trophy). So many athletes in different fields have brought laurels to our nation, this would be another one. Go and enjoy yourself…” he said.

The former India captain was in Australia recently, when he met some of the players — including Shafali Verma. Reminiscing that meeting, Tendulkar said: “Co-incidentally, I was there next to the trophy, and few members were there from our women’s team.

223,2020/03/05,Women’s T20 World Cup | Sixth straight final for Australia,"South Africa falls short by five runs under DLS method

Four-time champion Australia used its rich big-match experience to surpass a spirited South Africa by five runs in a rain-hit semifinal here on Thursday, setting up a title clash against first-timer India. This is Australia’s sixth successive final out of the seven editions held so far.

There were fears that the second semifinal between Australia and South Africa at the SCG too will be washed out like the India and England match earlier in the day. But the weather improved just enough to get a game albeit a curtailed one.

Leading from the front

Australia skipper Meg Lanning led from the front with unbeaten 49 off as many balls to take her team to 134 for five in 20 overs. Rain returned during the innings break and South Africa was set a revised target of 98 runs in 13 overs as per the DLS method.

South Africa ended at 92 for five despite a fighting 41 not out off 27 balls from Laura Wolvaardt. South Africa was reeling at 24 for three before Wolvaardt and Sune Luus (21) brought their team back in the game with a quickfire 47-run stand. Wolvaardt, who smashed three sixes and two fours, had too much to do on her own.

Host Australia, which did not have the services of injured star allrounder Elysse Perry, was ecstatic after Jess Jonassen was able to defend 19 runs in the final over with South Africa getting only 13.

Extremely tense

“It was extremely tense. Even in the last couple of balls it just wasn’t safe. They needed 19 off the last over and we knew we had to nail it. But that’s T20 cricket for you,” said skipper Lanning.

On the final against India, she added: “India are a class side, they have been playing excellent cricket. We are going to have to play really well. We have been improving each day, it hasn’t been an easy road.

“We wanted to give ourselves a chance of playing in the finals, and now we just need to enjoy ourselves. We are travelling to Melbourne tomorrow, train on Saturday and play on Sunday. I doubt there’d be much sleep happening tonight.”

South Africa skipper Dane van Niekerk said her team tried its best. “... we have to give credit to Australia for the way they bowled and we just came six short.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/nzmj8n/article30993934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06AUSTRALIA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/womens-t20-world-cup-sixth-straight-final-for-australia/article30993935.ece

India’s men’s team skipper Virat Kohli congratulated the Harmanpreet Kaur-led women’s side for reaching its maiden final of the T20 World Cup in Australia, saying the outfit’s performance is something to be “proud” of.

The Indian women’s team advanced to the the summit clash owing to a superior group stage record, after the semifinal clash against England was abandoned without a ball being bowled at the Sydney Cricket Ground due to persistent rain.

“Congratulations to the Indian Women’s team on qualifying for the @T20WorldCup final. We are proud of you girls and wish you all the luck for the finals,” Kohli tweeted.

Former India opener Virender Sehwag also took to Twitter to wish the Indian side luck for the final which is scheduled to be played in Melbourne on Sunday.

225,2020/03/05,Bangladesh call up uncapped spinner for Zimbabwe T20s,"The two matches will be held here on March 9 and 11

Bangladesh has called up uncapped left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed for its 15-man squad for the upcoming two-match T20I series against Zimbabwe.

Wicketkeeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim and all-rounder Mohammad Saifuddin make a return to the squad, but selectors left out batsmen Mohammad Mithun and Nazmul Hossain, and pace bowler Rubel Hossain.

Mushfiqur skipped Bangladesh’s previous Twenty20 series in Pakistan over safety concerns, while Saifuddin has been out of action since July with a back injury.

Chief selector Minhajul Abedin said they called up 25-year old Ahmed as a back-up.

The two matches will be held here on March 9 and 11.

The squad:

Mahmudullah Riyad (Capt.), Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mohammad Naim, Liton Das, Mushfiqur Rahim, Afif Hossain, Mohammad Saifuddin, Mahadi Hasan, Aminul Islam, Mustafizur Rahman, Shafiul Islam, Al-Amin Hossain, Hasan Mahmud, and Nasum Ahmed.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bangladesh-call-up-uncapped-spinner-for-zimbabwe-t20s/article30993887.ece
226,2020/03/05,Mashrafe Mortaza steps down as Bangladesh ODI captain,"Says the decision to rebuild the team for the next World Cup had convinced him to step down

Bangladesh pace bowler Mashrafe Mortaza, one of the country’s biggest sports stars, stepped down as captain of the national one-day side on Thursday, possibly ending his international career.

Friday’s 50-over game against Zimbabwe here was his last as captain, said the 36-year-old, who already has a new career as a Member of Parliament.

Available for selection

Mashrafe said he would remain available for selection as a player, but selectors are under pressure to bring in fresh blood ahead of the 2023 World Cup in India.

“I would like to thank Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) for keeping confidence in me for such a long period,” said Mashrafe. “I will try to give my best as a player if I get the opportunity.”

Mashrafe had not played any ODI since last year’s World Cup until the current Zimbabwe series. He claimed three wickets in the first two matches.

Bangladesh won both matches to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series.

Mashrafe said the decision to rebuild the team for the next World Cup had convinced him to step down.

“Until yesterday I was undecided, but this morning I thought ‘that’s enough’,” he said.

Mashrafe, who has had seven operations on his knees, acknowledged that he had been lucky to play so long.

Cult status

The bowler has cult status in Bangladesh for his role in taking the team from being international whipping boys to becoming a respected limited-overs side.

He led Bangladesh to 49 wins in 87 matches, making him Bangladesh’s most successful one-day captain.

Mashrafe also led Bangladesh to 10 Twenty20 wins before retiring from the format in 2017.

227,2020/03/05,"Kieron Pollard, Phil Simmons can transform WI: Dinanath Ramnarine","They have the ability and leadership capacity, he says

West Indies cricket, famous once for flamboyance and flair with bat and ball, is now better known for T20 match-winners, apart from payment issues between players and the board, known as Cricket West Indies now.

Matters came to a head in 2014 when a touring West Indies team abandoned the series against India mid-way and returned home after pointing fingers at cricket’s national body for not keeping promises.

Leg-spinner Dinanath Ramnarine, better known in West Indies cricket circles as president, West Indies Players Association (WIPA), is of the view that respect and communication can dilute differences.

He added: “Respect on all sides is very important, there should be dialogue and proper communication. Once the two parties talk, players speak to the board and vice-versa and there is respect towards reaching a common goal of getting the team to perform, such things will not happen.”

Ramnarine was talking on the sidelines of the Unacademy Road Safety World Series cricket, featuring famous names from cricket’s past.

Voice for players

Post-retirement in 2002, he became a voice for players as the WIPA head for a decade.

Responding to a query if the talent emerging in West Indies cricket will ensure the team in maroon becomes a formidable force in future, the Trinidad-born said: “Talent has always been there, no question about that. It takes time to groom them. Governance is one aspect always been lacking significantly in sports generally, we in the West Indies have our own share of not-so-good people.”

Ramnarine adds: “The current captain Kieron Pollard is a fantastic leader. He and Phil Simmons (manager) bring a lot of positive things to the game, these are good guys. With time, these two have the ability, skill and leadership capacity to transform cricket in the West Indies.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/t6qz37/article30993687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06Dinanath2,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kieron-pollard-phil-simmons-can-transform-wi-dinanath-ramnarine/article30993688.ece

The Sri Lankan stalwarts Rangana Herath, Farveez Maharoof and Romesh Kaluwitharana asserted that past rivalries will be revived on the cricket pitch when teams from five nations face-off during the Unacademy Road Safety World Series T20 featuring legends.

India and West Indies will clash on Saturday while Sri Lanka will play against Australia on Sunday. The other participating team is South Africa.

Sri Lanka team captain Dilshan Tillekaratne and off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan were part of the squad which went down to India in the 2011 World Cup final at the Wankhede Stadium. Chamara Kapugedera also played in that game.

Herath said: “We have a pretty good side and though I am sure competition will be tough, we stand a good chance.”

Allrounder Maharoof said: “This is an amazing initiative, I thank the organisers for bringing us all together for a sport we love.”

229,2020/03/05,Women’s T20 World Cup: India advances to final,"India had topped Group A with four victories while England had finished second in Group B

An unbeaten run in the group stage propelled India into its maiden Women’s T20 World Cup final after its last-four clash against England was washed out here on Thursday. India will take on holder Australia — which defeated South Africa by five runs in another rain-hit semifinal — in the final on Sunday which happens to be International Women’s Day.

Persistent rain

Persistent rain since morning delayed the toss and eventually the semifinal was called off without a ball being bowled, leaving England players in tears. “Really frustrating. Not how we wanted the World Cup to finish for us. No reserve day, no chance of getting play, and ultimately that loss against South Africa cost us,” a dejected England captain Heather Knight said after the game was abandoned.

Her India counterpart Harmanpreet Kaur also agreed that the semifinals should have had a reserve day, a request which was made by host Cricket Australia but turned down by the ICC. “Unfortunate we didn’t get a game, but there are rules and we have to follow it. Having reserve days in the future will be a great idea,” said Harmanpreet.

Paying the price

Knight said her team paid the price for not starting the tournament well. “It’s all very English isn’t it?,” talking about the weather and getting knocked out. “It felt that we gained a bit of momentum in the last few games and we were pumped up for the semifinals,” she added.

“Lessons are to win the first game I guess (laughs). It’s become a trend, not to start well in tournaments, and that has cost us.” England had ended runner-up in the previous edition.

India had topped Group A with four victories in as many matches while England had finished second in Group B with three wins and a defeat.

“From day one, we knew we have to win all the games because in case the semis don’t happen, that would be hard for us. In that sense, credit to the team for winning all the games,” said Harmanpreet.

“Everybody is looking in great touch — Shafali (Verma) and Smriti (Mandhana). They are giving us good starts, and that helps. Me and Smriti are trying to spend more time in the nets,” she added reflecting on her and Mandhana’s so far indifferent form.

“We are looking more positive now. Unfortunately we haven’t come up with big innings, but our teammates are, and at the end of the day it’s a team game.”

Oshane Thomas snared five wickets to guide the West Indies to a 25-run win in the first Twenty20 Cricket International against Sri Lanka on Wednesday after Lendl Simmons set the platform with an unbeaten half-century as the visitors tallied 196-4.

Opener Simmons hit 67 from 51 balls, including seven boundaries and two sixes, after the West Indies won the toss and elected to bat. He got good support from Andre Russell, who plundered four sixes in a 14-ball 35, and Keiron Pollard (34).

Thomas bowled short and with pace, taking three wickets in the second over to have Sri Lanka reeling at 17-3 after dismissing Avishka Fernando (7), Shehan Jayasuriya (0) and Kusal Mendis (0) within four deliveries.

Opener Janneman Malan struck a sparkling unbeaten century to guide South Africa to a six-wicket win over Australia in the second one-day international in Bloemfontein on Wednesday which sealed victory in the series.

Australia won the toss and chose to bat, posting 271 all out as South Africa seamer Lungi Ngidi completed career-best figures of 6-58 on a slow wicket to halt what had been an electric start from the visitors.

Malan, who was out to the first ball of the match on debut on Saturday, anchored the South African reply, taming his usual swashbuckling style to score 129 not out from 139 balls and lead the home side to victory with nine balls to spare.

Australia made a fast start to their innings, racing to 50 in the seventh over before David Warner (35) became the first victim for Ngidi, who later dismissed Steve Smith (13) and Marnus Labuschagne in consecutive balls.

Aaron Finch (69) looked fluent in the early part of his innings, but when South Africa strangled his scoring areas, he edged Anrich Nortje to wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock trying a flamboyant drive.

D'Arcy Short (69) put on 66 for the fifth wicket with Mitchell Marsh (36), and when they fell, Ngidi returned to mop up the lower order as Australia added only 49 runs for the loss of six wickets in the final 10 overs.

South Africa lost key batsman De Kock for nought to the third ball of their reply, the left-hander having his stumps shattered by Mitchell Starc for the third time in five innings.

But Malan, who has not been selected for South Africas ODI tour of India later this month, and JJ Smuts (41) put on a patient 91 in 20.1 overs to edge the home side closer to their target.

In-form Heinrich Klaasen added a run-a-ball 51 that provided momentum when it was needed, and David Miller (37 not out from 29 balls) joined Malan to finish off a record chase in ODIs at the Mangaung Oval as the hosts reached 274 for four in 48.3 overs.

234,2020/03/05,Six-storey parking complex to come up on R.K.V. Road,"Traffic movement disrupted as people park vehicles on road

The city is all set to get its first multi-level parking complex near Nethaji Market on R.K.V. Road as the Erode Corporation is in the process of appointing a consultant to prepare a detailed project report for the same.

Daily vegetable market, textile showrooms, commercial establishments, provisional stores and wholesalers of various products are located on R.K.V. Road, making it one of the busy roads in the city. But, in the absence of parking facilities, vehicles are parked on the road disrupting traffic.

As there are no pedestrian pathways on the stretch, the people walk on the road. There has been a demand to establish a multi-level parking complex in the area so that shoppers do not search for parking space or go for unauthorised parking.

Under the Smart City Mission, the Corporation has proposed to establish the six-storey complex in which two floors will be allotted for car parking while four floors will be for two-wheeler parking. Since hundreds of two-wheelers and autorickshaws carrying goods to the daily vegetable market are being parked on the road every day causing inconvenience to other road users, the complex aims at creating an efficient and durable infrastructure in the available space in the market area.

The consultant should conduct traffic surveys to estimate the number of trucks, lorries and other vehicles entering the market and also project vehicles for 20 years. The consultant should prepare feasibility report and detailed project report for construction of the complex including designs, drawings, bid documents and cost estimates as per specifications.

Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan told The Hindu that after the construction of the complex on R.K.V. Road and the proposed shopping complex near Kalaimadu Statue, both would have space to accommodate 500 cars and 5,000 two-wheelers. “Both the parking spaces will solve the parking issues in the busy areas in the city,” he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/4ysa44/article30994262.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA06PARKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/six-storey-parking-complex-to-come-up-on-rkv-road/article30994263.ece

The pots made of terracotta are of varying sizes for dogs, cows and birds and have special coating to prevent formation of algae. Animal lovers and volunteers can reach out to the SPCA for the pots.

Sanjay Tanesh, general secretary of the SPCA, says the initiative is taken up after the Water for Voiceless led a similar initiative for stray animals in Bengaluru, Delhi and Chennai. “As the heat soars, stray animals become aggressive. It is important that water is made available to them, as there are no tangible sources of water in the already dried up water bodies,” says Mr.Tanesh.

Those registering with the SPCA will be given two pots, one for dogs and one for cows. Based on the demand, pots will be ordered from the potters in the vicinity or sourced and distributed locally. As a proof of usage, photos of the location of the pot and animals drinking water from it will have to be sent to the SPCA, says Tanesh.

The initiate is interest-driven, and in Phase I, Water for Voiceless has provided 100 terracotta pots to the SPCA. The SPCA is headed by the District Collector, who is the chairperson. It was dormant for long and was revived under Collector S.Prabhakar, a veterinary doctor himself.

The public may contact Mr. Tanesh on 97913 81308 or 96262 95650 to register to get the free pots. Also, companies and donors are invited to contribute to the initiative of the SPCA in its vaccination programmes, says Mr.Tanesh.

Coimbatore District (Rural) Police are awaiting DNA analysis results of ten blood samples to trace the identity of a suspected second perpetrator involved in the sexual assault-cum-murder of a seven-year-old girl from a village near Thudiyalur in March 2019.

Blood samples of the 10 persons were collected at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital recently and sent to a Government forensic science laboratory in Chennai for the DNA test as per court's direction.

The police approached the court to conduct the DNA analysis after forensic findings indicated the presence of two semen samples in the victim's body including that of Santhosh Kumar (32) of Thondamuthur, the lone convict in the case so far.

The special court for cases registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act had awarded death sentence on Kumar on December 27, 2019.

The court ordered a further investigation into the case after the girl mother filed a petition pointing out the forensic findings.

Following court's direction, Coimbatore rural superintendent of Police Sujit Kumar had appointed inspector G. Anandanayagi to investigate the case under the supervision of Additional Deputy Superintendent of Police G.S. Anitha.

As per the earlier investigation conducted by the police, Kumar single-handedly committed the crime at his grandmother's house in the neighbourhood of the girl on March 25. Kumar had been staying with his aged grandmother to take care of her. He hid the girl's body inside house and dumped it in the neighbourhood in the early hours of March 26.

A 30-year-old tusker died on Thursday in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) after suffering a fall and injuring one of its hind legs.

Forest Department officials said that the animal had come to the Moyar River in the Singara Forest Range near the Northern Hay Anti-Poaching Camp, when it is believed to have suffered a fall and injured itself on some rocks near the river.

Forest staff noticed that the animal was unable to move on Wednesday and began efforts to give medical treatment. They also brought three kumki elephants from the Theppakadu Elephant Camp, along with an earth mover to try to help get the animal back onto its feet on Wednesday, but their efforts proved unsuccessful.

K.K.Kaushal, field director, MTR, said that they had also given the animal some food. “It was doing well and was feeding on Wednesday,” he said.

Forest staff set up camp near to the animal and decided to renew their efforts to treat and rescue the animal on Thursday. However, it died early on Thursday morning, officials said.

S. Kanthan, forest range officer, Singara Range, said that more than 40 people were involved in the efforts to try and rescue the animal. “We suspect that the elephant could have suffered a fall or it was injured in a fight with another elephant,” he said.

Following the completion of the postmortem, the carcass was buried.

239,2020/03/05,Drone to prevent poaching and forest fires in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve,"Purchased at a cost of ₹9.6 lakh, it will be an important surveillance tool

A drone, fitted with a camera, is being used to help the Forest Department track and fight forest fires, prevent poaching and help in mitigating human-animal conflicts in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR).

K.K. Kaushal, field director, MTR, told The Hindu that the state-of-the-art drone camera, purchased at a cost of ₹9.6 lakh, will prove to be a very important surveillance tool in the tiger reserve.

“It will be deployed in a variety of roles, to monitor the extent of forest fires, as a surveillance tool to prevent illegal entry into reserve forests by poachers and also during instances of human-animal conflict,” he said.

Forest officials said that the drone, which has a range of eight km and which can fly at an altitude of 800m above the ground, will be tested in the tiger reserve in the coming weeks.

“During this season, we expect that it will be used primarily to monitor forest fires,” said an official, adding that the use of the technology will improve the efficacy of the Forest Department in identifying the location where the fire first started.

“As this will improve our response time, we will stand a better chance of finding the source of the fire, whether it was natural or man-made, and even catch persons who may start fires on purpose,” said the official. It could also be used to remotely track the location of an animal from a safe distance, he added.

K. Periyasamy, assistant conservator of forests, has been tasked with imparting training to the forest rangers and field staff at the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve to use the drone cameras effectively.

Training has already begun, with lessons on how to use the drone taught alongside other training modules in preventing forest fires in both the core and buffer zones of the tiger reserve, officials said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/2kwn3j/article30994175.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB06DRONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/drone-to-prevent-poaching-and-forest-fires-in-mudumalai-tiger-reserve/article30994176.ece

241,2020/03/05,Reliance acquisition of SKDS to inspire local entrepreneurs,"The announcement by Reliance Retail that it has acquired Shri Kannan Departmental Store (SKDS) is seen as an inspiration to regional retailers and also as an indication of the consolidations happening across sectors.

According to Kumar Rajagopalan, Chief Executive Officer of Retailers’ Association of India, such acquisitions will create new opportunities and inspire regional retail brands.

V. Lakshminarayanaswamy, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, Reliance probably found this as an opportunity to expand its retail presence in the State. This is also an indication that consolidations have started happening across sectors - manufacturing and retail. If there is a good value chain and a sustainable model, acquisitions happen, even in the retail sector. However, this can also mean that such consolidations will force small-scale traders to build their own unique models to sustain. They are already facing challenges due to increasing online trading and consolidations will add to their challenges, he said.

President of TiE Coimbatore Hemalatha Annamalai said, “This goes to prove that even unconventional regional businesses can attract national players.” Such acquisitions are an opportunity for entrepreneurs to try new initiatives.

According to the website of SKDS, it was started in 1985 as Sangeetha Shopping Centre, a departmental store, in Erode. It was developed into a mega departmental store in 1999 under the name Shri Kannan Departmental Store. It has branches in several cities, including Pollachi, Tiruppur, and Karur.

Sources in the retail sector said the acquisition only shows that there is lot of scope for growth of retail sector if value is created, even in smaller cities.

248,2020/03/05,"Yet again, Corporation reluctant to reply to RTI queries","City resident seeks copies of the order passed by the Corporation Commissioner to engage private vehicles on contract

Sharing the details of vehicles the Coimbatore Corporation officials use may pose a threat to their safety. Therefore, the details sought for cannot be given, says the reply by a Corporation officer in response to an RTI query.

The query, filed by S.P. Thiyagarajan, a GRG Nagar resident, in March 2019, sought copies of the order passed by the Corporation Commissioner to engage private vehicles on contract for the civic body’s work.

The query was the fourth in the series of four questions that he had sought for from the Assistant Commissioner (administration). The other three were – the list of vehicles the Corporation owns, their details; which of the officers use those vehicles; and, copies of the Commissioner’s order authorising such use.

Replying to the questions, the Assistant Commissioner in May that year says the Commissioners have, over the years, allotted vehicles based on need. After furnishing details of five vehicles, the officer adds that with the passage of time and transfers of officials, the incumbents continued to use the vehicles.

The officer then forwards the RTI query for the city engineer reply saying the details sought for concerned the engineering wing. The city engineer furnishes a list of 291 vehicles, including 32 cars, sports utility vehicles and others used by officials and forwards the RTI query to the health wing saying the fourth query concerned the wing.

After receiving the queries, the petitioner, Mr. Thiyagarajan, has appealed to the Deputy Commissioner saying the city health officer has failed to furnish copies of the Commissioner's order and that the reply was beyond the mandated 30-day period; and, therefore, the officer should furnish the copies at no cost.

Commenting on the replies given by the officials, he says that while he sought for copies of order, all that the officer gave him was a prevaricated reply.

Dissatisfied, Mr. Thiyagarajan in January 2020 files another RTI query to the Assistant Commissioner – accounts seeking copies of the bills for the Corporation spending ₹ 53.96 crore towards maintenance of its vehicles from 2014 to 2018.

The officer then forwards the query to the Assistant Commissioners of the five zones asking them to share the details. In response to the query, only Assistant Commissioners from the North and West Zones have replied – not by furnishing the copies of the bills but by merely giving a year-wise break-up of the money spent towards vehicle maintenance.

Mr. Thiyagarajan says this only shows the Corporation's reluctance to share basic details with tax payers and its obdurate functioning. He sought the details because he felt ₹ 53.96 crore, as mentioned in Corporation budgets, was way to high and for the money the civic body could have bought new vehicles.

A Corporation officer explains that the maintenance charge include fuel charges and therefore it appears high.

If that be the case, why is it that the Corporation refuses to share the details, he retorts.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/yet-again-corporation-reluctant-to-reply-to-rti-queries/article30985145.ece

254,2020/03/05,HC rejects plea against govt. compensation,"‘Court won’t interfere in policy decision’

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday said there was “nothing wrong” with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s decision to announce compensation for victims of the recent riots in north-east Delhi.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar declined to entertain a PIL which had challenged the compensation announced by the Delhi government, saying “it is a policy decision” and “we will not interfere in it”.

The court said, “This is not a compensation given on fault basis. The compensation is being awarded on a no-fault basis. There is nothing wrong with it.”

The petitioner, BJP leader and former MLA Nand Kishore Garg, contended that victims of the riots should be first identified before payment of compensation to ensure those who “perpetrated” the violence do not get the relief.

The Bench disagreed with the contention, saying if the petitioner’s suggestion was accepted, then the scheme “would become totally unworkable”.

“It would be impossible to implement,” the court said, adding that it was a policy decision of the Delhi government and “we will be extremely slow in interfering with it”. “We expect the Delhi government’s assistance scheme for helping riot victims will be for assistance of riot victims only...

255,2020/03/05,Lawyers ask police chief to ensure accused get legal access,"‘Lawyers for Detainees’ set up camps across north-east Delhi

A group of lawyers on Wednesday wrote to the Delhi Commissioner of Police seeking legal access to those under arrest or in custodial detention following violence that erupted in north-east Delhi last week. The request comes after reports surfaced that several lawyers were denied information of detainees.

“Take all measures to ensure that the right of access to legal counsel for persons under arrest or custodial detention is honoured and that strict remedial action is taken against any further illegal deprivations of this invaluable Constitutional and statutory rights,” read the letter.

The letter from the lawyers also said: “We write this letter as an expression of our grave concern and deep anguish at the present state of affairs in which the fundamental right of access to legal counsel, the cornerstone of our Constitutional promise to ensure justice for all, is being wilfully eviscerated by the State.”

Meanwhile, lawyers’ collective ‘Lawyers for Detainees’ have set up legal aid camps in areas of north-east Delhi, including Mustafabad and Indira Vihar.

Mishika Singh, a lawyer who is part of the collective, said on Twitter: “In the last four days, we have initiated legal work for over 500 people in various capacities like processing of compensation forms, recording damage to property and injury to self, filing of complaints, pursuing missing persons reports and so on.”

“Apart from this, lawyers in the field are also helping with legal work in hospitals — getting their MLCs, making sure post-mortems are conducted as per law, bodies are released on time. We are stretched beyond imagination but there is satisfaction in the work that is being done,” Ms. Singh added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lawyers-ask-police-chief-to-ensure-accused-get-legal-access/article30985984.ece

Around 3 p.m., Education Minister Manish Sisodia entered a classroom of a government girls school in Jaffrabad, where a parents-teachers meeting was on going. The Minister smiled at students and parents before he asked: “The students are looking a little tense. Are you all fine?”

Many replied “yes” with a weak smile.

On Wednesday, Mr. Sisodia interacted with students and parents in three government schools in riot-hit areas of north-east Delhi and assured students that there will be peace and urged them to focus on studies.

Inside the classroom, as Mr. Sisodia asked 16-year-old Izna Khan whether there was violence in her mohalla, she replied in the affirmative. “We just want our citizenship. nothing else,” Ms. Khan, who lives in Seelampur, told the Minister.

Mr. Sisodia then asked 15-year-old Fatima Bi: “Were you afraid?”, to which Fatima replied that she was “a little” scared. “You are not afraid now, right?” he later asked, to which she shook her head.

“Everything will be peaceful... you concentrate on your studies and your families,” the Minister told the students. Before leaving, he told the teacher present in the class that counselling should be done for students, if required.

“The parents are still a little afraid but most of them said that they will send students for examinations,” the teacher told Mr. Sisodia.

“There was heavy stone pelting in our area but they did not burn any houses,” Fatima later told The Hindu. The teenager said that it was good that the Minister was visiting schools as it sent a message to them that things were “peaceful”.

“I told the Minister about NRC that we only want our citizenship. We do not have any problem with Modi ji,” Ms. Khan said. “She is just a child,” her father said as he put his arm around her outside the classroom.

The Delhi government had organised the special parent-teacher meeting in the riot-affected areas with a motive to restore confidence in students.

“The students were told that if they miss the CBSE board exam on March 7, they can appear for it later. For new dates, they can contact their schools after March 7,” an official statement read.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sisodia-visits-schools-assures-students-of-peace-security/article30985976.ece
257,2020/03/05,"AAP MLAs of riot-hit areas sit with victims, appeal for peace","Legislators talk to locals, hear grievances; visit relief camp in Mustafabad

At 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, AAP Seelampur MLA Abdul Rehman rushed out of his house and made his way through the narrow lanes of Jaffrabad to reach his car parked on the main road. “[Deputy Chief Minister] Manish Sisodia ji has reached,” he told his aide, as they got into the vehicle.

Mr. Rehman is one of the three AAP MLAs of the riot-hit north-east Delhi. Mustafabad MLA Mohammad Yunus was “down with fever”, and Gokalpuri MLA Surendra Kumar was on his way back to the area from Rouse Avenue court where he had gone in the morning.

As the car stopped outside the government school in Jaffrabad, Mr. Rehman jumped out to meet Mr. Sisodia, who spent about 15 minutes in a school talking to students and parents.

After the Minister left, the AAP MLA spent a further 20 minutes talking to the people, and asked them not to believe any rumours. He then left for his house.

Around 3.30 pm, Mr. Kumar joined the Deputy Chief Minister for a visit to a school in Gokalpuri. He left soon after Mr. Sisodia departed.

Consoling the bereaved

At 4.45 p.m., Mr. Yunus left his house in Mustafabad as he was “feeling better”.

He got off his vehicle near street number 5 of Babu Nagar. Inside the narrow street lined with open drains, an under-construction building was being used as a site for public viewing of Jamaludeen, who was killed in the riots.

“The MLA will get you the ₹1 lakh on Thursday and the rest ₹9 lakh will be deposited in the bank account. Do not worry, the MLA will take care of everything,” a man standing next to Mr. Yunus told Kamaludeen, the brother of the deceased.

“The situation is under control but things are not completely over,” the MLA told the people gathered in the area.

After spending 10 minutes consoling the family members, the MLA told the gathering: “Any time you need any help, you can call me. I will come.”

“Jamaludeen was killed by the son of an ex-BJP councillor. They killed him with swords and knives,” Mr. Yunus told The Hindu. as he left the area.

By 5.20 p.m., Mr. Yunus reached the relief camp in Idgah ground in Mustafabad, where the other two AAP MLAs were already present.

“We have been working a lot since the violence began. On February 24, we were in touch with the DCP and other police officers. It was not safe for us to go out. From February 25, we have been in touch with the people,” said the Gokalpuri MLA, when asked whether they were visiting people in riot-hit areas apart from the camps.

“On Tuesday, [Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Pal] Gautam ji was here and we met people in different areas. We are asking people about their problems and talked to them about brotherhood,” Mr. Kumar added.

Seeing the overcrowded camp, Mr. Rehman discussed solutions with a volunteer. “We are making IDs for the people who have taken refuge here, and also for the volunteers. Others will not be allowed to enter the camp,” said the MLA as a volunteer introduced Mr. Rehman to a reporter.

By 6 p.m. it started to get dark at the camp, Mr. Rehman and Mr. Yunus sat on plastic chairs surrounded by volunteers discussing the situation in the area.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/c6onvf/article30985971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5DECAMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-mlas-of-riot-hit-areas-sit-with-victims-appeal-for-peace/article30985972.ece
258,2020/03/05,"Delhi Violence | Garhi Mendu residents ‘agree to forget past’, return to village","Decision taken at a peace meeting, but questions about the incident remain

Members of the Muslim community of Garhi Mendu village, who fled after locals (in some cases their neighbours) allegedly started attacking them on February 24 when riots engulfed north-east Delhi, agreed to return to the village after a peace meeting between village elders from both communities on Wednesday. The meeting was facilitated by the local administration.

On the street opposite the village pradhan’s house, where the meeting took place, only one building was gutted and it reportedly belonged to a Muslim family. The same pattern could be witnessed at buildings throughout the village. Houses of Muslims were gutted, many with their doors broke open and looted.

List of perpetrators

Most members of the Muslim community here maintained that the violence was carried out by locals. At a relief camp in nearby Shri Ram Colony where hundreds fled to, many with nothing but only clothes, residents had even made a list of at least 40 people from the village who were allegedly involved in the violence.

“But no one wants to take names. They know that things won’t get spoilt now, so what’s the point?” said Mohammed Farzan, whose family had returned to the village after a week.

There was, however, counter-claims about the incident. “A majority of us rented out our old homes – many to Muslim families – after moving to the new village. Why would we want the atmosphere to be vitiated and make our rental income a thing of the past?” asked Jai Gurjar, a local resident.

Located across the main road from the New Garhi Mendu village — which came into existence to compensate mostly Gurjars of the Old Garhi Mendu village for their flood-prone properties — the village chief, Bikhari Pradhan, said a few of the 15-odd Muslim homes in the village happened to be among the oldest ones in the area.

“There are around 15 Muslim homes in the village – some which are owned by those who live in them and others which were rented to other Muslim families– which have been damaged. We were living like one family earlier and will do so in the future,” he said.

Outsider claim

“It was around midnight of February 25 when I witnessed a mob enter the village from the main road and later set houses on fire. I couldn’t recognise anyone...which means that they were outsiders...they did what they wanted to do and then left. They seem to have come with adequate planning. They knew which homes belonged to Muslims,” he claimed.

However, according to many Muslim families who had fled the area, the worst incidents happened on February 24.

Meanwhile, a vehicle with some of the Muslim elders from the village pulled up outside the residence as preparations for the peace meeting gathered steam. At the meeting, overseen by Seelampur SDM Ajay Arora, the official encouraged the formation of “Aman Committee” which could meet regularly to ensure that the situation in the village remained calm and any rumours were quickly quelled.

Accordingly, a committee of 18 people with members from both communities was formed. However, no date for their next meeting was set.

With regard to catching the perpetrators of violence, who the displaced Muslim residents said were locals, Mr. Arora said that inquiries would be conducted and they would be arrested.

He also informed that boards would be put up across the village with contact information of the area SHO as well as the beat constable. He also assured that street lights which were reportedly broken during the riots would be fixed at the earliest.

Members of the Hindu community said that they would help the Muslim residents rehabilitate and would provide extra beds and other materials if needed. In an odd turn of talks, village elders of both the communities agreed that the women of their communities “had to be kept in check” if peace were to be maintained.

“If there are any problems, we are there and we can sort them out,” said one of them.

“Whatever happened has happened. We all have to live together after all,” said another member at the meeting.

Asked whether matters could be settled quickly, standing outside his two-storey house which was brunt and looted, Talib, a resident said: “What else are we going to do? It is our land..We are helpless. At least if we can come back, then the poor people in the neighbourhood might get some confidence to come as well.”

With walls of the houses brunt from inside and ash from furniture all over the place, he and his family are unlikely to reside here anytime soon.

With regard to bringing the perpetrators of violence, Farzan said “Insaf ka toh dekho.. ummed hai [About justice, there’s only hope].”

“There are many Muslim families here; let them stay or make them go – we don’t care. But as long as they stay here, they must put up with the peace that we are willing to offer, not the kind they demand,” a resident said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/evskko/article30985959.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5DEMENDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/garhi-mendu-residents-agree-to-forget-past-return-to-village/article30985960.ece
259,2020/03/05,Police Commissioner avoids questions on AAP councillor Tahir Hussain,"Lookout notice soon against AAP leader: police

Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava on Wednesday avoided answering questions regarding the role of the Delhi Police in ‘rescuing’ Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain from his residence in Chandbagh during the riots last week.

Mr. Shrivastava had gone to Parliament to brief Home Minister Amit Shah about the law and order situation in north-east Delhi.

During a press conference on Tuesday, Additional Commissioner of Police Ajit Kumar Singla had said that on February 24, around 11 p.m., some people had informed the police about a councillor being stuck and feeling insecure, and Mr. Hussain was later rescued.

Within an hour of the press conference, the Delhi Police issued a clarification stating that Mr. Hussain “did not require rescuing” that night. “News of the councillor being stuck was received by the police but upon investigation it was found that the councillor was safe in his house,” the police stated.

The police registered four FIRs against Mr. Hussain on February 25. In the first FIR, registered at Dayalpur police station, the councillor has been charged under murder, rioting and arson. In the second FIR, he has been charged under rioting and destruction of evidence. The third FIR has been registered at Khajoori Khas and has charged the councillor under attempt to murder. The fourth FIR charges him under rioting and arson.

The FIR in Khajoori Khas police station was registered on the complaint of a policeman, which mentions that miscreants were throwing stones and petrol bombs from the terrace of Mr. Hussain’s residence.

“We have also moved a file for issuing a lookout circular against Mr. Hussain to prevent him from escaping abroad. The order may be issued by [Wednesday]night,” said a police officer.

Shahrukh taken to Shamli

Meanwhile, the Delhi police on Wednesday took Shahrukh Khan, who has been arrested for firing at a policeman during the riots, to Shamli for recovery of the pistol, car and mobile phone used by him during the crime. The pistol is yet to be recovered, added the police.

An officer said they are also verifying whether any police cases are registered against him outside of Delhi.

Meanwhile, a Delhi court on Wednesday deferred till Thursday the hearing of the anticipatory bail application of the suspended AAP councillor.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4b2z1z/article30985954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5DEPC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/police-commissioner-avoids-questions-on-aap-councillor-tahir-hussain/article30985955.ece
260,2020/03/05,Unclean toilet at camp adds to woes of displaced women,"The makeshift bathroom is nothing but a tent covered by cloth on three sides

Rukhsar*, a 14-year-old Class IX student and a resident of Sherpur Chowk, had shifted to the Idgah ground in Mustafabad on Tuesday along with many others from her locality. As she was menstruating, she was provided sanitary napkins and innerwear. But that didn’t solve the problem. The biggest worry for many like her was to find a place to change.

“It is embarrassing. Once I went to change at the makeshift bathroom where all the women and children bathe. Another woman walked in and I didn’t know how to react. There are hundreds of us here using that one tent,” she said.

Rukhsar said that once she went to a local neighbour outside the Idgah ground. “I had to tell the woman that I needed to change. It was embarrassing because we don’t usually tell anyone about it. It is not considered good,” she said.

However, the women are still filled with gratitude because “this is the only option they have”.

Sameena (38), mother of three, said that her date is due in three-four days and she is worried. “We don’t go to the two public toilets set up for women outside the ground. Men are outside all the time and it doesn’t feel good,” she said, adding that she prefers walking out of the ground to a local’s house to urinate or defecate.

Rifat Khatoon is four months pregnant. At the relief camp, her strategy to ensure minimum usage of toilet is eat and drink less.

“Because of pregnancy, I have to use the toilet a number of times and it’s tough for me to keep walking out. I try not to eat and drink much,” she said.

Unhygienic conditions

When this reporter visited the makeshift bathroom, which is nothing but a tent covering three sides against the wall, someone had openly defecated and a woman was bathing her two children there. Right next to the bathroom lay a mattress where women were sitting.

“It is so dirty. We are living together and people should take care of the hygiene as well,” said a woman, who did not wish to be identified.

Recalling the violence, Rifat said that she, along with others like Sameena, Rukhsar, Gulafsha and Gulshan from Sherpur Chowk, fled their houses on Monday evening when their neighbours’ houses were being burnt by a mob.

“We hopped from one terrace to the other and finally reached a house which was inhabited by Hindus. They sheltered us safely for a couple of hours and then ensured we reached Mustafabad safely,” said Gulafsha.

“We are grateful to everyone who is helping us but living in the relief camps is tough, especially for women. We just want to go home,” she lamented. There are also regular announcements that mothers should take their daughters wherever they go for their own safety.

In the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, women from different NGOs were seen informing the inhabitants of relief camps about usage of their dupattas and ensuring cleanliness.

A joint delegation of representatives of mass outfits has urged the Haryana government to take immediate steps to prevent any untoward incident from happening in light of threats to Muslim families in Bahadurgarh’s Nikhil Vihar to vacate their homes before Holi.

The delegation, comprising former CPM State secretary Inderjit Singh, Kisan Sabha’s Capt. Shamsher Malik, and Janwadi Mahila Samiti’s Savita and Munmun, among others, on Wednesday submitted a memorandum to Rohtak Divisional Commissioner, which sought immediate identification of communal elements, installation of streetlights in the colony, and request to the Delhi government to deploy adequate police force to restore the minority community’s feeling of security.

The delegation had visited the colony on Tuesday and spoke to affected families. They found that some families had already left the village while others had sent away their children.

The report prepared by the delegation expressed surprise and anguish that streetlights were not installed even three days after the incident, and that the Delhi Police had not tried to identify any of the roughly 50 men that had threatened the families.

In less than 18 months since its launch, the city bus service, run by the Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited (GMCBL), has achieved a cumulative ridership of two crore passengers this past month.

Making an announcement, GMCBL Chief Executive Officer Sonal Goel on Tuesday said, the bus service achieved the feat on February 23. Currently, the city bus service, called “Gurugaman”, has a fleet of 154 buses plying on 18 routes.

It was in 2017 that GMCBL was conceptualised as a Special Purpose Vehicle project by the Haryana State Government with shareholding from Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, and Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation. Chief Minister Manohar Lal had launched the service on September 2, 2018.

Special drives have been undertaken under the guidance of Ms. Goel to promote safe and fearless travel for women, including Women Special Service, the CEO herself taking a ride on the bus, pasting Women Helpline 1091 stickers and ‘You are under CCTV surveillance’ stickers inside buses.

“From February 2020, we are ferrying an average of 583 passengers per bus which compares very favourably to the most efficient U.S. transit systems. In February 2020, bus routes 111A, 215B, 111B, 134B and 238 carried more than 600 passengers per bus,” said Ms. Goel, a 2008-batch IAS officer.

263,2020/03/05,"City pharmacy owners face shortage of masks, sanitisers","Will look into reports of products being sold at higher rates: CM

Pharmacies across the Capital have seen a huge rush over the last two days with customers queuing up to buy masks and hand sanitisers as measures to protect themselves from COVID-19. Pharmacies across the city have run out of stock of N95 masks and hand sanitisers while many who have stock are selling them at inflated rates.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the Delhi government had enough stock of N95 masks but added that he would look into reports of them being sold at inflated prices in private shops.

“Almost 90% of the people in a day are either here for sanitisers or masks. They are also emphasising on the 60% alcohol content in sanitisers,” said Jaswinder Pal Singh of Preet Medicos in Khan Market. The signage at the entrance of his shop — ‘No Masks, No sanitisers’ — went unnoticed as visitors poured in to purchase the same. He added that preventive medicines for cold and fever are available on a limited basis.

“The lack of suggested N95 is pushing people to choose from low-quality cloth mask and surgical 3-ply mask which have been declared ineffective to fight the deadly virus. People are not even asking for the price of the masks. Expensive pieces worth ₹2,500 each are getting sold,” said Vishal of Fortis Healthworld here.

Pharmacy owners say that sudden rise in the demand of products is forcing them to sell them at inflated prices, at times even higher than the marked price.

“The earlier sale of sanitiser was one bottle in two days. Yesterday, I sold 30 bottles in less than an hour and turned away almost 30 people because we weren’t able to get it from the distributor,” said Satish Singh Chauhan of Sri Ram Medicos at Kotla market.

Addressing the growing fears over the spread of COVID-19, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal urged the public not to panic and to take precautionary measures and avoid public places.

Addressing the media at the Secretariat, Mr. Kejriwal said that efforts are on to check and screen 88 people who came in contact with the Delhi man who has tested positive for COVID-19 and that a State-level task force headed by him has been formed to tackle the situation.

“We are concerned about the situation, but there is no need to panic. We are doing whatever we can to control the COVID-19 from spreading... members of all the important departments in Delhi, State officials, and police officers have been included in the task force,” he said.

Isolation wards in 19 government and six private hospitals that were equipped to deal with swine flu are being prepared in case of need for isolation wards, Mr. Kejriwal said.

Testing lab

He added that apart from the two available testing centres, COVID-19 testing lab will be set up at Lady Hardinge Hospital and also at Lok Nayak Hospital, if necessary.

The Chief Minister said that 1,16,579 patients have been screened at the airport by thermal scanners and if any passenger shows symptoms, they will be referred to RML Hospital. The municipal corporations and the New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC), he said, have been given the task of contacting and screening tourists who have arrived from countries where cases of COVID-19 have been reported.

The teams, he said, would visit hotels and guest houses in the city to ensure that none of them have developed any symptoms after reaching Delhi.

Residents of Delhi who have not shown symptoms after landing from the four most-affected countries would also be screened as symptoms can show up after a period of 14 days, Mr. Kejriwal said.

The Chief Minister appealed to Delhiites to come together to fight corona outbreak just as they came together to fight dengue and brought down the number of cases in the city last year.

He said the Education Department would spread awareness regarding the threat of the virus.

265,2020/03/05,Seeking the truth,"Great masters go beyond their personality when they hit the highest point of self realisation and enlightenment even as a river loses its individuality and gains totality when it merges with the ocean. Krishna, representing the Truth, transcends the historical present and the Gita teaching owes its profound level of perfection and relevance for all times to the fact that it is spoken from the standpoint of the Impersonal Supreme Brahman, pointed out Srimati Sunanda in a discourse. The instruction is for every being to raise oneself towards a higher level of realisation of truth.

God, a guru, or the sastras can show the way and it is for every being to make the effort to tread the spiritual path. The Supreme Brahman pervades the entire created universe and also protects it by His Divine Sankalpa. Brahman remains as the final destination for all as well. So, Brahman is the essential principle enabling consolidated activities and experiences in life. The sun, the moon, the stars, etc, owe their radiance and power to illumine to Brahman. So too is the brilliance and heat in fire and the potency in water. He is the Omkara in the Vedas, sound in space and the atma in beings endowing all created objects and beings with specific functions and faculties. This truth can be grasped by observing and meditating on the external universe and also by looking inwards into oneself.

Unity and diversity are derived from the Supreme Brahman. The Oneness is the Truth while the diversity is the manifestation and cannot be called an illusion. A bhakta visiting temples to seek God who resides there in the form of the deity also sees the same God as the essence in all creation, including his self.

266,2020/03/05,A saga of service and sacrifice,"A tribute to the 69th head of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Pitam, on the occasion of his second Aradhana

A spiritual leader, who worked for the uplift of the downtrodden and who endeared himself to this section of society by his unique approach, Vedic scholar, who sowed the seeds of numerous Patasalas across the country, Pitadipathi, who covered the entire land on foot not once but three times... Sri Jayendra Saraswati, 69th pontiff of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Pitam, established by Adi Sankara, was indeed a phenomenon. It is two years since he attained siddi, on February 28, 2018, at the age of 82. His Aradhana rituals have begun at his Brindavanam in the Kanchi Sankara Math. The three-day events, including Namasankirtanam, Pancharatna Kriti rendition and discourses, culminate in Mahabhishekam and Poornahuti on March 7.

Strict adherence to Sanyasa dharma and duties as Pitadipathi did not distance Sri Jayendra Saraswati from the common man. “He reached out to the less privileged in several ways. Through bhajans and simple discourses, he spread devotion among them. He made them realise their importance as a vital link in the spiritual chain. He never missed an opportunity to showcase ancient music instruments and folk art forms. He started many schemes not only to protect the artistes but encourage the next generation to learn the instrument,” says Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati about his Guru. The 70th Pitadipathi has left Chennai to oversee the arrangements and participate in the Aradhana.

“I’m fortunate to get a disciple, who has made it his mission to fulfil the tasks that I have set for myself as Pitadipathi — to propagate Advaita and Sanatana Dharma, with the focus on for human welfare,” said Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, 68th head of the Pitam about Sri Jayendra Saraswati. Mahaswami was not exaggerating when he made this observation about his successor, whom he had spotted even when the boy was in his teens. Subramaniam was born on July 18, 1935, in Irulneeki village. Mahaswami’s eye had caught the potential of the young boy, who accompanied his parents — Mahadevan and Saraswati — during their prayerful visits to the Sage’s presence.

Until he attained the age of 18 and could be officially drafted, the incumbent engaged himself in the study of sastra, Vedantha, etc. at the Tiruvidaimarudur patasala, again as Mahaswami ordained. Having inherited the legacy when he was a mere child under extraordinary circumstances, the Acharya was well aware of the difficulties it posed an untrained individual. He, therefore, was clear that his successor should be well-versed in all the subjects, when he assumed the mantle.

From 1954, when he was anointed, to 2018, when he shed his mortal coil, Sri Jayendra Saraswati spent every day of the 64 years in service. Behind the pleasant smile and trademark laughter was steely nerve — resolve to strengthen the base of the Pitam and embrace followers sans discrimination. Veda Samrakshanam, cow protection, installation of Adi Sankara images and padukas, reaching out to the poor, especially during crises such as natural calamities, opening educational institutions and reviving pujas in village temples were only a few of the tasks on the agenda of Mahaswami. His disciple threw himself heart and soul into all of these, working relentlessly to leave imprints even in the remote parts of the country. To him nothing was impossible. Such was his Gurubhakti. “He is Ichcha Sakti (thought) and I’m Kriya Sakti (deed),” he declared. And Sri Jayendra Saraswati lived up to it. Not only the welfare schemes his mentor started flourished but countless new ones were started. By anointing Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati as his successor, he made sure that the good work continued seamlessly.

Towering edifices

Adi Sankara Mantapams were raised at Haridwar, Tirupati, Puri, Nepal and so on. The Nepal Government commemorated the Sankaracharya’s visit with a beautiful arch. Mani of Kasi Sankara Math recalls the experience of making ready a marble statue of Adi Sankara to be installed at Kailash Mansarovar. “The job was done within a week, because of his grace. The command came from Jayendra Periyava, when he had reached Kathmandu, on way to Kailash, after a consecration in Kasi. I got the two-ft statue ready and took it to Kathmandu, where it was installed and Vyasa Puja was performed,” he says. When he was camping in Satara (Maharashtra), Mahaswami thought of a temple for Sri Nataraja on the lines of Chidambaram. Sri Jayendra Saraswati would recall later: “Off I went to gather funds. After a whirlwind tour of Gujarat, arranging discourses by an eminent pandit, we returned with ₹10 lakhs. Without touching the money, the beaming Sage pushed it towards the altar, signalling the start of the project.” The consecration of Uthara Chidambaram took place in 1986. A similar case was that of the Adi Sankara Vimanam at Prayag.

“Don’t build more temples, instead take care of old and ancient ones,” was Mahaswami’s mantra, which was adopted by his successor. Thousands of temples, including those of historic and puranic importance, have been revived, priests appointed and daily pujas restored. Members of the numerous Sankara medical and education trusts that Sri Jayendra Saraswati founded and supported remember the optimism and enthusiasm with which he served society through these institutions.

A keen follower of current affairs, Sri Jayendra Saraswati advocated peaceful co-existence among communities. When Sikh-Hindu clashes erupted in Punjab, he sent a message of harmony, printing lakhs of copies and distributing them door-to-door in the villages. He had new houses built for those affected in the skirmishes, which broke out in Puliyankudi. “Where is the Ram Rajya, which Mahatma Gandhi visualised,” he said in anguish during such times. “Adopting a simple lifestyle, devotion and service among the people will go a long way in eradicating distrust and animosity,” he prescribed.

267,2020/03/05,His name brings joy,"Bhishma’s instruction of the Vishnu Sahasranama in the Mahabharata is an invaluable gift to posterity. More than the mere number of names, one thousand or ten thousand or infinite, it is the qualitative richness inherent in each of the Lord’s Nama that has been conferring unimaginable and subtle benefits on jivatmas through the ages, pointed out Mukkur Sri Srinivasan in a discourse. From the scholarly and devoted interpretations of the import and significance of His names, it is clear that what emerges is only the tip of the iceberg. It reflects the same inability expressed by the Vedas when they attempt to explain or describe the Supreme Brahman.

It is claimed that the Namas, when chanted with devotion and sincerity, will guide the ordinary jivatma to tide over life’s problems and lead him to salvation through the path of dharma. Apart from this direct and explicit benefit, there is yet another interesting effect experienced by many devout azhwars and acharyas. They have derived unadulterated joy by listening to His names and chanting them, and by meditating on them. This experience is so much fulfilling to them that they claim this itself is sufficient and even preferable to salvation.

Tondaradipodi Azhwar states that there can be no greater enjoyment than uttering His names and experiencing His infinite greatness. He would not prefer anything else, not even a place in Indra Loka with all honours. Vedanta Desika says that this joy of listening to and talking about His greatness can never equal the bliss that is supposed to be experienced in Vaikunta. All these may sound hypothetical, but they express the truth that once one gets hooked to His greatness there is nothing else that can equal this attractiveness.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/his-name-brings-joy/article30987504.ece
268,2020/03/05,COVID-19 proves a killjoy for Iranian students,"Their plans to celebrate Nowruz with family back home in their country go for a toss

The usual cheer and celebratory mood associated with the Persian New Year Nowruz will be missing for the Iranian students in Hyderabad, this time. Every year, the students fly back to their homes in Iran, or their families come to India to celebrate the important festival for Iranians across the globe.

The outbreak of COVID-19, the fears surrounding it and the travel restrictions are now posing a unique challenge to these young people, who had to cancel their flight tickets.

“It is very unfortunate. Every year I go to Tehran, the capital of Iran, to celebrate Nowruz with my family. But, this year, I had to cancel my booking due to the coronavirus outbreak there and other travel restrictions,” said Eli, a third-year Civil Engineering student from University College of Engineering, Osmania University.

Same is the case with Eli’s roommate Azadeh who has also cancelled her plans to visit her family this New Year, which is falling on Friday, March 20. “I booked tickets to Tehran from Mumbai but had to cancel it a few days ago. Back home, the situation is not good. Everybody is scared of the deadly virus,” Ms Azadeh told The Hindu.

When asked if anyone from her family or friends are suspected to have been infected with the virus in Iran, the youngster said, “Touchwood, so far none from my circle is infected. But, as a precautionary measure they have asked us not to come,” she said.

Ms. Azadeh is pursuing her second year in BA (PEP) from Nizam College. She came to Hyderabad in 2017 and every year during this time she goes to her native country to celebrate Nowruz. “Even last year, and in 2018 I went to Tehran.”

Meanwhile, Maryam Kouhestani, a student from OU Law College, had some exciting plans this New Year. As her parents were coming to Delhi for two weeks to celebrate the festival, she chalked out an itinerary for them, who were visiting India for the first time. “I was excited and wanted to take them to Agra and show them all the historical places in Delhi. But all my plans are dangled now. Thanks to coronavirus,” she said disappointedly. Ms. Maryam hails from Mazandaran province. “Thank god. So far only two cases of COVID-19 are reported in our province. But there most people are staying at home,” she said, adding that her parents have cancelled their tickets.

“Now, I will celebrate the festival with other Irani and Afghani friends here,” she added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/4qur7j/article30994275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy06Irani,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/covid-19-proves-a-killjoy-for-iranian-students/article30994276.ece
269,2020/03/05,"TSRTC fleet sanitised, posters put up at MGBS, RTA office","Sodium hypochlorite solution used to clean buses

The Telangana Road Transport Corporation, for the first time ever, began to disinfect and sanitise around 3,000 city buses on account of the coronavirus scare.

According to officials, sodium hypochlorite solution was used and several workers were pressed into service at different bus depots across the city for the sanitisation.

The TSRTC, officials said, is in no mood to take any chances and is ensuring that panic is not created on account of the anxiety over coronavirus. “Buses are usually cleaned with detergent. Since we never faced anything like coronivirus, we had to use this special solution,” a senior official said.

Touching upon whether there has been any decrease in occupancy due to the scare, officials confirmed that no such drop has been witnessed. On Thursday, staff of the MGBS gave away as many as 500 masks to passengers and another 60 to staff. Posters on preventive measures were also pasted on several places inside the bus station.

In an attempt to spread awareness about coronavirus, Transport Commissioner M.R.M. Rao pasted posters and handed out pamphlets to those entering Dr B.R. Ambedkar Transport Bhavan on Khairatabad Road.

Meanwhile, bus aggregator AbhiBus.com has offered to deliver masks to those who book tickets on their platform.

270,2020/03/05,"Plea to shift COVID ICU, isolation ward from Gandhi Hospital","Junior doctors fear safety of patients with low immunity

The plea to shift coronavirus (COVID-19) ICU and isolation ward from Gandhi Hospital to a better location got shriller on Thursday. Junior doctors including Post Graduates and senior residents, submitted a representation to the hospital superintendent Dr P Shravan Kumar stating that as patients with low immunity like HIV patients, pregnant women, get admitted there, it is easy for the virus to spread.

They said that close to 10,000 patients, attendants and others will be at the hospital on any given day.

The COVID ICU is located in second floor of Emergency block where other Intensive Care Units (ICU) are located. Respiratory Intensive Care Unit (RICU) is located beside the COVID ICU. A 65-bedded ICU is located on the third floor of the same building.

And the Isolation ward is located on the seventh floor of the main building where other departments like Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Dermatology and other departments, are located.

The junior doctors said that they have been deployed at the COVID isolation wards and will not hesitate to attending duties even if the ICU and the wards are shifted to far away location, if required Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) are provided.“Our concern is about the patients,” a junior doctor who did not want to be named said.

Another junior doctor said that they have to walk through a long passageway to a room beside the isolation ward to wear PPEs. “There might be virus in the passageway. Ideally, the room should be placed at a distance from the isolation ward,” the junior doctor said. They also requested for more protection gear.

However, Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender banked on the point that people who were in contact with the 24-yerar-old COVID positive patient tested negative for the virus, to state that not everyone contracts the infectious disease.

“If a positive patient walks through a passageway, will people contract virus? If it were to, did the 45 people from Apollo Hospital who came in contact with the positive patient contract the infection?,” Mr Rajender asked.

“The cosmopolitan culture of Hyderabad is distinct and different and it still survives,” said anthropologist Karen Isaksen Leonard at the launch of a new edition of her Social History of an Indian Caste. “I could see it in the humorous placards and the grace with which older people and women were treated during the January 4 protest,” said Ms. Leonard who has been researching Hyderabad and its culture for the past 55 years.

The book delves on the Kayasth community of Telangana region who migrated along with Nizam Ali Khan and settled down here. Oudesh Rani Bawa, whose father initially helped Ms. Leonard’s research, spoke about how the community of Kayasths originated and how they rose up in social hierarchy through education and women’s emancipation.

“Hyderabad had a culture where a person cannot be identified by his clothes. People could not even identify a person by his language,” said Sajjad Shahid, speaking about how the Kayasths exemplified the culture of the region.

Ms Leonard who has carried out much of her research in Urdu and Persian says she is giving away the material she has collected as she has moved on to other areas of research. “Currently, I am working on Punjabi Mexicans.

In a statement released here, the police said that based on reliable information, they arrested Dayananda at Pasra bus station. During the interrogation, the police found that Dayananda, who took a loan of ₹ 6 lakh from Devender, tried to eliminate the latter to free himself from debt. He allegedly took the amount to establish a confectionery shop, named New Bangalore Bakery, in Pasra some six months ago.

Of late, Devender started to pressurise Dayananda to return his money. Against this backdrop, Dayananda, who decided to kill Devender, hid a knife in his rented house. But seeing Sunil accompanying Devender, he changed his plan and put up a feigned effort to repay the money, borrowing from another person. He dilly-dallied till the evening.

When Sunil came out of the bakery shop on some work, Dayananda took a sickle from a coconut vendor and attacked Devender indiscriminately with it in his shop. Presently, Devender is fighting for his life in a hospital in Hyderabad.

Later, he took Sunil to his residence. Unaware of the lurking danger, Sunil followed him. After taking Sunil to his home, Dayananda slit his throat with the knife from behind killing him on the spot.

281,2020/03/05,"Declare PRC without further delay, BJP tells government","KCR duping employees, says Laxman

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday demanded the State government immediately declare the pay revision to its employees without any further delay, besides increasing the retirement age as was promised by the Telangana Rastra Samithi (TRS) before the Assembly elections.

Addressing a protest meeting organised by the party’s retired employees and teachers cell at Indira Park, party president K. Laxman lashed out at the government and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao for “duping” employees, first during the agitation for the separate State, where they were assured of several benefits, and also when the polls were held for the State Assembly for the second time.

“What happened to all the promises made? Mr. Rao claimed that the previous regimes in the united State had ignored the interests and welfare of the employees and assured that they will be treated with utmost respect. But, increasing retirement age to 61 years, pay revision, fitment payment and so on have remained a mirage. To hoodwink employees again, just before the municipal polls, he said the Pay Revision Committee (PRC) will submit report which has now been put off to December,” he pointed out.

‘No retirement benefits’

The BJP leader said that scores of employees have been retiring every year since the assurances have been made but not even retirement benefits are reaching them.

He reminded that the employees had played a key role during the Telangana agitation and warned that once again his party would not hesitate to take up the agitation path if the assurances made were not fulfilled soon.

Accusing the Chief Minister of “threatening” employees with dismissals and cases, he charged that democratic principles have been given a go-by in the State due to his dicatatorial attitude. MLC N.

283,2020/03/05,Celebrating the works of Puttaraj Gawai,"Chandana Bala Kalyan paid a musical tribute on the 106th birth anniversary of the musician-activist

The 106th birth anniversary of Pt. Puttaraj Gawai was celebrated by Gigue, which harnesses talent and takes musical training to remote villages, and venue partner, Mysore Association, Matunga, with musical tribute by Chandana Bala Kalyan.

The evening started with chanting of Rudram and Chamakam by the students of Sankara Matam.

Post this, a brief note on Veereshwara Punyashrama’s activities and of Pt. Panchakshara Gawai and Puttaraj Gawai were shared.

Pt. Puttaraj Gawai, author, composer and singer, who turned blind in infancy, could play many instruments, was one of the pioneers of Veereshwara Punyashrama music school dedicated to the differently-abled, especially the blind.

Pt. Panchakshara Gawai founded this Ashram for feeding and educating children born blind, the poor and the orphans, free of cost.

Chandana included many compositions of Gawai in her repertoire as a mark of tribute.

In the very opening Vachana , she played around with Panchakshari, the signature of the composer. ‘Guruvige tanuvannu’ in Mohanam, ‘Maadi Maadi Kettenayya’ seeking spiritual guidance, were selected to bring out the creativity of the stalwart.

Folk flavour

‘Vandisuvudaadiyali,’ Purandaradasa ganastuti was a sequel to the opening number. ‘Guruvina gulama,’ Dasa sahitya in Pantuvarali highlighted the devotion to guru outlining the oxymoron content. In ‘Bettada melondu,’ vachana of Akka Mahadevi, Chandana conveyed, through her highly charged emotive voice, the equanimity of the philosophic lines with a folksy flavour.

In ‘Kaagada bandide’ the main piece, Chandana forayed into high octaves with ease. A cascade of swara korvais and kuraippu, reproduced by guitar strings enhanced by resounding rhythmic patterns on the tabla.

Appreciating the creative energies of Jazz and Blues, Chandana sang ‘Neelavarnane Krishna,’ tuned by her. She associated with Blue as the colour of Krishna who left women feeling blue, she opined. His consorts were listed: Rukmini vallabha, Radha Manohara, Prananatha of Gopis etc. She stepped back to familiar territory with Gee Gee peppy dasa sahitya. Her ‘Tamboori meetidava,’ in Ad lib musical format, had the audience joining her.

On audience request she sang impromptu Basavanna vachana ‘Kalla naagara’ in Hindolam, bringing out the contradiction of worshipping the stone snake as divine but killing a live one, offering sumptuous ‘naivedya’ to God but driving away a hungry alms seeker. ‘Bhagyada Lakshmi’ was a fitting finale to the soulful evening.

Chandana explained the literal meaning and deeper disposition of every composition in English as the compositions were all in Kannada. She acknowledged her team of accompanists with generous inputs.

“I have experienced various musical influences.” She thanked Vinayak Netke, the tabla artiste, her musical producer and mentor in understanding Hindustani tala system. “He works under incredible pressure,” she said. “Me and guitarist Abhay Nayampalli share similar mindset in experimenting different genres that come our way.” As regards the harmonium player Abhinay Ravande, she said he was “essentially a Hindustani player who has crossed the line with me.”

Chandana said it was a special day for her and her team, to present dasa and vachana sahitya of various Kannada composers.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/kt8vre/article30990553.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06frChandana1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/celebrating-the-works-of-puttaraj-gawai/article30990554.ece
284,2020/03/05,An album called ‘Sa’,"Vocalist Sushma Somasekaran launches ‘Sa,’ a collaboration with musician-friends

Three years ago, Carnatic vocalist Sushma Somasekharan began feeling a bit restless. So she made a demo tape, exploring her voice in a non-Carnatic context in an attempt to connect more with her loved ones, not all of whom could relate to Carnatic music. Soon, one track turned into four and now, as Sushma’s first EP, or Extended Play Record, ‘Sa’ launches, it’s turned her into much more than just the voice.

“After finishing the first track, I realised how interested I was in the creative process: the intention of the songs, the choice of instruments and the ‘voice’ in the context of each piece, and how to bring those elements together with my other musical influences to create, something,” she explains.

She launches the EP, available on all digital platforms and on CD, at Chennai’s new performance venue, Offbeat, on March 8. The event is presented by Silkworm Boutique.

“’Sa’ is the first note of the Indian solfège, and it’s the first note I identify while listening to any melody or genre. I’m always searching for the ‘Sa,’ so in this metaphoric way, this EP signifies my being rooted in Carnatic music while venturing into other spheres as well,” she says.

The EP has her collaborating with fellow artistes and close friends — vocalist Aditya Prakash, mridangist Sumesh Narayanan, sound engineer Aditya Srinivasan and others. She says it simply wouldn’t have been possible without them.

“Aditya Prakash was there to constantly remind me of the values of self-inquisition, learning, discipline and practice throughout the production of this EP. Mt Aditya has mixed and mastered three of the four tracks, and his honest feedback has made all the difference,” she smiles.

Also featuring close friend and mridangist Praveen Sparsh, who’s produced one of the tracks, along with the U.K.-based sarod artiste Soumik Datta, violinist Shreya Devnath and musician Susha Raja, the EP also tells Sushma’s artistic evolution over the last decade.

While the already released single ‘SaMaGa’ plays within the ambit of Carnatic music and finds its footing in the varisais of Carnatic music, the other tracks titled ‘Mollika,’ ‘Vitthoba,’ and ‘Parame,’ involve lyrical aspects and a variety of instrumentation and arrangement that she hopes will make the EP accessible to listeners outside the Carnatic music realm.

Sushma’s hopes to focus her next project on environment.

“I have a scrapbook with all the different sounds, experiences, travels and videos that make me think about nature’s stories. I’d love to turn that into an album and possibly even a live show. But every endeavour of mine will centre around my pursuit of Carnatic music, from challenging it to finding ways to further my own understanding of it,” says Sushma as she gears up for the EP launch performance that also features Aditya Prakash (vocals), Sumesh Narayanan (percussion), Sayee Rakshith (violin), MT Aditya Srinivasan (tabla) and David Abinandan (guitar).

285,2020/03/05,Wind instrument made of stone!,"Kal Nagaswaram, another ancient instrument, that has its origins in temple festivals

We were driving on the ECR and took a little detour to visit Sri Nityakalyana Perumal temple at Thiruvidandhai. It is one of the 108 Divyadesams where the Lord is worshipped as Nityakalyana Perumal and the Goddess as Komalavalli Thayar. As it is an ancient temple, we were curious to know about the musical instruments that were played during the temple festivals here.

Priest Rama Bhattachar informed us that the Kal Nagaswaram was played during Brahmotsavam when the ‘Oyara nadai’ is performed during the procession of the Lord.

The instrument roughly weighs around three-and-a-half kilos to four kilos and is around two ft long. The body of the instrument is made of granite, while the anasu is joined by vengalam or brass and the seevali holder is made of brass. The kal nagaswaram has six holes unlike the wooden ones which has seven. Hence pratimadhyama ragas such as Kalyani, Shanmukhapriya, Dharmavati, and Hemavati, and Madhyama-varja ragas such as Mohanam and Hamsadhwani can be rendered with ease, while suddha-madhyama Mela ragas such as Sankarabharanam, Kharaharapriya and Thodi can be difficult.

“As the instrument is heavy, one has to hold it carefully. Controlled blowing technique with the required force is to be practised along with right fingering to perform this instrument,” says Swaminathan, who plays this nagaswaram at Sri Adi Kumbeswarar temple, in Kumbakonam.

The instrument is performed at ‘E scale’ sruthi (three kattai).The Kal Nagaswaram was earlier performed during the Masi Makham utsavam and Maha Maham. But it stopped in the last 15–20 years. Swaminathan revived the practice in 2017 and played the instrument during Saraswathi puja at the Adi Kumbheswarar temple.

“Nagaswaram vidwans Kunchithapatham Pillai and Pakkirisami Pillai used to play this instrument in those days at the temple,” said Swaminathan.

It has become just a showpiece at the Adinadhar Alwar temple in Azhwar Tirunagari, Thoothukudi district, as the instrument is no longer played. Parthasarathy, the internal supervisor said that the Kal Nagaswaram at the temple was donated by Krishnappa Nayakar, who ruled 350 years ago.

The Kal Nayanam (Kal Nagaswaram) here is around 1 ft long and was performed only during the Margazhi Pagal Pathu as an accompaniment to the Nammazhwar procession from the pagal pathu mandapam to his shrine.

286,2020/03/05,Mala Chandrasekhar’s concert dedicated to U. Shrinivas,"Mala Chandrasekhar played some of U. Shrinivas’s favourite compositions

In a melodious and well-defined flute recital, Sikkil Mala Chandrasekhar paid rich tributes to Mandolin U. Shrinivas at Narada Gana Sabha recently. The concert titled ‘Gurusmruti’ was convened by his student Aravind Bhargav. He was aided befittingly by veena exponent Kannan Balakrishnan. Presiding over the function, art patron Nalli Kuppuswami Chetti spoke about the creative genius of Shrinivas, recalling a wonderful Abhogi exposition by the prodigy when he was in his teens. Chief guest, veteran mridangam artiste T.V. Gopalakrishnan reminicised how the young musician constantly strived for excellence.

During her recital, Mala evoked memories of Shrinivas through her choice of kritis. The performance also reflected her musical background as she rendered M.S. Subbulakshmi’s favourite compositions, including ‘Maithreem Bhajatha’. The stamp of her gurus — flute duo Sikkil Kunjumani and Neela — was evident in her swaraprastaras and in the raga enunciation (Nalinakanti, Kharaharapriya, Bindumalini and Kalyani).

Appealing Nalinakanti

“I want to begin my tribute concert to Shrinivas with raga Nalinakanti,” said the flautist, before playing a brief raga sketch and the composition, ‘Natajana Palini,’ adding duritakala kalpanaswara and korvai to enhance the appeal.

‘Srinivasa tava’ in Kharaharapriya, the highlight of the concert, was preceded by a neatly chiselled alapana with rich contours, thus bringing out the characteristics of the raga. Kumbakonam M.R. Gopinath (violin) provided an adept Kharaharapriya essay.

Immensely evocative was the Bindumalini sketch that came next and the kriti was Tyagaraja’s ‘Enta Muddho’ . “Shrinivas used to often play this composition,” said Mala during a post-concert conversation. The kriti created a poignant mood. The flautist’s next major offering was an elaborate and structured Kalyani raga essay for the kriti ‘Nijadasa Varadakila’ with niraval, swaram and korvai. The recital ended with a Khamas javali and a thillana in Kanada.

287,2020/03/05,Sufi music is a way of life: Smita Rao Bellur,"Ahead of her performance in Delhi, Smita Rao Bellur talks about her transition from Khayal to Sufi music

For vocalist Smita Rao Bellur, transition is the song of life. Moving through life choices marked by shifts, from Bengaluru to Mumbai, Hindustani classical music to Sufi kalam and from a lucrative corporate profile to being a musician, she believes in going with the flow of artistic impulse. Slated to perform over the weekend in Delhi at the World Sufi Music Festival ‘Jahan-e-Khusrau’, the artist reflected seamlessly on Sufi music as a way of life.

The shift

“In Northern Karnataka where I grew up, the Hindustani classical influence is very strong,” recalls Bellur as she talks about her father taking her to her first music class. Trained primarily in the Kirana gharana, khayal music was the mainstay in the early days of her performance career. “Music was always a serious pursuit.” Taught in the traditional guru-shishya tradition, she believes the teaching system of that time made music a part of life, first as a hobby and interest and later as a consuming passion and profession.

“I remember almost growing up in my Guruji’s home. After school I would spend most of my time there, learning and practising, and most of my summer vacations too.” Years of training with maestros PR Bhagwat and Arjunsa Nakod gave her a strong foundation, sketched further with a nuanced study of the Jaipur style with vocalist Alka Dev Marulkar. With over 350 classical concerts to her credit, Bellur’s initiation into Sufi music was sudden and swift.

Words of wonder

The vocalist started listening to Sufi music as a panacea to her work life. She recalls a moment that marked the sublime shift of genres and professions for her. “I was in the thick of corporate life, returning from work, and this particular Sufi kalam took me into a trance.” The composition was Aziz Ahmed Warsi’s rendition of ‘Allah Hu.’ For her the words carried a message and it was the surreal experience of the universe speaking directly with her. “The way this famous kalam was presented was very different. It was slower in pace, and included a little narrative about a devotee and her belief that the divine power would come home to visit her, she even begins preparing for this visit. She is mocked and berated for her belief and told that her concept is faulty. In this story, god says that a devotee can worship or love them the way they want. This absolute acceptance and expression of devotion is beautiful.”

Deeply moved by this kalam, Bellur’s artistic stirrings directed her towards finding a teacher for her foray into Sufi music. Soon she had become a disciple of the Warsi Brothers. “I realised this was my calling and since I had trained to be a classical singer, it was not very difficult to learn this genre.”

She continued to practice Khayal, and Sufi music gradually took prevalence until she decided to finally give up her cushy corporate day job and move to Mumbai to focus entirely on being a musician. “Khayal is mostly about creating the mood of the raga, the focus is more towards the aakar and development of the raga and not the bol. Sufi music focuses on the poetry.” She shares, describing the gravitation towards the world of words, “It is not just the text, but the vibration of the words, the way they are sung, that is important.” Bellur believes that Sufi music has a deep connect with the audience and is anchored in emotion and spirituality.

The vocalist points out that delving into Sufi music actually goes beyond musical training. “A lot of Sufi learning is about understanding the philosophy, reading, connecting the dots.” The immersive world of Sufism has taken her into the compositions of several other saints apart from the traditional lineage of the Warsi brothers. “Mystical traditions of various languages and regions draw me, for instance the Punjabi Sufi kalams are very different in thought and music and go deep into social and cultural life.”

For Bellur life changed dramatically in 2016 as she adopted Sufism into her everyday life. “To quit my job and move to another city in the pursuit of music was an impulsive and inspired decision,” she reflects. “I almost dismantled a comfortable and financially stable life for this and rationally it would probably not appear a good idea. But it felt natural, and I just took a leap. Sufism, after all, is a way of life.”

Embracing change

Balancing major changes in daily life has also been accompanied by transformations in the aesthetics of music presentation. Bellur points out that traditional instruments have given way to new-age arrangement in the Sufi music sphere. “It is quite common now to use the keyboard, drums, programmed rhythms. I try and stick with acoustic or Indian-sounding arrangements though some changes are required to present a sound that connects with young people also.”

As one of the few women qawwals, she believes that the entry of more women in the Sufi genre subtly challenges the social structure. “I was accepted easily into the musical tradition where few women have been allowed earlier, times and attitudes have changed now and there is acceptance and less gender bias.”

Curating theme-based presentation is the way ahead for Bellur as a researcher and musician. Presently engrossed in the works of Hyderabadi poets including ghazals and Sufi kalaam, she would be sharing her interpretations in her upcoming concert at Jahan-e-Khusrau. “The festival is known for its Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb and Muzaffar Ali sahbb has given me a rare kalam of his choice to compose.”Iranian musicians would be accompanying the vocalist at the festival.

Quietly reflecting on the significance of Sufi music in the present world, the vocalist says, “Indian music is largely about love. In today’s world hate has unfortunately become more popular. In our traditional music, there is a nuanced exploration of love – from erotic, romantic, to the divine. Themes of love have been written and celebrated. I am happy to be part of this musical world where love is at the centre.”

288,2020/03/05,U. Shrinivas tribute - Musical camaraderie at its best,"The U. Shrinivas tribute show brought together multiple artistes and instruments on one stage

When I go up on the stage and see the audience something happens to me. I feel this energy inside me and I almost don’t realise what I am playing. I am not sure where it comes from, yes, it does come and I do play. Maybe the energy is God.” (Mandolin Shrinivas, Rave magazine, 2004) True, it was that unseen energy that guided him to elevate the stature of a tiny alien instrument and place it on the global platform. The name of the instrument eventually became a prefix to his name, and the world of music came to know him as Mandolin U. Shrinivas.

Six years have passed since he left the mortal world, but the magical sound that flowed with effortless ease from his instrument and the charming smile on his face are still fresh in our memory.

To celebrate his musical genius and his birth anniversary, Mandolin Rajesh and SS International Live presented an evening of music featuring a galaxy of musicians.

This year, the show began with Sankara Vijayendra Saraswathi of Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam honouring Kailash Kher and Sudha Ragunathan.

A heartfelt rendition of ‘Srinivasa Thiruvenkatamudaiyan’ in Raga Hamsanandhi by Sudha Ragunathan gave a melodic start to the evening. She followed it up with the song, ‘Chinnanchiru Kiliye’, popularised by her guru MLV. Anil Srinivasan’s responses on the piano added an interest dimension. Praveen Narayana on the tabla and Krishna Kishore on the drums provided rhythmic support.

Lively session

Mandolin U. Rajesh along with flautist Rakesh Chaurasia next played a composition, ‘love within’ composed by Shrinivas; a simple tune capturing the essence of raga Charukesi. The lively instrumental segment had Anil Srinivasan and Krishna Kishore on the ganjira, Rakesh Chaurasia with Giridhar Udupa on the ghatam and U. Rajesh with Praveen Narayana on the tabla.

Greg Ellis from Los Angeles on the drums, Aalaap Raju on the bass and jazz pianist Harmit Mansetta and the little boy Steven Samuel Devassy on the drums joined the artistes on stage to render a composition titled ‘Inner Child’.

Starting with simple notes, they slowly built it up with exciting musical phrases. The composition evoked mixed emotions of joy, adventure and contemplation. The concluding passage that incorporated notes of the timeless geetham ‘Raravenu Gopala’ brought alive childhood memories. Each artiste played individually before coming together during the crescendo.

It was quite late before Kailash kher came on the stage. The dimunitive singer with a powerful voice livened up the atmosphere. When he rendered his superhit song, ‘Saiyyan’ the audience response was overwhelming and they wanted more from him, but time constraint played spoilsport.

After solo and group performances by musicians, it was time for raga Hindolam and the song ‘Samajavaragamana’ (a Shrinivas favourite) played on the mandolin by students of the music school established by Shrinivas, that came like a breath of fresh air. The synchronised playing was heartwarming. Earlier, Srikanth Krishnamoorthy sang a composition in raga Hindolam.

Music director Devi Sri Prasad offered tribute to his ‘dear anna’ with a group rendition of Hanuman Chalisa. But the pulsating rhythm of the presentation dominated the meditative chanting. A short musical composition and a film montage on Shrinivas by Devi Sri Prasad brought down the curtain on an evening of nostalgia.

Amidst his virtuosity, the melodic aspect stood out in Shrinivas’s music. It would be befitting if this annual show focused more on this rather being rhythm oriented. Though the stage was occupied by well-known artistes, the duration of the programme did not allow them enough time to perform. But that every year they enthusiatically participate in the event is a reflection of their bonding with the late mandolin maestro, who touched many lives with his exceptional music.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/u-shrinivas-tribute-musical-camaraderie-at-its-best/article30990207.ece
289,2020/03/05,KSHMR comes to India for Road To Ultra and Sunburn Holi,"The popular musician dishes about his new track ‘Over And Out’ and how his label Dharma Worldwide empowers budding musicians

It is not easy to get a hold of KSHMR. The musician was just in New York, Brazil and then Mexico, before flying out to India for his Road To Ultra performances in Hyderabad and Delhi, an Sunburn Holi sets in Mumbai. Even though he will most likely be hundreds of metres from nearsight, one cannot mistake his broody appearance and addictive tunes.

The 31-year-old, whose real name is Niles Hollowell-Dhar, has been in the music industry for almost a decade, his early years being with The Cataracs. He was born in San Diego to a Kashmiri father and American mother; these cultural convergences often reflect in his music.

Ask him about the advice he would have for his younger self and he responds, “In the early 2000s, there was no KSHMR yet! It was only me, Niles, and my group The Cataracs (known for their 2011 chart-topper ‘Top Of The World’). I would tell myself to stop trying to be ‘cool’ and focus on songs that come from the heart.”

The karma of Dharma In July 2017, KSHMR launched Dharma Worldwide, his own record label; but the label also empowers budding musicians to develop their creative and technical skills. “The education side of Dharma is Dharma Studio, something brand new. Our most important offerings are the tutorials and sounds. We provide you with tips that are rooted in experience from producers such as myself. And the sounds — samples and presets — provide inspiration to help you start creating.”

He adds that he is a “recovering workaholic” but does exercise, spend time with his dogs and his friends. “It takes a concerted effort to step away from music and do ‘normal’ things, but I’m starting to appreciate those more. Challenges keep my career interesting for me: working in new tempos and genres, reinventing the live show, and of course finding the next great melody. The pursuit of great melodies is a fire in me that will never die.”

His most recent release is the galactic ‘Over And Out’ with vocals from Charlott Boss. The lyric video was released just two days ago. “We were all excited to release a track in line with my earlier work, something hard-hitting and sure to connect with the crowd when I play it live. The vocal was sent to me by Ilan, our [artistes and repertoire division] at Dharma Worldwide. He is a magician, always finding ideas and vocals that blow me away — and Charlott’s demo struck me instantly.”

A look at his Instagram (which has over 2.4 million followers) shows he has an unrivalled love for festivals, Road To Ultra included. “I’m so happy to see such an international festival as Ultra recognise the importance of India — to play Ultra is always an honour, but to do it in the country closest to my heart is a dream come true.”

In tune Niles Hollowell-Dhar aka KSHMR , at one of his performances

KSMHR’s Spotify Wrapped 2019 revealed, ‘192.1 million streams, 9.1 million hours, 20.6 million listeners and 79 countries.’ It makes sense given 2019 saw him ranked 15th on DJ Mag’s Top 100. KSHMR’s career also brims with notable collaborations — with Tiësto, Headhunterz, R3HAB, Lost Stories and Marnik. He made his Bollywood début for 2019 Hindi film Good Newwz’s theme song with Tanishk Bagchi.

290,2020/03/05,Chenda artiste Kalamandalam Unnikrishnan on the changing phases of the chenda in Kathakali,"The percussionist talks about the importance of redefining and repositioning the instrument in the art form

A daily-wage labourer in Kolathur in Malappuram sends his two sons to two different art schools and years later the brothers grow up to become top Kathakali percussionists. And while it may sound like a fairy tale, it is the true story of Kathakali’s top chenda player Kalamandalam Unnikrishnan and his brother Kottakkal Ravi, a prominent maddalam player.

Their father was a part-time ritualistic chenda player at a temple. His friend taught the young Unnikrishnan and Ravi the basics of playing the chenda. “I was enrolled in Kalamandalam for the simple reason that at the end of the day there wasn’t enough food to put on the table. I was the eldest of six children. Ravi went to Kottakkal two years later. And although we enjoyed drumming, the push factor was poverty,” says Unnikrishnan.

What strikes you at first as you talk to the 61-year-old Unnikrishnan, who retired as principal of Kerala Kalamandalam Deemed University in 2015, is his holistic approach towards Kathakali. He thinks and lives Kathakali, and about how his chenda can help an actor lift his act and how he can enhance the viewer’s experience.

Excerpts from an interview with Unnikrishnan.

You were in the forefront of Kathakali melam for the last few decades when a new percussion system for pacha (heroic) characters emerged. Could you elaborate on this?

In every area of Kathakali, certain systems have evolved over time outside the kalari system. A set of conventions and applications born out of practice become a system over time. This has happened in the case of percussion for pacha characters too. When we talk about the late Ramankutty Nair Ashaan’s Ravana, we immediately think of Krishnankutty Poduval Ashaan’s chenda. But no one remembers who played the chenda for Kunju Nair Ashaan’s Nala. The reason is that there was no set system those days for playing the chenda for a pacha character.

When you look at the evolution of Kathakali melam we realise that even when there was a system in the kalari, not much attention was given towards the control of tempo when it came to a pacha character. There were set pieces to play, and the chenda followed the artists’ footwork. Concepts such as kal kottu, kai kottu or kannu kottu (drumming for the feet, hands or eyes) evolved or were codified much later. Many of these elements were already in use, but were not properly structured.

You are almost always called upon to play with Kalamandalam Gopi Ashaan. Did he play any role in the evolution of this style?

Gopi Ashaan did provide inputs. He has clear ideas about rhythm, tempo, cadence and mood. He is fastidious about when the tempo should rise or wane and on what should follow next. I am lucky I got lots of opportunities to perform with Gopi Ashaan right after I joined Kalamandalam as a teacher. My guru Achunni Poduval Ashaan, used to encourage me to play for Gopi Ashaan. And this drumming system for pacha characters is something that has evolved from there.

To illustrate this system, let us take the ‘verpadu’ scene where Nala deserts Damayanti in the forest. In the olden days, the percussion switched to irattivattam, a sort of drum roll, after Nala rips off a piece of Damayanti’s robe to cover himself. The chenda didn’t follow the mudras for the rest of Nala’s attam — such as praying to the gods and exhorting the sages to protect his wife — or when he runs away from her. What was being played was merely a repeat of the irattivattam. Today, it is the chenda that gives the cue to the artiste with a kalasam in the dramatic scene where Nala looks alternately at his sleeping wife’s form and the forest. The result has a far bigger impact in conveying to the viewer the conflicting emotions and confusion that are tearing Nala apart. Then there are many instances where the artiste gives a signal, a hint to the percussionists on what is to follow. This is just one example of the language of pacha, an unwritten system that has evolved outside the kalari syllabus.

Is this new system of percussion part of the Kalamandalam syllabus now?

Lately in post-graduate courses in Kalamandalam, especially in theory classes, these principles are discussed and ingrained in the students. We also go through the percussive peculiarities of the important descriptive segments in various stories.

New concepts such as the kind of drumming to be used for gestures or when using the eyes to describe something is also discussed. Take, for instance, the drumming that follows the movement of the eyes. Nala watching Hamsam leave, Bheema looking at the Gandhamadana mountain and Ravana viewing Mount Kailas, are all “looks”. But the drumming patterns vary because the effect that needs to be created on stage is vastly different — one holds a ray of hope for Nala, the second must project Bheema’s overconfidence at conquering that mountain, and the last is Ravana marvelling at the immensity of Kailas. There are several such examples. I believe these aspects must be built into the chenda syllabus. The teaching process must be standardised just as there is a codified system of mudras for actors.

What else is being developed now?

Drumming to display conflicts or sangharsha kottu. Elakiyattam, which is the actor’s narration without vocals, can be divided into several categories: scenes of internal conflict such as Nala deserting Damayanti or Karna’s turmoil on seeing Kunti; anger of Roudrabheema as he confronts Dussasana; self-confidence or even arrogance such as of Ravana lifting Kailasa; and the aesthetics of describing a beautiful garden, for example. There are different approaches to the drumming of these emotions though the mudras may be common. For example, the mudra for Krishna when depicted by Duryodhana and by Arjuna is the same but the former displays hostility and the latter devotion. The chenda helps amplify this contrast. I am sure that a system of emotion-based drumming will evolve over time.

What is your take on the trend of using microphones to hone the acoustics for the chenda and the maddalam?

I believe Kathakali deserves good acoustics. We must change with the times. I remember the days when the singers did not have a microphone and then a time when two singers shared a microphone. Today’s Kathakali vocalists use sophisticated sound systems. Percussion too needs similar amplification, especially since the way these drums are played have changed over time. The possibilities of the chenda and its four basic sound positions are tapped to the maximum only in Kathakali.

An example will drive home my point. There are many slow-tempo sringara padams in Kathakali. Each one is different from the other. ‘Kuvalayavilochane’ in Nalacharitam - Day 2, depicting the newly-wed Nala and Damayanti stands out from the rest in its softness. The terms and imagery such as flowers, saplings...are all delicate. So the technique we drummers use is also delicate. To carry that rhythm to the actor, first to inspire him, and then to the audience, we need a good sound system. It’s time the chenda got a sound check.

How about the practice of using three and sometimes even four sets of chenda and maddalam?

That may be a bit overdone in some cases, but is justified in others. Take the majestic kathi character of Narakasuran. His Keki scene with his wife, going to heaven, confronting Indra, etc all need only one chenda. You can use a second chenda to keep the basic rhythm. It’s the same in Ravanolbhavam till the thapassattam. But if you consider the violent scenes of Roudrabheema or Veerabhadra and Bhadrakali, or the appearance of Narasimha, a third set of drums will certainly add to both the visual and aural impact. The audience will go back thrilled. Isn’t that the very essence of performing arts?

What do you say about the state of Kathakali today?

We have a rich talent pool, in every department. In chenda many of them are my students. The opportunities are plenty now. And, unlike before, they are getting the chance to perform with senior artistes early in their career. But they must be aware of their responsibilities too. Before every performance they must revise in their minds the kalari lessons of the part they are going to perform. What we must remember is that our work is continously being archived by people through videos. If we skip a kalasam or display a lack of rigour, our disciples will think it’s okay to do that. That may lead to erosion in standards. Actors must also take more care to communicate with the percussionists and the vocalists. They should give pointers when their attam is about to end or when the tempo should pick up. There should never be a lack of clarity between the actor and other artistes on stage.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ugi2xd/article30987891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvfUnnikrishnan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/in-conversation-with-kathakalis-top-chenda-player-kalamandalam-unnikrishnan/article30987892.ece
291,2020/03/05,Marat Bisengaliev to perform at Rangashankara’s 15th anniversary celebrations this weekend,"The evergreen allure of classical music

The Symphony Orchestra of India which is part of the National Centre for Performing Arts (NCPA) Mumbai, will be in Bengaluru for Rangashankara’s 15th anniversary celebrations. Violinist and conductor Marat Bisengaliev who will be conducting the orchestra this weekend is a citizen of Kazakhastan; however, he has made Mumbai his home from 2004.

Marat first performed in Bengaluru in 2007 with clarinet player and conductor Michael Collins. “I still remember that concert very well. After that we played quite often in Bengaluru,” he says.

Marat feels there is a steady interest in classical music, contrary to popular belief. “The rapid growth of the Indian economy created a rapid growth of the middle classes. This has resulted in a cultural vacuum, a spiritual void that can be filled with classical music,” he says, adding, “Over the years, while interacting with audiences here, I have seen how the the public perception has changed. More young people are coming forward to join this musical genre.”

While there are many Indian musicians who play international standards of classical music, Marat says they are very selective of who joins the Symphony Orchestra of India. “The quality of music comes first. It always has to be of the highest level to make sure we gain supporters. If we do not produce that quality, it will have an adverse effect and classical music would lose listeners instead of gaining them.”

Many of the 31-piece chamber orchestra comprise musicians from Eastern European countries who have trained in the Russian school of playing classical music. The orchestra will present the works of Vivaldi, Mozart and Haydn as well as a special feature to commemorate Beethoven’s 250th birth anniversary.

At 58, Marat is first a violinist and conductor though he plays the guitar and a few folk instruments too. “My second love is to waive the baton when I’m with the orchestra, which is what I will be doing for the most part in Bangalore,” he laughs.

Despite his accolades (and there are quite a few), Marat is most excited about the academy and the training being done there. as he believes it is their legacy. “This is something we started eight years ago and it will bear fruit. It’s a very long process, but in 15 to 20 years you will get a fully trained professional musician.”

NCPA’s Symphony Orchestra of India will play at Rangashankara, on March 6 and 7.

292,2020/03/05,The importance of Safdar Hashmi,"Sudhanva Deshpande’s book, Halla Bol remembers the legendary theatremaker and activist through a series of events that recall his life’s worth

A book tour with a difference is currently making its way across Mumbai. Sudhanva Deshpande’s book, Halla Bol, that celebrates the life and art of icon Safdar Hashmi, is the focus of a series of events organised by the Jana Natya Manch (Janam) at a slew of cultural venues. At each space, the proceedings include a performance of the iconic 13-minute, Machine, a lyrical piece on industrial labour written by Safdar (then 24) and Rakesh Saksena.

It was Janam’s first ever street play with its opening performance taking place in 1978. At last evening’s showing at NCPA’s Experimental Theatre, Naseeruddin Shah joined Janam actors in reading excerpts from Halla Bol, the play that gives the book its title. Apart from Shah, other speakers at the events include Janam pioneer Moloyashree Hashmi, Annie Zaidi, P Sainath, Shanta Gokhale and Deshpande. Published in Hindi and English by Vaam Prakashan and LeftWord Books respectively, his book is available for sale at all venues. The closing performance at Lokhandwala’s Studio Tamaasha will feature local actors and singers reading and performing from Janam’s and Safdar’s works.

Truth and power

‘Halla Bol’ is the colloquial clarion call of socialists, the import of which could be described as ‘creating a ruckus’ while speaking truth to power. The English word hullabaloo shares its Persian forebears with the Hindi phrase. ‘Raise a slogan’, as it is sometimes translated to, doesn’t quite carry the same charge. Halla Bol was incidentally the street play Safdar was performing with his cohorts at a labour colony in Jhandapur in 1989 when he was fatally attacked by Congress cadre. There were two deaths, and Deshpande describes disquietingly in his foreword, “An artist’s head deliberately clobbered by blunt instruments, a worker’s life snuffed out casually by a bullet.”

The play, Halla Bol was a reworking of Safdar’s Chakka Jam, written for a seven-day strike mobilised by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions in 1988. That play was remade based on worker demands so that it could continue to be performed, according to Dia Da Costa in Politicizing Creative Economy: Activism and a Hunger Called Theatre. Thus, the power of Halla Bol can be attributed to both middle-class cultural activists and factory workers, coming together like never before. This was also true for the rallying cries raised during the strike. Of course, the slogan has often been appropriated at odds — in Mulayam Singh Yadav’s call to boycott ‘separatist’ newspapers in 1994, or in Amit Jayaram’s poem on Ayodhya, or as a television catchphrase for irate newscasters subservient to the regime.

In solidarity

A couple of days after Hashmi’s passing, members of Janam returned to the site of his martyrdom to perform the play with large numbers standing in solidarity. It spawned silent protests across the country and further performances of Halla Bol. It was immediately evident that Hashmi’s flame could not been extinguished, and his legacy would remain unfurled in manifold ways.

In this regard, the book’s tag-line ‘The Death and Life of Safdar Hashmi’ acquires a prescient significance, even if written in aching hindsight. As detailed in Da Costa’s book, Deshpande was a young student going through his own rites of passage during the late 1980s, aloof and politically nonchalant at first, but soon to become one of Janam’s foremost stalwarts. Safdar’s death was a catalyst for Deshpande’s political coming of age, as he was catapulted from a begrudging apprenticeship to a leadership role armed with an ideology for life.

Jana Natya Manch celebrates Safdar Hashmi through performances, readings and conversations on March 6, at 1 p.m, at TISS, Chembur and at 6:30 p.m. at Goethe Institut/MMB, Kala Ghoda. On March 7 at Studio Tamaasha, Lokhandwala, Andheri West at 7 p.m.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/jotk9c/article30993460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Safdar-with-baton,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/the-importance-of-safdar-hashmi/article30993461.ece
293,2020/03/05,"Saarang Theatre Festival: Lights, stage, reality","How three plays at the Saarang Theatre Festival mirrored the happenings around us today

Art is a reflection of our time. I was constantly reminded of this while watching three contemporary theatre productions at the recent edition of Saarang Theatre Festival in Pune. Conflict of various kinds dominated these plays and we were watching them safely ensconced inside an auditorium while the national capital was engulfed in communal riots claiming lives of innocent citizens.

In such a climate, I saw Neel Chaudhuri’s ‘Rihla’ which deals with issues such as citizenship, identity and most importantly, home. Is nation home? How can it become home to all? Does such a nation exist? Rihla features young actors from the Aagaaz Theatre Trust, New Delhi. In the play, a group of young people set on a voyage to find a new country to forge a new identity and feel accepted. This quest is however into the great unknown – where is that country? This young group speak aloud their thoughts and aspirations about the new country they want to reach, educate and disagree with each other in the process thereby showcasing their dilemma and agony. While they aspire to reach and find an ideal state, it is anyone’s guess that it’s easier said than achieved.

Furthering the theme of conflict and war, Joy Maisnam’s ‘Andha Yug’ is a spectacular production. Based on Dharamvir Bharati’s iconic play, it is set against the backdrop of the last day of the Mahabharata. Mahabharata in itself is a big metaphor for the director and many like him who have adapted the play on stage. Brilliant in its scenography, this attempt brings out the inner contradictions of the characters in the Mahabharata – Gandhari, Aswathama and Krishna to name a few. TAAM (Treasure Art Association, Manipur) builds upon the physical martial traditions of Manipur and constructs a movement-based theatre vocabulary which is the strength of the production. The play could be set in a different timeframe, but its core concerns still resonate with us, thus yielding it topical to our context where treachery, murder, violence indicates the new normal.

Jyoti Dogra’s ‘Black Hole’ though talks about cosmological objects and such phenomena is an intimate meditation on life and loss. In her monologue performance, Dogra uses the scientific to talk about the personal. Seldom have such exchanges or associations been seen on stage, where science is not perceived or treated as the other but becomes a part of the individual’s emotional geography. Dogra appears solo on stage, a white sheet is her only prop and she shares information about the cosmos. While the synopsis may sound disorienting, very soon into the play one realises that the scientific information she shares facilitates an insight into the character and her ways of coming to terms with the loss of a loved one. When all vocabulary fails as if loss has a predetermined vocabulary, we device new epistemologies to talk about them and this to me is the highlight of this solo act. Dogra dismisses the obvious in the favour of the introspective. Even her rage is so subtle and nuanced. ‘Black Hole’ is a remarkable achievement in contemporary theatre helping us reimagine notions of form, body and ideas of encounter in the performing arts.

The plays are over, so is the festival but conflict lives on, spills out onto the streets creating routine mayhem. It is perhaps this mayhem that will genesis new performances.

294,2020/03/05,Purisai Sambandan redefines Therukoothu,"Purisai Sambandan, recently feted, is taking Therukoothu to places

“They made our village famous. I will take you there,” said the young man, getting down from his bicycle. I was looking for the house of Therukoothu artiste Purisai Kannappa Thambiran. They were rehearsing for a new play, ‘The old man with huge wings,’ based on Un señor muy viejo con unas alas enormes by Gabriel García Márquez — a collaboration between Purisai Duraisami Kannappa Thambiran Paramparai Therukoothu Mandram of Tamil Nadu and Mapa Teatro of Bogotá, Colombia. I watched as Kannappa Thambiran’s son Sambandan put the story into the koothu mode with Heidi and Rolf Abderhalden of Mapa Teatro.

The story metaphorically unravels as an inter-cultural, theatrical and human experience. A man from another world appears one day, falling from the sky into the backyard of Pelayo, a villager and his wife, Elisenda. The production was, for both companies, an experience in alterity and difference, where an experimental theatre from the ‘new continent’ searches the tradition of popular theatre from the ‘old continent.’ The ancient art of Therukoothu discovers the possibility of exploring new horizons and revitalising its tradition through the work of a contemporary playwright.

According to Mapa Teatro, the experience revealed “a post-dramatic theatrical form approaching pre-dramatic forms and vice-versa, creating a dialogue between past and present in the performance space.” A video documentation of this project shows backstage pre-performance activities, following various actors through their preparation routine — drinking coffee and applying make-up. The play was premiered at the fifth International Theatre Festival at Bogota (1996). “We were surprised by the number of invitations we got for staging the play in villages across Tiruvannamalai district, Chennai and other places,” says Sambandan.

Sambandan is the fifth generation Therukoothu artiste. His ancestors were singers in bhajanai groups. His father discouraged him from becoming a Koothu artiste. He was bundled off to Chennai to work as a casual assistant in a post-office. Sambandan decided to stealthily learn adavus of Koothu from Vedachalam. It took a lot of convincing for Kannappa Thambiran to induct Sambandan into the group. “I really worked hard to impress my father,” says Sambandan.

Sambandan recalls that the association with N. Muthuswamy, who founded the avant garde theatre group Koothuppattarai inspired by Therukoothu, widened their horizons. They were invited to perform at Padma Subrahmanyam’s house and she encouraged Sambandan to go back to the village and become a full-time artiste.

Sambandan seized opportunities to train himself also in modern theatre, attending workshops conducted by Bansi Kaul, Badal Sircar, Peter Brook and other directors. These workshops honed his acting skills, teaching him to use body and voice to fuller effect. He has played principal roles in many traditional koothus, acting as Arjunan in ‘Vil Valaippu,’ Duchasanan in ‘Draupati Vasthraparanam,’ Duryodhanan in ‘Rajasuya Yaagam,’ Karnan, Arjunan, and Bheeman in ‘Karna Motcham,’ and Abhimanyu in ‘Veera Abhimanyu’ to name a few.

Purisai group became the first traditional theatre group to break the template and create new stories. In 1980, Kannappa Thambiran’s brother Natesha Thambiran split from the group as he did not agree to producing Subramanya Bharati’s ‘Panchali Sapatham’ in Koothu mode. Thereafter more and more modern plays were cast in the manner of Koothu — ‘Vellai Vattam,’ an adaptation of Brecht's ‘Caucasian Chalk Circle,’ directed by K.S. Rajendran, for instance. Sambandan also appeared in ‘England,’ directed by N. Muthuswamy, and ‘Kaalam Kaalamaaga,’ directed by P. Krishnamoorthy. During Brecht’s centenary, ‘Caucasian Chalk circle’ became a full-fledged Koothu in Sambandan’s direction. There was also a humorous play, based on Thenali Raman of Tamil folklore, and a Koothu version of Bhasa’s Sanskrit play ‘Doota Ghatotkacham.’ He choreographed the production of Avanthi Meduri's ‘God Has Changed His Name’ for the Koothuppattarai group. He worked on Macbeth and a complete Ramayana, unlike staging episodes from the Mahabharata.

He conducts workshops at the National School of Drama, New Delhi, at the University of Pondicherry, and at Bhaskar’s Arts Academy, Singapore. He travels around the country and has performed in several countries such as France, Sweden, the U.S., Singapore, Sri Lanka and Colombia. These opened the door to a new world.

A Koothu training school has been functioning in Purisai since 2003 and after the passing away of Kannappa Thambiran, an annual festival is conducted in his memory, where artistes such as shadow puppet expert Murugan Rao are honoured. The third day after his father died, Sambandan was playing Keechakan at the village Perumal temple. After being conferred the Kalaimamani (1995) title by the Tamilnadu Eyal Isai Nataka Manram, came the Sangeet Natak Akademi award and now, the honorary doctorate.

Sambandan says that he is intrigued when people say Therukoothu is a dying art form. “I do not know what they mean by dying. It is difficult to make a good living but more and more companies are being formed now. There were just about ten companies during my father’s time but now there are lots more. How can this happen if the form is dying? When we produced ‘Indrajit,’ people were surprised but it has done more than 1,500 shows and has travelled to villages my father had never gone to.”

About the nomenclature controversy, Sambandan says, “We never called the form Kattaikuttu and never performed in processions. We are happy with the name Therukoothu used traditionally for the form.”

Now the sixth generation of Koothu artistes in the family are performing, some of them women. His daughter Gowri, who has studied music accompanied him to Paris, where they collaborated with Theatre Du Soleil.

Sambandan says that he was emotional on hearing about the “It is an honour not for me, but for the work done by forefathers.”

Rare Honour

The Tamilnadu Fine Arts University was created by the former Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa in 2013. It now carries her name and is called the Tamilnadu Dr.J. Jayalalithaa Fine Arts University. Colleges of music and dance, those of fine arts, architectural and sculptural institutes and Government-aided colleges such as Kalai Kaviri in Tiruchi come under the umbrella of this university. At its first convocation, presided over by the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu Edappadi Palaniswamy, who is also the University’s Chancellor, Purisai Kannappa Sambandan became the first folk artiste to be given an honorary doctorate by the university. Vice Chancellor Prameela Gurumurthy listed the colleges that are affiliated to the university and said it was a matter of honour that they could bestow the honorary doctorate on two excellent artistes of different genres — mridangam legend Umayalapuram Sivaraman and Therukoothu artiste Purisai Kannappa Sambandan.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/grvlxf/article30990167.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06frSambandamjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/purisai-sambandan-redefines-therukoothu/article30990169.ece
295,2020/03/05,"Winner of the Outstanding Woman Entrepreneur of Kerala Award for 2020, Sheila James introduced bespoke clothes in Thiruvananthapuram","She opened the first designer boutique in the city in 1988

“At a function I saw an acquaintance wearing a beautiful peach crepe sari with exquisite motifs in grey. She had it accessioned with grey pearls and looked elegant and stylish. I was pleased to see that such brilliant handwork was still in vogue and wondered how much she had spent on her sari. When I complimented her, she told me that she had bought the sari from my boutique some 22 years ago!” recalls Sheila James with a big smile on her face.

The first to set up a designer boutique, Body Tunes, in the city in 1988, Sheila recalls how there was hardly anyone who encouraged her when she decided to open shop. Sheila’s Body Tunes made designer clothes accessible to all those with an eye for fashion and the wherewithal to buy bespoke saris and dresses.

“I find it hard to believe that I started my business without a capital investment to speak of. It was my passion for design and colours that helped me make a mark as a designer,” muses Sheila, one of three winners of the Outstanding Woman Entrepreneur of Kerala Award for 2020.

Accent on handlooms

“Right from the beginning my choice was handlooms and handworked saris. It was intuitive and not driven by any sense of business acumen. I can confidently say that I popularised handworked raw silks, tussars, Kanchi cottons and handlooms.”

Initially, she had a space opposite her house in PTP Nagar where 10 families, all experts in Ari work, were accommodated. Over the years, Sheila has relocated them back to their home town and now has craftsmen all over the country doing specialised work for her.

Eventually, when the business outgrew the tiny space in Sasthamangalam, she moved to her present location in Statue and named it Czarina. “My daughter Shalini James, a designer and founder of Kochi-based Mantra, came up with the name ‘Czarina’. ‘The princess within you’ is the tagline of the boutique. We believe that there is a princess in every woman and we cater to her with the best from all over the country,” explains Sheila.

She laughs when she remembers travelling to Benares, Kolkata and Jaipur on her own to source weaves, meet craftspersons and locate sellers. “It was the late eighties. No net, no mobile phones and no connections in the fashion world. All I had were some friends and some contacts given to me by my workers. I was literally discovering India’s rich diversity of weaves and textiles. My family would have been aghast if they had known I was travelling on my own during those trips,” she recounts.

That experience has stood her in good stead and today Sheila and Shalini travel together to select material and weaves for their boutiques. “Shalini is a trained designer and so I turn to her to learn about materials and technique while my contacts and experience have helped her in sourcing exactly what she wants,” she explains with a smile.

Sitting pretty in a sari her boutique, the self-taught designer says she never thought she was setting out on a new adventure when as a young mother of three, she got a tailor to run up a few salwar sets on a sewing machine she had at her home in Kilpauk, Chennai.

“My youngest daughter had turned four and I had a little time for my own. Since I had always been fond of designing my clothes, I decided to make a few for me. I liked what I had done and showed it to a person who used to manage actor Sarada’s boutique, Panjali, in Chennai. She complimented me on my work and told me to leave them behind. I remember how happy I was when I was told they had been sold,” recalls Sheila.

Buoyed by that initial success, she employed more tailors, turned the garage of her house into a workspace and got down to work. Body Tunes, her outlet in Chennai, became popular with Malayalis and she also held a couple of exhibitions in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuam.

Eventually, she decided to open an outlet in the city. Her father, the late Baby John, asked her if she wanted some help. “And I wondered aloud if Mammootty could come for the inauguration. My father did succeed in that and I remember how the entire Vellayambalam-Sasthamangalam was packed with people waiting to see the actor,” she laughs.

Happy customers

As congratulatory messages and calls keep interrupting the conversation, Sheila says that she does not measure her success in number of outlets or celebrities wearing her clothes. Her happiness is in her loyal customers who have grown up with her boutique. Although she had franchises in Kochi, Kottayam and Kozhikode, she says she closed them down when she found that she was unable to give those outlets personal attention.

Today, as boutiques spring up in every nook and corner of the city, Sheila has a word of advice for young entrepreneurs, “Start small and stay grounded. Be realistic and, I feel, it is best to use your own money to begin with so that the fear of repayment of loans will not hamper the pleasure of doing something that you enjoy. And, of course, give the best to your customer.”",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/nm4i5z/article30990547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvmShiela1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/in-conversation-with-sheila-james-winner-of-the-outstanding-woman-entrepreneur-of-kerala-award-for-2020/article30990548.ece
296,2020/03/05,Residents protest against revised drainage project,"Residents on the East Hill-Karaparamba stretch of the Mini-bypass have protested against the closure of the link roads following the construction of a drainage for more than two months.

The worst affected are the residents living on either side of Navarang Road. “The vehicular traffic to this residential colony is totally impaired as the service road has been cordoned off to facilitate the trench work of the new drain on the Mini-bypass. Even emergency vehicles such as an ambulance is unable to enter the colony, which is predominantly occupied by senior citizens and dozens of totally bed-ridden patients,” said Ashok Veetil, joint secretary, Navarang Residents’ Association.

Now the civil work has been in a frozen state for weeks together. The issue started when PWD officials introduced some revisions to the original plan, by allowing a spillover exit to a tiny ‘surface drain’ situated on Navarang Road from the under- construction drain.

In fact, the proposal to construct the drain was to carry huge volume of rainwater from the massive underground culvert recently reconstructed on the Mini-bypass that first collects rainwater from the surrounding area starting from West Hill Barracks and then redirects to the Connolly Canal. So, the residents of this area objected to this “unscientific alteration” to the design, said B. Raman and Rimsy Jayan, president and secretary of the association.

Despite petitioning A. Pradeep Kumar, MLA, and ward councillor Beena Rajan, the PWD officials seemed determined to stick to their revised plans. The residents also blamed the councillor for not openly coming forward to help them although she claimed to support the issue.

Over a decade, people in this area were facing flooding during rains. “The last two years were notorious due to the unprecedented rainfall. It is a fact that the locality, which was once a vast open field, has now converted into one of the most populated residential area and the natural drains and streams once existed have mostly vanished on the face of rampant urbanisation,” Mr. Ashok said.

Memorandums have also been submitted to the District Collector and the Commissioner of Police to solve the issue, the residents said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/5xek16/article30987675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04KI-DRAINAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/residents-protest-against-revised-drainage-project/article30987676.ece

298,2020/03/05,College management sets up panel to probe student’s suicide,"PTA vice-president alleges unethical actions by some teachers

The management of Malabar Christian College, Kozhikode, has set up a committee to probe the circumstances that led to the suicide of Jaspreet Singh, a third year student of B.A. Economics on Sunday.

In a release on Wednesday, the manager of the college mourned the death and expressed his concern over the incident. “If any of the staff is found to have committed any errors, legal action will be initiated against them as per the report of the inquiry panel,” the manager said. Jaspreet did not have the attendance as mandated by Calicut University’s regulations to write the final semester exam. His family members have accused the college authorities of being unsympathetic to his plea for a relaxation in the norm. It is learnt that they are now planning to file a complaint with the Chief Minister.

Sabu Mathew, vice-president of the Parent-Teacher Association, sought action against teachers who alleged denied him attendance.

“Jaspreet was a lively student, active in extra-curricular activities. He was a like a guest for the people of Kozhikode. But he lost his life due to the unethical actions of some teachers. They have not even bothered to visit his house,” Mr. Mathew said. He alleged that the PTA had not met after the incident.

Meanwhile, the general secretary of the college union has been included in the three-member panel set up by the college staff council to inquire into the suicide. This followed a demand from activists of the Students Federation of India, its Kozhikode district secretary T. Athul said. The Muslim Students Federation took out a march to the college seeking action against teachers who allegedly denied attendance to Jaspreet.

Varughese Mathew, secretary, Unaided College Principals’ Council, alleged that the practice of condoning lack of attendance, through which students could twice make up for missing days after producing a medical certificate during the course, was illegal and detrimental to academic excellence. This will lead to students not attending classes as attendance was not mandatory, he said.

CB probe sought

Meanwhile, Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee vice-president T. Siddique has sought a Crime Branch probe into the incident.

He told the media here on Wednesday that charges pertaining to abetment of suicide should be registered against Godwin Samraj, the college Principal, and teachers.

Predeep, Professor and Head, Department of Physics, NIT-C, said Vigyan Bharati had introduced innovative methods to make physics understandable, perceivable and enjoyable at the high school and secondary school levels with demonstration experiments in the classroom and informal lab activities outside it.

Vigyan Prasar and the Department of Physics at IIT-Kanpur have jointly developed several innovative open-ended experiments in physics for school students and teachers. Teachers will be trained in the use of these experiments.

Dr. Predeep said the main aim of the workshop was to equip motivated physics teachers at the high school and secondary levels with innovative ideas so that each of them became the focal point in his/her region to spread this teaching methodology. “Many of the teachers who had attended our workshops have now become competent communicators of science education,” he said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/workshop-on-novel-way-of-teaching-physics/article30985442.ece
300,2020/03/05,‘Unarvu’ to provide coffee for late night drivers,"Initiative to prevent rising road accidents in the wee hours

With the cooperation of the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD), the Kera Cabs online taxi service providers and the Karuna Taxi Drivers’ Organisation (KTDO) on Wednesday launched their ‘Unarvu-2020’ scheme to distribute free dry ginger coffee to drivers on the Kozhikode-Thondayad National Highway.

Regional Transport Officer M.P. Subhash Babu opened the project, which was initiated as part of the taxi cab operators’ initiative to mitigate increasing road accidents in the late night hours. The Thondayad bypass was selected for the project considering the highest number of late night accidents on the route.

The project coordinators said similar schemes initiated by the police, youth clubs and other organisations in some of the vulnerable road stretches in Kerala had already evoked a positive response. The drivers too were found appreciating it, they said.

“Members of both Kera Cab and KTDO will be present near the Thondayad junction from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. to serve coffee to the drivers. It will be continuing on an experimental basis for 30 days,” said Jennis John, director, Kera Cabs.

Mr. Jennis said the MVD officials would offer their support at the possible hours to stop the vehicles and request the drivers to cooperate with the voluntary initiative. Apart from this, the participation of politicians, film personalities, socio-cultural activists and artistes would be ensured to make the drive a success, he said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/3jhh79/article30985396.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04KI-UNARVU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/unarvu-to-provide-coffee-for-late-night-drivers/article30985397.ece
301,2020/03/05,No standard norms for parking service,"A uniform fee and a common code of operation to make the private parking service providers more accountable for the safety of parked vehicles are yet to be a reality in the city. Even after recurring thefts in some of the parking slots, the business continues with no proper mechanism to address the grievances of vehicle owners.

Those who manage the parking slots at malls, supermarkets and cinemas do not give any guarantee against theft and damage of the vehicle.

“There should be some legal measures to make these operators accountable for compensating the losses as they charge between₹30 to ₹100 based on the type of vehicles. At first, display boards denying this basic obligation should be banned by the City Corporation,” says Vinod Kumar, a city resident who makes use of a parking facility near S.M. Street everyday.

He also points out that the employees who take care of the parking facilities respond roughly to vehicle owners if they make any complaint.

The practice of letting too many vehicles park in small spaces and haphazard parking often lead to heated arguments between vehicle owners and the employees.

“A look at the parking facility near the railway station is enough to understand the chaotic situation. There were many incidents in which indicator lights and head lamps of the vehicles were broken at the parking slots,” says Prasad Punathil, another city resident.

Those who collect hourly charge for the service are least bothered about their responsibility of ensuring the safety of vehicles and they never care to check even the surveillance cameras to identify the persons who made the damage, he claims.

Meanwhile, the Corporation authorities and the city police say the rules for the service providers will be streamlined with the opening of new multi-level parking facilities controlled directly by the local bodies. As of now, there are two multi-level car parking facilities coming up in the city.

A standard operational code will be formulated for the service providers soon, they add.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/fyfgc9/article30985236.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04KI-PARKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/no-standard-norms-for-parking-service/article30985237.ece

307,2020/03/05,Constitute committee for water management: PIL plea,"Petition says water theft, groundwater exploitation affecting Cumbum Valley farmers

MADURAI

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday ordered notice to the State on a public interest litigation petition that sought a direction to constitute a monitoring committee to oversee water supply to the ayacut lands of Cumbum Valley in Theni district.

A direction was sought to the State to constitute a committee comprising officials of Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board, Public Works Department, Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation and farmers association of the region to monitor water supply.

A Division Bench of Justices P.N. Prakash and B. Pugalendhi ordered notice to the State on the petition filed by T. Vijay Rajan, representing a Theni-based farmers association. The petitioner said that illegal drawing of groundwater in the region should be stopped.

He said that Cumbum Valley had a long history of paddy cultivation. However, the precious resource was increasingly being monetised by unscrupulous persons, which directly affected the supply of water and the livelihood of Cumbum Valley ayacut farmers.

Several representations had been sent to the government regarding the main factors affecting the farmers that included poor water management, insufficient water storage in tanks due to encroachments and poor maintenance, water theft from Periyar river and exploitation of groundwater in the ayacut areas.

In the last 10 years, water theft from Periyar river and excessive drawing of groundwater from ayacut areas to non-ayacut areas had increased, affecting cultivation in the region. Several water cartels had mushroomed and they were exploiting groundwater, the petitioner said.

The theft of water had resulted in crop failures and, in turn, affected the livelihood of the farmers. The modus operandi of the cartel was to buy a piece of land in the ayacut region, drill borewells along with pipelines and draw water.

The petitioner said that the PWD must take steps to stop these illegal acts.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/constitute-committee-for-water-management-pil-plea-madurai-cumbum-valley/article30992834.ece

312,2020/03/05,Man murdered by kin on wedding eve,"In a shocking incident, a 27-year-old man was found murdered on the eve of his wedding at his house near Sivagiri in the district on Thursday.

M. Muniyappan, 27, an earthmover driver and resident of Thenmalai Indra Colony, was all set to marry a girl from Kunnoor in Virudhunagar district on Friday (March 6). His relatives arrived at his home on Wednesday. After dinner, he went to sleep in a room, while his mother, Paranjothi, slept in an adjoining one.

On Thursday morning, she found her son lying in a pool of blood with his throat slashed. Hearing her screams, the relatives rushed into the room. Sivagiri police came to the spot and sent the body for post-mortem.

During investigation, they found bloodstains in the house of Muniyappan’s brother-in-law, Veera Sangilimurugan, and picked him up for interrogation.

Grilled, Veera Sangilimurugan told them that he was not taken to Kunnoor along with other relatives for Muniyappan’s engagement as he was under the influence of alcohol. Agitated by this, he had a heated argument with Muniyappan and others upon their return from the betrothal ceremony.

On Wednesday, he created a ruckus again after consuming liquor in the evening. He was beaten up by Muniyappan and forced to leave the house.

313,2020/03/05,Assistant Professor booked for sexually harassing students,"HC direction forces MSU administration to file police complaint after five years

Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, in a bid to fulfil the direction of the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, has filed a complaint against an Assistant Professor in the Department of History five years after girl students levelled sexual harassment charges against him.

Based on the complaint preferred by Registrar S. Santhosh Baboo, Pettai police have registered a case against Vinod Vincent Rajesh under Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and Section 4 of the Women’s Harassment Act.

When a good number of girl students of the university charged that Vinod Vincent Rajesh was sexually harassing them in 2015 even as he was taking classes for them, the administration did not take any punitive action against him, forcing the students to launch a series of protests on the university premises. As the protests continued despite intimidation by a few people in the administration, the MSU was forced to constitute an internal inquiry committee to probe the sexual harassment charges.

After the committee, comprising R. Kala of the Department of Mathematics, P. Madhava Somasundaram of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice and a few others, inquired the affected students and the witnesses, it recorded in its report that Vinod Vincent Rajesh had used “unprofessional statements” in the classroom.

Since the committee’s findings confirmed the charges levelled by the students against the Assistant Professor, the MSU administration placed him under suspension for a few months and then reinstated him. As he was allowed to work in Nagalapuram Mano College, the affected students objected the move.

Adding fuel to the fire, the MSU Internal Committee, which should have forwarded a complaint against Vinod Vincent Rajesh to the jurisdictional police after a prima facie case existed, did not fulfil the legal obligation, forcing the affected girl students to approach the court that directed the MSU to file a complaint with the police against the accused.

After filing his statement that narrated the ordeals of the girl students with Pettai police, Dr. Santhosh Baboo filed the formal complaint on Wednesday and the police registered the case late in the night.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/assistant-professor-booked-for-sexually-harassing-students-tirunelveli/article30991821.ece

The petitioners said the Tamil Nadu State Co-operative Societies Election Commission had issued a notification for the election to 17 posts of Board of Directors to the Madurai Milk Union. Out of the 17 posts, five was reserved for women, three for SC/ST candidates and the remaining nine for the general category.

It was said that on February 28, 43 nominations were received.

However, it was alleged that the nominations were accepted without proper scrutiny. Subsequently, 13 nominations were declared valid and the rest rejected. On February 29, the 13 candidates were declared elected unopposed, without giving any reasons for the rejection of other nominations. The appointment of two Board of Directors to the union was not challenged.

With the election to the four remaining posts scheduled for March 4, the petitioners sought a direction to stay the election notification. They further sought a direction for conduct of a fresh election in a free and fair manner and appoint an observer to ensure the same.

A Division Bench of Justices S.S. Sundar and C. Saravanan perused the video footage of the nomination process.

Allowing the election to the four remaining posts to be held as per schedule, the court stayed the appointment of 11 Board of Directors who were elected unopposed.

Revenue Minister R. B. Udayakumar said the State government has been working to train the public in disaster-prone areas and establishing effective warning signals in coastal areas to reduce fatalities.

Addressing National Cadet Corps at the Madurai Kamaraj University, he said that they would be kick-starting an effective disaster management skill development training programme for 1,500 students so that they could take the message to the people.

A total of 80 NCC officials attended the programme and trained students. They undertook drills conducted by the Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue departments. They also observed mock drills conducted in case of biological, meteorological and hydrological disasters.

“The State government has included effective responses in cases of disasters in textbooks of school students. We have built 14,347 all-weather homes at a cost of ₹310 crore. As part of the Coastal Disaster Risk Reduction Project, which has been funded by the World Bank, we have created protection centres in coastal areas and installed effective warning systems in places like Velankanni and Cuddalore. The government has taken steps to have underground electrical wiring in disaster prone areas,” he said.

To educate more public, the Revenue Minister urged students to help train people in rural areas to effectively communicate on ways to handle a disaster in a calm and composed manner.

He added that such large-scale conferences had begun in Chennai and Tiruchi and will be held in Tiruvallur and Kanchipuram too.

‘Disaster management meetings will be held in all other districts too,’ he said.

Cooperation Minister Sellur K. Raju said that the State government has the best ability to effectively manage disasters.

Additional Chief Secretary, Revenue and Disaster Management, Atulya Mishra too elaborated on the point and said that the State was a role model in effectively tackling disasters.

Southern Railway undertook a host of new works in and around Mangaluru Junction Railway Station to ease movement of trains, including commissioning of the double line between Junction and Padil stations, on Tuesday.

Mangaluru Junction Railway Station has been a crucial junction where trains from three networks — Southern Railway towards South, South Western Railway towards East, and Konkan Railway towards North — meet. As many as 102 passenger train services pass through the junction in a day.

SR’s construction division has undertaken doubling of track between Mangaluru Junction and Panambur Yard via Padil. At present, doubling work on the 17-km stretch between Junction and Padil, excluding 2 km between Kulashekara and Padil that includes 600 m of Kulashekara tunnel, is complete.

The completion, said a release from SR’s Palakkad division, is bound to ease congestion of trains and facilitate their hassle-free movement. Hitherto, connectivity on this stretch for passenger trains was on a single track while trains were subjected to detention for the passing of goods trains.

Upon commissioning the double track for passenger train on Tuesday night, Train No. 12617 Eranakulam Junction–H. Nizamuddin Mangala Express that left Junction at 10.05 p.m. was the first train dealt on the new double line.

Doubling work between Mangaluru Junction and Panambur (21 km), including the tunnel work, is expected to be over by March next, the release said.

Other works

Meanwhile, SR also executed several improvement works in Junction. Platforms 1 to 3 were extended to accommodate 26 coach trains while provision for two-engine lay-bys was provided to facilitate traction change from diesel to electrical and vice versa.

The existing electronic inter-locking signalling system was replaced with upgraded electronic interlocking and dual visual display units at Mangaluru Junction, the release said. Improvement in signalling eases movement of trains.

Provision was also made for continuous track circuiting between Junction and Padil to ease movement of trains and ensure safety while trip shed and ballast siding were provided at Junction.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/jy00ua/article30985101.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5BGTRAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/sr-commissions-double-line-between-mangaluru-jn-padil/article30985102.ece

The rupee snapped its four-session losing run on Thursday to close 6 paise higher at 73.33 against the U.S. dollar amid hopes that efforts by countries and global agencies would offset financial damage from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

Besides, easing crude oil prices and weakness in the dollar vis-a-vis other key global currencies also helped the rupee build resistance.

At the interbank foreign bank exchange, the domestic unit opened on a positive note, but soon gripped by an intense volatility. During the session, the rupee swung between a high of 73.04 and a low of 73.56 against the American unit.

It finally settled at 73.33, showing a rise of 6 paise over its previous close.

SBI jumped 1.05% following reports that the government has given the go-ahead to the lender and other financial institutions to take over capital-starved Yes Bank.

According to analysts, despite trading significantly higher through the day on positive global cues, market failed to hold on to most gains as domestic investors turned increasingly risk averse amid rising cases of coronavirus in the country.

One more case of novel coronavirus was reported in the national capital region on Thursday, taking the total number in the country to 30 so far, including 16 Italian tourists.

330,2020/03/05,Caught in a bureaucratic web,"For Assam residents, the process became the punishment while proving citizenship before courts and tribunals

The Gauhati High Court declared Sahijuddin a foreigner on November 13, 2015. He had appealed to the High Court against an ex-parte order of the Foreigners Tribunal in Kokrajhar declaring him a foreigner. Mr. Sahijuddin was too poor to afford the services of a lawyer and was not represented before the Tribunal. The High Court found this reason unconvincing and stripped him of his citizenship without even examining the documents he possessed. Mr. Sahijuddin is one of 1.17 lakh people who were declared foreigners by Foreigners Tribunals (as on March 31, 2019), quasi-judicial bodies in Assam that decide questions of citizenship.

In this article, the authors discuss the problems with how appeals from Foreigners Tribunals cases are decided by the Gauhati High Court, based on an analysis of 787 such orders and judgments between 2010 and 2019.

Of the cases analysed, 41% of the appeals were from Morigaon, Barpeta, and Goalpara, none of which share a border with Bangladesh. Around 35% of these appeals were from ex-parte orders of Foreigners Tribunals i.e., without hearing the person accused of being a foreigner.

Ex-parte judgments

Unlike Mr. Sahijuddin, when Bhanu Biswas received a notice, he hired a lawyer and provided him with all the necessary documentation to prove his Indian citizenship before the Foreigners Tribunal. Mr. Biswas stopped following up with his lawyer after 2009. When the police came to his house to take him to a detention camp in May 2011, Mr. Biswas realised he had been declared a ‘foreigner’ through an ex-parte judgment in 2003. In a further twist, Mr. Biswas found out that his lawyer had died sometime in the two years prior to his arrest. He was subsequently declared a foreigner by the Gauhati High Court on September 22, 2015.

The burden of proof under the Foreigners Act, 1946 is on the person accused of being a foreigner. If the person accused does not appear before the Tribunal, they will be declared a foreigner without the state having to prove their case. In 99% of the appeals from ex-parte orders of the Foreigners Tribunals, the High Court agreed with the findings of the Tribunals. All the persons who appealed to the High Court had some form of documentation. Around 61% of them produced electoral rolls and 39% of them produced permanent residence certificates/certificates from the panchayat. In 66% of the cases, the Foreigners Tribunals found the documentation unsatisfactory. In 38% of the cases, documentation was rejected because spellings did not match and in 71% of them, the secondary evidence was deemed inadmissible. This means that where people had produced copies of documents, these were not certified copies or the person who had created the document could not certify its contents.

The process is particularly harsh on women. Women who do not have birth certificates and get married before registering as voters do not have any document linking them to their parents. The Supreme Court in Rupajan Begum vs. Union of India allowed a certificate from the gram panchayat secretary to be submitted as a link document to prove descent from a person who entered India before March 24, 1971. However, wherever this certificate is produced as evidence, the gram panchayat secretary needs to testify in person. This standard of proof is quite difficult to meet, given that gram panchayat secretaries change over time. In 99% of the cases where such a document was produced, the person was declared a foreigner.

Detention and deportation

Overall, in 97% of the appeals before the High Court, the person was declared a foreigner. In 15% of these cases, the High Court ordered deportation. Amongst the remaining cases, in 1%, the Court ordered that the person be sent to a detention centre, and in 80% of the cases, the Court did not specify what steps were to be taken. In a majority of cases, the High Court instructed the Border Police or the Foreigners Tribunal to “do the needful.” It is not clear what the Border Police or Foreigners Tribunals did thereafter. Although the Foreigners Act provides for a range of non-custodial options such as restrictions on residence, the prohibition of certain kinds of work, etc, the High Court appears to prefer detention and deportation.

The question of citizenship is nestled in a confusing tangle of documents, bureaucracy, and legal procedures which Foreigners Tribunals and the Gauhati High Court are tasked with resolving. In doing so, courts need to avoid an overly legalistic approach which ignores fundamental contradictions between lived experiences of identity documentation and evidentiary requirements.

331,2020/03/05,Trump 2.0 may see more slash-and-burn unilateralism,"India should be prepared for more arbitrary duties

Not since Richard Nixon’s 24-hour state visit 50 years ago has a U.S. President spent as little time on Indian soil as Donald Trump did.

During that first term in office, Nixon had proceeded to throw the international monetary order under the bus — tearing down the gold-dollar link that had sustained the Bretton Woods system. With equal alacrity, Mr. Trump has gone about gutting the international trading order with his beggar-thy-neighbour mercantilism and flagrant disregard for multilateral trade law. Given India’s post-1990 globalising reforms and the imperative for an enabling and development-friendly external environment, the country will find it hard to escape unscathed.

The government has already, fleetingly, been burnt by Mr. Trump’s slash-and-burn unilateralism. In March 2018, ‘national security’ tariffs of 25% and 10% were imposed on $1.01 billion worth of Indian steel and aluminium exports, respectively.

‘National security’ claim

This use of Section 232(b)-based ‘national security’ authority was clearly at odds with WTO/GATT law, which requires that such action be “taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations” and should touch upon the member state’s “essential security interests.” The tariffs were followed by New Delhi’s eviction from the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme in June 2019 — in turn, affecting an additional $5.7 billion of exports.

In December 2019, Mr. Trump took his wrecking ball to Geneva, incapacitating the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) dispute settlement function. As a result, a successful Indian challenge against the U.S.’s imposition of countervailing duties against Indian steel exports, which was pending a final compliance panel appeal, has now been kicked into the long grass. With the U.S. Commerce Department recently publishing a new — and wildly WTO non-complaint — regulation that treats an undervalued currency as a countervailable subsidy, more such arbitrarily arrogated duties on Indian primary goods exports can be expected.

On February 10, at the same time as the White House was announcing Mr. Trump’s visit, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) was stripping India of its ‘developing country’ classification for ‘special and differentiated treatment’ purposes. A U.S.-European Union-Japan led effort is currently under way to introduce stark new industrial subsidies and technology transfer disciplines that will inevitably crimp India’s development policy space — even as the trio luxuriate in multi-billion-dollar trade distorting agricultural subsidies.

More punitive action

“We can have a trade deal with India, but I’m saving the big deal for later on … we’re not treated well by India, but I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot.” Similar words were uttered by Mr. Trump prior to his Section 301 exaction on China. It matters not to Washington that these unilateral 301 duties violate the very first two articles of WTO/GATT law.

With WTO dispute settlement having been disembowelled, should Mr. Trump get re-elected, the Narendra Modi government could well be staring at punitive Section 301 action. It has escaped the Section 301 dragnet during Mr. Trump’s first term — despite the USTR’s inclinations, owing to the agency’s lack of time and bandwidth. The government may not be as fortunate next time. It must brace for its consequences and craft next moves wisely.

In addition to winnowing the bilateral trade deficit, Commerce Ministry mandarins would be well-advised to thumb through the intellectual property, technology transfer, financial services and agricultural biotechnology product approvals-related chapters of the U.S.-China Phase One agreement.

332,2020/03/05,What Kejriwal should have done,"The Delhi Chief Minister’s lack of response and status quo-ist stance led to further spread of violence

That we should be at a loss for words is understandable. It should be no surprise if ordinary citizens were struck dumb by the brazenness with which the violence in Delhi was instigated, then perpetrated, and the participation — active or passive –— by those who are sworn to protect us. However, there is little explanation for the verbal caution exercised by those who claim to represent citizens — MLAs and MPs, foremost among them Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.

It was on the strength of the word, after all, that they rode into power. They gave tongue to promises of battling corruption. They know how to frame services — water, electricity, education, women’s safety — as a matter of rights. They are not ignorant of what ails us, or what the remedies might be. How, then, should we interpret the lassitude of the political response in Delhi?

How they failed to act

On the strength of the same tongue, Mr. Kejriwal could have prevented or minimised the loss of life and property in Delhi. When politicians affiliated with rival parties were making threats, he could have activated his cadre and motivated them to stand guard. Hours after goons were reported burning parts of northeast Delhi, he remained silent. He could have stepped in, with the security that is due to him as Chief Minister. It was inevitable that the violence would recede. If the police refused to listen, his Ministers could have organised citizen patrols. They have the support of millions, after all. If even one per cent of these supporters had been encouraged to organise themselves into patrol groups, the violence would have been contained.

If he could not do even this, Mr. Kejriwal could have made a speech in any public spot that was not on fire — perhaps during that infamous visit to Mahatma Gandhi’s memorial? He could have said that citizens have the right to work hard to improve their own economic status without having their homes set on fire merely because they followed a particular religion. He could have said that peaceful protest is an inalienable democratic right. If he had said it before, or even after winning the State Assembly, it may have given pause to millions of people who were being told repeatedly that protesters deserved to be attacked simply for opposing the policies of the Central government. After all, Mr. Kejriwal himself has, in the past, done everything in his power to topple those elected to Parliament.

Speaking up for the oppressed

When he saw footage of CCTV cameras being smashed to prevent the recording of evidence while students were attacked in libraries, he could have said that his government would, anyhow, make sure that the guilty were punished. He could have said that his government would ensure that mosques are re-built, and that interfaith meetings will be held every single day until the community can find its way back to harmony. He could say, even now, that we must resist ghettoisation, for it can only lead to a greater gulf between communities. He could say that ghettoisation is not just the outcome but the purpose of such violence, that it is venom in the body of our republic.

He could say to doctors: treat riot victims gently, and do post mortems honestly. He could say to teachers: counsel children so that they may not be drawn to future acts of violence, and may learn not to discriminate. He could say to members of Residents’ Welfare Associations: for India’s sake, stop discriminating. He could even ask that meetings be conducted in every colony to discuss the imperative of citizenship, and understand why so many Indians are feeling vulnerable.

There is a long list of things that need saying, urgently, but beyond taciturn appeals for peace — and those worded in miserly fashion — nothing has been said or done that demonstrates true leadership. The crisis in Delhi, and all over India, is that our leaders appear to think that their role is limited to winning elections. When they speak, they weigh their words against the weight of public opinion. They act as if they were a mirror for potential voters, however ill-informed, self-serving, narrow-minded the latter be.

The notion that a leader is someone who ‘leads’, in thought and in deed, seems to have collapsed. There is no Gandhi or Nehru, Ram Manohar Lohia or Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi — men willing to risk the displeasure of caste groups, their own party members, or the fury of a mob. There is no Amrit Kaur or Aruna Asaf Ali either. Can we imagine that any one of these leaders would have sat around tweeting ‘peace’ during last week’s events in Delhi? Would they have drawn a polite curtain of silence over the behaviour of the police force?

Failing to walk the talk

A leader is not a status quoist. A leader gives direction to public morality, gives voice and shape to new ideas that challenge an ailing system. In India, the only leadership in evidence lately has been to the far right of the political spectrum. There, we see leaders, some of them voicing dangerous ideas that run counter to democratic values like equality and freedom of speech. The parties belonging to the rest of the spectrum, including broadly centrist parties like the Congress, have watched, waiting to see whether or not voters buy into the rhetoric, and often followed suit instead of leading in a different direction.

Those who claim to be leaders of a new sort of politics are not leading people into the sunshine of universal love and brotherhood. They are not leading any marches. They are not going door to door, demanding that people give up hate. They are not writing to their voters, explaining the dangers posed by legalised inequity, reminding them of the world’s history of apartheid, of racism and resistance. They are not acting on reports that document widespread bigotry in the police force, so they may challenge and address it through institutional means. Instead, they are repeating exhausted tropes such as demanding answers in Parliament, when it is already clear that it does not help stem violence.

Therefore here we are, stuck with a polity where electricity may be cheap, but acid is freely available for use against dissenting students and religious minorities; where CCTVs stand aghast and rioters record their own crimes on high resolution mobile phone cameras; where data packages are cheaper than books and online rape threats abound; where the bodies of murder victims lie rotting in drains in the national capital and citizens are encouraged to take pride in a clean India.

333,2020/03/05,Advantage Bibi: On Israel’s third election in 12 months,"Another term for Netanyahu bodes ill for West Asia and Palestinians

No bloc managed to win a clear majority in Monday’s Israeli parliamentary election, the third in 12 months, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has emerged the clear leader to bid for government formation. When 99% of the votes were counted, his Likud party won 36 seats, while its rival, former General Benny Gantz’s Blue and White got 33. The Prime Minister’s right-religious coalition, which includes Shas, United Torah Judaism and Yamina, has 58 seats, three short of a majority in the 120-member Knesset. Yisrael Beiteinu, led by secular nationalist Avigdor Lieberman — kingmaker after the last two polls but who chose not to support any side — got 7 seats. For Mr. Netanyahu, this was a referendum of sorts. If he fought the last two polls under the threat of being charged for corruption, this time he had already been charged. He is expected to appear in court later this month. Still, Likud improved its tally from 32 in September to 36 now. While Mr. Netanyahu, as leader of the largest party and the coalition, is expected to be invited to form the government, it will not be easy for him to prove a majority in Parliament. Mr. Gantz has ruled out a unity government under Mr. Netanyahu’s leadership. Mr. Lieberman too has dismissed joining the Likud coalition, not wanting to share power with the bloc’s Jewish religious parties. The Joint List, the coalition of Arab parties, has won 15 seats, but Israel’s mainstream Zionist parties will not have any tie-up with them.

Despite these challenges, there are two factors favouring Mr. Netanyahu. One, unlike the September election in which Mr. Gantz’s party got more seats, this time only Mr. Netanyahu is in the race to form the government. It is either a Likud government or a fourth poll. Second, after three back-to-back elections, some rival lawmakers could actually back Mr. Netanyahu’s claim to avoid another round of polling. Likud leaders have already signalled that their coalition would prove a majority in the Knesset with dissenters’ votes. While Mr. Netanyahu remains the only option for providing Israel a stable government, his return to power with a majority could spell more trouble for the Palestinians. The peace process has been stalled for years. The Palestinians have rejected the U.S.’s peace plan, which they say favours the Israeli positions. During the campaign, Mr. Netanyahu had pledged to annex Jewish settlements on the Palestinian West Bank. If his coalition returns to power with a clear majority, he is likely to press ahead with the annexation, deepening the crisis. If he fails to win the vote of confidence, Israel will go to another election and during the campaign, Mr. Netanyahu and his allies will step up their right-wing agenda and attacks on the Palestinians, like they did during the last two campaigns. Either way, troubled times lie ahead for the region.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/advantage-bibi-the-hindu-editorial-on-israels-third-election-in-12-months/article30984753.ece
334,2020/03/05,Rights or wrong?: On U.N. rights body move against CAA,"U.N. body’s CAA move may be unwarranted, but govt. must abide by its equal protection duty

The application on behalf of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, seeking to be heard as amicus curiae in the pending litigation in the Supreme Court against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, is undoubtedly an unusual step. As expected, the government sees it as unwarranted interference. It does appear that the move is unnecessary as the global human rights perspective that High Commissioner Michelle Bachelet Jeria hopes to present is most likely to be raised by some of the petitioners themselves. After all, most of the 140-odd petitions argue that the CAA fails to extend the equal protection of law to all immigrants in the country. But, to be fair, the High Commissioner is not seeking to be a petitioner. On the contrary, she is offering the undoubted expertise that the premier U.N. body possesses in aid of the Court. She has appreciated the amendment’s positive side, noting its potential to redress the “irregular” condition of some migrants through a quicker citizenship process. It must be noted that the Court has relied on principles contained in international legal instruments in some of its judgments. The moot question is whether the U.N. High Commissioner ought to be given an opportunity to assist the Court in the matter, or whether, even without such assistance, the Court will countenance arguments based on the salutary provisions of international conventions that India is a party to. Needless to say, the amicus brief may not be necessary in the latter situation.

The Modi government may be unhappy with the U.N. rights body’s “overreach”, but it will have to be underscored that the CAA’s flawed structure and the aggressive manner in which it was initially linked with a post-implementation exercise to purge the country of illegal immigrants have contributed to the present situation. The political Opposition, sections of the legal fraternity, academicians and commentators have made a strong case that making religion a factor to include certain categories for a fast-tracked naturalisation process is violative of secular principles. The government’s stout defence of the CAA is that no current Indian citizen would be affected, and that it was meant to help persecuted minorities in countries where Islam was the state religion. In addition to having to discharge the burden of proving that the CAA does not contravene the Constitution, the government would have to demonstrate that it is not in violation of provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Ms. Bachelet’s application marshalls significant aspects of global humanitarian law to buttress her point. The Court may probably not take her assistance, but there is little doubt that the Centre cannot evade its obligation to enact non-discriminatory legislation, grant all migrants equal protection and abide by the non-derogable principle of non-refoulement.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rights-or-wrong-the-hindu-editorial-on-un-rights-body-moving-supreme-court-against-caa/article30984751.ece
335,2020/03/05,"No contribution to State’s revenue from IT, says CM","Information Technology continues to be the largest revenue earner to the exchequer, contributing approximately 25%, and that makes State’s GDP and per capita income much higher compared to other States. However, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa pointed out in his Budget presentation: “As there is tax exemption for export of IT services, there is no contribution to the State’s revenue collections, from this sector.” Karnataka’s IT market contributes revenues to the tune of over $80 bn worth software services and products.

He further said the State had 34% share in the country’s $60 bm bio-economy, which is expected to reach $100 bn by 2025. The government would commission an in-depth study for drawing a roadmap and strategy to up this contribution to 50% by 2025, he said.

In order to create a conducive environment for businesses, the State would set up a Centre of Excellence for “internet of ethical things” in collaboration with the World Economic Forum, Davos, and other stakeholders.

“We will provide a financial assistance of ₹30 crore in five years to support this centre. A grant of ₹7.5 crore will be provided during the current fiscal,” said the Chief Minister.

An ‘Artificial Intelligence Research Translation Park’ is proposed to be set up in association with the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. This is expected to promote AI-Research, AI-Innovation, AI-Commercialisation, Pilot Project Implementation, along with development of 5G technology. “For this purpose, a corpus grant of ₹60 crore will be provided during next three years,”' said Mr. Yediyurappa, who also holds the finance portfolio.

The state also proposes the development of a new software to support e-market system under the Deen Dayal Anthyodaya Scheme- National Urban Livelihood Mission. This system would enable street vendors in urban areas to carry out business through mobile application.

Aimed at boosting the holistic growth of the state and also to address technical challenges of various critical sectors, the government proposes to open a Centre of Excellence for Efficiency Augmentation, in collaboration of STPI. This will come up at an investment outlay of Rs 30 crore.

To ensure ease of doing business and expedite delivery of services to entrepreneurs in the state, the budget proposes to bring all key services provided by KIADB and KSSIDC, such as allotment of land, approval of plan, lease cum sale deed, sale deed etc under “Sakala”.

To help individual citizens obtain information quickly under Right to Information Act, a special software, ``Mahiti Kanaja” will be developed and implemented, proposed the budget.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/no-contribution-to-states-revenue-from-it-says-cm/article30994165.ece
336,2020/03/05,COVID-19: Govt. steps in to check inflated price of masks,"Warns dealers against creating artificial shortage

The government has warned of strict action against dealers creating artificial shortage of N95 masks and also selling them at exorbitant prices in the State.

“If anyone finds that masks are sold over and above the maximum retail price, they can call 104 Arogyavani (helpline) and lodge a complaint with specific details. We will initiate action against the dealers/medical store owners through the State Drugs Controller,” said Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey.

This follows several complaints from people about the non-availability and soaring prices of masks in stores. “We will not allow anyone to take undue advantage of the situation and make profits by fleecing people. People can call our helpline and complain. Action will be initiated,” he said.

Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar said it is not required for everyone to use N95 masks unless they have symptoms. “The State has adequate stock of the masks — 40,000 N95 and four lakh triple-layered apart from the required stocks of medicine. There is no need for people to panic,” he said.

Apart from those with symptoms, N95 masks are mainly for doctors, paramedical staff and other health staff in hospitals, who will handle patients.

On the increasing flow of patients in hospitals for screening, he said only those who have symptoms and have returned from COVID-19 affected countries in the last 14 days or have been in contact with those with travel history will be tested. Those who meet the above criteria can call 104 helpline and request for a test, he said.

The Health Department also had a meeting with private hospitals on Thursday to update them on the recent developments pertaining to COVID-19 and seek their active participation in handling the situation. “They have agreed to support the government in battling the disease, in case of an outbreak,” the Commissioner said.

Circular

Meanwhile, the Labour Department has issued a circular asking all employers to grant mandatory paid leave of 28 days to COVID-19 infected persons. Those covered under the Employees’ State Insurance (ESI) should obtain a certificate from their Medical Superintendent of their jurisdictional hospital.

“Doctors in ESI hospitals should attend to the infected persons without any delay and give them certificates to facilitate their immediate isolation. On producing the certificate, the employers should immediately grant them 28 days paid leave. This will help in ensuring the infection does not spread to others. Those not covered under ESI should be permitted to avail sick leave and other leave for 28 days,” the circular said.

Reports awaited

Five persons, who travelled from COVID-19 affected countries and showed symptoms, have been admitted to hospitals in Bengaluru, Udupi and Bidar since Wednesday. These five include an Iranian national, whose samples tested negative on Wednesday. He is under observation at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD). The reports of the remaining admitted cases are awaited, said officials.

B.G. Prakash, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), said till date, 695 persons have been identified for observation. Of them, 225 persons have completed 28 days of observation and 461 persons are continuing under home quarantine. These include persons who have travelled to COVID-19 affected countries and had contacts with COVID-19 positive cases.

Till date, 321 samples of symptomatic persons have been sent for testing and 273 samples have tested negative. A total of 68,717 passengers have been screened in Karnataka so far. These include 46,569 passengers in Kempegowda International Airport and 22,139 passengers in Mangaluru International Airport.

337,2020/03/05,"IMA case: HC deplores State’s attitude of not giving office space, powers to officer","He has written many letters to Chief Secretary on the urgent needs of the newly created post

Deploring the attitude of the State government in not providing office space, required staff, and financial and administrative powers to the newly created post of Special Officer and Competent Authority (CA) for I Monetary Advisory (IMA) cases, the High Court of Karnataka on Thursday directed the Chief Secretary to look into the issue on priority.

“This is a very sorry state of affairs by the State government when the issue involved is related to lakhs of investors affected by the scam,” a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi said in its interim order on PIL petitions related to the IMA case.

Senior IAS officer Harsh Gupta, who is the Special Officer and CA for the IMA cases, in his affidavit had brought to the notice of the court that he had written to the Chief Secretary on February 12 reminding about the urgent need for an office space, staff, vehicles, approval of budget and release of amounts, grant of powers under the civil services, delegation of financial powers, and so on to the newly created post.

“The work of the competent authority, which has been hampered for the last few months owing to the above requirements, has now come to a standstill for the last many days as even basic infrastructure and delegation of powers of running an independent office have been lacking...,” Mr. Gupta had said in his third letter to the Chief Secretary.

The Bench directed the Chief Secretary to ensure that all these requirements of the office of the Special Officer and CA are met within a month, while cautioning that the court may have to take stringent action for failure to comply with the requirements.

Online validation

On steps taken to receive claims from IMA investors, Mr. Gupta said that the online claim application having features of real-time validation of Aadhaar number, mobile number, ration card number, and client ID with IMA has been developed and put up for feedback from the investors. A website — imaclaims.karnataka.gov.in — has been internationalised to provide information to depositors about the claim process and for collecting feedback, and a class centre and help desk (080-46885959) has also been operationalised, it has been said in Mr. Gupta’s affidavit.

Meanwhile, the Bench directed the Union government to ensure grant of permission for Aadhaar validation as it was pointed out in the affidavit that the State’s committee recommended to the Union government for Aadhaar validation four months ago and it may take about a month’s time as the ministry concerned was framing rules for granting permission.

CBI’s plea

Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal has been accused of dowry harassment by his wife of more than 10 years.

In her complaint to the Koramangala police on February 28, Priya Bansal alleged that her in-laws too had been harassing her mentally and physically ever since the marriage. She said the family started demanding more money from her after the couple’s son was born.

FIR registered

The police are yet to question the accused but based on the complaint, they have filed an FIR charging Mr. Bansal, his father Sat Prakash Agarwal, his mother Kiran Bansal and brother Nitin for dowry harassment.

In her complaint, Ms. Bansal said her husband had physically assaulted her. “She said she married Sachin in February 2008. At the time, her parents spent ₹50 lakh on the wedding and gave the family ₹11 lakh in cash instead of a car,” said a police officer, quoting from the FIR.

339,2020/03/05,Film city in Bengaluru: Worries over location crop up,"It is final: the proposed film city will be in Bengaluru. After much confusion as to where the ambitious film city will be located, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced that a film city of “global standards in Karnataka will be established with private participation at Bengaluru at ₹500 crore.”

With this, the long-winding journey of the proposed film city, which went from Ramanagaram to Mysuru, has settled in Bengaluru. This was also one of the requests that actor Yash, who was the guest of honour at Bengaluru International Film Festival, put forth to the Chief Minister.

But where can the project come up has certain sections worried. Earlier proposals made to establish a film city in Hesarghatta and Roerich estate in Tataguni drew sharp criticism.

Artist Suresh Kumar G., who has been vocal against the proposal of setting up a film city in Tataguni, said not just environmentalists, even artists are against the idea. “We don’t know where the government plans to set it up. But lung spaces such as Tataguni should be protected, given that we have so few left – such as Cubbon Park and Lalbagh,” he said.

“Existing spaces for artists – auditoriums, university spaces – are underutilised. So why in the name of art are they coming up with this proposal? And why only in Bengaluru? This is only for tourism. Technically, with the advances in graphics and other aspects, there is no necessity of one,” he added.

Environmentalists, who were signatories to a letter to the CM against Hesarghatta being a possible location echoed the same thoughts. “Film-makers prefer using real locations. Why consider an eco-sensitive zone as a location? If it turns out to be Hesarghatta, we will go to court,” said one of them.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/film-city-in-bengaluru-worries-over-location-crop-up/article30994096.ece
340,2020/03/05,Family reunion at Andaman turns sour after travel agency dupes customers,"48 members were left stranded for four days

A family reunion at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands turned out to be a nightmare for 48 people, who realised that they had been cheated by the travel agency a day after they checked into their hotel.

They later told the police that they were stranded for four days and allegedly spent two days in the hotel lounge. “The hotel where they were booked by the agency asked them to check out for non-payment of bills,” said the police.

Siddalinga S., a project manager with a private firm in Bengaluru, who planned the trip for his mother and relatives, said: “I paid ₹9 lakh to the agency for a four-day trip that included food and accommodation. But the agency neither paid the hotel nor did it book our return tickets.”

With limited funds, the victims contacted some of their friends in the city who approached the police for help. “We tracked down the owner of the agency, Arul Prasad, and made him buy tickets for 13 members to return to Bengaluru. The others managed on their own funds,” said a police officer with the Banaswadi station.

After returning to Bengaluru, some members of the family lodged a complaint with the police. “We filed an FIR and arrested Prasad for cheating on February 28,” the officer said. The accused, Prasad, promised to return the money and issued cheques, but they allegedly bounced.

“We got together to go to Andaman for a memorable holiday, but it was memorable for all the wrong reasons,” said one of the members.

According to the police, the agency has a history of cheating people. “Others too have approached us seeking a refund for trips planned through the agency,” the police added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/family-reunion-at-andaman-turns-sour-after-travel-agency-dupes-customers/article30994094.ece
341,2020/03/05,"Bengaluru gets ₹9,771 crore for ‘comprehensive development’","Effective solid waste management and improving road network get emphasis

With an allocation of ₹9,771 crore for the “comprehensive development” of Bengaluru, the State Budget 2020-21 has laid emphasis on effective solid waste management and improving road network.

While ₹8,772 crore has been allocated overall for Bengaluru, ₹999 crore has been earmarked under ‘Shubhra Bengaluru’ to make the city a model in solid waste management in the country.

Impetus has been given to improving civic infrastructure though the Budget has been criticised for lack of clarity in the allocation made to different departments.

Founder-president of Citizens’ Action Forum N.S. Mukunda said the Budget seems like a statement of expenses and receipts, with no new schemes being announced for the city.

Around 190 km of road network under 12 high-density zones that contribute to 80% of traffic congestion will be developed under the supervision of Karnataka Road Development Corporation Ltd. (KRDCL) at an estimated ₹500 crore.

The BWSSB is executing the project to provide drinking water and develop underground drainage systems in 110 villages within the BBMP’s limits. However, this has resulted in deterioration of roads. A total of ₹1,000 crore has been earmarked for the development of roads in these areas, of which ₹500 crore will be released this fiscal.

The BBMP had sought ₹11,000 crore for various projects in the city. BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said the civic body will utilise the remaining funds under the ‘Mukhyamantrigala Nava Nagaroththana’ scheme this year. Under the scheme, ₹8,344 crore was to be utilised over a period of two years. “Of this, the State government has released around ₹1,381 crore. We will utilise the remaining this year,” he said and added that the government has sanctioned around ₹8,000 crore to the BBMP in the 2020-21 Budget.

One of the projects that the BBMP hoped would find mention was construction of railway overbridges/railway underbridges at level crossings. However, this finds no mention in the Budget.

According to Harish Kumar from Namma Bengaluru Foundation, how the funds allocated get expended should be explained in public domain. That apart, chunks of Bengaluru’s budget are spent by different civic agencies. “It is critical that the Bengaluru Metropolitan Planning Committee, the overarching body that integrates this inter-sectoral spending, is strengthened immediately,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-gets-9771-crore-for-comprehensive-development/article30994091.ece
342,2020/03/05,Suburban rail gets ₹500 crore; Namma Metro to be opened for private investment,"The State government’s allocation of ₹500 crore for Bengaluru’s suburban rail in the 2020-21 Budget has given a much-needed shot in the arm for the public transport project that has been languishing for years.

In past Budgets — both State and Union — the project only found a mention with meagre allocations. Both governments have been under pressure from various quarters to allocate funds and start implementing it.

Sanjeev Dyamannavar, an advocate for a robust suburban rail network, said: “The government’s allocation is welcome. Now, the onus is on the Centre to give final clearance so that it gets implemented.”

As per the Union Budget, to implement the 148-km suburban rail network with 57 stations, both the Centre and State had agreed to provide 20% equity each. The Centre will facilitate external assistance up to 60% of the project cost, which is estimated at ₹18,600 crore. The project is now pending before the Centre for final approval.

Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE) had announced that out of the four corridors rail network from KSR Bengaluru to Devenhalli will be taken up first for implementation. The line will benefit people travelling to Kempegowda International Airport, and requires an initial investment of Rs 1000 crore.

Namma Metro

In a major move, the State government has opened the door for private-public partnership for Namma Metro. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa in his Budget said that Hebbal to J.P. Nagar (ORR) and Magadi Road ‘Metrolite’ projects will be taken up under the PPP model. The total length of the network will be 44 km. The government is likely to implement the project under phase III of Namma Metro.

BMRCL managing director Ajay Seth said keeping in mind Bengaluru’s growth and also Namma Metro’s expansion, there is a need to look at different options like PPPs. “The city requires a much larger network of Namma Metro. By 2024, we will have a network of 172 km of metro but it will not be enough. We need a lot more for a growing city,” he said.

He pointed out that other cities such as Hyderabad, Nagpur and Pune have exercised these options. “Every project need not be funded out of budget allocation alone as the investment required is huge. The PPP model will be a feasible option,”Mr. Seth added.

Mr. Yediyurappa also announced that the construction of the 56-km long Outer Ring Road to Kempegowda International Airport via K.R. Puram and Hebbal will commence in 2020-21. Commercial operation of the extended metro line on Mysuru Road and Kanakapura Road wuold start this year.

BMTC gets funding for buses

The State Budget has made provisions for loan subsidy for Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) to purchase 1,500 diesel buses, which is estimated to cost ₹600 crore. The government will provide ₹100 crore every year for a period of seven years in the form of loan subsidy.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa also announced that BMTC will operate 500 electric buses which is likely to be on a lease basis similar to the model adopted by the Centre’s FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid & Electric Vehicles in India) initiative. A total of ₹100 crore will be provided for this.

“BMTC seems to be getting financial support for 1,500 regular buses and 500 electric buses. However, it had earlier mentioned that 1,300 old buses have to be phased out, which means that there will be net increase of probably 700 new buses which is welcome but insufficient,” said Vinay Sreenivasa of Bus Prayanikara Vedike.

He also demanded the State government extend the free bus pass facility announced for 1 lakh garment workers to others who afford higher fares. “Reducing the fares across the board would have been far more effective and beneficial for a wider population who faces financial hardships because of high bus fares. BMTC should have been provided additional grants to implement a substantial fare reduction to benefit the city better,” Mr Sreenivasa said in a press release.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/suburban-rail-gets-500-crore-namma-metro-to-be-opened-for-private-investment/article30994007.ece
343,2020/03/05,"Karnataka Budget 2020-21: Bengaluru gets over ₹8,700 crore","It has been set aside for overall city development

Reiterating his government’s commitment to overall development of Bengaluru, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, who also holds the Bengaluru Development portfolio, has set aside a lion’s share in the 2020-21 Budget that was presented on Thursday.

Over ₹8,700 crore has been set aside for various departments, including Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB).

Mr. Yediyurappa has underscored the need for a Municipal Corporation Act, specific to Bengaluru, given that the nature of problems and issues in the city that pose a major challenge to administrative management.

In 2019-20, an action plan for different works at ₹8,344 under ‘Mukhyamantrigala Nava Nagaroththana’ scheme was introduced. The same will be implemented this fiscal. That apart, work with a grant of ₹999 crore for solid waste management under ‘Shubhra Bengaluru’ will be implemented this year.

Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. in partnership with BBMP has proposed to establish a new 11.5 MW capacity “Waste to Energy” plant at Bidadi in Ramanagara District at an estimated cost of ₹210 crore. Around 70 million units of power will be generated annually in this project, which will help management of segregated waste generated in the city.

To prevent sewage from entering lakes, ₹100 crore has been set aside under the ‘Shubhra Bengaluru’ scheme, while ₹317 crore has been earmarked for the development of lakes under the ‘Mukhyamantrigala Nava Nagaroththana’ scheme. These allocations have been made to protect the water bodies in the city and convert them into green locations for flora and fauna.

To prevent flooding during the monsoon and to fill the missing gaps in the major storm water drain network, grants amounting to ₹200 crore have been allocated.

Civic infrastructure

Impetus has been given to improving civic infrastructure. In his speech, Mr. Yediyurappa stated that the construction of 56-km long Outer Ring Road – Airport Metro from Central Silk Board junction to Bengaluru International Airport via K.R. Puram and Hebbala at an estimated cost of ₹14,500 crore will be taken up this fiscal.

With an aim to reduce traffic congestion, a comprehensive mobility programme for Bengaluru had been prepared for the first time. Infrastructure facilities, transit based development and essential regulatory measures will be taken up with an objective of increasing the utilization of public transport from 48% to 73%. That apart, action will be taken to increase the transport capacity in Hebbala, Silk Board and K.R. Puram junctions in Bengaluru which are afflicted by critical traffic congestion. Around 190-kms of road under 12 high density zones contribute 80% of traffic congestion. These roads will be developed under the supervision of Karnataka Road Development Corporation Ltd. (KRDCL) at an estimated ₹500 crore.

BWSSB is executing a project to provide drinking water and develop underground drainage systems in 110 villages in BBMP’s limits. However, this has resulted in deterioration of roads. A total of ₹1,000 crore has been earmarked for development of roads in these areas, of which Rs. 500 crore will be released this fiscal.

Water supply

In addition to rejuvenation of water sources from the T.G. Halli project, it is possible to utilize 1.7 TMC water for Bengaluru city drinking water supply, Mr. Yediyurappa said in his speech.This project will be completed by the end of September 2021, he said.

The BWSSB’s sewage water treatment capacity, which was at 721 million litres during 2016-17 has increased to 1,137 million litres by the end of 2019-20. It is targeted to increase the capacity to 1,587 million litres by 2020-21.

Old sewage treatment plants will be rejuvenated and modernised at ₹1,000 crore. This, Mr. Yediyurappa claimed, would make possible the treatment of all sewage generated in the city.

The Budget proposes the completion of the 5th Phase of Cauvery Water Supply scheme at ₹5,550 crore. This will enable the water utility to supply 775 million litres of water to the city.

Following a techie from Bengaluru testing positive for COVID-19 in Hyderabad, Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) saw an increased patient flow on Wednesday, while pharmacies saw a spike in demand for masks and hand sanitisers.

RGICD director C. Nagaraj said more than 110 patients lined up at the hospital for tests out of panic. “Although we have got additional doctors and paramedical staff deployed at the hospital, we have asked the department to provide a few more doctors and nursing staff to handle the increased patient flow if the panic situation continues,” he said.

Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Wednesday acknowledged in the Legislative Council the spurt in demand for hand sanitisers and masks across the city. Price of masks had shot up threefold and strict action would be taken against those spreading rumours, said the Minister.

A pharmacist at Pulakeshinagar said there was a spike in demand from Tuesday evening after the media started reporting on the infected software engineer.

“Many customers asked for the N95 masks because apparently it was suggested by international organisations. We had not procured them before. If the demand increases in the next few days, we will have to make arrangements so that they are available,” the pharmacist said.

People claimed that the N95 masks that were previously sold for around ₹200 to ₹250 were now being sold for ₹500.

When The Hindu enquired with a few pharmacies, they said they were selling the N95 masks for ₹400 to ₹500. Many also claimed that the pollution mask that used to be available before for ₹10 or ₹20 was now costing more.

Pharmacists said there was an above average demand for hand sanitisers, especially herbal flavours. “We have ordered more stock because they are flying off the shelves,” said a pharmacist in Frazer Town.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-rush-in-hospital-demand-for-masks-hand-sanitisers-spikes/article30986087.ece
345,2020/03/05,KIA records 9% negative variance in global passenger traffic,"Arriving passengers being screened for COVID-19

The impact of COVID-19 has already started to make itself felt at Kempegowda International Airport in terms of the number of people coming to the city from other countries.

Bangalore International Airport Ltd. (BIAL) said there has been a 9% negative variance in international passenger traffic in January-February 2020. It is expecting an overall variance of -4.0% for 2019-20, compared with what had been forecast in October 2019. “This is primarily due to a drop in international seat load factors by 20% to/from the Asia-Pacific region combined with other cancellations by foreign carriers,” said an airport spokesperson.

Across the world, airports have recorded similar drop in passenger traffic. However, BIAL claims that domestic traffic has remained “largely steady”. Passengers arriving from all countries and not just the affected ones will be screened at airports, ports and harbours across the State for COVID-19 symptoms.

Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar informed the Legislative Council on Wednesday of this decision. On Tuesday evening itself, passengers from all international flights at KIA were screened on arrival. This decision was taken after a software engineer who had travelled from Dubai to Bengaluru and later to Hyderabad tested positive.

As a precautionary measure, alcohol-based hand sanitisers have been installed at multiple locations in the airport terminal. Common use areas in the airport are being sanitised and fumigated regularly. “In addition, we are actively driving an awareness campaign among employees of the BLR Airport community,” said a spokesperson of the BIAL.

Self-declaration

Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar has directed the airport authorities to take a declaration from the passengers about their visits abroad, sojourn, and the people who came in contact with them to facilitate initiation of prevention measures. He also asked the authorities to make in-flight announcements for the benefit of passengers, about the procedure to be followed on arrival.

The authorities have been instructed to station a dedicated ambulance at all airports exclusively to shuttle infected passengers or those showing symptoms of the virus.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/kia-records-9-negative-variance-in-global-passenger-traffic/article30986076.ece

The reports of the two others who were found to have symptoms during screening at the Kempegowda International Airport are awaited.

Health officials said fumigation of the techie’s office had been done and 25 colleagues have been isolated at home. Offices on the other floors of the building have been asked to follow workplace guidelines and allow their employees to work from home. All the contacts of the infected techie have been traced and have been home isolated, they said.

Meanwhile, allaying fears of a possible outbreak in the State, Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar on Wednesday informed the Legislative Council that the State was prepared to tackle the situation, in case of an emergency. Of the 275 suspected cases, the samples of 259 have tested negative. So far, 42,283 passengers at KIA and 20,000 passengers in Mangaluru airport have been screened, he said.

Regional testing labs

Responding to members’ demand for setting up regional testing laboratories, the Minister said he would hold consultations with the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers for accreditation of laboratories in districts. “Only NABH-accredited labs can take up COVID-19 tests as there can be chances of false positivity in smaller labs,” he said.

As of now, the virology laboratory in Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute and the NIV branch in Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases in Bengaluru have been identified as sentinel labs for the tests. “I have also spoken to NIMHANS director B.N. Gangadhar to start tests in their laboratory,” he said.

‘Action against those spreading rumours’

The Health Department will initiate action against those who spread rumours and false messages about COVID-19 in the State, said Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey.

“Police cases are being lodged against such rumourmongers in Kerala and Telangana. We will initiate similar action here too. This is required to ensure that there is no panic among people,” he said, adding that it is important to follow basic hand hygiene and take precautions to stay safe.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/infected-techies-colleague-tests-negative/article30986064.ece

While the Indian Air Force in Bengaluru has also established a 20-bed isolation ward at Command Hospital in the city, the Coast Guard at Karwar and Army facility at Belagavi have also been asked to establish quarantine facilities, in case of any eventuality of the spread of virus in the State.

The Department of Health and Family Welfare will deploy the required doctors for 24x7 care, and the State Drug Controller has been asked to provide masks, gloves, and personal protection equipment besides, medicines, he said.

The Chief Secretary, who held a videoconference with the deputy commissioners, asked them to ensure that isolation wards are set up in all hospitals. He instructed them to monitor all places of mass gatherings.

Directing them to prepare a Cluster Containment Plan so as to act swiftly at short notice, he said it was important to keep District Surveillance Plan and District Disaster Teams ready to face the last-minute challenges.

348,2020/03/05,"Health Department issues advisory to IT, biotech companies","‘Avoid non-essential travel of employees to countries affected by coronavirus; allow employees with flu-like symptoms to work from home’

The State Health and Family Welfare Department on Wednesday issued an advisory to information technology and biotechnology companies to avoid non-essential travel of their employees to countries affected by coronavirus. This comes after a software engineer who travelled from Dubai to Bengaluru contracted COVID-19. He is under observation in Hyderabad.

The advisory, issued by Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education, has asked the companies to refrain their employees from travelling to China, Iran, Republic of Korea, Italy, and Japan.

“Any passenger who has visited affected countries in the last 14 days and come to Karnataka, he/she has to self-intimate to the Health Department. If he/she has to travel again from Bengaluru to other places, he/she has to take permission from the Health Department or he/she has to intimate the officials concerned of the Health Department,” the advisory stated.

Regarding any symptoms or travel history to COVID-19 affected countries, people can report to ‘104’ Arogya Sahayavani toll-free helpline and email to ssuidspbanga lore@gmail.com.

The department has also advised companies to allow employees with flu-like symptoms to work from home and spread awareness on standard hand hygiene and cough etiquette.

“Put sanitising hand rub dispensers (alcohol based) in prominent places and provide access to places where staff can wash their hands with soap and water. Surfaces (desks and tables) and objects (telephone, keyboards, etc.) should be wiped with disinfectants regularly,” the advisory said.

Intel on Wednesday said it would strictly adhere to the advisory issued by the government. One of its employees — a flatmate of the software engineer who contracted the virus — is under observation. “We already have put some measures in place to ensure safety. Further to that, we will also fully adhere to the State government’s recent advisory,” said the microprocessor major.

Wipro takes steps

Tech major Wipro has suspended travel to and transit through mainland China, including Hong Kong and Macau, until further notice. Employees have also been advised to avoid non-critical travel to Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Italy, said the company on Wednesday.

Any employee who travelled to an affected area within China in the last few days has been asked to work from home for 14 days before returning to office. The company has also advised all its employees to be vigilant, especially those based in China and those who visited the country recently.

Wipro has also formed cross-functional local and central teams to closely monitor and assess the evolving situation and decide the course of action.

“We do not have employees in Wuhan province. We have enabled a significant number of employees based in China to work from home and have also requested them to be on self-quarantine in case they or their family members show any symptoms. That apart, we have taken all necessary measures at our offices there, including thermal screening, surgical masks, and frequent sanitisation of premises,” said a spokesperson from Wipro Ltd., in response to a query.

350,2020/03/05,Some parking lots at KIA to be temporarily closed from March 9,"This is to facilitate infrastructure development works

Ongoing infrastructure development works at the forecourt of Terminal 1 and other areas in Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) will impact the movement of passengers and visitors who drive to the airport as some parking lots will be closed.

The BIAL has advised passengers to rely on public transport and taxis to avoid inconvenience. In a press release, BIAL said that with effect from March 9 to facilitate construction of infrastructure work, parking lots such as P1 (two-wheeler), P2 (budget) and P3 (premium) will be closed and private parking (non-taxi) will be made available at P4. From March 20, P6 will be opened for public.

These changes will increase walk-time to and from the terminal. To help passengers, BIAL has decided to provide airport shuttle services from P6 to the terminal every 10 minutes.

A decision has also been taken to shift the Uber boarding area to an adjacent facility from March 17. However, the Ola boarding zone will remain unaffected. Airport taxis will continue to operate from the current location.

351,2020/03/05,Illegal religious structures: ‘Set up squad to provide protection to BBMP staff’,"It is the duty of police to assist authorities in demolition of such structures: HC

The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday directed the Bengaluru city Police Commissioner to form a squad to provide adequate security and protection to officers of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to demolish religious structures illegally built on public places.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi issued the direction when the BBMP pointed out that it could not demolish an illegally constructed temple on the open park space on 9th Main Road, Srirampura, owing to protest by public at large on February 25 despite police protection. The temple was illegally constructed by Gangaiamma Festival Committee, Srirampura.

The Bench said the squad, having adequate number of police personnel, both armed police and women police, should be deployed for protection and the squad should ensure that the public are prevented from gathering around the illegal religious structures. It is the duty of the police to assist the civic authorities in demolition of illegally built structures in accordance with the law, it said.

Senior Counsel Anant Mandgi, appearing for the BBMP, pointed out that officers of the civic body could not carry out demolition of illegally built religious structures owing to opposition from the public at large and emphasised the requirement of better police security for such operations as deployment of a few police personnel for protection will not be sufficient.

Illegal structures

Meanwhile, the BBMP on Wednesday informed that there are only 83 illegal religious structures (temples/churches/mosques/ gurdwaras) built on public land prior to September 29, 2009 in the eight zones of the city and only 17 such illegal religious structures were built after September 29, 2009, which is the cut-off date fixed by the apex court to not allow any illegal structures built after this date.

The Bench was hearing a PIL petition initiated suo motu to monitor implementation of the apex court’s direction to remove illegal religious structures on public properties and other PIL petitions related to illegal religious structures.

In another PIL petition, which has sought demolition of another illegal temple built abutting a footpath in Jayanagar 4th Block, the Bench said residents’ association should not support illegal religious structures when a person, claiming to be secretary of a group of residents’ association opposed demolition of a temple of Muneshwara Swamy.

Interestingly, the intervenor claimed that the deity was placed in the said location in the 1800s, but the Bench, on going through photographs, wondered whether such structures could have been built during the 1800s as they appeared to have been built recently.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/illegal-religious-structures-set-up-squad-to-provide-protection-to-bbmp-staff/article30985844.ece
352,2020/03/05,"Reconsider nod granted to BMRCL to cut trees, HC tells committee","Committee was set up after court’s directive in April 2019

The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday directed the Special Committee comprising experts to consider afresh all its decisions of granting permission to the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) for felling or translocating trees to make space for the ongoing metro project.

The committee was set up by the State government on a direction issued by the court in April 2019 for considering the applications for felling of trees in the city.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the order while noticing that the committee had not examined whether any tree could be saved from cutting before granting permission to the BMRCL for felling or translocating the trees as directed by the court last year. The Bench was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) petition filed by Dattatraya T. Devare and Bangalore Environment Trust.

Members of the committee, the Bench said, were perhaps under the impression that for the metro project it was not necessary to go into the question of whether any of the trees could be saved. The court had in its earlier orders indicated that cutting of trees should be the last option.

While pointing out that primary objective of the Karnataka Preservation of Trees Act is to save trees and not to casually allow cutting or translocation of trees, the Bench said the minutes of the committee does not indicate that the committee considered the aspect whether any tree could be saved without affecting the alignment of the metro project. First endeavour of the committee should be to analyse whether work of the metro alignment as per the finalised alignment can be carried out by saving any or some of the trees, the Bench observed.

The BMRCL agreed to the court’s suggestion for reconsideration of the approvals granted and agreed to place all the applications before the committee once again.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/reconsider-nod-granted-to-bmrcl-to-cut-trees-hc-tells-committee/article30985813.ece
353,2020/03/05,No more MoUs with corporate entities for lake maintenance for now: HC,"Court to examine legality of such agreements already executed with a few entities

The High Court of Karnataka on Wednesday restrained the State government from executing any more agreements/memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with corporate entities for development and maintenance of tanks/lakes in the city till the court examines the legality and validity of such agreements/MoUs already executed with a few entities.

The court, however, said this would not prevent the government from taking funds from corporate entities for maintenance of lakes.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Ashok S. Kinagi passed the interim order during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition related to lakes and storm-water drains. While going through a draft copy of an MoU, the Bench termed it as a “disturbing feature” certain terms and conditions mentioned in it and pointed out that the conditions indicate that the State was “virtually parting away lakes to corporate entities”.

“Prima facie, by way of the MoU, the State government wants to shift its obligation to corporate entities,” the Bench observed while directing the government to submit the copies of the MoUs already entered into with corporate entities for the court’s examination.

Leo Saldanha of Environment Support Group, who was added as a party to the PIL petition proceedings, had during an earlier hearing brought to the court’s notice the appeal made by the Chief Minister, as the Chairperson of the Karnataka Tank Conservation and Development Authority (KTCDA), through public notices issued in newspapers in December last year inviting corporate companies to take up lake development and maintenance task as part of their corporate social responsibility. It was Mr. Saldanha’s contention that manner of involvement of corporate entities was contrary to the undertaking given to the court by the government in a different PIL petition eight years ago.

Bylaw

Meanwhile, the Bench directed the council of the Burhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to take steps for finalising the solid waste management (SWM) bylaw, draft of which was published on July 31, 2019, in its very next meeting. The Bench directed the BBMP Commissioner to inform the council about this order while pointing the delay of more than two years in framing the SWM bylaws as per the mandate of the SMW Rules, 2016, notified under the Environment (Protection) Act.

Committees

While pointing out that no proper survey of all lakes in the State, including those in the city, was carried out even after eight years of a direction issued by the court in 2012 in another PIL petition related to the city’s lakes, the Bench directed the government to ensure that the committees, established now as per the 2012 direction of the court, complete the survey of lakes across the State, demarcate the boundaries, and take steps to remove encroachments.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/55awnq/article30985783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGLAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/no-more-mous-with-corporate-entities-for-lake-maintenance-for-now-hc/article30985784.ece

356,2020/03/05,"A peek at Black Orchid, the new resto-bar in Chennai","The tavern-esque Black Orchid lends an old Hollywood charm to RA Puram’s night life

‘I want to know what love is,’ sings Eighties band Foreigner as I step into the recently opened Black Orchid. With a bevy of staff dancing attendance, I am about to find out.

Music bounces off its deep leather sofas, black walls and orange-hue lamps that lend it the feel of an upmarket tavern. It serenades the ladies who lunch by the restaurant’s yawning, bright windows, and the mosquitoes that buzz along in time, uninvited.

Choose the armchair-style seating on the first floor. It has a view to a thrill — an unusual bar with eclectic bottles of liquor standing cheek by jowl — that has birthed a 10-page drinks menu co-created by its owner, banker-turned-restaurateur Sanjeev Verma.

The room has been pared down to a soothing green. Giant orbs of light on the ceiling make the lower floor seem poised and en pointe — much like the cuisine. Or the chef behind the perfectly-plated sushi, seafood, North Indian and Italian food that Black Orchid serves. Like Sophia Loren in the eponymous film, everything is coffee-table-book-pretty with an air of mystique.

The first to arrive are maki rolls with a choice of vegetables, and crisp California sushi with crab stick, carrot and avocado. This is sushi with a western edge but the touch of wasabi and the soft crunch of rice and seafood lend it a pronounced Asian accent.

A mixed platter of cottage cheese tostadas and mushroom crostinis appears next. Each sliver of cottage cheese is velveteen with a little fire of spices; the mushroom can be mistaken for coarse minced meat. Which is not a bad thing; my companion and I shovel these little eats straight off the platter.

Since there has been a glut of savoury, Chef Fabian Ravi — who built a career helming Patio at Taj Coromandel — suggests a Japan-inspired salad. The lettuce is translucent and the flavour umami-rich, but I am not one of those who warm up to greens readily and nit-pick at it.

We are saved by Jagan Jack, the mixologist, who serves cocktail glasses of Rooty Salty — a vetiver vodka served with frozen blood orange puree — and Zu Zu Li — floral gin with jasmine vodka and lemon juice. Since they are infusions, there is the headiness of alcohol without the burn of it.

The beef teriyaki has slim waves of fat and muscle the colour of plum. It is laid out like a fan, like artwork in a gallery. A tough contender for first place that afternoon is the pan-tossed garlic and cheese marinated prawns that have the comfort of home.

A close second is the beef with kaffir lime and lotus stem. The slices lie nestled like commas, ready to fall apart with a touch of the fork. A distant last comes the mutton sukka tortilla — over-spiced, it is the proverbial dish from hell. An attempt to fuse flavours from India with the Hispanic, the dish seems to have lost its way, though a less fiery version may have let it breathe better.

Anyway, it is time for dessert and Chef suggests a serving of the signature Black Orchid cheesecake and the chocolate and hazelnut delice. The former is serious and dark; it has been worked on for hours but tastes over-engineered.

357,2020/03/05,Shanti theatre complex on Chennai’s Anna Salai will soon house office suites,"Family members of veteran actor Sivaji Ganesan and real estate developer Akshaya Private Limited together announced the launch of the new project

The family members of veteran actor Sivaji Ganesan and real estate developer Akshaya Private Limited came together to announce the launch of ‘Akshaya Shanti’-- office suites for businesses and enterprises at the Shanti Theatre complex on Anna Salai.

Nearly four years ago, the family members of the late actor had announced that they were going to shut down the theatre, a landmark building on Anna Salai, and redevelop the property.

Shanti theatre, built by G. Umapathy and D. Shanmuga Raja, was originally inaugurated in 1961 and later bought by actor Sivaji Ganesan.

“While there were initially several options as to how to redevelop the property, we worked with Akshaya and ultimately decided to go with state-of-the-art office suites which will be unique to this area. We had our initial apprehensions about the redevelopment since this is a building that my father bought, but the builders have ensured that they will retain something to remember him by, here,” said actor Prabhu.

The gate to the building as well as the walls leading up to the entrance have the names of Sivaji Ganesan’s most memorable films. The lobby of the building too has large black and white photographs of the actor depicting some of his popular on-screen characters.

The grade A project can either house a single big corporate office or multiple mid-sized corporate offices spread across six floor plates. There is also a gymnasium, landscaped terrace gardens, and car park with a capacity of 134 vehicles and a cafeteria planned.

T. Chitty Babu, Chairman and CEO of Akshaya Pvt Limited said that the facility was gold-certified by the Indian Green Building Council. “With its proximity to the Metro Rail and other transport networks, we hope that this becomes the go-to grade A office space in this area for businesses and enterprises,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dcmno3/article30990473.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MARTH--PRABHU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/shanti-theatre-complex-on-chennais-anna-salai-will-soon-house-office-suites/article30990474.ece
358,2020/03/05,"New dimension needs to be created in medical education to handle challenges of astronauts, says former ISRO chairman","K. Kasturirangan spoke at the 32nd convocation of the Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University on Thursday

With India aiming for human space missions, a new dimension needs to be created in medical education to handle the physiological and psychological challenges the country’s astronauts have to face, K. Kasturirangan, former Chairman, ISRO, said on Thursday.

Delivering the convocation address at the 32nd convocation of the Tamil Nadu Dr. M.G.R. Medical University, he proposed that yoga therapy could help in dealing with the physiological and psychological effects on human beings surviving in space. He added that even Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian to travel to space, has spoken about performing yoga while in space.

Pointing out that a number of changes happen in the human body under microgravity conditions in space, he said that bone loss, space motion sickness, and the psychological impact of being in an isolated environment were some of the common effects. He said that while counter measures in dealing with some of these effects include exercises, India’s very own valuable heritage in this connection is yoga therapy. He said yoga therapy helped in maintaining core and neck strength besides helping in overcoming the problems of space motion sickness and the psychological impact.

“We need to create specialised courses as well as institutions to impart education with necessary simulation and training infrastructure in this connection,” he said.

Arguing that the quality of medical education and the aspects of governance in India leave much to be desired, Mr. Kasturirangan, who headed the committee that drafted the National Education Policy (NEP), said that the NEP and the newly-formed National Medical Commission had tried to address many of these issues.

Highlighting the shortfall in doctors with post-graduation degrees, he said that the roughly 600 or so district hospitals in the country must be upgraded into teaching hospitals at the earliest.

Stressing on the need for increased collaboration between industry and academia, he said, “For instance the collaboration for conducting clinical trials for products that companies plan to market either in India or internationally will be made more effective through appropriate institutional mechanisms. “Industry will also be a major supporter for basic research, including diseases and epidemiology,” he added.

Speaking on the impact of artificial intelligence in the medical field, R. Chidambaram, former Chairman, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, said that artificial intelligence and machine learning were expected to be more useful in diagnosis and drug development. He said that the advancements in diagnosis through artificial intelligence will be particularly useful to India since the patient load is high. With the healthcare industry shifting towards digital record-keeping, he stressed on the need for adopting principles of cyber security to ensure data privacy.

Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit presided over the convocation. Sudha Seshayyan, Vice-Chancellor of the university, presented the annual report.

A total of 17,590 graduates from medical, dental, AYUSH, and allied health sciences received their degrees, of which 724 received their degrees in person while others received them in-absentia.

For the first time since the inception of the university, the convocation was conducted in the university premises, the V-C said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/p3vjw6/article30989762.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MARTH--CONVOC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yoga-therapy-can-help-astronauts-says-former-isro-chairman/article30989763.ece
359,2020/03/05,Garbage bins block carriageway on Chennai’s Pycrofts Road,"Garbage bins placed on the road in the Zam Bazaar area, have partially blocked the carriageway, causing inconvenience to motorists and pedestrians in the already congested locality.

Two such bins that have also not been cleaned properly, are on the stretch on Pycrofts Road between Triplicane High Road junction and Zam Bazaar police station.

Shopkeepers in the area say that though Chennai Corporation clears the garbage from the bins daily, it is not done in a proper manner, resulting in garbage getting strewn around. Apart from the bins blocking the carriageway, cattle often gather around the bins to scrounge for food, resulting in further blockage of the road.

“There are some meat shops in the area, who also dump some of the waste from their shops in these bins. This results in the stench becoming very strong as well,” said N. Abbas, a fruit vendor in the area. “The Corporation workers cannot be blamed altogether since the garbage generated here is excessive,” he added.

An employee of a pharmacy located nearby said that the Corporation could provide smaller bins to the shopkeepers and collect garbage from them individually.

“There is a strong stench in this roughly 200-metre stretch mainly because of the huge garbage bins. Corporation officials say they cannot be moved elsewhere since there is no space. Why don’t they remove them altogether and instead collect garbage door-to-door,” he asked.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dsj1xu/article30989424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MARTH-Garbagejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/garbage-bins-block-carriageway-on-chennais-pycrofts-road/article30989425.ece

361,2020/03/05,Compensation to passenger cut by 40%,"The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Chennai, has cut compensation to a student who sustained injuries in a road accident, for travelling on the footboard of a Metropolitan Transport Corporation Limited bus, by 40%.

In his petition, T. Arun said that on February 24, 2011, he was travelling on a bus at the Dr. Ambedkar College Road junction on M.P.M. Street, Vyasarpadi, from Kannigapuram to Vyasarpadi.

The driver of the bus stopped at the Vyasarpadi bus stop and Arun tried to alight from the vehicle, but the driver, without seeing the passengers alighting through the rear entrance, moved the bus. Arun fell and sustained injuries, the petition added.

At the time of accident, Arun was studying in Class IX and he sought compensation.

In its response, MTC said that the passenger was travelling on the footboard, without following traffic rules, and was not heeding the advice of the crew and the passengers travelling in the bus.

The tribunal, based on the FIR copy, ruled that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the driver of the bus. It also noted that the passenger would have contributed in some way to the cause of the accident, and that his contribution was fixed at 40%.

362,2020/03/05,Decision on location of second airport for Chennai in a fortnight,"State to decide between Mamandur and Parandur, communicate choice to Centre

The Tamil Nadu government will decide on the location of Chennai’s second airport in a fortnight and send its recommendation to the Centre, official sources said.

Last November, the State government had said that it had identified two possible land parcels — one in Mamandur and another in Parandur — and written to the Airports Authority of India (AAI), asking them to inspect and carry out a survey. Following this, a team of AAI officials came down to the city and inspected the sites. Thereafter, they did a pre-feasibility study and submitted the report to the State.

A few weeks ago, the Centre sent a letter to the State, asking it to give its recommendation and choose one of the two sites in terms of feasibility.

Highly-placed sources told The Hindu that AAI had given the pros and cons for both sites and the State was likely to respond and finalise a site in two weeks.

AAI sources speculate that Parandur is more favourable and say that it is very likely that it may house the city’s second airport.

Soon after the government gives its recommendation, the State will have to apply for a series of clearances, after which, the actual construction of the airport can begin. But this is bound to take a lot of time.

Sources said that nearly 4,700 acres of land at Parandur and its adjoining villages were considered, and of this, the State government had only 50% of the land. Land acquisition will have to be done for the rest, sources added. Since there is a waterbody close to the site in Mamandur, there are issues involved, and they have to be resolved before going ahead.

The Chennai airport’s terminals are already saturated and passengers are put to hardship, with long waits for security and immigration checks. Authorities say that by the time the new integrated terminal, which is now under construction, also becomes congested, the second airport should be ready.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/t07xkn/article30985891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5THTERMINAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/decision-on-location-of-second-airport-for-city-in-a-fortnight/article30985892.ece
363,2020/03/05,Varsity’s decision worries guest faculty,"Anna University’s Syndicate had resolved to retrench 135 persons

A decision taken by Anna University’s Syndicate has worried the faculty and employees of constituent colleges.

Last month, the Syndicate resolved to retrench 135 persons employed in the constituent colleges as both faculty and administrative staff, without following the due process of appointment.

Over a period of time, the university had appointed these people as and when vacancies arose. Some of them were appointed as guest lecturers without following the rule of recruitment or roster. The appointees continued to function as guest faculty in their respective positions, the last decade.

On its part, the university has constituted five committees in the last decade to review the appointments and each committee has given its recommendations, all of which have remained just on paper. The appointees, fearing loss of jobs, have been filing petitions in the High Court. For the university, it has been an unending series of court cases.

The last Syndicate had taken a decision to retrench the appointees, and the affected persons have been seeking reprieve.

A senior faculty at the Anna University said that the recruitment of these people should be regularised since they had contributed to building institutions.

“During vice-chancellor Mannar Jawahar’s period, services of 98 contract lecturers in Chennai were regularised, although they were also appointed without any recruitment advertisement, selection committee or roster,” the faculty said, adding that since there was a precedent, the university could consider the same route this time as well.

Vice-chancellor M.K. Surappa said that the government would have to resolve the issue, as successive administrations had taken decisions on the appointments.

The university’s Syndicate, whose strength should be 15, presently has nine members, of whom five are bureaucrats. The five vacancies in the Syndicate have not been filled for over two years. The university’s representation is considerably weak, owing to these vacancies.

Mr. Surappa said that university representatives were sympathetic to the faculty, but the government thought otherwise. “It is beyond messy. Each day I get court notices to prevent termination of their services,” he said.

Several guest faculty members do not have the appropriate qualification, but have been teaching students. Despite these ad hoc appointments, the colleges are woefully short of teaching staff, Mr. Surappa said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/moeoq0/article30985862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5THANNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/varsitys-decision-worries-guest-faculty/article30985863.ece

According to the police, Vijay Harish of Anna Nagar is the son of actor Sooriyakanth. He is also a budding actor. The police said that he became acquainted with the 20-year-old girl from north Chennai, studying in a private college, and later, the two got into a relationship.

368,2020/03/05,HC to directly monitor bottling units in T.N.,"The Madras High Court on Wednesday decided to monitor the functioning of all drinking water bottling units in the State directly by constituting a team of two advocate commissioners for each of the 32 districts in the State and directing the advocates to report to the court through the Principal District Judges (PDJs).

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar instructed the PDJs to select two advocates, with a minimum professional experience of 10 years, and empower them to visit all drinking water bottling units along with the district-level monitoring committees already constituted as per orders of Justice S.M. Subramaniam in 2018.

The advocates were directed to submit reports, along with photographs of the sites, to the High Court through the PDJs.

They were ordered to find out whether any bottling unit was involved in illegal drawal of groundwater, whether the seals put by government officials on illegal units were intact and whether all units had valid licences.

“If any such units are doing any illegal drawal of groundwater for their production activity, the said committee of two advocates with any member of the District Level Monitoring Committee will have right to visit the units concerned and make a report to be forwarded to this court through the Principal District Judge concerned.

“This arrangement may continue for the next six months, subject to further orders of this court,” the judges said and recorded the submission of Advocate General Vijay Narayan and Special Government Pleader J. Pothiraj that decisions shall be taken within 15 days on the applications for fresh licences and also for renewal.

Security deposit

However, taking note that a majority of the bottling units in the State had been functioning for years together without obtaining any licence as required under a Government Order issued in 2014, the judges directed that all applicants seeking either a fresh licence or renewal should make a security deposit of ₹50,000 for each unit.

“In case of any further default or non compliance of the terms of the licence/permission such as the necessity to fix flow meters to keep a tab on quantity of water extracted, the authority concerned shall be free to pass appropriate order, after giving an opportunity of hearing to the unit concerned, to forfeit the said security deposit amount,” the Bench said.

The judges also stated that the 64 advocate commissioners to be appointed across the State shall be paid an honorarium of ₹4,000 each for every month, at the rate of ₹2,000 for each fortnightly visit, by the district administration at the first instance and later on adjusted from the security deposit to be collected from the bottling units.

The Division Bench of the High Court further ordered that all those illegal bottling units which had not yet been sealed by the government officials must also be brought under the net and shut down until they applied for a licence and obtained it after following the due process of law.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-to-directly-monitor-bottling-units-in-tn/article30985637.ece

370,2020/03/05,Traffic snarls at Pallavaram junction to end,"Work on ₹82.66-crore uni-directional flyover nearing completion

Traffic movement at Pallavaram junction, on GST Road, is set to improve shortly with construction work on the ₹82.66-crore uni-directional flyover at the point nearing completion. Only about two weeks of finishing work, including painting and lighting, is left now.

Sources in the Highways Department said that the approach on the Guindy side was completed and work on the road on the Tambaram side was being finished. “The wearing coat on top will be laid shortly and we hope to complete the entire work soon,” the official source said.

The 1.53-km three-lane flyover will allow traffic from the Tambaram side to proceed towards the airport, without stopping at the Kundrathur Road, English Electricals and Old Pallavaram Sandhai Road junctions. Work was started in 2016, and on completion, the flyover, with its three lanes, will match the one in front of the airport.

To facilitate construction, the department strengthened the Old Trunk Road and took permission from the Cantonment and laid the Kundrathur Road after removing encroachments on either side. What was a 25-ft road earlier became a 40-ft-wide facility after the work. Since over 2.25 lakh vehicles take the GST Road every day, diversion of vehicular traffic was a major problem.

Earlier, several motorists used to avoid taking this stretch of GST Road due to the work. “Traffic snarls were a daily affair. But one must remember that the construction was carried out for public good. After the traffic diversions clicked, vehicular movement in the area was smooth.

371,2020/03/05,Former AIADMK MP gets 7 years sentence,"In 2013, Ramachandran and his son Rajasekaran, by colluding with Thiagarajan, borrowed ₹17.28 crore for the construction of a new college campus.

A special court for MPs/MLAs on Wednesday convicted K.N. Ramachandran, former AIADMK MP from Sriperumbudur, in a criminal case filed by the CBI and sentenced him to seven years’ imprisonment.

While Ramachandran, the chairman and managing trustee of M/s Kannamal Eductional Trust, is the third accused in the case, R. Thiagarajan, senior regional manager, Central Bank of India, Chennai, is the first accused and R. Rajasekaran, chairman, M/s Sakthi Mariamman Engineering College, the second accused.

In 2013, Ramachandran and his son Rajasekaran, by colluding with Thiagarajan, borrowed ₹17.28 crore for the construction of a new college campus. However, the money was spent for other purposes.

As the loan’s repayment was irregular, the bank conducted an inquiry and found that the manager had sanctioned a loan beyond permissible limits.

A case was registered by the Anti-Corruption Branch of the CBI, Chennai and, after investigation, a charge-sheet was filed in the case. On completion of trial, all three accused were convicted by judge D. Lingeshwaran of the special court for cases against MPs and MLAs

While Thiagarajan was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for five years and ordered to pay a fine of ₹13.10 lakh, Rajasekaran and Ramachandran were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for seven years each and ordered to pay a fine of ₹1.11 crore each. The fourth accused, M/s Kannamal Educational Trust, was ordered to pay a fine of ₹15.20 crore.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/former-aiadmk-mp-gets-7-years-sentence/article30985596.ece
372,2020/03/05,IIT-M launches investigation into hacking of its server,"Institution says except for e-mail, none of its other services got affected

The Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) has launched an investigation into the hacking of one of its servers that resulted in a temporary shutdown of its e-mail services last month.

Confirming that one of its e-mail servers was “down” temporarily, the institution said that the issue was resolved and normalcy restored.

Investigating cause

“All e-mails on the server are being backed up and no e-mails have been lost. The backup of e-mails is ongoing and will be completed shortly. The cause is being investigated,” the IIT-M director’s office said on Wednesday.

Responding to a query on whether ransomware had targeted and accessed the research work of students, researchers and academicians, the institution said that “no other services were affected”. The media relations division chose not to comment on whether a criminal complaint was lodged with any law-enforcing agency.

The issue surfaced after a researcher posted a screenshot of a message he received after logging into the IIT-M server, on social media.

The suspected ransomware message claimed that all files were encrypted and to recover them, the data had to be decrypted.

The user was asked to send an e-mail to a particular account for the decrypted file that would be made available on payment.

‘Serious attack’

Acknowledging that there was a “serious attack” on computers on campus, IIT-M sent out a circular to students/staff that the virus appeared to have targeted computers operating on a particular operating system and asked them to take a backup of their work immediately.

The source and the variant of ransomware is under investigation by in-house experts.

The Tamil Nadu police denied having received any complaint from IIT-M on the incident.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jycu6b/article30985569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5THIIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iit-m-launches-investigation-into-hacking-of-its-server/article30985570.ece

374,2020/03/05,Additional staff to be deployed at airports for COVID-19 screening,"Decision to screen all international flights prompts move

With the Centre deciding to screen passengers of all international flights for symptoms of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the State Health Department is all set to depute additional manpower — both doctors and paramedical personnel — at airports in the State, particularly in Chennai.

So far, passengers from 12 COVID-19-affected countries have been screened at the airports. The decision to screen all international flights in the wake of COVID-19 spreading to more countries has raised the need to depute sufficient number of doctors and nurses for the screening.

Directions given

“Earlier, we had deputed 10 members each to the airports in Chennai and Tiruchi. Now, we are all set to provide additional manpower at the airports. We are increasing the number of persons from today, and have sent out instructions to post the required number of doctors and nurses from Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram and Chengalpattu districts, on duty for airport screening,” K. Kolandaswamy, director of public health and preventive medicine, said.

It is already the public health teams that have been screening passengers at both the Coimbatore and Madurai airports, he added.

Public health officials said that passengers who have symptoms of cough, fever and difficulty in breathing are transferred to isolation wards of nearby government medical college hospitals using the 108 ambulance.

“Those who look ill or tired on arrival, having a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit and above, are transferred to the nearby isolation facility. We collect samples — nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs and blood — only in a hospital setting, and send them for testing,” an official said.

Hospital quarantine

According to the bulletin issued by the Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, 96,729 passengers were screened at the airports in Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore till now.

Of this, 1,292 persons were under home quarantine for 28 days and five under hospital quarantine.

Testing of nasal, throat swabs and blood samples of three persons are under process at the King Institute of Preventive Medicine. Till now, 51 persons have tested negative for COVID-19 in the State.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/x959sk/article30985518.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5THSCREEN2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/additional-staff-to-be-deployed-at-airports-for-covid-19-screening/article30985519.ece
375,2020/03/05,Eight detained for Anna Salai bomb attack,"Police suspect it to be outcome of gang war as two of city’s gangsters were in SUV

A day after two youngsters hurled country bombs at an SUV near Kamarajar Arangam on Anna Salai, the police have detained eight people for interrogation.

Police suspect it to be a fallout of a gang war as they suspect that two persons in the SUV who escaped unhurt were top gangsters in the city.

The police have secured a college student who was part of the gang that was involved in the Anna Salai attack.

Based on the information provided by him, the police will be securing one more person involved in the case.

On Tuesday evening, two youngsters on a bike hurled two bombs at a car near the Anna Flyover. The bombs did not damage the car and the driver swerved into Mayor Sundar Rao Road to escape further attacks.

The duo on the bike also sped away. While the SUV was not damaged, the crude bombs caused some damage to the frontage of shops in the area. The Teynampet police rushed to the spot and started investigation.

In the CCTV footage, two persons, likely to be in their late teens, were seen riding a bike. The police tracked down the owner of the bike and found that the vehicle was used by his son, who is absconding.

“By scrutinising the CCTV footage, we found that eight bikes had followed the car. We have identified the people involved in the crime using the vehicle registration numbers. We will arrest them soon,” said A. K. Viswanathan, City Police Commissioner.

Of the eight bikes, one had a fake registration number.

“They had followed the car from George Town Court. Two ‘A plus’ category gangsters are suspected to have been inside the SUV and the attackers reportedly belonged to the rival group,” said a police officer.

According to the police, the country bombs were made using a mixture of gunpowder, stones and glass pieces. Such explosives were first used in funeral processions. Then they began to used by anti-social elements in southern districts during the start and end of an attack. Though such bombs were used rarely until a few years ago by top gangsters to injure or maim their rivals, their usage has become more common now. “There is a need to form anti-gangster units, with young members, in every zone to curb the rowdy menace,” said a police officer.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/eight-detained-for-anna-salai-bomb-attack/article30985498.ece
376,2020/03/05,Never looked at caste of electorate: Chidambaram to HC,"Congress leader subjected to marathon two-hour cross-examination

During cross-examination in connection with a case challenging his election from Sivaganga in 2009, former Union Minister P. Chidambaram told the Madras High Court on Wednesday that he had “never looked at the caste of the electorate” and did not know the “number of voters in each caste” in the constituency.

Mr. Chidambaram’s response came to a question during the course of a more than two-hour long cross examination before Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana. He was asked if he knew that numerically, voters belonging to the caste of the election petitioner R.S. Raja Kannappan were more than any other caste in Sivaganga parliamentary constituency.

Advocates K. Rajendra Kumar and G. Saravana Kumar cross examined the former Minister after describing him as a “formidable witness.” The election petition alleged that Mr. Chidambaram had secured victory through corrupt practices and by the misuse of his then position as Union Home Minister.

He denied all allegations in his counter affidavit and during cross examination.

When asked if he was aware of the silence period maintained before the day of polling, he gave an expansive reply that all candidates should stop campaigning at 5 p.m. on the day which falls two days prior to the day of election. “Yet, on May 12, 2009, your son was seen at Rajagambiram village in Manamadurai Taluk at 7:30 pm?” the advocate asked and the former Minister said: “There is no bar on anyone traveling on the previous day of election. Party workers and leaders meet each other. In that context, my son did visit a few villages.”

“But there is a bar on distributing money, is it not?” the lawyer queried and pat came the reply: “There is a bar for distributing money on any day and place during an election.” The legal duel continued with the advocate claiming, “Sir, your son was accompanied by 24 men in two cars,” and Mr. Chidambaram quipping, “No, 24 men can’t fit in two cars. He was accompanied by four or five party workers.” At this point of time, the lawyer, in a lighter vein, asked: “Sir, don’t you watch Tamil movies?” and pat came a counter-question: “Do you want this to be recorded in the court proceedings?” After a brief period of laughter and making it clear that he was just joking, the lawyer went on to ask why did the former Minister rush to Manamadurai police station on May 12, 2009.

“I received information that the car in which my son was travelling had been surrounded by a mob. Therefore, I rushed to Rajagambiram. There, I was told that the local police had safely escorted my son and other party workers to Manamadurai police station. So, I went to Manamadurai police station,” he explained.

“Sir, wasn’t your visit to Manamadurai police station an opprobrium considering that you were the Union Home Minister at that time?” the lawyer asked and the reply was: “Please remember, I was a candidate when I received information that my son and party workers were safely escorted to Manamadurai police station. It was my duty to go to the police station and find out what happened.”

The advocate went on to state: “Sir, I say that your presence is enough to send a chill down the spine of the Inspector of Police who, in his genupecting (sic) manner, obliged to you by not registering a case against your son on a complaint given by Anbalagan (of AIADMK) but promptly took the complaint lodged by Saravanan (driver of Mr. Karti Chidambaram) on file.”

To this, Mr. Chidambaram said: “I am sorry, you are underestimating the police. I had no knowledge of any complaint lodged by Mr. Anbalagan. On Saravanan’s complaint, I was told that action will be taken in accordance with law. Immediately, I left Manamadurai police station.”

“Sir, who exactly uttered the words ‘action will be taken’ to you?” the former Minister was asked and he said: “May be the Inspector or the Sub Inspector or even the writer (in the police station). I don’t remember now.” After the marathon counter examination, the advocates said they had some more questions and hence the judge adjourned the case to Monday.

Making it clear that the examination should be concluded on Monday and oral arguments by the end of this month, the judge impressed upon the need to give a quietus to the election petition pending for more than a decade.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/weml13/article30985422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PCHIDAMBARAMUNIONBUDGETANALYSIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/never-looked-at-caste-of-electorate-chidambaram-to-hc/article30985423.ece

He wanted the Tamil Nadu government to survey people according to the procedure adopted in 2010, which was later on incorporated as Census 2011.

A resolution in this regard should be passed in the current Assembly session, he said. He called for the DMK, Congress, IUML and other parties to work together in pressurising the government.

378,2020/03/05,Unauthorised vendors to be cleared by Vellore municipality,"More than 300 buses are operated from the old bus terminus

Unauthorised street vendors continue carrying out their business on bus bays in the old bus terminus in Vellore, despite the provision of specifically earmarked street vendors’ yard. In its effort to clear space for bus operations, the Vellore Corporation would be forced to vacate such vendors, an official from the Vellore City Municipal Corporation said.

Bus operations to southern districts like Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram, Chidambaram, Cuddalore, Thittakudi, Puducherry, Polur, Arni, Cheyyar and Vandavasi have been shifted from the new bus stand. More than 200 buses are thus operated from the old bus stand.

Private buses

Moreover, private bus operators too ply on these routes, accounting for 100 more buses per day. All of this has resulted in huge crowd at any point of time during the day.

Permanent stalls given to these vendors inside the bus terminus remain unused, said Nasir from Vellore.

Speaking about illegal commercial usage of parking space in buildings, the official said that action was being initiated against such buildings as per regulations.

Officials used tom-tom drums to announce the removal of unauthorised vendors’ encroachments on Wednesday.

Traders were asked to vacate on their own. They would forfeit their stock and essentials if they failed to comply, the announcement said.

However, traders seemed unperturbed by the announcement.

Prior notice

It is customary to give prior notice to such vendors, before swinging into action, Corporation staff said.

Vendors return to the same spots within a few days, despite the clearance drive, said one of the traders in the old bus stand.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/i2r02x/article30985353.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UNAUTHORISEDVENDORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unauthorised-vendors-to-be-cleared-by-vellore-municipality/article30985354.ece

380,2020/03/05,AAI awaits land to complete runway work at Vellore airport,"State Highways Department has to hand over a piece of land on Abdullapuram-Alangayam Road

With civil works for the upcoming airport nearing completion at Abdullapuram, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) now awaits a letter of authority from the State Highways Department, which will allow it to complete construction of the airstrip.

At a meeting held at the Vellore Collectorate earlier this month, it was decided that the State Highways Department would hand over a piece of land, required for runway connectivity, to the AAI.

Accordingly, the State Highways Department has to hand over a piece of land on Abdullapuram-Alangayam Road (SH-122) and seek ₹1.7 crore for construction of another road adjacent to the airport compound wall.

Sources with State highways said the road would provide connectivity to Asanambut, Alangayam and many other villages enroute.

When complete, the airport would provide connectivity to airports at Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad. 20 seater planes would ply between these airports, AAI sources said.

The Vellore airport was sanctioned under the second phase of the UDAN-RCS (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagarik-Regional Connectivity) scheme.

Electrical work

According to AAI officials, construction of the terminal building was complete and electrical work was under way. Putting to rest speculations over the inauguration of the Vellore airport, the AAI officials clarified that it would take a minimum of three to six months for operations to commence. The final word has to come from State Highways, Chennai.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) will then have to issue airport licence after the Civil Aviation Ministry carries out spot inspections. Only after all this will the airport become operational, the AAI source said.

However, a social activist, Suriyanarayanan N., said, “A four-lane road is the only permanent solution to reaching the airport since the temporary road now planned, on the fringes of the airport, will only ensure smooth-flow of traffic when the Anaicut road is closed for airport completion.”

“Already 70% of the land acquisition work, for the proposed four-lane highway, was complete. We expect all work to be completed in a short time and the project will be operational,” official sources revealed.

“The four-lane highway, when completed, will connect the Vellore-Tiruvannamalai road, thus enabling commuters reach Tiruvannamalai from the Chennai highway without entering Vellore town, the officials added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5x6hu8/article30985275.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VELLOREAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/aai-awaits-land-to-complete-runway-work-at-vellore-airport/article30985276.ece
381,2020/03/05,Dark tales in Andhra Pradesh’s IIT success story,"A study on secondary education in the State shows coaching starts too early amid immense pressure on students

As the examination season rolls in, nearly 1.5 crore students in India prepare to sit for the board examinations. They are more fortunate than nearly half their cohorts, who will never get to that stage. Among the happiest students will be those who will get admission to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), and among the States, the largest number will be from Andhra Pradesh (AP). Subsequently, many will earn the kind of money that they, and their families, may not even be aware of.

But underlying these grand successes is an ugly story, which emerged during a study on secondary education I conducted in AP in 2018-19. The State owes its distinction in producing the largest number of IIT entrants to two major chains of ‘corporate schools’, which focus on preparing students for the IIT, and failing that, other engineering colleges. These schools had initially been established for Classes XI and XII, but now cover the whole school cycle. Many are residential schools.

Also Read Over 80,000 kids still out of school in State

Ignoring the children’s learning stages, the schools have distorted the curriculum. A principal of a corporate school revealed that coaching for the IIT examination began as early as Class VI. The school focused on physics, math and chemistry, while the mother tongue and social sciences were sidelined. Further, as the school had to ‘complete’ the syllabus prescribed by the State government along with IIT coaching, the syllabi for Classes XI and XII was taught from Class VI onwards too, with 10% of the syllabus being ‘covered’ each year. During interviews, government officials and teachers said that students in such schools did little or no physical or extracurricular activities, and got little rest.

The pressure on students was enormous. As per the principal, students were divided into three ‘levels’ according to ability, and taught separately. There were fortnightly exams and cumulative exams every month, and students were re-allotted to different levels after the latter. The atmosphere was very competitive. The school hours stretched up to nine hours or more, and there were few holidays. There were several cases of student suicides each year, usually following a demotion in the ‘level’. As per the principal, around 20% students were placed at the top level, and of them 15-20% were likely to get admission to the IITs. In other words, after a high level of stress and sacrificing a well-rounded education, 3-4% of the total students got into IITs. How many would have got admission to the IITs with a proper education too, is a matter of conjecture.

A childhood lost

All the students in such schools lost the chance to be children, explore and grow, develop their special talents, and form their unique identity. But for those who did not get admission to engineering colleges, the loss was manifold. They got little support in the school, as the best teachers were deployed to teach the top-level students. Reportedly, the students in the bottom layer were pejoratively called ‘patrons’ by the management, as their parents paid high fees, while their chances of getting into an engineering college were negligible.

Also Read The false allure of English-medium schooling

Behind this story of lost childhoods, and for many students, lost career opportunities too, lay corporate greed and state failure. Corporate greed was visible in aggressive campaigns to enrol students. Teachers at a government school said private school representatives came to the school in January, made lists of good students, contacted parents, and encouraged students to join. An individual who once worked in a corporate school reported that teachers were given targets to enrol students and collect fees, and their salary was withheld if they did not meet them. Norms regarding minimum infrastructure, such as space, sanitation, play-grounds, fire safety etc. were flouted. The maximum fees a school was allowed to charge was ₹4,000 per year, but corporate schools charged extra as coaching fees and for facilities, adjusting the fees to the paying capacity of the area.

In cahoots with government

Government officials, teacher educators, and even panchayat representatives interviewed were aware that the educational practices of corporate schools were questionable, and that they fooled and exploited students and parents. However, regulating such schools was beyond the capacity of the government system. One, at inter-college, or the Classes XI and XII stage, where corporate schools first began, the number of government educational institutions was inadequate. Two, the manpower available for regulation was deficient. At the district level, the senior-most principal of government inter colleges was designated the Regional Inspection Officer (RIO), and was responsible for regulating private schools, in addition to his existing duties. Moreover, because of a lack of manpower, some RIOs had charge of more than one inter-college. For Classes IX and X, education officials remained busy with government schools, and had little time to inspect private schools.

Also Read Enrolment ratio in A.P. schools below national average

Three, the corporate school management exercised considerable influence at the very top levels of government. They were reported to contribute funds during elections, and some had begun political careers themselves. Officials described several instances of political pressure to prevent action against corporate schools. So much so that representatives of small private schools complained that the government favoured corporate schools and discriminated against them. Not surprisingly, little effort had been made to inform people about the problems with corporate schools.

This nasty tale of state collusion with uncaring profit-makers remains hidden as the faces of successful entrants of IITs stare at us from newspaper advertisements every year.

382,2020/03/05,The sum and substance of the Afghan deal,"The United States is on its way out and this does not ensure peace for the people of Afghanistan

The long-awaited deal between the United States and the Taliban was finally signed in Doha last Saturday by U.S. Special Envoy Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad and former Taliban deputy leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. On the same day, U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper visited Kabul to conclude the Joint Declaration for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the two governments. Gaps and inconsistencies between the two only add to the confusion. But two facts are clear. The U.S. is on its way out and second, this does not ensure peace for the Afghan people. As former U.S. Defence Secretary General Mattis put it, “The U.S. doesn’t lose wars, it loses interest.” But since a major power cannot be seen to be losing a war, certainly not in an election year, a re-labelling of the withdrawal becomes necessary.

Shades of Vietnam

Nearly a half century ago, U.S. President Richard Nixon had faced a similar dilemma. With more than half-a-million U.S. soldiers deployed in Vietnam, it was clear that a military solution was out of question. Seeking an exit, his National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, during his secret visit to Beijing in July 1971, assured Premier Zhou Enlai that the U.S. was prepared to withdraw completely from Vietnam in return for release of U.S. prisoners of war and a ceasefire lasting “a decent interval”. Kissinger and Nixon knew that the deal would leave their ally, the South Vietnamese government led by President Thieu, vulnerable. In declassified 1972 White House tapes, Nixon and Kissinger acknowledge that “South Vietnam is not going to survive and the idea is to find a formula that can hold things together for a year or two”. The ploy worked.

Nixon was re-elected with a record margin in November 1972 on the platform that peace was at hand. In January 1973, the Paris Peace Accords were signed, and by end March, the U.S. had completed its withdrawal ending direct military involvement. U.S. prisoners of war were released but by end-1973, the ceasefire was in tatters. Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese forces on April 30, 1975. Approximately 20,000 U.S. soldiers died during 1972-73 (Nixon cemented the understanding during his visit to China in February 1972) and 80,000 South Vietnamese soldiers died after the collapse of the ceasefire, following the decent interval. To win his re-election, Nixon had promised an honourable peace and delivered a delayed defeat, but by then the world had moved on. Dr. Kissinger won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 (joint winner). The secret assurances of 1971-72 only surfaced after four decades.

Mr. Khalilzad is no stranger to Washington politics having served in Republican administrations since the Reagan era. He understood his job perfectly when Secretary Pompeo appointed him the Special Envoy for Afghan Reconciliation in September 2018. An Afghan by birth (he came to the U.S. in his teens) and having served as U.S. Ambassador in Afghanistan, he knew full well that he was not negotiating an Afghan peace deal; he was negotiating a “managed” U.S. exit. The time line too was clear. U.S. President Donald Trump had repeatedly declared that “great nations do not fight endless wars”; his re-election is due in the fall of 2020.

The road to Doha

Mr. Trump’s 2017 policy aimed at breaking the military stalemate in Afghanistan by authorising an additional number of up to 5,000 soldiers, giving U.S. forces a freer hand to go after the Taliban, putting Pakistan on notice and strengthening Afghan capabilities. Within a year, it was clear that the policy was not working because no insurgency can be defeated as long as it enjoys safe havens and secure sanctuaries. Pakistan’s help was necessary to get the Taliban to the negotiating table.

Comment | Who won the Afghan war?

A three-way negotiation ensued. First was the Doha track with the Taliban; a second was with Islamabad/Rawalpindi and the third was with Kabul to ensure that the Afghan government would accept the outcome. The dice was loaded because Taliban and Pakistan negotiated as a team. Within six months, they had whittled down Mr. Khalilzad’s four objectives: a ceasefire, an intra-Afghan peace dialogue, cutting ties with terrorist organisations such as al-Qaeda, and finally, U.S. troop withdrawal —to just the last one, with some palliatives regarding the third.

The deal was ready to be signed last September when Mr. Trump abruptly called it off, stalling the process. National Security Adviser John Bolton’s dismissal (he was opposed) and the release of three high-level Taliban militants including Anas Haqqani (Sirajuddin Haqqani’s brother) in November helped smoothen issues.

The key features of the Doha deal are: i) U.S. troops to be reduced from the current 14,000 to 8,600 by June 15 (in 135 days); ii) withdrawal of all remaining U.S. and foreign forces by April 29, 2021 (in 14 months); iii) Removal of the Taliban from UN Security Council sanctions list by May 29; iv) Up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 Afghan security forces prisoners to be released from Afghan and Taliban custody respectively by March 10; v) U.S. sanctions against Taliban leaders to be lifted by August 27; vi) intra-Afghan talks to begin on March 10.

Whither Afghanistan?

Nothing reflects the fragility of the deal signed between the U.S. and the Taliban in Doha better than the title: “Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan which is not recognised by the United States as a state and is known as the Taliban and the United States of America”. This is repeated more than a dozen times in the agreement. Ironically, the U.S. has committed to getting UN Security Council endorsement for the deal with an entity that it does not recognise.

The leader of the Haqqani network and the number two of the Taliban, Sirajuddin Haqqani, who recently wrote an op-ed in The New York Times, remains on the U.S.’s wanted list with a reward of $10-million for information leading to his capture or death. This hardly squares with the notion that the Taliban is now a U.S. counter-terrorism partner against the Islamic State.

The Kabul Declaration states that Afghan government will “participate in US facilitated discussion with Taliban on CBMs, to include determining the feasibility of releasing significant number of prisoners on both sides”. There is no reference to numbers to be released or a deadline of March 10 linking it to commencing intra-Afghan talks, as in the Doha deal. No wonder President Ghani angrily declared a day later that release of prisoners will be part of the agenda for the intra-Afghan talks, provoking the Taliban to declare that the truce would no longer cover Afghan security forces, creating the first of many obstacles ahead.

There is no mention of what will happen to the Taliban fighters whose numbers have suddenly inflated from earlier range of 30,000 to 50,000 to 60,000 to 1,50,000. Are they to be disarmed and demobilised; prepared for civilian life or integrated with the Afghan security forces? Who is expected to provide stipends to those opting for peace? Mr. Trump maintains that it is “time that the war on terror is fought by someone else” so it will not be the U.S.. The U.S. has described itself as a “facilitator”, a responsibility that it will be glad to share with others.

The idea of a ceasefire, which is normally the starting point for any peace process, has been made an outcome of the intra-Afghan dialogue, together with a political road map for the future, but without any time frame. There is no reference to preserving the gains of the last 18 years and with the Taliban intent on reviving the Islamic Emirate, the shape of things is clear.

Remember the duck test — if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it probably is a duck.

The step by the Geneva-based Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), of planning to move the Supreme Court on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is a blatant case of ‘overreach’ (Page 1, March 4). As the External Affairs Ministry has said, the CAA is an internal matter. If the OHCHR is genuinely concerned about rights, it can cast its net outside — its very first priority should be to stop the inhuman treatment being meted out to the Palestinians by Israel for years. The UN would do well to remember that Palestinians are stateless people and their hardships and travails are quite unlikely to end in the foreseeable future.

If the UN human rights body, long known for its selective targeting of nations and lacking a deep understanding of India’s political and cultural history, can muster the temerity to challenge India’s sovereignty in enacting its own laws, one need not look far to seek the context for this diplomatic misadventure. The blitzkrieg of the anti-CAA protests, riding on fictitious narratives and exaggerated concerns about existential threats to a community, has done incalculable damage to India’s image abroad. The protesters and their political backers may exult over the government’s discomfiture with a sense of schadenfreude, but they need to ponder the perils of agitational overreach and political opportunism.

The loss of face for the government, if any, is an assault on national prestige and is, in fact, a loss of dignity for every Indian citizen. It is not axiomatic that the louder the protest, wider the publicity, the greater is its legitimacy. Surprised by the indefensible and inexplicable stridency and belligerence of the protests, the silent majority seems to have arrived at the inescapable conclusion that the protesters have been driven by persecution complex and an adversarial mindset towards the ruling establishment to launch a causeless agitation that has wrecked social harmony.

V.N. Mukundarajan,

With due respect to the OHCHR official and her quest to protect all human rights for all people”, I would like to ask her a few questions: Where was the OHCHR and its concern for human rights when countries were being ravaged and generations of people continue to suffer in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Libya or even in nearby Afghanistan? Has the OHCHR ensured accountability when a few powerful nations were unilaterally bombing these countries including civilian institutions? Where was the OHCHR when much of Europe refused to accept dinghies of immigrants fleeing persecution and war and left them adrift in the high seas? Why has the OHCHR never spoken out against countries in West Asia that deny citizenship but also residency rights to outsiders? Even without these analogies, India is a sovereign nation and is well within its rights to legislate on internal matters.

T. Nagarajan,

While there may be much argument about how right the move is from a legal angle, the point is that it has dented the image and prestige of India on the international stage. Already nations such as Malaysia, Turkey, Iran, the United States (some leaders) and the European Parliament have expressed their concerns over the CAA.

It is a divisive policy that has left us in an embarrassing spot.

Reservation issue

There is no denying the fact that reservation has helped in the uplift of the Backward Classes and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Editorial page, “A blow against social justice”, March 4). There is the other side to this too. There is a conspicuously inadequate representation of SCs and STs in the higher echelons of government services and judiciary as well. We all agree that the caste system is a sort of social evil that creates social hierarchy and divisions in society.

We make efforts to fight the discrimination created by the caste system — reservation is a tool for the same — but do nothing to get rid of the caste system itself.

It has been 70 years since the adoption of the policy of reservation and I feel it is time to get rid of the caste system. It would be a very difficult task especially having been a social system in place for long. Having served as the basis for several social, economic and political activities, it would be difficult for it to be dropped overnight using legislation.

Nonetheless, it is time that we at least start asking ourselves: Can we do it? If yes, then how?

To play or not

The reported statements of both the Indian Premier League Governing Council chairman Brijesh Patel and BCCI president Sourav Ganguly ruling out any threat to the upcoming Indian Premier League due to the coronavirus outbreak as of now, seems premature (‘Sport’ page, March 4). This life-threatening virus is already made its presence felt in India and medical experts have cautioned people about avoiding going to public places and gatherings. In the present situation, the focus needs to be on ensuring full protection and safety as far as public health is concerned.

Any final decision regarding holding the Indian Premier League or any other big sporting event as scheduled should rest solely with the Union Health Ministry and the State governments concerned. Large and regular gatherings of spectators in cricket stadiums in different cities with even spectators coming in from different cities over a two month period pose a huge potential risk of the virus spreading.

384,2020/03/05,‘Gypsy’ movie review: This Raju Murugan film leaves you in deep conflict,"Jiiva is exceptional, having put his heart and soul into the character’s representation and portrayal, but as a whole, the film struggles to appeal to our collective

This Raju Murugan film is a curve ball.

It is hard to fathom Gypsy as a love story, especially after watching the original trailer (released last year). But it is what it is — a story of a man named Gypsy (Jiiva) whom Waheeda (Natasha Singh), the daughter of a Muslim man, Muthaleef (Lal Jose), who believes a woman’s agency is best placed in a man’s hands, falls in love with. Contemporary political scenarios affect their romantic journey and the filmmaker drops a message of social harmony into the package.

Gypsy is hard-hitting in parts. It is the kind of film that dares you to stare at the screen even as it kicks up a conflict and the feeling of guilt in your heart. But it is also an odd film because it leaves you conflicted about what to make of it. If love in the times of sectarian/casteist/politcal violence is the core of a movie, then there are better films that do justice to such a premise. Gypsy, in comparison, appears to be a collage of scenes that are wildly different from one another in terms of the emotion (some provoke you to hark back to it but none leave a deeply profound, thought provoking level of impact) it kicks up in the viewer.

Before getting into the details: besides Jiiva, the two real heroes of this film are Santhosh Narayanan for how his beats carry the ethos of the film from start to end, and Selvakumar SK, whose angles and frames are extraordinary in places.

The film begins in a fictional Kashmir valley. It is the sound that sets the mood: you are welcomed by the noise of automatic rifles firing at will, of bombs being dropped at a scenic location. We are then shown four people in a hideout desperately hanging onto their lives amid the violence (read as: war) — an inter-religious couple (the woman is offering the namaaz while the man is praying to the Hindu God Shiva), their just born son and a nomad. As the couple leave the hideout, they are killed and the child is orphaned. The nomad takes possession of the orphaned child and names him Gypsy.

The belittling of human lives in the name of all the divisive reasons under the Sun that human beings can conjure drives the narrative from this point on.

Gypsy travels the country with his adoptive father, who he calls Senior. He has no religion, no caste and no one language. Hence, he has no identity. In one of the earlier, poignant scenes, which sets up the film’s political premise, Senior tells Gypsy that having travelled the length and breadth of the country, he could tell the distance between Kashmir and Kanyakumari, but what he could not figure in his lifetime was the “distance between two human hearts”. When Senior passes away, Gypsy plants a sapling in his memory — how very meaningful, if only all those who passed were remembered as trees and not just on tombstones by their near and dear ones.

Gypsy’s proclivity to force you into a rethink can be found in its dialogues; such lines are littered all across the film. When Gypsy and his nomadic troupe are held responsible for their horse (Che) attacking an Imam, he is asked: “Gypsy na... enna matham, enna jaathi?” (What is the religion and caste of a Gypsy?), and he responds, “Matham pudikaatha manusha jaathi” (Humans without religion).

It is a clever pun. ‘Matham’ here refers both to religion and insanity, easily interchangeable depending on the context.

Raju Murugan is a clever writer. Years of practice as a journalist helps, his characters are sweetly-layered. But his writing is not without flaws; the screenplay suffers courtesy a lack of refinement, and his characters are distinctly one-shaded in that they only resonate with the ideology they are used to. They lack the natural flavours of a human being. Case in point: when Hindu fundamentals strike at the doors of houses in an alley, as they go on a rampage killing hundreds of Muslims, they repeat, in almost a robotic fashion: “Maar Dalo, Maar Dalo”.

Other such instances of where weak writing comes to the fore is when the grown-up Gypsy meets Waheeda. The film slows down considerably, at this point.

It takes time to build their romance: nothing flashy, no over-the-top attempts by the cupid struck hero to woo his woman. It is precisely at this point that, as a viewer, you can be certain of Gypsy’s ‘love story’ premise because until then, Raju Murugan shows a distinct eagerness to colour his screenplay using political commentary.

There is, however, one high point in the love track between Gypsy and Waheeda in the first half. If the Maruvaarthai Pesaathe song from last year’s Enai Noki Paayum Thota was an expression of a man’s boundless love for the woman, then Kaathellam Poo Manakka is just a beautifully-shot song, which has a man let the woman know why their love needs to push past the bounds imposed on them.

There are amateur scenes too, which does not fall under the “witty extrapolation” category. Like the scene where Gypsy is watching an India-Pakistan cricket match. He cheers for both India and Pakistan; it re-establishes what we have known since the start of the film that here is a man who is neither governed by religion nor is restricted by lines of control drawn by humans to separate themselves.

What we do not understand is how in the following shot, when he confronts an upset Waheeda, he proceeds to ask if the cause of her sadness is due to Pakistan’s poor performance (using the word ‘ungaalunga’). She retorts: “Neenga enna loosa? India than engaalunga” (Are you mad? Indians are our people).

With the benefit of hindsight, I will take it easy on Raju Murugan here and now. A secular society could look down upon a filmmaker for using such lines to drive home a subtle political message. But can I really say — with any shred of conviction — that what Gypsy asks Waheeda is out of context in the current political climate? I don’t think so. The rhetoric around people expressing an opposing view being branded anti-nationals, and being asked to (with the use of uncivilised language) “Go to Pakistan” on prime time news debates of all places, still happen.

Then, Waheeda decides to take a leap of faith. The significance of the ‘why did she do it’ is held together by this scene where Muthaleef meets with his future son-in-law. He runs a hotel where his mother cooks food for customers. She does not exit out from behind the curtain from where she cooks. He tells Muthaleef that Waheeda should come soon (read as: rush the marriage date) so that he can relieve his mother off the cooking duties. The two men talk; the woman is nowhere in the scene, we only get glimpses of her when the wind lifts the curtain to reveal her presence.

Muthaleef’s fundamentalist ideals are further represented in a later scene when he forces his community’s religious heads to formalise Waheeda’s separation from Gypsy. When Gypsy insists that he won’t agree to the separation until Waheeda says so, Muthaleef responds with something along the lines of: ‘What has a woman got to say after the men have come together to make the good decision?’

The women in Muthaleef’s universe ought to be chained to their patriarchy-enforced responsibilities, and it is precisely these chains that Waheeda chooses to rid herself off, when she asks Gypsy to take her on a ride atop his horse, the night previous to her nikah — “for a little distance”, she says; “a little further”, she adds; before she asks him to take her away for good. Gypsy doesn’t say a word. He takes her with him; to show her the world she had been boxed away from, the world that she longed to see, know and experience, away from the rigidity of organised religion’s fundamentalist shackles.

And then Leaderji happens.

Now, if you haven’t already watched the “censor cut” clips the film’s production team has made available on YouTube, with an explainer at the start as to why these scenes were demanded to be removed by the Central Board of Film Certification, go watch it. Not that it would enhance your experience of watching Gypsy, but it does lead one to wonder could Raju Murugan really have been hampered by the demand for unrealistic cuts, crippling his visualisation of how the script ought to have been presented on the big screen?

I felt that there is little evidence of jarring, obnoxious cuts in the film’s certified version. But neither the production team nor Raju Murugan never came out clean on the extent of cuts demanded; what we knew was that there was a dispute in terms of what was deemed objectionable representation by the certifying authority and what Raju Murugan thought was fair representation.

As a result of the dispute, we do not see the colour saffron anywhere in the film except for when right wing fundamentalist characters sport them as tilak. The violence, the bloodshed and goriness all take place in a world hued different using the Inkwell filter from Instagram, which is a shame considering how brutally upsetting it is. Raju Murugan incorporates Bilkis Bano, Mohammed Akhlaq and the many faces who we seldom remember in the aftermath of riots. The rioting sequence is jarring considering how they do not look out of place, especially after the events in Delhi over the last couple of weeks. There is no aesthetic about it; riots are dirty, it is abhorrent, especially when the inciting cause is religion, a rhetoric of ‘Us versus Them’.

That is exactly what Leaderji does clad in his hued-out-of-meaning-and-context saffron robes, standing near the Ganges bank in a fictional North Indian town that eerily rhymes with Allahabad (I’m giving the benefit of doubt to Raju Murugan, his script and dialogues easily pre-dates Prayagraj’s period of existence). But we see little of Leaderji; actually we see nothing of him, the scene I mention above is from the censor cut (his likeness and appearance has been cut right out of every single frame in the film, we only hear him in voice-over capacity), but we do see his evil lieutenant, the man who believes he is tasked with the responsibility of upholding “morals”, and of the fight to restore the “natural order of things” with respect to minority communities’ existence in their midst.

Then, there is Sonu Kumar (whose name seems to have been changed, judging by the dub). He becomes the face of religious hatred and majoritarian violence in Gypsy, not too dissimilar to the gunman who fired at protesting JNU students a little over a month ago in Delhi. The imagery of him standing with arms raised, wielding a sword, and having a pregnant Waheeda at his mercy as the merciless assailants around him chant, “Maar Dalo” is as chilling and spine-tingling as it is recent.

What unfolds as a result of the riots, and how it affects Gypsy’s love life forms the rest of the plot.

It is this latter half of the journey that makes a viewer feel distant about Gypsy, allowing one to only enjoy it in parts and not in its entirety. As a whole, the film struggles to appeal to our collective, to call us out on our bigotry and to remind us of the consequences of keeping our maun vrat in an hour of need. It confronts one political ideology head on, but Gypsy’s premise as a love story unfolding in the backdrop of a radically right wing fundamentalist political climate needed more juice. It lacks in the department of hard-hitting moments, like a Joker did.

Perhaps that is what making a film with an established hero entails, although credit where it is due, Jiiva is exceptional as Gypsy. He seems to have put his heart and soul into the character’s representation and portrayal. It ought to be said that the script seldom pushes the actor beyond his comfort zone. It is as if Raju Murugan imagined Kavalai Vendam Jiiva growing out long hair, sporting nomadic clothes and carrying a custom-made guitar around with a horse for company.

In other words, Gypsy is no Joker. There is no single superlative performance (like Guru Somasundaram in the latter). There is no isolated defining moment that strips nude the frivolous nature of the life and times we live in (like the death of a wife for want of a proper toilet). There is no impact after the event.

Raju Murugan, it would seem so, is less likely to not be crucified at the altar of his National Award-winning sophomore film. Gypsy is no Joker but a gypsy is who we could all aspire to be, if not for the jokers ruining it for us.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/9yh7zo/article30990608.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JiivaGypsy-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/gypsy-movie-review-this-raju-murugan-film-leaves-you-in-deep-conflict/article30990615.ece
385,2020/03/05,Margi Visishta and Margi Aswathy did a fine job of describing the sights in the garden in ‘Bhagavadajjukam’,"Margi Visishta and Margi Aswathy donned the roles of Ajjuka and Madhurika respectively in the Sanskrit work

Koodiyattam aficionados had a treat in a Koodiyattam presentation consisting of ‘Udyanavarnanam’ (description of the garden) in the anonymous Sanskrit farce (prahasana) called Bhagavadajjukam or Bhagavadajjukiiyam.

Etymologically the title indicates that it is an episode involving a ‘Bhagavan’ (a hermit or a holy man) and an Ajjuka (Prakrit for a courtesan). But the crux of the theme is the hilarious after effects of an accidental transmigration of the souls of a hermit and a courtesan who are among the main characters of the play.

Mistaken identity

A soldier of Yama, the god of death, due to a case of mistaken identity, takes away the soul of Ajjuka, who was bitten by a serpent while spending some time in the garden with her companion Madhurika. Realising his mistake, the soldier returns to the garden only to find the soul of a hermit inhabiting Ajjuka’s body. As the soldier is on an urgent mission, he slips Ajjuka’s soul into that of the lifeless Bhagavan’s body.

Other characters in the play include a friar, believed to be an expert in treating cases of poisoning, the Sandilya and the Vidooshaka or clown, who functions as the disgruntled disciple of the Bhagavan.

Margi Visishta and Margi Aswathy donned the roles of Ajjuka and Madhurika respectively. The duo captured the attention of the audience right from the moment they appeared on stage with their demeanour, make-up and costume (‘aahaaryam’). That favourable impression was sustained till the end through grace, precision and force of their emotional and gestural acting.

The trees and creepers in the garden appear to be bedecked with fragrant, colourful flowers. The buzz of bees is heard all around. While a mild breeze carries the fragrance flowers, peacocks mistake the sound of fountains for thunder and burst into a charming dance, as if to welcome the imminent rain. The swans treat themselves to a sumptuous feast in the stalk of lotus flowers. Ajjuka and Madhurika find a smooth rock to sit on as they enjoy the sights, sound and fragrance of the garden and sing an enchanting song. The episode continues with Ajjuka’s death due to snake bite. But the scene selected for the performance came to a close with the duo in the garden.

The performance, about one-and-a-half hours long, provided the viewers the rare opportunity of viewing a scene that is reputed for its aesthetic charm. It was Painkulam Rama Chakyar’s dexterous choreography of the Bhagavadajjukam in 1976, which reduced the performance time of the play from 35 hours to about three-and-a- half so as to suit the changing taste of the audience and for pragmatic reasons.

The percussion team consisting of Margi Sajikumar and Margi Mahesh on the mizhavu, Anayara Vijayan on the edakka and Margi Devendu, who handled the rhythm, did a fine job as they ensured that they were in sync with the action and the changing emotions of the characters, especially in the scenes wherein the actors transform themselves into a bee, a peacock, a swan, wind... according to the script.

The performance, organised by Koodiyattam Centre, was held at Vivekananda Cultural Institute in the capital city.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/v3spcd/article30987923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvfBhagavadajjukam,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/margi-visishta-and-margi-aswathy-excel-on-stage-performing-scene-from-bhagavadajjukkam/article30987924.ece
386,2020/03/05,Koodiyattam exponent Sooraj Nambiar’s evocative presentation of excerpts from ‘Shakuntalam’ and ‘Thoranayudham’,"He came up with captivating solo acts of certain excerpts from the texts in Thrissur

Two anecdotes excerpted from Shakuntalam and Thoranayudham were staged by Sooraj Nambiar at St Thomas College, Thrissur. The sloka beginning with ‘Chalaa paamgam drushtim sprusasi bahu sove padhumathim’ from Shakuntalam was taken to depict ‘Bhramara badha’ (attack by the bee). On reaching the ashram of sage Kanwa, Dushyantha is puzzled to see a bee that hovers constantly around Shakuntala.

Sooraj, an alumnus and current faculty member of Ammannur Chachu Chakyar Smaraka Gurukulam, appeared in the ‘sthayi’ of Dushyantha, who wonders at the strange sight. Sooraj’s transformation into Shakuntala was admirable. Annoyed with the bee’s antics she tries to run away but the bee chases her. All attempts to drive it away fail. While staccato beats from the two mizhavus served to enhance the intensity of the bee’s constant buzz around Shakuntala, the edakka supported the amorous attitude of the bee. The display won a spontaneous applause from the audience. Then, Sooraj turned into Dushyantha, his face reflecting emotions ranging from wonder to jealousy.

The 20-minute anecdote was presented to highlight ‘pakarnnattam’ (multiple impersonation of characters by a single actor), an intrinsic technique in Koodiyattam, and also to depict the delineation of varied rasas.

Solo act

There are around a dozen archetypal anecdotes that are generally presented to highlight the theatrical potential of Koodiyattam, when a play is not fully staged. Among them, Kailasodharanam (lifting of Kailasa) was enacted by Sooraj. This feat is presented to project the valour of Ravana, whenever he appears in a play.

Sooraj selected a part from the ‘Nirvahanam’ (pre-story recital) of Sankukarna in Thoranayudham of poet Bhasa. The headgear was changed to suit the character. After defeating Vaisranava and usurping his vimana, Pushpaka, Ravana is returning to Lanka when he finds Mount Kailasa blocking his way. He asks Maricha to remove the obstacle but he is helpless. Infuriated, Ravana alights from the vimana and throws away the giant of a mountain.

Sooraj, as Ravana, surveys the mountain. One could see in his eyes the height of Kailasa and its innumerable peaks. Lowering his body while staring at the mountain appeared an ingenious technique to demonstrate its height. The description of the mountain entailed the valleys, the rain drops, water flowing to form rivulets which in confluence turns into rivers forming water falls.

Using his eyes and gestures, Sooraj magnificently depicted the mountain and its features. Long drawn was the process to shake the mountain and lift it. After stretching his hands several times to warm up, he tries to shake the mountain at first. When such attempts fail, he sits on the ground and starts inserting his hands under the mountain. Finally the mountain begins to move and he starts lifting it up gradually. The entire body and the eyes of the actor communicated the weight of the mountain. The beats of the mizhavu seemed to energise him. Ravana plays a game of ‘ammanaattam’ as he transfers the mountain from one hand to the other. He finally discards the mountain as if it were a flower.

Sooraj’s abhinaya skills received spontaneous applause from the audience, as they watched the mountain being lifted. Kalamandalam Hariharan AN and Kalamandalam Narayanan Nambiar were on the mizhavu and Moorkanad Dinesh Warrier, on the edakka. The programme was organised by Devamatha Cultural Centre.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/tymd8y/article30987994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvfSooraj,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/sooraj-nambiar-presents-excerpts-from-shakuntalam-and-thoranayudham/article30987996.ece
387,2020/03/05,Michelin’s star chef comes to Mumbai,"Mauro Colagreco rated as the world’s number one chef will be in the city for one special meal

Argentina’s most celebrated culinary export Mauro Colagreco has been serving seasonal food on the Côte d’Azur, at his restaurant Menton since 2006. Last year Mirazur, also called the ultimate restaurant experience, was awarded a coveted third Michelin star, pushing it to the number one position on the World’s 50 Best Restaurants List. Despite Mirazur’s presence in the ‘best of’ lists, Colagreco, isn’t the kind of person who hankers for news space. Colagreco doesn’t open restaurants with Gucci or work on an academy and conduct symposiums for chefs. Instead Colagreco, prefers to cook and allow his food and the dining experience to do the talking.

Raising the bar

This Saturday, for one night only (select) Mumbaikars – will get a taste of Mirazur’s food when Colagreco comes visiting. Marriott International in partnership with Culinary Culture have brought the chef to India as part of their Masters of Marriott programme. “I love travelling, discovering new places, trying different foods and meeting new people,” says Colagreco about the collaboration.

This particular pop-up is all about raising the bar, as it’s all about the recreation of the entire Mirazur experience, down to the flatware and tables. Colagreco shares,“Guests can expect to enjoy some Mirazur classic dishes, such as Goat Cheese Ravioli and Smoked Eel and Caviar Tartlet. We have also created a special dish inspired by India, incorporating local produce and techniques,” Expectedly, he’s waiting to unveil the dish at the pop-up.

Culinary journey

In previous interviews, Colagreco has stated how he wanted to open his own restaurant outside of Paris, away from the pressures of the city. Menton is just that. “I first arrived in Menton in 2005 and fell in love with the abandoned building that was Mirazur at the time, I rented it for a ridiculously low amount, the early days were tough as I had no money and no experience of running a restaurant,” he says. The local community now inspires his menu and the district’s much vaunted citrus fruit. “The location has a very big impact on the food we serve. Mirazur is on the Italian-French Border on the Cote D’Azur, so my inspiration comes from the environment surrounding me, the mountains, the sea and my garden. I like to present to guests a menu designed as a journey, a sensory experience between gardens, mountains and the sea through its magnificent ingredients. I try to sublimate the product in order to keep its essence, and present it in its most beautiful form through the dish.”

Colagreco who responded to questions on email downplays his achievements, “My route into cooking came at a time of crisis for me – I wasn’t sure which direction to take my life in and was at a crossroads, but sometimes this is what leads to the best opportunities. I studied for a literary baccalaureate and I tried to follow in my dad's footsteps as an accountant, but I just had no passion for either. My sister reminded me of how much I used to love cooking with my grandmother when I was a child. It was this memory that started my journey into discovering my true passion for cooking, and now I could not imagine myself being anything else.” In keeping with his slant towards sustainable cooking, Colagareco is excited to experiment with vegetarian cooking. “For me, a vegetable is much more interesting to cook with and has many more options than meat. Vegetables can be used raw, cooked, steamed, liquidised, puréed, confit, salty and even in desserts. The different ways are infinite and for a creative chef that is really exciting. Vegetables will certainly play a big part in our menu in India,” says the chef.

388,2020/03/05,What makes Speyside’s whisky special,"A master distiller explains why this Scottish region is iconic in the world of whiskies

Alan Winchester is a spirited man. Let’s just say that is one of the many perks of being a master distiller. Especially, considering he has been in the whisky industry for 40 years, since he was a 16-year-old.

For the last 20 years, Winchester has been an integral part of the French alcohol giant Pernod Ricard. “It has been an honour to work with Pernod Ricard on Secret Speyside, a curated collection of 15 rare and remarkable whiskies from four of Speyside’s most elusive distilleries,” says Winchester.

For the uninitiated, Speyside, located in the picturesque Scottish Highlands, is Scotland’s biggest whisky-producing region. It is home to 50 distilleries, and represents almost half of all distilleries in Scotland, some of which date back to the early 1800s.

Explaining the geography, Winchester says that there are five undisputed regions in Scotland producing this drink: Speyside, Highlands, Lowlands, Islay and Campbeltown, each offering its own distinctive flavour profile.

One of the reasons why Speyside stands out is due to its abundance and quality of water. It is believed that the region’s water has the lowest level of dissolved minerals in the country. And as a result, what you get are sophisticated, smooth whiskies “frugal with peat and full of fruit.” Apple, pear, honey, vanilla and spice all have a role in expressions from this region, which are commonly matured in sherry casks.

Dram details The Highlands region has a huge diversity of flavours and characters, from lighter whiskies all the way through to salty coastal malts.

Soft and smooth malts are characteristic of the Lowlands region, offering a gentle, elegant palate reminiscent of grass, honeysuckle, cream, ginger, toffee, toast and cinnamon.

Islay is a unique island where the majority of its population are involved in whisky production, which is famous for fiery, heavily peated whiskies.

Campbeltown whiskies have hints of salt, smoke, fruit, vanilla and toffee combine in whiskies of robust and rich character.

The region produces an overwhelming number of malts. Some of the better-known names include Glenfiddich, The Macallan, Glenlivet, Glen Moray and Aberlour, as well as Glen Keith, Caperdonich and Braes of Glenlivet that are part of the Secret Speyside collection. Winchester says the philosophy behind the creation of Secret Speyside is one of discovery, cultural enrichment and excellence.

The distilleries have intriguing stories. “Take Caperdonich, for example — the distillery was taken down brick by brick in 2011, so, there is only a finite supply of the whisky featured in the collection. Once gone, they will be gone forever,” he says.

And do the whiskies from the distilleries of Speyside have a characteristic taste or aroma? Although there is a sweet, fruity, floral, Speyside “style,” the house styles of different distilleries in the same area can be dramatically different, says Winchester.

Despite having over 120 active distilleries across different regions, the dram here varies from one distillery to another. “From the source of the water and the shape of the still to the wood of the cask used to mature the spirit, there are many factors that make Scotch whisky so wonderfully different.” He adds, “No two are the same; each has its own proud heritage, unique setting and its own way of doing things that has evolved and been refined over time.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/wr3vs0/article30990799.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06mpspeyside,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/what-makes-speysides-whisky-special/article30990802.ece
389,2020/03/05,Abinas Nayak on winning the coveted Masterchef Season 6 title,"Flavours from home: Abinas Nayak used cuisines and techniques he was familiar with to win the coveted Masterchef Season 6 title

When 28-year-old Abinas Nayak decided to take part in Masterchef India Season 6, all he wished for was to make it to the top 15. An analyst from Odisha, Abinas lives and works in Hyderabad, and had done his preparation well. He wanted to make a statement — not for himself or his cooking skills, but for Odisha’s cuisine which is rarely spoken of. Abinas’s love to create regional food and present it with an Instagram-worthy twist, has drawn a lot of followers. They know what to expect of him — so much so that when he repeatedly used his water straw ‘morha’ to present his dishes, they wanted more.

Abinas went on to use his expertise to create dishes not commonly found on restaurant menus. “I decided to make the Chicken Besara, a dish made with an Oriya signature mustard paste base. I used black and white mustard seeds to make a paste along with cumin, chilli, and garlic. I presented it with rice and the judges polished it off. After which I was simply told, ‘You are selected.’ No questions asked, no interview. I was dumbfounded. Seeing other participants go through 30-minute interviews, I was quite nervous,”says Abinas, speaking over phone from Mumbai, where he is with his family to celebrate his win.

Abinas is all for experimentation: he is not just about the Odia pakhla bhaat and ghugni; nor is he one to constantly debate on the GI tag for rasagulla. He has attempted a chocolate variant of the traditional rasagulla; has made chicken drumsticks and kebabs on betel leaves, among many others. A self-taught food stylist and techie, Abinas was also the recipient of the Lokicooks Fellowship 2019.

‘All worthwhile’

Going back to his days at the Masterchef kitchen, Abinas recollects it to be “humongous and gruelling”. He admits that he found the experience overwhelming at times. “But it was all worthwhile once the task was completed. We would spend over 10 hours in the kitchen preparing, brainstorming, discussing, and learning at the same time.” The most daunting task on the show was the Republic Day episode. “We were to make 15 thalis with 100 dishes from different regions of India,” he recollects.

Abinas credits his interest in cooking to his grandmother Jashoda with whom he spent most of his middle school years in Aska near Behrampur. He is now busy attending events at catering and hotel management institutions to discuss food. He doesn’t plan to start a restaurant yet, but is sure to do so in the future. “For now, I plan to document lesser-known cuisines of India,” he adds.

Abinas runs us through his winning dish: “My contender was strong and highly talented. So, for the grand finale, I decided to use all what I learned from the chefs I met, and the judges. For the final cook-off, I went all regional with flavours. I made prawn ceviche with a tempering of the Oriya pago and ambula. I also made vermicelli-coated prawn fry. This was a starter. For the main course, I picked a lost Odia recipe, the Oda mangsho (ginger lamb). I presented desi flavoured lamb shanks in an international style with mulberry, ginger, lemon honey vinaigrette, and balsamic ginger reduction. Ginger was the show-stopper flavour.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/rr8hp5/article30990074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym06abinas1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/abinas-nayak-masterchef-season-6/article30990075.ece
390,2020/03/05,This all-day dining place in Hyderabad serves up Thai dishes and novel pizzas,"A nook for nibbles

Café Nook is christened from the fact that it is in a nook. This also works to their advantage as missing this café is next to impossible. So what if parking is not thought of well, the café has done their best with interiors for car parking frustrations to fizzle out. Done up with two dominating colours — blue and white, the café will vaguely remind diners of Blue Door that once used to be a city hotspot for its signature Greek menu. What I liked best about the interior is that it is homely and cosy and gives a welcoming feel.

Café Nook is the exact place where you will want to hang out after work over endless finger foods being passed from one person to the other. These cafe’s display of knick knacks is a carefully put-together menu and one can see that a lot of thought has gone in. Nothing seems to be out of place and every corner relates to the other with perfect harmony.

Music could be a little loud sometimes, but on request they are more than willing to lower the volume.

At most cafés, my favourite go-to-dish is chicken wings; I find them value for money. Wanting to make every penny count, I ordered a portion of it. It reached the table after a bit of waiting and the first bite had me keep it back on the plate immediately — it was crispy all right but the sauces were yet to soak in. I decided to let the wings get ready as I sat waiting while my stomach growled. After about seven minutes the wings seemed ready, and this time round, with the sauces getting fully absorbed, the wings were perfect. Those who are fans of piping hot food that comes at the risk of burning your mouth, this dish is totally for you.

I was keen on trying the Caesar salad. So I did and was completely blown away by it. Many places still don’t get their salads right, this café nailed it. A lot of dishes were recommended at Café Nook. Some of them are kul kul mass pizza, bruschetta, keema pav, cottage cheese malfatti, peri peri chicken and the Thai curries.

Of the list suggested, the ones I was eager to have were the kul kul pizza and keema pav — but both weren’t available. So, for the mains, I went for chicken was Thai curry and cottage cheese malfatti. The malfatti seemed to be like malai kofta curry puddled in a thick tomato gravy — very cheesy, yet not bad to taste.

I quickly moved over from malfatti to the Thai curry. It was on point and had me cleaning the bowl to its last morsel. I also tried a no-frill chicken pizza. If I am asked to order something quick but filling and that which can be had on the go, I would go with the pizza.

392,2020/03/05,"No detention centre coming up in Maharashtra, says Anil Deshmukh","However, the Union Home Ministry has asked the State government to set-up a temporary facility to house foreign nationals awaiting deportation, he said

No detention centre is coming up in Maharashtra in connection with the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), Home Minister Anil Deshmukh told the Legislative Council on Thursday.

Mr. Deshmukh gave this information in a written reply in response to a question by Sharad Ranpise (Congress).

“No detention centre is coming up anywhere in the State in connection with rolling out of the CAA and the NRC,” he told the Upper House.

However, the Union Home Ministry in the past asked the State government to set-up a temporary facility to house foreign nationals awaiting deportation, he said.

The Union Home Ministry directed the State, in a letter dated September 10, 2014, and a manual dated January 9, 2019, to set-up a temporary detention centre for foreign nationals who have completed their jail terms here and were waiting for deportation, Mr. Deshmukh said.

Also read | Explained: What connects the NPR, NRIC and Census?

“Those foreign nationals who have served their jail sentences after conviction would be kept in such a detention centre until their nationality is proved and they are deported,” the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Minister said.

There are directives for constructing a temporary detention centre at Nerul in Navi Mumbai. The government has also requested the CIDCO (a State-run city planning agency) to allot three acres of land for setting up a permanent infrastructure for the same, Mr. Deshmukh said.

All three ruling coalition allies — the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the NCP — have opposed the proposed NRC, an exercise that seeks to create a record of bonafide Indian citizens and identify illegal migrants.

However, last month the government told Parliament it has not taken any decision on preparing a nationwide NRC.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has already said his government would not allow the NRC to be implemented as it would “impact people of all religions”.

But, Mr. Thackeray, who is also the Shiv Sena president, has supported the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which seeks to fast-track Indian citizenship for non-Muslim refugees who have fled Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan because of religious persecution.

His allies, the Congress and the NCP, have opposed the amended citizenship law, calling it discriminatory and violative of the Constitution.

393,2020/03/05,Nirbhaya case: Shiv Sena blames ‘loopholes’ in law for delay in execution,"The execution of the death warrants of the four convicts has been deferred thrice so far

The Shiv Sena on Thursday said the execution of the convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case has been being delayed due to “loopholes” in the judicial system.

Hope people will not lose faith in the Judiciary due to delays in the implementation of punishment of the convicts who are facing the gallows in the Nirbhaya case, an editorial in Saamana, the Sena mouthpiece said.

The execution of the death warrants of the four convicts — Mukesh Kumar Singh, 32, Pawan, 25, Vinay Sharma, 26, and Akshay Kumar Singh, 31 — has been deferred thrice so far due to delays by them in exhausting legal remedies. All the convicts in the case are to be hanged

together.

The Shiv Sena said courts must have been “bound” by provisions of the existing laws. But, the implementation of punishment to the culprits should not be delayed when the country’s top court has upheld the hanging of the accused.

The President rejected their mercy petitions. Moreover, their death warrants were issued and the date and time of the hanging was finalised, the Marathi daily noted.

“The loopholes in the existing laws should not come in the way of implementation of the death sentence. Such unfortunate developments should not happen,” it said, while adding that they wondered who should be blamed for this.

“Unfortunately, what should not happen is happening [in the Nirbhaya case],” it added.

“We hope people don’t lose trust in the Judiciary because of the delay in the hanging of the Nirbhaya case convicts,” the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.

Delay in justice

Due to the delay in the delivery of justice, people feel that the “Disha” shown by Andhra Pradesh, wherein the accused persons in a rape case were “killed by the Hyderabad police”, should be implemented elsewhere, the Sena said.

The Andhra Pradesh government recently formulated the Disha Act that seeks to fast track cases of offences against women and children and award death penalty.

It was enacted as a tribute to a veterinary doctor who was brutally raped and murdered in Telangana in November last year.

The law mandates completion of an investigation in cases of sexual offences within seven working days and the trial within 14 working days from the date of filing the charge sheet.

As many as 5,427 fire incidents, 17 of them serious, were reported in Mumbai in 2019, the highest compared to the annual figures recorded in the preceding two years, State Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde told the Legislative Council on Wednesday.

Mr. Shinde also informed the Upper House that 56,145 fire incidents occurred in the city from 2008 to 2019, in which 677 people died.

395,2020/03/05,Lack of publicity leads to few tenders in Navi Mumbai: CAG,"Report also cites violations in awarding contracts for Metro, airport, work delays

A Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report on public sector undertakings (PSU) has raised serious objections to the lack of publicity in inviting tenders for projects such as Navi Mumbai Metro Rail (NMMR) and Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), which resulted in poor response, and absence of competition as only two-three offers were received against 10 tenders.

The report comes as a setback to former chief minister and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Devendra Fadnavis, who had also held the urban development portfolio. The City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO) falls under the department, which is executing the two projects.

“Advertisements on 16 tenders with an estimated tender cost of ₹50 crore and above were not released in leading newspapers at the national level in violation of the guidelines. Global tenders for projects like NMMR and NMIA were not published in any international publication,” the report said.

The report further said in three contracts with a total value of ₹1,581.11 crore, the works were awarded without sufficient competition. “The contracts for land development work for packages III and IV relating to the airport were awarded M/s GPL for ₹699.44 crore at 18% above the estimated cost and M/s CSJ-GVK for ₹804.91 crore at 28.50% above the estimated cost.”

In case of NMMR, the audit said, in six cases with an estimated cost of ₹890.42 crore, the contractors did not possess the minimum prescribed value of work experience, but were awarded the contracts.

The report also highlighted the delays in the NMMR project, which was scheduled to be completed in December 2013. “The NMMR project has slowed down mainly on account of the delay in completion of station works attributed to the poor financial condition of the contractor.” The audit also said in 10 cases with a total contract value of ₹429.89 crore, the existing contractors were awarded additional works valuing ₹69.38 crore at different work sites without inviting tenders, thus violating the guidelines.

The CAG report slammed the CIDCO over payments and recoveries citing instances such as a contract valuing ₹1,328 crore regarding the NMMR project, where an excess mobilisation advance amounting to ₹25.33 crore was paid in violation of the contract condition.

In 22 contracts with a total value of ₹4,759.94 crore, the CIDCO had not recovered compensation for the delay, which amounts to ₹185.97 crore, even though the delay in completion of work or not achieving the milestones was attributed to the contractors.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xqxh39/article30985853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BMNAVIMUMBAIAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lack-of-publicity-leads-to-few-tenders-in-navi-mumbai-cag/article30985821.ece
396,2020/03/05,"Irregularities in Shivaji memorial project, but it’s not a scam: Chavan","Minister says govt. finds difference of up to ₹1,000 crore in tender process

Irregularities have been found in the Shivaji memorial project, Public Works Department (PWD) Minister Ashok Chavan said in the Legislative Council on Wednesday, stopping short of calling it a scam. “Several irregularities have been found in the tender process. We can see a difference of ₹500 crore to ₹1,000 crore but I am not calling it a scam. We feel more scrutiny is needed,” he said.

Mr. Chavan was responding to a query by Hemant Takle (Nationalist Congress Party) during Question Hour on the project, the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (CAG) stringent remarks on it, and the project’s status.

In December 2019, it came to light that the CAG, who had scrutinised the project earlier that year, had given a detailed report. The report mentioned that the PWD had floated a global tender for this project without administrative approval from a competent authority, and that the scope of work was drastically changed. Moreover, the change, after bids were opened, vitiated the tender process, it said. It also said changes in technical specifications are bad in law and a change in the height of the statue indicated improper planning, costing the exchequer an additional ₹81 crore.

Mr. Chavan’s party (the Congress) had come down heavily on the Bharatiya Janata Party for irregularities in the project. Shiv Sangram Party leader Vinayak Mete is heading the project co-ordination committee.

On Wednesday, Mr Chavan referred to the cost optimisation done by the department after the bids were invited. “The government also wants the memorial to be completed. The original approval was given in 2014 but there has been no progress since.” Mr. Mete’s letter dated September 2018, he said, raises serious concerns. Decisions regarding the project were taken without taking the Mete Committee into confidence. The CAG had raised objections, saying modification to the project after inviting bids is not correct. Some things were done to favour the project management consultant, Mr. Chavan said.

“Work was executed without administrative or technical sanctions. We feel more scrutiny is needed. We can see a difference of ₹500 crore to ₹1,000 crore. I am not saying there is a scam but it is shameful that such things happen in the project for Shivaji Maharaj,” the minister said.

Mr Mete, who is also an MLC, told Mr. Chavan, “The Cabinet has approved more than ₹3,600 crore, do you know that? Your answer is incorrect. Like me, you have also been kept in the dark. Are you thinking of cancelling the tender or retendering?”

To this, Mr. Chavan said the project’s cost has been estimated at around ₹2,500 crore plus GST while administrative approval to the project was for ₹3,600 crore. “But no money has been paid to L&T yet. Changes should not be made after bids come. It should be transparent. Many should get a chance to compete,” he said.

Mr. Chavan said the Supreme Court has put a stay on the project, which the government will try to get vacated. A member accused the previous government “that wanted to indulge in corruption in Shivaji Maharaj’s name,” which the Opposition loudly objected to. The House was adjourned for 10 minutes.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kjas6n/article30985758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BMASHOKCHAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/irregularities-in-shivaji-memorial-project-but-its-not-a-scam-chavan/article30985726.ece
397,2020/03/05,Mumbai woman’s body brought home from China a month after demise,"She died on flight, which made emergency landing in Zhengzhou

The remains of Mumbai resident Rita Mehra were brought back home from China on Wednesday, 39 days after she collapsed and died aboard a Melbourne-Mumbai flight.

On January 24, Mehra (63) boarded a late-night Air China flight from Melbourne to reach Mumbai with her son Puneet Mehra, a Bandra-based dentist. The next morning, she visited the lavatory, but failed to return.

It was only after the door was opened by the cabin crew that Mehra was found in an unconscious state. The plane made an emergency landing at the Zhengzhou Airport in China, where doctors declared her dead.

Mr. Mehra told The Hindu that he stayed back in China for two weeks to complete the formalities, hoping to bring his mother’s remains back. However, red tape and the COVID-19 outbreak presented several hurdles in the process.

“The Chinese government had taken strict measures in light of the outbreak and had restricted any public movement. Embalming procedures in China are carried out only in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, but no movement was allowed from one province to another. Besides, funeral homes were asked not to accept bodies from other provinces,” Mr. Mehra said.

Trouble with certificate

He said the medical authorities there also did not provide a death certificate that would be acceptable under Indian laws. The first certificate issued mentioned the cause of her demise as ‘death before rescue’, while the second one named a vague cause of death saying ‘cardiac arrest likely’.

“I asked them to give a proper cause of death on the certificate after conducting the autopsy, for which they asked for a month’s time saying that most of the doctors are in Wuhan or on leave due to the Chinese New Year. However, the third certificate they issued said ‘sudden death’, which was acceptable as per the Indian embassy rules,” he said.

Mr. Mehra returned to India after two weeks, but his mother’s body remained in a morgue in a hospital in Zhengzhou. He subsequently wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the External Affairs Ministry to help bring her remains home.

Mehra’s body was brought to Mumbai at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, and her last rites were performed at the Hindu Shamshaanbhumi in Santacruz around 7.30 p.m.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/z1agtm/article30985684.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BMRITAMEHTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-womans-body-brought-home-from-china-a-month-after-demise/article30985685.ece

As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in India rose to 28 on Wednesday, Mumbai remained on the edge, with preparations under way to tackle the infection if it reaches the city.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said it has enough personal protective equipment, N-95 masks and isolation beds. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said besides Kasturba Hospital, the main isolation centre in Mumbai, four other hospitals — HBT Trauma Care in Jogeshwari, Bhabha in Bandra and Kurla, and Rajawadi in Ghatkopar — have been identified to set up isolation facilities with 20-25 beds.

“Kasturba Hospital has 28 beds, but we can add another 100 if the need arises. We also have State-run hospitals as a back-up,” Mr. Kakani said. He has also requested private facilities like Jaslok and HN Reliance hospitals to be ready. The BMC has called a meeting with private hospitals on Thursday.

Kasturba Hospital currently has 4,900 articles of personal protective equipment, which include protective clothing and face shields, and 3,000 N-95 masks. “We have authorised the medical superintendent to make local purchases if needed and have also issued a tender for long-term purchases,” he said.

In case the facilities have to operate at full capacity, they have stocks that would last for 10 days, he said. Staff training programmes will also be undertaken.

State epidemiologist Dr. Pradip Awate said 161 of the 167 samples sent for testing from Maharashtra have been found to be negative. While six reports are awaited, seven patients in Mumbai and one each in Nashik and Nanded remain in isolation.

At Mumbai airport, 1,365 passengers from 12 countries, including Iran, Italy, Nepal, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, have been screened. Officials said they will now screen all travellers.

399,2020/03/05,‘Hyperloop feasibility under scrutiny’,"Urban Development Department Minister Eknath Shinde has said, in a written response to the Legislative Council, that the Mumbai-Pune hyperloop project is under scrutiny for feasibility. The statement comes in the wake of his Cabinet colleague Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar haveing expressed scepticism about the project in the past.

The previous Bharatiya Janata Party-led government announced the hyperloop to reduce travel time between the two cities. However, Mr. Pawar had said in January, “The State does not have the bandwidth to experiment with a project like the hyperloop and will focus on development and strengthening of other transport projects. When the hyperloop is successful in another country, we can do it too.”

But Mr. Shinde’s written reply to Congress legislator Sharad Ranpise that was tabled in the Legislative Council on Wednesday reads, “The Maharashtra infrastructure development enabling authority is examining the the financial cost, land acquisition and risk assessment and planning for the project.”

Asked if a meeting between the Chief Minister and British industrialist Richard Branson of the Virgin Group was organised on December 12, 2019 to discuss the project, Mr. Shinde said in his reply, “Yes this meeting was organised, and it reviewed the work to be done for the Pune-Mumbai hyperloop.”

The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority will be in charge of the project, which will be implemented through a public private partnership, Mr. Shinde said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hyperloop-feasibility-under-scrutiny/article30985621.ece
400,2020/03/05,A wink and nudge: CM asks why demonetisation is not in Budget,"Thackeray takes potshots at ex-CM during release of Fadnavis’s booklet

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday took a jibe at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), wondering why a decision like demonetisation, which had a huge impact on economy, never found mention in the (Union) Budget. He was speaking at the launch of a booklet, ‘Arthasankalp sopya bhashet’ (Budget simplified) written by BJP leader, former CM and current Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis.

The event was attended by Assembly Speaker Nana Patole, Legislative Council Chairman Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar and others.

During his speech, peppered with witticisms, Mr. Thackeray hoped Mr. Fadnavis would keep writing books on budgets of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government over the next five to 10 years.

“You have written a book before we present our first budget. You should keep writing such books on our budgets for the next 5-10 years. We will also know what the problems are on our part (in the Budget),” Mr. Thackeray said. Budgets, he said, mention the smallest of things that have a bearing on the economy.

“I always wonder, if we are mentioning small things in the budget, should demonetisation, which is of vital importance for the economy, have found a mention in the Budget or not?” said the CM.

Mr. Thackeray said the budget is worked out of the money of commoners, who should know how every penny is spent by the government.

Earlier, Mr. Pawar too did not let go of the opportunity to take friendly potshots at Mr. Fadnavis and the BJP. “When I read the book, I realised that you can be a good author,” he said, referring to the ex-CM. “We too will have better days if you turn author, skipping politics. Delhi politics require a politician and an author rolled into one. If you decide so, all 288 MLAs will support it. Especially Sudhir Mungantiwar (former finance minister) from your party,” he said.

Meanwhile, Mr. Fadnavis said the idea of the booklet was to ensure even new MLAs understand the budget well.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/u39xhv/article30985642.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BMFADNAVISBOOKRELESE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a-wink-and-nudge-cm-asks-why-demonetisation-is-not-in-budget/article30985601.ece
401,2020/03/05,‘Stopping toll at city entry points will weigh on govt.’,"Exempting 5 Mumbai entry points and Pune Expressway will cost exchequer ₹18,344 cr., says Shinde

The government will not stop collecting toll at the five entry points to Mumbai and on Mumbai-Pune Expressway as it will cost the exchequer up to ₹18,344 crore.

There has been a long-standing demand to waive toll on all entry points to Mumbai, as done in other parts of the State. In 2015, the government shut down 12 toll plazas and exempted light vehicles and State transport buses on 53 toll nakas, excluding the entry points into Mumbai.

The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena had protested against this in the past. The Bharatiya Janata Party government, before coming to power, had promised a toll-free Maharashtra, but when in power had taken a U-turn. Anant Gadgil (Congress) asked a question in the Legislative Council regarding a committee formed under the Chief Secretary to study the matter.

In his written response on Wednesday, Urban Development Department Minister Eknath Shinde said, “If light vehicles and State transport buses are given waiver on the toll nakas to Mumbai and on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, the contractor will have to be reimbursed ₹6,863 crore and in five instalments, he will have to be given ₹9,463 crore. Similarly, if the tolls are shut at once, the contractor will have to be reimbursed ₹13,379 crore and in five instalments, he will have to be given ₹18,344 crore as compensation. Since this amount is large, the government has decided not to stop toll.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hd86wk/article30985576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5bmAssembly-Backbenchersrevcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/stopping-toll-at-city-entry-points-will-weigh-on-govt/article30985577.ece
402,2020/03/05,"For ACB team, desperate times call for desperate measures","Dummy notes help boost bribe amount used to trap officer

Dummy notes of ₹2,000, normally used in children’s games or by fraudsters to slip into a bundle of genuine currency, came to the rescue of an Anti Corruption Bureau (ACB) team on Tuesday.

Officials with the Nashik unit of the ACB said they received a complaint last week from a man who works as a consultant for farmers. One of his several jobs is to act as a conduit to obtain the certificates necessary for a farmer to export his produce. The complainant alleged that when he approached Narendrakumar Aghav, a Class I government servant posted as deputy agriculture director with the office of the District Agriculture Superintendent in Nashik, for the work, the official demanded a bribe.

“The complainant was seeking certificates for a large group of farmers in one go, and Mr. Aghav demanded ₹1.64 lakh from him for the work. The complainant approached us and we started verifying his claims,” an officer with the Nashik ACB said.

In subsequent conversations monitored by the ACB, Mr. Aghav allegedly agreed to settle for ₹1 lakh as the first instalment. The ACB registered a case against Mr. Aghav and set about laying a trap. The process, however, hit a hurdle when the complainant was only able to put together ₹50,000 in cash.

“The complainant had 25 notes of ₹2,000 available at the moment, but Mr. Aghav was not willing to lower the amount any further. Any delay might have made him suspicious. So we slipped in 25 dummy notes of ₹2,000 in with the genuine notes,” an ACB officer said.

On Tuesday, Mr. Aghav accepted the money in his office. ACB officers, who were in the area in plain clothes, arrested Mr. Aghav.

“He has been charged with demanding and accepting a bribe under the Prevention of Corruption Act. He was produced in court on Tuesday and has been remanded in our custody for two days. Searches were conducted at his residence and office, and we are awaiting the report,” the officer said.

ACB officers said while the practice of using dummy notes is not a usual one, it is also not entirely unheard of. “Complainants have their limits as to how much cash they can raise at short notice, and we have to resort to such methods when the demand is of a large amount. Before dummy notes being sold as toys became a norm, we would use blocks of paper cut in the size of genuine currency notes,” a senior ACB officer said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/for-acb-team-desperate-times-call-for-desperate-measures/article30985556.ece
403,2020/03/05,"No shortage of N-95 and triple layer masks, Tope tells Council","Cyber police told to crack down on spread of misinformation

Not a single person in Maharashtra has tested positive for COVID-19, Health Minister Rajesh Tope asserted in the Legislative Council on Wednesday. He also said the State has no shortage of the necessary masks and that he has directed the police to take action against anyone spreading misinformation.

The Council Chairman had called a special session on Wednesday morning to discuss measures to deal with COVID-19. After listening to all the members’ concerns, the Health Minister made a long statement before the House.

He said that most of the air and sea passengers who underwent thermal screening on arriving in the State, and were subsequently quarantined, have tested negative for the virus and been discharged.

Test results of a couple of them are awaited, while a few passengers remain in isolation.

Mr. Tope has also instructed the cyber crime unit to crack down on anyone spreading misinformation and creating panic.

“We have purchased enough N-95 and triple layer masks. The State will ensure sufficient funds are available for an emergency situation, and if needed, the contingency fund will be used as well. All existing laws provide for action against anyone hoarding masks or selling them at exorbitant prices,” he said.

Regarding measures undertaken by the State, Mr. Tope said, “All district hospitals have already set up quarantine wards holding 10 beds each. Doctors in all districts are being trained in ventilator management facility, and other dos and don’ts while handling suspected novel coronavirus cases. Private hospitals have also been roped in.” He said personal protective equipment has been distributed to all hospitals.

Responding to one member’s demand, he said it was not possible to set up NIV-like laboratories in every district, as it is a highly specialised institute.

The minister said people in general need not wear masks, but can use handkerchiefs to cover their faces. He also advised people to wash hands regularly.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no-shortage-of-n-95-and-triple-layer-masks-tope-tells-council/article30985527.ece
404,2020/03/05,Teen tries to end life after being harassed at school,"Complaint to principal gets no response; NC filed against teacher

A 14-year-old girl allegedly tried to end her life over sustained harassment by her schoolteacher last month. The Waliv police have filed a non-cognisable complaint against the teacher and have issued a notice to her.

According to the victim’s parents, the girl is a Class X student in a school based in Vasai (East). On February 26, the victim failed to wish her teacher, a woman, good morning while passing her by, as she was running late for her internal exams.

“The teacher called me and questioned my values and I apologised, saying I did not notice her, and left. After the test, she called me aside again and started scolding me over my younger brother’s pending fees. She asked me why he is studying in an English medium school if we can not afford the fees,” the victim said, adding that a complaint to the principal went unnoticed.

On February 27, the teacher allegedly threatened to tear the victim’s hall ticket as her father had complained to the principal. She also threatened to use her influence with the State Education Board and get the girl failed in her exams.

The victim’s mother said, “My daughter came home crying and was looking for something in the cupboard when I intervened. She told me that she did not want to live any more, and I had to slap her to pull her together. She was depressed and afraid of failing in her exams. I approached the principal, but he dismissed the matter.”

The family then sought the help of a local NGO and approached the Waliv police on Monday, and an NC of criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code was filed.

“The offence as described by the victim only warrants an NC. We have recorded a statement from the concerned teacher, who claims she did not intimidate the victim and only asked about the pending fees. We have issued her a notice as well,” police inspector Vilas Chaugule said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/rjouoy/article30985494.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16bmsuicidehelplinecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/teen-tries-to-end-life-after-being-harassed-at-school/article30985495.ece
405,2020/03/05,Two held with drugs worth ₹4 lakh,"Bangladeshi immigrants were trying to sell Ya ba pills

The Vashi police have arrested two illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, found to be in possession of Ya ba drug worth ₹4 lakh. The drug, also called Myanmar Rohingya drug, is a mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine and costs ₹2,500 per tablet.

Acting on a tip-off, the police team laid a trap behind Jagruteshwar temple near Vashi village bridge at Sector 7 around 9.30 p.m. on Monday. The team nabbed Mokalesur Rahman alias Jaani Bishwas (36) from Khulna in Bangladesh, who is currently residing in Nerul, and Hilal Sabiuddin Matiur Rehman (26) from Nodail, currently staying in Palaspe village in Panvel.

“On being detained, they voluntarily told us that they had entered the country through illegal means. We found 160 orange pills of Ya ba drug in their possession,” police inspector Ravindra Daundkar said.

Crime on bail

Mr. Rehman has previously been booked by the Special Branch of the Mumbai Police after being caught as an illegal immigrant. “He was earlier a resident of Mumbai and was once caught. After being released on bail, he shifted to Navi Mumbai. They will be deported after the trial is over and they have served their sentence,” Mr. Daundkar said.

Mr. Bishwas’s wife, Payal, has also been booked by the Nerul police for being an illegal immigrant.

The accused had brought the Ya ba pills from Bangladesh and were looking for customers to sell them to. They have been booked for cheating and forgery under the Indian Penal Code, along with sections of the Foreigners Act, 1946, and the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985.

406,2020/03/05,4 booked for cheating two of ₹5.11 lakh on promise of job,"Youths were lured by opportunities in Iran, Maldives

The Kharghar police have booked four people for cheating two men of ₹5.11 lakh by promising them jobs in foreign countries.

The complaint was filed on Tuesday by Bajrang Singh (20), from Bikaner in Rajasthan. Mr. Singh, who underwent a Merchant Navy course in Haryana, said he had a classmate called Arif Khan, from Jammu, while studying there. When Mr. Singh and another classmate, Akshay Chauhan, who hailed from Revadi in Haryana, later came to Belapur in search of a job, Mr. Khan introduced them to one Arif Chaudhary, who would help find a job.

Mr. Chaudhary introduced them to two agents — Sunil Kumar and Anand Kumar — at Bhumi Tower in Kharghar, claiming they would help. Mr. Sunil Kumar introduced Mr. Singh to Sajid Khan and asked him to meet the latter at Amsway Ship Management in Masjid Bunder.

The two demanded ₹30,000 from Mr. Singh to send him to Iran, which he transferred to Mr. Sunil Kumar’s account. After Mr. Singh received a ticket to the country, he transferred ₹1.86 lakh more and gave ₹35,000 to Mr. Sajid Khan, who told him that he would get a job once he reached there.

Once Mr. Singh spent a few days in Iran with no arrangements for accommodation or food, he realised there was no job. He asked Mr. Sajid Khan to bring him back to India, for which the latter demanded ₹11,000. “From August 23 to October 12, 2019, Mr. Singh was cheated of ₹2.51 lakh,” an officer of the Kharghar police said.

On his return to Mumbai, Mr. Singh met Mr. Chauhan, who narrated a similar ordeal. The latter was introduced to one Anisha Wasim alias Pooja by Mr. Sunil Kumar and Mr. Anand Kumar. They met at Kharghar and promised Mr. Chauhan a job in the Maldives, asking him to travel to Tamil Nadu, from were a Vietnam-bound ship would take him forward.

Mr. Chauhan stayed at a hotel on his own expense for a month while while the trio kept giving excuses when asked about the ship. Finally, he borrowed money from a friend and returned. He was cheated of ₹ 2.6 lakh between September 7 and October 10.

“We have registered a case against the four accused and are investigating further. No arrests have been made. There are chances that they would have cheated more people,” Mahesh Patil from Kharghar police station said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4-booked-for-cheating-two-of-511-lakh-on-promise-of-job/article30985338.ece
407,2020/03/05,"2 held for supplying adulterated milk to Andheri hotels, tea stalls","Crime Branch seizes 271 litres branded milk mixed with contaminated water

A day after The Hindu reported about a worrying 79% of branded and loose milk being adulterated as per a recent study, the Mumbai Police Crime Branch on Wednesday busted a major milk adulteration racket operating out of Andheri and arrested two people.

According to Crime Branch sources, police constable Ravindra Mane with the Crime Branch Unit VIII received a tip-off that milk was being adulterated with unclean water and supplied to tea stalls and hotels in Andheri. Acting on the information, two teams led by police sub-inspectors Mahesh Togarwad and Deepak Sawant kept a watch on Telugu Chawl in Sahar Village and intercepted two men who were carrying a large consignment of branded milk pouches.

The suspects, Swami Nathi (52) and Satayya Nathi (42), were questioned and allegedly admitted to running the racket. “They would buy one-litre milk pouches produced by brands like Amul and Nandini in large quantities from wholesalers and bring it home, where they would make small openings in the pouches. They would drain out around 100 to 150 millilitres of the contents of each pouch and replace it with tap water mixed with powdered milk. The pouches would then be resealed using candles,” police inspector Ajay Joshi, in-charge of the Unit VIII, said.

Mr. Joshi said this milk would then be sold to tea stalls and hotels in the area. The accused have been supplying the adulterated milk to at least four to five establishments for the last two months. Preliminary inquiries have also established that they only moved into their current residences two months ago, and the police are finding out if they were running the same racket elsewhere prior to this.

The Crime Branch has seized 271 litres of branded milk and also informed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA officers have given a preliminary report certifying the milk seized from the spot as adulterated. The accused have been booked under the Indian Penal Code and the Food Safety and Standards Act.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/o03v3k/article30985288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05bm-milk-adulteration,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2-held-for-supplying-adulterated-milk-to-andheri-hotels-tea-stalls/article30985290.ece
408,2020/03/05,State to ask Centre for escape clauses to breach fiscal deficit,"Ajit Pawar to attend Finance Commission meeting on March 13

The State government will urge the Centre to introduce limited escape clauses to enable it to breach tough budgetary norms mandated under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act.

Finance Minister Ajit Pawar will attend a consultation meeting with the Finance Commission on March 13 to discuss possibilities of achieving better synergy between State FRBMs and the Central FRBM legislation. He will also push for early release of the State government’s grant proposals pending with the Centre.

Senior officials of the Finance Department said the government will also demand from the Centre to relax FRBM clauses on account of being a large industrial State and its weakening financial health.

Push for hike in share

The State is likely to push for a hike in its devolution share currently at 5.26% of the Centre’s kitty, and demand introduction of escape clauses to breach fiscal deficit, currently restricted at 3% of the budget.

“We will push for easing of norms that currently link surplus revenue requirements with release of funds from the Centre. Being a large industrial State, we believe some concessions could be offered to us, especially in light of the burden from the rolling out of the Goods and Services Tax regime,” said a senior official of the Finance Department.

The 15th Finance Commission’s terms of reference were amended by the President in November 2019 and extended until October 2020. While extending the term, the commission was asked to submit two reports, one for the year 2020-21, and a second report for 2021-22 to 2025-26.

The Finance Commission’s report for the financial year 2020-21 was substantially accepted by the Union government and presented in the Lok Sabha along with the Union Budget for 2020-21. The commission is now working earnestly to complete the task of recommending fiscal transfers for the extended award period.

The consultation with the States on March 13 is to discuss issues related to the final report of the Finance Commission for 2021-26, which it is likely to submit in October this year.

‘Significant development’

Senior officials said the discussions on optimum utilisation of funds will also be part of the meeting. The issue of timely constitution of State Finance Commissions as well as the action taken after their recommendations are also likely to be discussed.

The commission will also discuss the projections of the State Domestic Product and the tax buoyancy projected by them for the period of the award of the commission. This is very significant development as it impacts the quantum of resource for the revenue deficit grants, officials said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/k6i5su/article30985122.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4BMMUMBAIPROPERTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/state-to-ask-centre-for-escape-clauses-to-breach-fiscal-deficit/article30985125.ece
409,2020/03/05,Transport Department in favour of move to exempt AC buses from permit system,"RTOs need to find another provision to penalise errant drivers

The Transport Department has given its suggestions on the Centre’s proposal to exempt luxury air conditioned buses from securing permits to operate. The State government will review the suggestions and forward them to the Central government.

Sources said the department is in favour of the proposal, but pointed out that regional transport offices (RTOs) will lose a key provision to penalise errant drivers. “During cases of rash driving or other transgressions, the permit is revoked or suspended as penalty. In its absence, an alternative mechanism needs to be devised so that RTOs can enforce rules such as overloading of passengers or goods,” a senior official said.

In January, the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highway had asked all State governments for suggestions on the proposal. The Transport Department then sought the opinion of RTOs, the permit issuing authority.

The proposal is limited to air conditioned deluxe buses. The Bus Body Code AIS-052 stipulates that such buses should have fixed glass windows and push-back 2x2 seats on both sides. The proposal says the initiative aims to provide a “safe, reliable, dignified, comfortable, affordable public transport in Indian cities”.

Senior officials said the proposal will open up the sector to bigger players who were turned off by the permit system. An official from the department said, “The category of buses is a premium one, where there are several checks built in from the manufacturer to the operator. The removal of the requirement will only help the segment grow.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kkabul/article30985075.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5BMMUMBAITOURMTDCVB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/transport-department-in-favour-of-move-to-exempt-ac-buses-from-permit-system/article30985076.ece

411,2020/03/05,Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku has numerous ways to keep one entertained,"While visiting Baku, make time to catch the eternal flames at YanarDağ, take a dip in the mud volcanoes of Gobustan, and make sure to enjoy a meal of sheki piti, the popular lamb soup

There are many things that you check when you travel, especially to a Muslim-majority country like Azerbaijan. Dress code (there isn’t any), food (the sheki piti, a soup with lamb, chestnuts and white plums, is a must-try). But no one thinks to check wind speeds! Baku, situated on the banks of the Caspian Sea, is also called the City of Winds. And it almost never lets up — thanks to Khazri, a cold wind from the North (at 140 kilometres per hour), and Gilavar, a milder one from the South.

We are welcomed by the former. So our excursions around the city are punctuated by Marilyn Monroe moments (skirts a-flying). Once you get used to the blustery weather, however, the city’s charm takes over. An eastern country with a western outlook, its architecture is varied — from the medieval (harking back to the Persians and Ottomans) and Russian (the former Soviet nation gained its independence in 1991) to the contemporary. Parks, gardens and squares pepper the cityscape, where fashionably-dressed locals gather late into the night; museums are recommended with pride; and the Flame Towers — a trio of skyscrapers that symbolise fire — pop up on the horizon no matter where you are. Two days give us just enough time to catch the highlights.

Day 1

11 am: YanarDağ

The Burning Mountain is 27 kilometres from Baku. As we drive away from the city, Azerbaijan’s oil associations come to the fore. Drilling rigs pop up, the sole sentinels in large fields stripped bare of vegetation. But little shacks selling cranberries, peaches, figs and mulberries brighten up the drab landscape. As we get closer to YanarDağ, things liven up. Literally. We smell the smoke before we see the flames; a wall of it licking up the sides of a small hillock, crackling and dancing in the wind. Natural gases coming up through vents in the sandstone feed the fire, as it has done for centuries — day and night, through rain and snow. Selfies are mandatory, but caution is advised.

A tip: while there, stick to the concrete paths and steps to navigate the rough terrain. As we explore a museum on site, with ancient household items, and a café, a lone man with a horse offers us rides. The wind is too cutting, so it becomes an opportunity for some more camerawork.

1 pm: Ateşgah

Keeping to our fiery trail, we drop by the 500-year-old Fire Temple, a testament to Azerbaijan’s associations with the Silk Route. That history can be seen in the Sanskrit and Gurmukhi script (including an invocation to Lord Shiva) that we spot adorning lintels and walls. Our guide tells us that Hindus, Zoroastrians and Sikhs travelled here, and donated money to build the temple — which has ramparts like a castle and rooms like a traditional caravanserai.

Despite the wind, the fire in the central altar roars up to the ceiling, warming the beige of the surrounding sandstone walls. Today, it is fed by Baku’s gas pipeline, but for centuries, a now-exhausted natural gas field had ignited the ‘eternal flames’. We skirt the excavation sites in the courtyard — work is on to uncover older structures and artefacts — to catch audio-visual presentations and lifelike recreations tell stories of pilgrims, prayers and the past.

4 pm: Icherisheher

It is the colours we notice first, as we enter the gates of the Old City later that day — the green of pomegranate trees, the sun-warmed yellow of sandstone walls, and the riot of silks in roadside stalls. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it is the most ancient part of Baku. Hidden behind crenellated walls, cobblestone paths wind past old buildings, partially-excavated ruins, and sheltered cafés that serve vine leaf-wrapped dolmas and oven-baked tandir breads. Hamams sit cheek-by-jowl with art museums; the minarets of the 11th-Century Muhammad Mosque pierce the sky and the Multani caravanserai welcomes you with glasses of black tea and white cherry murabba (jam).

We can’t make it to the Palace of the Shirvanshahs (dating back to the 15th century), but the Maiden Tower, but the Maiden Tower (where, legends say, a flame-haired girl defended the city from an enemy who had laid siege) more than makes up, with a museum tracing the history of the city’s evolution.

9 pm: Highland Park

Baku at night is spectacular. Spotlights illuminate old buildings, store fronts dazzle and monuments are picked out in silhouette. We, however, climb to the top of the viewing square, built on the highest point in the city, to get the best view. The boulevard fronting the Caspian Sea is trimmed in jewel-like lights, while Soviet-era statues and gardens, and the show at the Flame Towers — lights in various colours undulate over the skyscrapers every night — add to the drama.

Day 2

9 am: Gobustan’s mud volcanoes

Battered Soviet-era cars hurtling down dirt roads, while you hold on for dear life, may not seem an ideal start to the morning, but it is exhilarating. Especially when the driver decides to serenade you with old Hindi songs. The barren, almost otherworldly, landscape, heavy with the smell of sulphur, needs this injection of life. Fifteen minutes in, we spot innocuous-looking mounds. Inside, thick, cement-like ooze bubbles. There’s nothing to be heard except the wind and the occasional plop as a bubble bursts. Then cheers split the air, as a dark-haired tourist from Russia takes off his shirt and carefully slides in. Despite the depth of each volcano, the viscosity of the mud helps him float. All’s well until he realises his mobile phone is still in his pocket. Oops!

None of us is in a hurry to try our luck floating, so our chatty driver scoops out some mud instead, and tells us to apply it on our faces. It’s supposed to be great for the skin and for people with arthritis. Well, maybe another time.

1 pm: Carpet Museum

Later that afternoon, as we drive up to the seafront Dənizkənarı Milli Park, what looks like a rolled up carpet captures the eye. Designed by Austrian architect Franz Janz, it is an exhibition space and a research centre — housing carpets from the 17th to the 20th centuries, along with ceramics and metal works dating back to the 14th century. There are woven rugs on walls, on looms, on curved and tilted displays... even laid out floor-to-ceiling in a room outfitted to look like an old Azeri household. You can certainly see why Azerbaijani carpets were proclaimed ‘A masterpiece of intangible heritage’ by UNESCO in 2010.

How to get there Air Arabia has competitive fares (approx ₹37,000 for a return trip), while Turkish Airlines, Vistara and Air India also ply the route.

There is an intensity of colour that is surprising, and motifs range from flora and fauna to geometric patterns. But it’s the ones created during the Soviet rule that are a surprise. Each tells a story — be it of revelry, the developing oil industry, or the need to exercise (a painterly depiction of three youngsters running on the beach)! One of their biggest carpets, made with 37 million knots, features Lenin, we are told.

4 pm: Heydar Aliyev Centre

We end the day at one of the newest monuments. Designed by the late Iraqi-British architect, Zaha Hadid, the centre is like an undulating Arctic wave. The sinuous, continuous surface connects various cultural spaces in its many ‘folds’.

For those like us, who do not know much about the country’s past, the Heydar Aliyev exhibit throws light on the first president — through interactive touchscreen and AV presentations. Elsewhere, exhibits, performances and talks bring in the best from around the world. At the moment, Zoospective & Morphospective, by the French sculptor Mauro Corda, is attracting crowds, as is an exhibition of nearly 200 rare musical instruments. A few hours are not enough to cover its eight floors. Finally, sore feet ready for a cushioned pouffe, we wrap things up with a photo op at the large ‘I love Baku’ installation outside.

412,2020/03/05,Head to Meghalaya this weekend,"Discover Meghalaya through the maiden edition of a unique tourism festival that will showcase the State’s adventure, scenic and cultural hotspots

Explore the world’s longest cave systems. Scuba dive in pristine rivers. Waft through the clouds in a hot air balloon over lush terrain. Glamp in a plush tented colony within the forest. A peek into the lifestyle of the indigenous communities, an example in sustainable living. From March 7 to March 15, the maiden edition of a unique tourism festival will showcase the adventurous, scenic and cultural attractions of Meghalaya in a series of curated experiences.

The Meghalayan Age, an initiative by Meghalayan Tourism and E-Factor, is gearing up for visitors to explore the destination, at varying paces, whether a thrilling excursion through the labyrinth of caves, or a relaxing evening amid the glow of tethered hot air balloons, enjoying some local cuisine and shopping.

Dense forests, dramatic cliffs, mountains cloaked in mist, and gushing streams and waterfalls make up Meghalaya’s magnificent natural heritage. The Meghalayan Age aims to promote and position the State as a sustainable tourism hub for conscious visitors from around the globe. “Travellers today want authentic experiences and we want to attract those who are sensitive about our fragile ecology. Unique tourist products like hot air ballooning, caving and glamping are part of new-age experiences designed to immerse the audience in the rare natural and heritage surroundings of this State,” says Dr D Vijay Kumar, IAS, Commissioner and Secretary to the Government of Meghalaya.

Hot air balloon rides, with experienced pilots from around the globe will take visitors to the skies in vehicles with quirky names like Happy Baby Bird and Mellow Yellow. As the sun rises, the balloons will ascend, offering a unique vantage point to admire the rugged and spectacular landscape — a mix of hills, dizzying valleys, plains, shallow dales and startling cliffs.

The extensive cave network that Meghalaya boasts of is still uncharted territory. Carved as water meets limestone and sandstone, the caves have an underground network of magnificent formations and eco-systems, with rare species and fossils from millions of years ago. With expert guides from the Meghalaya Adventurers’ Association, avid spelunkers and even virgin explorers, can delve into three of the cave networks as part of the event.

From one of the wettest places on Earth, Sohra, enveloped in mist; to quaint villages like Kudengrim with its old living-roots bridge; from Shnongpdeng, the secret water sports capital; to a cluster of, reportedly, some of the tallest monoliths on earth at Nartiang; and the café culture and shopping in Shillong, the Meghalayan Age includes sightseeing excursions to various parts of the State.

The vibrant music scene will be showcased through live performances by some of the region’s most well-known talent, Khasi rock bands, Colours and Strait Brothers; acclaimed blues band, Soulmate; and the ‘Bob Dylan of India’ — iconic Khasi guitarist, Lou Majaw.

Describing the diverse experiences on offer at the festival, Samit Garg, CEO and co-founder, E-Factor, says “Meghalaya is one of the most amazing undiscovered destinations that offers the perfect balance for travellers, with its young vibrant population, prolific music scene, and an untrodden natural and heritage capital.”",travel,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/sz1tut/article30988745.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MPThe-Megahlayan-5,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/the-meghalayan-age-festival-opens-on-march-7/article30988747.ece
413,2020/03/05,Code red!,"HELP! What do you do when a whole part of you is being taken away from you?

DISASTER ALERT! DISASTER ALERT! DISASTER ALERT!

The end of the world is officially here people and there is nothing I can do about it. No masks to protect me. No underground bunker to hide in. No wand to wave and set everything right. No, it’s not the polar ice caps or a raging forest fire or another virus doing the rounds that’s got me up at night. It’s worse.

My best friend is moving away.

Maybe that doesn’t seem like a big deal to you, but that’s probably because you’ve never had a best friend desert you like this. H was the first friend I made when we moved here. We’ve been together in the same section every year since then and he’s been my best friend since grade 2. We both love drawing anime, going go-karting and playing Dance Dance Revolution at the arcade. We’ve never had a fight, and when other kids pick on me or bully me, he’s always stood up to them. And when I’ve fought with other friends, he’s always taken my side, even when maybe the fight was my fault. And now he’s going. Who will I sit next to at lunch? Who’s going to help me come up with good excuses to P Ma’am when I haven’t done my algebra assignment? Who’s going to be my desk buddy? My lab partner? Who will I plot to overthrow the school dictatorship with?

Moving on

H is trying to be sad about it, but I know he isn’t. Not really. He’s moving to Florida. In America! I’d find it hard to look sad too if I was going to the home of Disney Land and Universal Studios. He’s going to be doing Harry Potter 4D rides and puking his guts out on Space Mountain every weekend while I’ll be stuck here doing nothing. In a few months, he’ll have brand new best friends to draw anime with and I’ll have no one.

H says that we can do video calls and that he’ll keep coming back to see his grandparents, but I know that’s not going to really happen. I know that, because it’s what I told my best friends when I left Mumbai to move here. And I haven’t seen some of those friends since I was seven. I’m not even sure I remember what some of them look like. Is that what’s going to happen to H and me? Will we forget how each other look? Will he forget that I gave him the idea for that cool hair style for his anime character Yu?

Some of us are going to throw H a surprise farewell party and everyone is super excited about it. Everyone but me.

I’ve decided that the only way to try and make myself forget how sad I am is to do something super depressing. Like my algebra homework. Anyway, it’s not like I have a best friend to help me with excuses for not having done it.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/y2xxf/article30990514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06YTBUGBOYjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/code-red/article30990515.ece

415,2020/03/05,New water treatment plant to be delayed,"75-mld plant will be ready by June, not March, Minister tells Assembly

Contrary to the Water Resources Department’s earlier position, the 75-mld water treatment plant coming up at the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) facility at Aruvikkara will not be ready by March. The plant will be ready for commissioning only by June, according to a written reply given by Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty in the Assembly on Wednesday.

Earlier, the Minister had announced that the plant, one of the two major projects meant to meet the capital city’s long-term drinking water needs, would be ready by March 31 this year.

Sources said that the project may even be delayed up to July. While work has been progressing, delay in procuring approvals and clearing bills had affected it, forcing the government to push the commissioning date by several months.

Project details

The ₹60-crore project is getting ready under the under the Centrally assisted Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). While the KWA is the implementing agency, the cost is borne by the Centre and the Corporation.

The other big water supply initiative for the capital, the 120-mld Neyyar project, too is likely to be delayed on account of the dispute over the land identified for the project at Neyyar.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/new-water-treatment-plant-to-be-delayed/article30985565.ece
416,2020/03/05,"Order online, get library books","Apart from home delivery, The Like Minded builds a network linking book lovers

The Like Minded, a city-based library on wheels launched six months ago, is dreaming big. Besides getting people to enjoy the pleasures of reading an actual book, the library hopes to build a community of books lovers through its business aggregator model.

Soumya Manoj Kumar, founder of The Like Minded, says there are quite a few libraries in the city, but many lack patronage. People have little time to browse bookshelves or even make it to the library through traffic.

When she thought about opening a library, she knew there should be something different to attract readers. After discussions with her partner Alvin Raj, an answer emerged - home delivery. They formed a WhatsApp group and listed their collection. Next, they moved to Facebook.

Their website, www.thelikeminded.in, is fully operational now. Readers can log on and order books to be dropped off at their doorstep.

Titles can be checked out as in a brick-and-mortal library, or put in a cart or wish-list. Once payment is made online, the books will be delivered the next day.

Books are delivered on weekdays for ₹60 and on Sundays for free. There are three plans, with different tariffs and reading time.

The ‘Warm-up’ plan lets you order four books online and keep them for 15 days. ‘Book Bees’ will let you read six books for 20 days. These can be retained for an extra week on payment of ₹50. Subscribers to ‘The Like Minded Bookworms’ plan can order 10 books twice a month, and keep them for a month before returning. Soumya and Alvin have plans to unveil an app too.

Lend your books too

Another aspect that sets venture apart is their business aggregator model. People who are interested in lending their books can add them to The Like Minded portal. The books can then be picked up by readers and the owners make a commission.

Even libraries that want to reach out to more readers can become part of this venture. A library can make its books available to other libraries in that city through The Like Minded portal.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/1bnrvc/article30985541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05tvtv,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/order-online-get-library-books/article30985542.ece
417,2020/03/05,Minister justifies move on bottled water plant,"‘Handed over to KIIDC for KWA to focus on supply projects’

Water Resources Minister K. Krishnankutty on Wednesday justified the decision to issue orders handing over the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) bottled water plant at Aruvikkara to the Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation (KIIDC) stating that the KWA needed to concentrate on water supply projects and tackling a potential drought.

The Water Resources Department had issued orders on February 28 handing over the plant to the KIIDC on a seven-year lease subject to a formal agreement between the KIIDC and the KWA. The decision had drawn sharp criticism from employees’ unions. The KWA Employees’ Union had burned a copy of the order in protest. In a written reply to the Assembly, Mr. Krishnankutty said the facility would function once the agreement is signed. The KWA is responsible for implementing water supply projects worth ₹9,000 crore funded under the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board, Asian Development Bank, National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, and State Plan. This is in addition to the Centrally sponsored Jal Jeevan Mission which aims to provide all rural households with water connections by 2025, he said.

Threat of water shortage

Also, there is an urgent need for the KWA, using its limited resources, to focus on tackling a potential drought and water shortage this year, he added. The State government has pumped in ₹16 crore so far for the construction of the bottled water facility which has a capacity of 7,200 litres per hour. The civil, electrical and mechanical works were completed on May 22, 2019. Though the KWA had christened its brand ‘Thelineer’ it has been unable to launch commercial operations. The plant is yet to obtain the certification of the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS).

Pact within a month

Mr. Krishnankutty told the Assembly that it was not desirable to further delay its commissioning as the government had already spent a large amount on the facility. As per the order, the KWA and the KIIDC have to sign a pact within a month. On the strength of the February 28 order, KIIDC technical experts have begun inspections at the plant.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/minister-justifies-move-on-bottled-water-plant/article30985430.ece
418,2020/03/05,Fronts spar over land allotment,"Row in House over ‘granting public land for political offices’

The government and the Opposition sparred with each other in the Assembly over the grant of public land for political offices.

Congress legislator P.T. Thomas said the Left Democratic Front government had arm-twisted the University of Kerala into handing over eight cents of land to the nearby AKG Centre. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan termed the accusation false. He said the A.K. Antony government had allotted the land to the centre.

Fisheries Minister J. Mercykutty Amma hit back at the Opposition by stating that the previous UDF governments had brazenly grabbed public land to erect Congress offices in Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram.

The DCC office in Kollam stands on two acres of public land allotted to it by the previous Congress government.

Similarly, Congress gave itself a scenic hill at Neyyar Dam to set up the Rajiv Gandhi Research and Study Centre.

The Opposition took umbrage, and tempers flared when John Fernandez, the MLA nominated by the LDF from the Anglo Indian community, alleged that the Air India had purchased paintings by A.K. Antony’s wife at excessive rates when the UPA government was in power.

419,2020/03/05,KSRTC suspects foul play,"‘Probe audio clips by private bus crew’

The Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) will approach the police seeking an inquiry into a call reportedly given by the crew of private stage carriers to foment trouble in East Fort.

In the wake of the Wednesday’s incident at East Fort that led to a flash strike for five hours, the KSRTC has decided to approach the police to check two audio clips, of 24 seconds’ and 33 seconds’ duration. The KSRTC will give a formal complaint to the police as the management believes that the incident on Wednesday was a planned one. The crew of private buses and their supporters were at the scene in good numbers to vitiate the atmosphere, a top official in KSRTC said.

“Our buses are not allowed to park in East Fort. Create an issue and others will join. Someone should take the initiative. We cannot accept the three to four minute stoppage. We have planned to create a scene. We will halt the bus if they block us and ask if they have time schedule....,’ says an audio clip accessed by the KSRTC. An office-bearer of the private bus operators association said they had also come across the audio clips and would cooperate if the police carried out a probe.

The KSRTC, which had drawn flak for the flash stir that crippled public transport for five hours, will also seek steps for regulating the use of the bus bay at East Fort and flag the unauthorised trips by 100-odd private stage carriers operating in the city limits.

The trigger

The unruly incidents were triggered when KSRTC staff questioned a private stage carrier, operating on the Trikannnapuram-Maruthoorkadavu sector, reached East Fort at 9. 20 a.m., ahead of the schedule and picked up commuters. The KSRTC was operating chain services to Attukal in connection with the Pongala festival.

As the private buses do not commence services from East Fort, they have been given designated places near Hotel Luciya and the Ganapathi temple to stop for three minutes and pick up commuters. “Seldom do they follow the schedule and tail the KSRTC buses at the parking bay. The complaints given by the KSRTC to the police have not yielded results,” the official said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ksrtc-suspects-foul-play/article30985375.ece
420,2020/03/05,Flash strike: human rights panel takes suo motu case,"Flash strikes, road blockades will not be allowed, says Collector after emergency meeting

The Kerala State Human Rights Commission has registered a case suo motu in view of the intense hardship faced by the general public following a flash strike by the KSRTC staff in the city on Wednesday. Surendran T., a resident of Kachani, collapsed and died as he could not be shifted to the hospital on time.

A former auto driver, Mr. Surendran had reached East Fort by 11 a.m., but was stranded there along with hundreds of other passengers. Around 2 p.m. he developed uneasiness and collapsed at the bus bay at East Fort. A nurse who was waiting for the bus services to resume administered first aid, but it did not suffice.

Ambulance trapped

According to local shopkeepers, attempts to move Mr. Surendran to the hospital were delayed. The ambulance was trapped in the traffic snarl cased by KSRTC buses abandoned on the road as part of the strike.

The General Hospital, where Mr. Surendran was finally taken, declared him dead on arrival. According to the hospital, he was brought there at 3.21 p.m.

Mr. Surendran had had two heart attacks in the past and had undergone angioplasty, his son-in-law Vinod said. “He was under treatment at the Medical College Hospital. He had left home at 10 a.m. to buy medicines,” Mr. Vinod said.

Services restored

Mr. Surendran leaves behind his wife Prameela and daughters Lissimol and Sinimol. Mr. Surendran’s body has been shifted to the mortuary of the General Hospital.

The flash strike, seeking the release of three personnel of the KSRTC taken into custody by the police, was called off around 3 p.m. after Deputy Commissioner, (L&O and Traffic) R. Karuppaswamy held talks with KSRTC officials and trade union leaders. Later, the three KSRTC personnel were released on bail. The services were restored after an hour.

Hearing on March 18

Antony Dominic, Chairman, Kerala State Human Rights Commission, has directed the managing director, KSRTC, and the District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram City) to investigate the KSRTC strike in detail and submit a report in two weeks’ time. The Commission registered the case suo motu on the basis of media reports. The case will be up for hearing on March 18 in Thiruvananthapuram.

District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan, who convened an urgent meeting in the wake of the KSRTC strike, said the district administration would not allow flash strikes or road blockades as part of strikes in future.

422,2020/03/05,Potable water becomes dearer in Tiruchi,"Rise in temperature and increase in price of packaged water have hit the people

The demand for water from the couple of automated vending machines installed by the Tiruchi Corporation has increased following the rise in temperature and also due to the strike by packaged drinking water suppliers. The packaged drinking water suppliers have also increased the price of a 20-litre can by ₹5 in the city.

Interesting read: March-May period likely to be hotter than normal: India Meteorological Department

The two vending machines, one near Mainguard Gate and another near the Marakkadai bus stop are currently functional and frequented by residents in the locality.

The Tiruchi Corporation had, in 2019, drawn up plans to set up reverse osmosis (RO) water treatment and vending plants with an approximate capacity of 1,000 litres an hour at affordable rates at around 73 locations in the city under the Smart City Mission. But it has set up only two so far.

The plan, however, has been dropped in light of the recent Madras High Court order imposing restrictions on the extraction of groundwater for commercial purposes, officials say. “We cannot flout the court direction. We understand that the vending machines are in good demand; we will soon think of some alternative to meet the demand,” said a senior official at the civic body. The already established ones will continue to function, he said.

“Until last week, only college students who alighted from buses here would come to fill water bottles. But now residents bring pots and water cans too,” said a guard at the water vending machine at Mainguard Gate. Those accessing the machines must come with a container to fill water as bottles are not provided. A litre of water can be bought at ₹1 and 20 litres for ₹7.

“The rates are nominal when compared with packaged water bottles in the market which cost at least ₹20, or packaged cans which cost anywhere between ₹30-40,” he said. Access to the 20-litre tap require a QR code which is available with the guard. ""Until recently, the 20-litre tap was rarely used. However, in the past week, residents from nearby areas have used the vending machine frequently. At least 20 have used it since Monday,” he said.

While the Corporation has been commended by the users for installing the machine, they however, demanded more such facilities across the city. “It would be of great use in places such as Thillai Nagar,” said S. Subhash, a student. “Tourists and shoppers who visit Mainguard Gate, Teppakulam and the Big Bazaar area will benefit from the vending machine, especially during summer,” he observed.

Meanwhile, packaged water supply units supplying water to residents in the city have increased the price per can by ₹5. “In a single day, 30 units were supplying about 70,000 cans. Since the strike, they have to bear the extra load,” said N. Hemanathan, Secretary, Packaged Drinking Water Supply Workers Association (PDWSWA).

“The HC order says that if we are pumping groundwater, we must pay the government for it. If that plan comes to force, the prices will increase. The ₹5 hike is temporary,” he said.

Amma water bottles

Meanwhile, the Amma water bottles, sold at two stalls at Central Bus Stand have been flying off the shelves over the last week, says P. Perumal, a vendor. “In a day, we would sell about 500 bottles, but now, we sell at least 950-1,000. Passengers sometimes even buy in bulk”, he said. The Amma water bottles are sold at ₹10. “Some restaurants and stalls supplying food near the bus stand are also buying this water since packaged drinking water supply has taken a hit,” he said.

Citizens opt for purifiers

Some residents have started purchasing water purifiers as a permanent solution, says H.

425,2020/03/05,Karaikal-Peralam new broad gauge railway line project awaits release of funds,"The Railway Board had sanctioned ₹177.69 crore in early 2019 for the 23-km stretch

The Southern Railway Construction Organisation is now awaiting release of funds for the project to lay a new broad gauge railway line from the port town of Karaikal to Peralam via Thirunallar. Sources said preparatory works have been completed already and agencies have been identified for the project.

The Railway Board had sanctioned ₹177.69 crore in early 2019 for laying a new railway line on the 23-km stretch from Karaikal to Peralam. Consequently, the Southern Railway Construction Organisation, which was entrusted with the task of executing the project, identified an agency to carry out soil tests along the stretch. It had also floated tenders to identify the agencies to execute the work of laying the railway line, construction of major and minor bridges and four station buildings en route. Railway sources say soil tests have been completed along the stretch and a report was awaited from the agency. Soil tests are essential to finalise the type of foundation to be laid for construction of bridges.

All other preparatory works connected with the proposed execution of the project have also been completed. The drawings and yard lay outs have also been readied for the proposed project. The project requires about four hectares of land for acquisition near Peralam since there will be a slight change in the proposed new railway line alignment. The plan was to construct four stations along the route at Tirunallar, Koilpathu, Pathakudi and Ambagarathur. A major bridge and 77 minor bridges would be constructed on the stretch.

“The project should be taken up at the earliest and completed speedily. This would be provide rail connectivity to temple town Tirunallar visited by devotees in good numbers,” said V.R. Dhanaseelane, president of the Karaikal District Rail Users Welfare Association.

A metre gauge line was in existence from Karaikal to Peralam several years ago, and was dismantled in the mid-1980s leading to suspension of passenger train services since then. Rail travellers in and around Karaikal have for long been seeking the restoration of the line since it is a shorter route to reach Mayiladuthurai from Karaikal instead of taking a detour via Nagore, Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur which is the case at present for trains proceeding to Karaikal.

The sanction for the project by the Railway Board have gladdened rail travellers as it paves the way for the revival of the rail link which would turn Peralam into a railway junction since the station falls along the Mayiladuthurai – Tiruvarur broad gauge section.

Railway officials hope that the funds would be released at the earliest which would enable commencement of the project. “If the allotment of funds comes through, the project could be completed in one-and half-years,” a Railway official said.

The new line would enable transport of coal, iron ore and fertilizer from Karaikal Port to other destinations via Mayiladuthurai and Peralam instead of taking the circuitous route via Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur thereby reducing time and fuel usage by diesel locomotives.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/karaikal-peralam-new-broad-gauge-railway-line-project-awaits-release-of-funds/article30990197.ece

427,2020/03/05,I-League | Yusa helps Chennai City hold Bagan,"His strike cancels out Diawara’s goal

Defending champion Chennai City FC stopped the winning run of Mohun Bagan, holding it to a 1-1 draw in an I-League fixture at the Kalyani Stadium here on Thursday.

Senegalese striker Babacar Diawara put the host ahead in the final minute of the first half, but the visitors made a spirited comeback after the break, finding the equaliser through Japanese playmaker Katsumi Yusa.

Chennai City, which had lost its first leg outing 3-2 against Bagan in Coimbatore, put up a much-improved performance to share the honours with the current leader in its own den.

The draw, after seven successive wins, prolonged Bagan’s wait for the title.

Bagan, which has 36 points from 15 matches, is 13 points clear of its nearest challenger — Punjab FC — which has 23 from 15 games.

On the attack

Making its intentions clear right from the beginning, Chennai City successfully thwarted Bagan’s attacking plans.

The visitors toiled hard and created quite a few chances in the opening session, but failed to convert them.

The visitors could have easily found the lead early on in the opening session as Yusa ran amok and came up with three clear chances in the opening 30 minutes.

But the opportunities went abegging as Spanish striker Adolfo Miranda (twice) and Jockson Dhas failed to find the target.

It was Bagan which went ahead in the final minute of the first half. Diawara put the finishing touches on an assist from Nongdamba Naorem, who was set free after Chennai City defender Rohit Mirza failed to clear a long-floater from Francisco Morante in the Bagan half.

The visitors continued to press for a goal after the break and reaped the rewards of hard work in the 67th minute when Yusa converted.

A superb cross from Jockson set the Japanese who poked home a grounder.

The result:

Mohun Bagan 1 (Babacar Diawara 45) drew with Chennai City FC 1 (Katsumi Yusa 67).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/3gys5g/article30993728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06BAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/i-league-yusa-helps-chennai-city-hold-bagan/article30993729.ece

India’s FIFA World Cup 2022 qualifier at home against Qatar is likely to be postponed after FIFA and AFC made a formal proposal for the same after a meeting in Zurich on Thursday.

Apart from the game against Qatar, India is also scheduled to play a friendly versus Tajikistan in March.

Already out of contention after failing to win even a single game, India is scheduled to play 2022 tournament host Qatar in Bhubaneswar on March 26, followed by matches against Bangladesh and Afghanistan in June. India is now seeking to qualify for the 2023 Asian Cup.

FIFA and AFC have sent the proposal to the relevant member associations to postpone the match. An update on these fixtures will be announced after consultation with the associations. The decision was made keeping in mind the well-being and health of all individuals involved.

Monitoring the situation

FIFA said it will continue to monitor the situation in relation to the coronavirus outbreak in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO), the confederations and the member associations.

The other matches discussed were the women’s Olympic Games play-off between Korea Republic and China PR and the AFC Futsal championship in Turkmenistan.

429,2020/03/05,Italy may play all Serie A games without fans due to COVID-19,"The move could also affect the Champions League match between Juventus and Olympique Lyonnais on March 17

Italy is likely to order all major sporting events including top-flight Serie A soccer games to be played without fans attending in efforts to curb Europe's worst coronavirus outbreak, the sports minister said on Wednesday.

The move could also affect the Six Nations rugby international between Italy and England, due to be played in Rome on March 14, and the Champions League soccer match between Juventus and Olympique Lyonnais on March 17.

“We are heading towards that decision,” Vincenzo Spadafora told reporters when asked if the government was thinking of barring fans.

Inter Milan's chief executive Giuseppe Marotta said it could be the only way of finishing the Serie A season.

The government last month banned sporting events in the worst-affected northern regions although it gave clubs in that area the option of playing behind closed doors.

Serie A, however, has preferred to call off games rather than play them in empty stadiums and, so far, 10 matches have been postponed as well as this week's two Coppa Italia semi-final ties.

Meanwhile, Italy's epidemic has spread, with 107 dead and more than 3,000 cases. On Wednesday, the government closed all schools and universities until at least March 15.

Spadafora's announcement came as representatives from Serie A clubs were meeting to discuss the situation and Marotta said they were prepared to play without fans -- an about-turn from their previous position.

“Playing behind closed doors could be the only way to complete the championship in the light of the emergency and the restrictions that the government is rightly adopting,” he said as he left the meeting.

“The aim is to finish the championship as normally as possible, without creating a competitive imbalance, but as you can see the scenario is constantly changing.”

Marotta suggested that the six matches which had been postponed last week -- including the heavyweight Juventus v Inter match -- could be rescheduled for the coming weekend.

Six Nations organisers have postponed the match between Ireland and Italy in Dublin on March 7 but said on Monday that all other games would go ahead, including the match against England.

The organisers and the Italian rugby federation could not immediately be reached for comment.

UEFA has said that it is in constant contact with local authorities and decisions over whether games should be played behind closed doors, or postponed, would be taken at the last minute.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/jmktag/article30985999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTHITALY-SOCCER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/italy-may-play-all-serie-a-games-without-fans-due-to-covid-19/article30986000.ece
430,2020/03/05,DMK amendment on Hindi rejected,"The D.M.K. group’s amendment to the motion of thanks to the President was defeated by the Lok Sabha to-day [March 4] by 178 votes to 20, with 4 abstentions. The amendment sought deletion of the constitutional provision for official status to Hindi. The rejection of the amendment has not caused so much surprise as the meagre votes it secured. Although the D.M.K. group’s amendment was rejected, the party’s leaders here seem to feel that they have gained a point in the propaganda war between the D.M.K. and the Organisation Congress in Tamil Nadu. They gave enough indication that the absence of Mr. Kamaraj and the other two members of his party from Tamil Nadu in the House on this occasion would be fully exploited in their propaganda against the Organisation Congress in Tamil Nadu. (While Mr. Kamaraj had not arrived from Madras by voting time, the other two M.Ps. of his party absented themselves). The rejection of the D.M.K. amendment was the subject of conversation among M.Ps. in the Central Hall of Parliament. It is the view of a section that the D.M.K. has damaged its chief cause and not gained. Protagonists of Hindi are claiming that the voting figures have conclusively proved that not more than 20 members in the Lok Sabha would like Hindi to be removed from its present position as the official language of the nation. If this claim gains support it will only add to the difficulties of those who are fighting against Hindi.

The D.M.K. group’s strength in the Lok Sabha is 23 and of them not more than 10 were present at the time of division on the group’s amendment which obtained ten votes from the Muslim League, the CPM and Swatantra members from Tamil Nadu, Bangla Congress and Akali Dal, one or two Independents and a solitary vote from a ruling Congress member (Mr. Y. Ankiveedu Prasad from Andhra Pradesh) besides the D.M.K.’s 10 votes. The Organisation Congress, according to its leader, Dr. Ram Subhag Singh, remained neutral. Dr. Ram Subagh Singh told newsmen later that he had abstained from the voting on the D.M.K. amendment since its main purpose was to embarrass Mr. Kamaraj who had taunted the party with not pressing for its own stand on the language issue, taking advantage of the Ruling Congress’ dependence on it for the Central Government’s existence.",archives,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/archives/dmk-amendment-on-hindi-rejected/article30982963.ece
431,2020/03/05,Our Education and the Study of English.,"(By Mr. P. K. Anantanarayana Iyer M.A. L.T.)

Among the beneficial results that have accrued as the consequence of India’s contact with England, the study of English language and literature should be assigned a very big place. It opened up to us a new world of thought and feeling of the freedom loving western mind, which led to a new outlook upon life and its varied problems. It inspired our young and ardent minds to new forms of literary creation and roused a healthy enthusiasm for social and political ideals of a liberal kind. It has afforded articulate India a common press and platform and has been the means of bringing us into close touch with the outside world in trade and commerce and in the fields of scientific research and industry. That most of the educated Indians have received a bilingual education has been fruitful of immense good in the past. At what stage should the study of English commence? It can be laid down as a sound principle that a child should be introduced to the study of a foreign language only after it has received a good training in the use of mother tongue, at least for the first four or five years at school. If English is begun when the children are about ten years old, they would be able to pick it up easily without feeling any strain upon their tender minds.

The Direct Method.

The use of the Direct Method has been strongly advocated by many educationists and linguists to facilitate the study of a foreign language like English. That method has certain advantages especially in the early stages and in small classes. But faddists have carried it to extreme degrees of absurdity. To say that there are enthusiastic champions of the direct method like the teacher who, in trying to show the significance of the word `knock’ actually brought his zealous cranium into violent contact with the unsympathetic wall, is not a mere fantastic assertion. To such blind followers of a useful method we might reply in the words of Hazlitt applied in a different connection that the use of the vernacular will not bite them. Whenever it is necessary and useful, the translation method might and even should be safely employed to supplement the other method at all stages.",archives,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/archives/our-education-and-the-study-of-english/article30982971.ece
432,2020/03/05,Another tale of two cities,"Through their graphic novel ‘The Cities Beneath’, Jai Undurti and Fabian Stoltz use mythology and history to find a connect between Hamburg and Hyderabad

Jai Undurti feels relieved and sad at the same time. For lack of a different example, he compares his emotional state with that of new mothers. “I definitely cannot say how new mothers feel, but I have heard that women, when pregnant, are eager for the carrying period to get over... and when it is over, though they are happy and excited, they also feel something missing. I am glad the project of my graphic novel The Cities Beneath is over. It was with me for three years, I was obsessing over it, working on it, thinking about it everyday, and was eager to finish it. Once it is done, I miss everything that went into planning the book,” says Jai.

Sitting at a cafe in Banjara Hills, Jai takes us back to his first visit to Hamburg, where he travelled for the project.

It all started in 2009, when the Hamburg Ministry of Culture and the Goethe-Zentrum Hyderabad initiated the project “040”, with the aim of coordinating and joining their support for cultural projects. The name of this project is based on the fact that Hamburg and Hyderabad share the same area code — 040. But they had to find a deeper connection, for the book.

The missing link

This, Jai explains, was challenging and interesting at the same. It made him fall back into history books and revisit World War II, while constantly working to find a reasonable connection between both places. “How do you take these two cities which are geographically, culturally and linguistically different and connect them through myths? The central idea was the belief that for everything on the surface in the city, there is a reflection of it underground. We imagined an underground city, and built the narrative on it,” he explains.

“My first stop for the project was Hamburg in 2017 where I officially started on the project. It was a lovely experience to meet and and understand the history. However, I was still missing the connection. There are lovely cafes all over Hamburg and we have places for tea. Not the exact comparison that I was looking for, but nevertheless I found some connection. Even though it was irrelevant. There, I met my partner, graphic artist Fabian Stoltz,” recollects Jai.

While the two brainstormed and looked desperately for a connection, “Fabian suggested we use the ‘Wimmelbild’ format for the narrative. It is a kind of hidden-picture book. So we did, and we saw progress. I mostly took the World War II connection and saw how it affected and connected the world. I did a lot of research and also read up mythology books. As a writer I was looking at a solid continuity to keep the readers engrossed,” says Jai.

After the research and information collection, it was time to face the next challenge: bringing it all into a concise, 50-page graphic novel. “Truth be told, what is published is only 20% of our research,” added Jai.

As the two worked in two different timelines, they both recollect to have eagerly waited to see the outcome the following day. “I was sure I wanted the novel to be driven with graphics, and not be word heavy. So after Fabian would send the sketches, I would sit to work on wording the emotions and reeling out a story,” adds Jai.

Now that he is overloaded with information, will he work on a sequel? “Not immediately,” he says.

433,2020/03/05,Ronan Farrow severs ties with Hachette over Woody Allen memoir,"Ronan Farrow said he was “disappointed” to find out that Hachette not only went ahead with the acquisition of Allen’s book but also “concealed” the decision.

Slamming publisher Hachette for acquiring Woody Allen’s memoir Apropos of Nothing, journalist and director Woody Allen’s estranged son Ronan Farrow has announced that he is ending his association with the company.

Grand Central Publishing, a division of Hachette Book Group, acquired the memoir a year ago and will bring it out on April 7, the company said earlier this week.

It was reported last year that Allen was pitching his memoir to several publishers but but was rebuffed in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

The multi-hyphenate director has become a subject of discussion over the resurfacing of the sexual assault allegations levelled against him by his step-daughter Dylan Farrow, Ronan Farrow’s sister, which caught steam in the wake of the #MeToo uprising. He has repeatedly denied the accusations.

Incidentally, Hachette’s division Little, Brown and Company published Catch and Kill, by Ronan Farrow in 2019, in which he wrote about his reporting during the #MeToo movement that led to the downfall of many powerful Hollywood executives, including Harvey Weinstein, over sexual abuse allegations. He also won a Pulitzer Prize for his 2017 reporting at the New Yorker on Weinstein.

Ronan Farrow said he was “disappointed” to find out that Hachette not only went ahead with the acquisition of Allen’s book but also “concealed” the decision.

“I was disappointed to learn through press reports that Hachette, my publisher, acquired Woody Allen’s memoir after other major publishers refused to do so and concealed the decision from me and its own employees while we were working on ‘Catch and Kill’ – a book about how powerful men, including Woody Allen, avoid accountability for sexual abuse,” he said in a statement posted on Twitter Tuesday.

Alleging that Hachette had not fact-checked the book, Ronan Farrow added no one contacted his sister for her side of the story.

He said the publisher had displayed a “wildly unprofessional” approach, which also “shows a lack of ethics and compassion for victims of sexual abuse.”

“My sister Dylan has never been contacted to respond to any denial or mischaracterisation of the abuse she suffered at the hands of Woody Allen – a credible allegation, maintained for almost three decades, backed up by contemporaneous accounts and evidence.

“It’s wildly unprofessional in multiple obvious directions for directions for Hachette to behave this way. But it also shows a lack of ethics and compassion for victims of sexual abuse, regardless of any personal connection or breach of trust here.”

Ronan Farrow further said he had urged Hachette to conduct a fact check on Allen’s account.

“I’ve also Hachette that a publisher that would conduct itself in this way is one I can’t work with in good conscience,” he said.

Dylan on Monday took to Twitter to slam the company for betraying her brother with their decision to publish Allen’s memoir.

“Hachette’s publishing of Woody Allen’s memoir is deeply upsetting to me personally and an utter betrayal of my brother whose brave reporting, capitalised on by Hachette, gave voice to numerous survivors of sexual assault by powerful men. For the record, I was never contacted by any fact checkers to verify the information in this ‘memoir’, demonstrating an egregious abdication of Hachette’s most basic responsibility,” she said in a statement posted on the microblogging site.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/qi652q/article30988423.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAK2020THEHOLLYWOODREPORTERSWOMENINENTERTAINMENTBREAKFASTGALA,https://www.thehindu.com/books/ronan-farrow-severs-ties-with-hachette-over-woody-allen-memoir/article30988424.ece

Simon & Schuster, the publisher of such authors as Stephen King and Bob Woodward, is up for sale.

ViacomCBS, fresh off a merger, is looking to sell its book publishing business as it tries to raise cash to pay down debt and please shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks.

Simon & Schuster is a major publishing house, releasing nearly 2,000 books a year, according to its website. Its library includes Ernest Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea and Dale Carnegie’s How to Win Friends & Influence People. Its parent company has used its books to create movies and shows. But the business made up just 3% of ViacomCBS’ revenue last year.

ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish said the book publisher is not a “core asset” of the company since it isn’t video. But he said it’s a “marquee asset” that is “highly valuable.”

“I’ve had multiple unsolicited inbound calls” about the publisher, he said Wednesday at an investment conference.

Simon & Schuster CEO Carolyn Reidy sent a letter to employees on Wednesday telling them that ViacomCBS is beginning the sales process and that business will continue as usual.

Simon & Schuster announced on Tuesday that it would publish bestselling author Janet Evanovich’s next four books.

ViacomCBS is also looking to see what other businesses it can unload. It has already been trying to sell the longtime CBS headquarters building, Black Rock, a famous Midtown Manhattan office tower designed by modernist master Eero Saarinen. Mr. Bakish said Wednesday that several potential buyers are interested and that he expects a sale to close this year.

ViacomCBS owns cable networks Nickelodeon, MTV, BET and Comedy Central as well as broadcast network CBS and movie studio Paramount. It is trying to navigate consumers’ shift from watching live TV on a television set to streaming shows and movies on the internet. It’s bulking up an existing streaming service, CBS All Access, and it will also continue supplying rivals with its library of shows and movies, like making SpongeBob spin-offs for Netflix.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/kuya40/article30988362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/simonjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/viacomcbs-looking-to-sell-book-publisher-simon-schuster/article30988372.ece
435,2020/03/05,Through another pair of eyes: A chat with author Kavita Kane,"Minor characters sometimes give you an alternative perspective to mythological stories, says author Kavita Kane

“Stories are very deep and symbolic. You don’t have to take them literally,” smiles best-selling mythological author Kavita Kane, who was in Coimbatore recently for a book-signing session at Sapna Book House in RS Puram. Mythology, she points out, has been used as “a literary device to portray contemporary issues and sensibilities.

Her first book was Karna’s Wife. Does she even appear in the epic, I ask incredulously. A very minor character, she responds. Actually she wanted to tell Karna’s story “but didn’t want him to do the telling. It would have become very one-sided. I wanted a woman who would see him for what he was: a tragic character with a flaw. A wife was the best to see him not just as a husband but as a political person, as a hero, a warrior, a condemned, conflicted and torn man… At first I wondered if the story should be told through his mother’s eyes but finally decided on the wife. After all she was his partner, his conscience.”

Interestingly Kavita had first lit on Urmila, who appears in the Ramayana as Sita’s sister and Lakshmana’s wife. “Hers was the book I really wanted to write. My second book but my first thought,” she smiles. What happened, I prompt. “I lost courage,” she says ruefully. “There wasn’t much on her, so I started Karna’s Wife. When that did well, I thought I could write about Sita’s Sister.” According to Kavita, Urmila also undergoes 14 years of exile, “her own private one.” Legend has it that Urmila was asleep for the 14 years so that Lakshmana could stay awake and serve his brother and sister-in-law. “Interpret the sleep as a metaphor for loneliness and loss,” scoffs Kavita, “and there you are.”

While researching for Urmila, Kavita stumbled upon Menaka. “I was intrigued by the fact that Vishwamitra and Menaka really loved each other and had a 10-year relationship,” she muses. “The way it is portrayed is as if she seduced him and abandons their child.” Kavita describes Menaka’s story as “every woman trying to create her own little slice of heaven.” If she had not revealed her motive to Vishwamitra, would they have lived happily every after? She shrugs, and adds, “I wanted to see what kind of woman she was and the circumstances that forced her to take the decisions she did without judging her. Our stories give us a very uni-dimensional image of a beautiful seductress. We don’t associate courage and sacrifice with her.”

And she lets fall another startling fact: Menaka abandoned not one but two children. Later I dig around and find this: According to the Pauloma Parva, Menaka has a girl with Viswavasu, the king of Gandharvas and abandons the baby near the hermitage of Sage Sthulakesa. “Menaka is the symbol of female sexual power. Her sexuality is part of her personality. It is who she is,” remarks Kavita.

Ahalya’s Awakening by Kavita Kane published by Westland | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Kavita’s latest book is Ahalya’s Awakening, about Ahalya who is restored to human form by Rama after having been turned into a stone for infidelity and adultery. “The episode is minor but you feel the echoes right through until Sita’s bhumipravesh.” The villain here, she feels, is not Rama, Gautama or Indra, but society. “It’s us sitting on judgement and condemning people with the little we know. The story of Ahalya is not about love and loyalty in marriage. It is about the how the act of being judgemental kills the very essence of a person.” Ahalya and Sakuntala are classic victims of a patriarchal mindset, Kavita argues. “In the original story, Sakuntala did not go back to her husband. But all we know now is Kalidasa’s Sakuntala.”

As a student of literature, Kavita stresses the importance of mythology. “If myths reflect the socio-cultural ethos of earlier times, they can also be used to contemporarise those same issues in today’s world. Actually nothing has changed. Love, rivalry, disappointment, war, anger, greed… all of these emotions still exist. There’s a chance of an alternative perspective by looking at the epics through the women and minor characters at that.”

Ask if she has a favourite among her books, Kavita says she enjoys them all, but each is special for a different reason. Take Sita’s Sister, for example. “I come from a family that has lots of girls. Sita also had four sisters, and I wondered if things changed once they became sisters-in-law. And then Satyavati… the seeds of discontent actually start with Yayti, Sarmishta and Devyani and find their apogee with Satyavati and Shantanu.

She agrees that the research is time consuming, more so because not much is known about these characters. “Sometimes the information is so huge and massive that filtering it all takes time. I have to remind myself to get down to writing.”

Her next book is almost done, but “I am being a little superstitious, I don’t want to say what it’s about. Not now,” she says pleadingly.

436,2020/03/05,Tamil fuelled Subbu’s creativity — in all forms,"From performing villuppattu to writing lyrics and stories that were later made into films, Kothamangalam Subbu made Tamil the pivot of his life

Kothamangalam Subbu, author of Thillana Mohanambal, was much more than a novelist. He was a poet, script writer, film director, actor, music critic and villuppattu exponent, all rolled into one. The seeds for Subbu’s villuppattu — ‘Gandhi mahaan kathai’ — were sown when Gandhi visited Madras. Va. Ra. asked Subbu to compose a poem in 24 lines to welcome Gandhi. Unfortunately, the poem could not be read at the time. The 24 lines were later expanded by Subbu to fill 250 pages, and the work was published by Vai Govindan Chettiar of Sakti Prasuram.

The second edition was brought out after Gandhi’s death, with additional verses. “Appa performed this villuppattu in many places, including Raj Ghat. Appa would cry when he narrated Gandhi’s death, and the audience would cry along with him,” says Subbu’s son Viswanathan. “During the Indo-China war, appa wrote a play in villuppattu style, and it was broadcast on AIR, Madras. The Congress committee published it under the title ‘Cheena vedi.’ Every year, on January 25, AIR New Delhi would have a mushaira (poetic symposium). When appa’s villuppattu verses were translated to Hindi and presented there, the audience, which included vice-president Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, was very impressed,” says Subbu’s son Srinivasan.

The song ‘Maname Murganin Mayil Vahanam’ (film Motor Sundaram Pillai) was written by Subbu. He had set it in Atana ragam, but M.S. Viswanathan wanted to present the verses in Hindolam, and Subbu agreed. However, the film version did not have the charanam. When Subbu sang the charanam on stage, listeners would get emotional.

From the archives

“Some years ago, Ananda Vikatan published nuggets from its archives, under the title ‘Pokkisham.’ In an interview, Kannadasan says that it was one of father’s songs in Mangamma Sapatham that inspired him to write songs, ” says Srinivasan. The Purattasi Sanikkizhamai concerts at Subbu’s house were famous, drawing huge crowds, who came not only for the music, but also for Subbu’s witty speech at the end of each concert. The Purattasi concerts had their beginning in Kothamangalam, and the person who set the ball rolling was Abdul, Subbu’s tailor. In the early 1930s, Subbu worked for a timber merchant in Kothamangalam.

One day, he and his brother Cheenu were planning to go to a concert in a neighbouring village, but the timber merchant assigned some work to Subbu, and Subbu asked Abdul to tell Cheenu that there was a change in plans. At once Abdul said, “I suppose you are not going to the concert, because you have to do a puja for Venkatachalapathy, today being a Purattasi Saturday.” Subbu had not given a thought to Venkatachalapathy puja, and was shaken by Abdul’s words. He decided to do a Srinivasa puja, but there was no picture of the deity in his house. An advertisement in The Hindu had a picture of Srinivasa, which he propped up against the wall. He then vowed to observe puja every Purattasi Sanikkizhamai and organise concerts and bhajans. In Madras, the Purattasi event got bigger, with six or seven concerts a day.

Once, Subbu and Cheenu travelled to a village to attend a T.N. Rajarathnam Pillai concert. It was a temple festival, and even while TNR was playing, fireworks were set off and an angry TNR walked away, refusing to play. (‘Thillana Mohanambal’ had a similar scene. TNR was the inspiration for Shanmugasundaram, the hero of the film ).

Dejected, Subbu and Cheenu walked away from the temple, and sat on the pyol of a house. Subbu said to Cheenu: “Why don’t you sing something in Thodi?” Cheenu began to sing, and suddenly the window of the house opened, and a voice thundered: “Can you not come in and sing?” The voice belonged to TNR! The brothers went in and TNR sang Thodi for them! Cheenu and TNR took turns to sing the whole night!

When Subbu heard a TNR concert broadcast by All India Radio, Madras, he wrote the poem ‘Asaiyaaga kettu naanum.’ “I have lost my heart to the flawless playing of Rajarathnam. I remain mesmerised, but not by your ragamalika, or your rapid ravais or even the naadam. Just the sound of your seevali is enough to make me your slave. Of what use is a garland of flowers for such a vidwan? So, I offer you a garland of verses,” goes the poem.

Pithukulli Murugadoss was a close friend of Subbu’s, and he used to tell Subbu about his days in the gurukulam run by Brahmananda Paradesiyar — an echo was the character in ‘Thillana Mohanambal.’

When Subbu moved to Madras, he lived for some years in Subramania Mudali Street, Purasawalkam. GNB, who lived in Santhome, would take a tram to Purasawalkam to meet Subbu. Udumalai Narayana kavi would join them. Sleep would be forgotten and the three would talk about Tamil literature, until the next morning, when Subbu’s friends would leave after a refreshing cup of coffee.

In the 1947 film Miss Malini (script and direction Subbu), Subbu played the role of a villain, who had the nickname ‘Bit notice,’ and whenever Subbu walked up to the Kapali temple, children would run after him shouting ‘Bit notice.’ Subbu was delighted with the attention he got, because it was proof of his success as an actor. Pantulu’s film Veerapandiya Kattabomman was based on the biography of Kattabomman by Ma.Po.Si, who said that he was inspired to write the book, when he heard a song from the film Miss Malini. The song, penned by Subbu, had the line — ‘Gandhi mahaan, Nethaji, Kattabomman kathaiayai solli pillai valarppen.’

Whenever Ramanand Sagar, who directed the TV serial Ramayan, came to Madras, he would spend hours discussing the Ramayana with Subbu. While Sagar would quote from Valmiki and Tulsidas, Subbu would talk about Kamban. Srinivasan once met Ramanand Sagar during a train journey and Sagar said, ‘My Ramayana serial was a result of the many discussions I had with your father.”

At a function organised to honour Ariyakkudi, Subbu said that he owed a lot to the pazhaiyadhu which he used to eat in Ariyakkudi’s house, for as Subbu ate, Ariyakkudi would sing. Once Ariyakkudi sang a folk song for him, which began with the lines “Aathoram kodikaalaa, adukkadukkaa vethilayaam.” Subbu retained the first two lines for a song in the film Chandralekha. Subbu was fond of folk arts. So, in the 1953 film Avvaiyar, written and directed by him, he included many folk dances, in the scene where the king welcomes Avvaiyar.

Subbu wrote verses in a folksy style, for Vikatan Deepavali Malar, and magazines — Sakti, Hanuman, Sivaji, Bharatamani and Kalki. ‘Poranda naatta nenachuppaathu porappattu vaanga’ was a song welcoming soldiers returning home after World War II.

“Vasan printed copies of the song and gave it to the soldiers,” says Viswanathan. Srinivasan recalls that when there was a drought in Madras, Subbu wrote the song ‘Kaveri aathaa kan thirandu paaru.’ Some days after, it poured so much, that the rain seemed threatening, and Subbu wrote ‘Karunaiye pagaiyaanal’ (when kindness proves counterproductive).

Songs in book format

Subbu’s family decided to publish his songs and his daughter Lakshmi Ramachandran, sourced songs from Roja Muthiah library, Ananda Vikatan archives and Tamil Nadu archives. Her sister Annapoorani compiled the songs under different headings, and the book finally took shape under the title ‘Marukkozhundu.’ It Marukkozhundu was released by Nalli Kuppuswami Chetty. Speaking on the occasion, Nalli said: “ Subbu wrote the lyrics for the film ‘Samsaaram.’ All shows were booked in theatres across the city, and I had to go to Pallavaram Janatha theatre to see it.”

Thiruppur Krishnan said that Subbu’s verses, although written in a colloquial style, were never out of tune with grammar. Only a person with clarity of thought could write without bombast. , said Krishnan. Krishnan recalled that author Vikraman used to say that artist Gopulu and Subbu were like a rettai nayanam, each complementing the other, picture and word marching together in perfect harmony.

Isaikkavi Ma. Ki. Ramanan said that Subbu not only wrote in the language of the common man, but the ideas in his songs were unpretentious and down to earth.

437,2020/03/05,Chhotu is more than a Partition tale,"The graphic novel ticks all the boxes of pop storytelling and questions the locus of power and freedom in society

In the Penguin potboiler, Chhotu, Varud Gupta and Ayushi Rastogi tick all the boxes of pop storytelling even as they reopen a scab from the nation’s past and hold up a mirror to its more recent blisters. It is essentially a Partition tale, but the authors are firm that it started out as a “superhero story”, about “a simple kid who stumbles upon the magical underpants of Shaktiman”.

Using many popular tropes — young sundered love, devastating personal loss, flashback storytelling, an arch-villain (whose smug rasp you can almost hear in your head), heart-warming courage, etc — the authors show that they know just how to win the reader’s heart, mind, and wallet.

“Bollywood was very much the lifeblood of the story from the start,” Rastogi admits, when told how filmy it all feels. “Chandni Chowk on the cusp of Partition [was where] this novel came together... and [with its undercurrents of today’s world] allowed us to explore the story of our grandfathers growing up during the time.”

Breaking boundaries

Storyboarded within crisp cinematographic frames, zoomorphic characters enact the socio-economic and communal chaos that followed India’s Independence. Why animal heads a la Bojack Horseman? “[In] Maus, animals were used to show the disparities between communities… Chandni Chowk was our ‘Animal Kingdom’ [to show] that we aren’t defined by just one aspect of our identities,” says Rastogi, openly admitting their love for the cultishly popular animated sitcom.

The pall of doom is tempered with stylishly wry humour, which is just what you need when you “rip open the Pandora’s Box” of “one of the defining moments of India’s past” which is generally treated as too taboo to ever unpack and learn from. The hero’s journey device, even if a simplistic method, does make that dark period feel a bit more palatable.

Part of the cycle

The line art is crisp and loose in a way as to suggest the dilemmatic contrast faced by the country’s forefathers, who had to watch their best-laid plans for an independent future come undone in the aftermath. “We don’t envy the decisions India’s leaders had to make — to pursue Independence knowing the ensuing aftermath or risk further time under British rule.”

The power of the book’s narrative also lies in how it depicts the cyclicality of such events. “Chhotu was born from... as individuals feeling small from the events happening in the world — and we’ve felt those very same feelings again,” says Rastogi, adding that it was surreal that its release, after many a missed deadline, coincided with the signing of the Citizenship Amendment Act. The use of contemporary vernacular inside a black-and-white palette helps visually underscore the point, although the authors insist it was a cost-constraint thing.

The novel throws up questions about the locus of power and freedom in society, and leaves you wishing you too could achieve your own transformational catharsis inside a two-page spread.

438,2020/03/05,The Reverend Ernesto Cardenal’s prayer for revolution,"One of Latin America’s most admired poets, The Reverend Ernesto Cardenal, who passed away recently, demonstrated how religious heritage could be used in people’s struggles

He was a man whose contradictions turned him into a complete human being who deified all stereotypes and created his own unique persona. He was a Roman Catholic priest who took active part in the Nicaraguan revolutionary struggle led by the Sandinistas against the authoritarian regime of the Somoza dynasty that relied on torture, extra-judicial killings and suppression of the press to contain its opponents. He was a Marxist who prayed but not for his people, as he did not view himself as an intermediary between God and man. He was the best known Liberation Theologist who had emphasised the emancipatory essence of religion – in his case, Christianity. He wrote revolutionary poems and songs following the literary style of Psalms and thus demonstrated how religious heritage could be used in people’s struggles.

Such was The Reverend Ernesto Cardenal, one of Latin America’s most admired poets, along with Federico García Lorca, Pablo Neruda, Octavio Paz and Nikanor Parra, who breathed his last on March 1, 2020 in Managua at the age of 95. He was also one of those great revolutionary poets who, like Nazim Hikmet, Faiz Ahmed ‘Faiz’ and Mahmood Darvesh, became sources of inspiration for several generations of Hindi poets because of their dedication to the people’s cause and their mastery of the art of poetry.

When people of my generation began to write poetry, Naxalbari had happened merely four-five years ago and revolutionary change was in the air. Alokdhanva was emerging as the voice of this revolutionary fervour and left-wing poets like Sri Sri and Varvara Rao (Telugu) or Nabarun Bhattacharya (Bengali) were being read with keen interest in Hindi literary circles. That was the time when Hindi poets discovered Cardenal and his poems, translated from English into Hindi, started appearing in literary magazines. However, after a few years, Hindi poets such as Prabhati Nautiyal, who had learnt and studied Spanish language and literature at Jawaharlal Nehru University, began to translate Cardenal’s poems straight from Spanish.

When Cardenal came to Delhi in March 1983 to attend the Seventh Non-aligned Summit as Nicaragua’s minister for culture, Nautiyal was deputed to liaison between him and the Indian government. When he told Cardenal that he had translated some of his poems from Spanish into Hindi and that he was a beloved of young Hindi poets, he could not believe it. He was under the impression that nobody in India knew who he was. So, the next day, Nautiyal showed Cardenal the November 1978 issue of Hindi magazine “Sarokaar” that had carried Nautiyal’s translation of his celebrated poem “Salmon”. Although Cardenal did not understand a word of Hindi, he asked Nautiyal to read out the translation and asked if he could take the magazine with him back to Nicaragua – a request that Nautiyal happily acceded to. Cardenal also signed a poem for him.

Eminent poet Mangalesh Dabral, who was among those who led the Award Wapasi movement in 2015 to protest the Modi government’s silence on the targeted killings of public intellectuals and writers, also had a similarly interesting experience with Cardenal that showed how simple a man he was despite his international stature. He had returned from Bhopal after attending a World Poetry Festival at Bharat Bhavan and there was a function at the Nicaraguan Embassy to celebrate his birthday on January 20, 1989. Dabral was the literary editor of Hindi daily “Jansatta” and his poet-cartoonist colleague Rajendra Dhodapkar had given him a blank paper to get it signed by Cardenal as he wanted to draw a cartoon of the revolutionary poet. When Dabral spread the blank sheet before him and asked him to sign, Cardenal took out and his pen and was about to sign when embassy officials stopped him, pointing out how he could sign a blank paper.

A born poet

Dabral too had translated a few of Cardenal’s poems and he gave him the issue of Hindi magazine “Tanaav” that had published them. Cardenal was very happy and he sent him some of his poems after returning to Nicaragua. In 2017, Hindi journal “Rachana Samay” published Dabral’s translation of 80 of Cardenal’s poems.

If poets are born and not made, Cardenal was truly a born poet. He began writing verse when he was a small boy of four years. Later, he once said that he could not remember a time when he did not write. He wrote against American imperialism but there is not a word in his writings that is directed against the American people. In this sense, he represented revolutionary universalism that aims to unite all the suffering people of the world by creating bonds among them. His poem “Zero Hour” bears some resemblance with a long poem of Firaq Gorakhpuri titled “Aadhi Raat” (Midnight), especially because of its recurring refrain:

Watchman! What hour is it of the night?

Watchman! What hour is it of the night?

Perhaps, secular fundamentalists and doctrinaire Marxists of today can learn something from Father Cardenal. He was a deeply religious man who defied the Church and Pope John Paul II. And, he was a Marxist, who as a revolutionary poet did not fight shy of learning the art of poetry from a self-proclaimed fascist like Ezra Pound. Cardenal is Dead. Long live Cardenal!",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/z3idmq/article30990142.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thumbnailCover-of-Rachna-Samay-on-Cardenal-1,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/the-reverend-ernesto-cardenals-prayer-for-revolution/article30990144.ece
439,2020/03/05,"Ala, a unique theatre space","Touch the darkness, find out the colour of an itch.... Manu Jose teaches theatre in a community space in Mulanthuruthy that used to be a godown, and now hosts actors, cyclists and chess

“Can you hear the darkness? Touch it, feel its texture... how does it smell?” asks Manu Jose as I step into the pitch dark interiors of Ala. A centre for culture and alternative education, designed by the actor this space was once a godown, and is set in Mulanthuruthy, an outlier town of Kochi. Inside, silence engulfs me and the darkness is overpowering. My senses are more receptive and I seem to hear, feel, taste, see and sense more.

The blackout is one of the tools Manu, who is also a storyteller and theatre personality, uses in theatre education to highlight the importance of the sensorial in daily life. When the lights come on, they reveal a hall with a high ceiling, fitted with iron bars for lights and large windows curtained in black. A striking red and wooden walls offer sound proofing.

After studying theatre at School o

f Drama in Thrissur, Manu acted in films, plays, produced dramas and, through this journey, realised that his strength lay in storytelling. “It was an undeveloped genre in 2002 when I began,” he says explaining the difference between traditional koothu (an ancient musical mono act) and his storytelling. “While the chakayar (actor) never responds to the audience’s comments; in my show, I interact with them. I am Macbeth here and there’s a Macbeth there.”

As he began his acts, he brought painter-musician OC Martin and founded ‘MeandYou Performing Company’, which aimed at introducing various styles of storytelling — Chitrakathi, Kamishibai, etc— using papercrafts and painting, from across the world. It performed about 500 live storytelling performances across India and parts of West Asia. He incorporated theatre tools like body language, life skills training and later delved into psychology, learnt Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) and Transactional Analysis(TA) and introduced these elements into his self -designed workshops.

“The basic guiding principle of Ala comes from TA, which is about autonomy of people: they can think and can change. Theatre is a wonderful tool to help people gain confidence, to think and change, ” he says.

In 2008 he did a short stint with corporate trainer Santosh Babu, in New Delhi to conduct workshops for entrepreneurs, which reinforced his confidence to explore the potential of theatre training among different professionals including teachers, social workers, health professional, architects, factory workers, Kudumbasree women entrepreneurs.

Manu’s workshops for professionals in different fields now began inculcating a tailor-made idiom, transforming his role from an actor to an educator.

He conducted 160 workshops over a period of two years with teachers, students and non teaching staff only in Manipal University besides several others with different professional groups. In 2016 he was invited to head the Art By Children (ABC) programme of the KMB and added the visual auditory and kinaesthetic (VAK) angle to the making of art. He encouraged students to adopt an out-of-the box approach and asked them to find the colour of a smile or of an itch. He took the programme to about 100 schools in all 14 districts of the State.

“Theatre in Kerala is strong in performance but the learning process of those who work with theatre is not continuous,” says Manu. His wish to give back to society what he had earned from it found fruition with the idea of a designated space for community development in Ala.

In its first year, Ala has hosted cycling, chess, yoga mindfulness programmes and film clubs to help people slow down and savour life. “I ride along with the members and kids to a park where look around, chat and spend leisure time. Such spaces are important; it nurtures love among people,” he says.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/29na0a/article30990632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPMANUJOSE,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/ala-a-theatre-space-in-suburban-kochi/article30990635.ece
440,2020/03/05,The bird to catch before March ends,"This is the time to catch the Black Redstart, or Phoenicurus ochruros on a low branch near you

A general upright stance, and a peculiar quivering motion of its tail makes the Black Redstart stand out. This restless bird frequents backyards and the plains of India, from the end of September through March.

The term ‘Redstart’ has been picked up from the old English term ‘Red’ describing the colour, and ‘steort’ meaning ‘tail’ in the proto-Germanic language, which is assumed to be the ancestral language of the Germanic group ofl anguages.

The small robin-sized bird (14-15 cm) breeds across the Himalayan Range. It occurs almost throughout Europe and Asia and in portions of Africa and breed in the high altitude areas of Kashmir, Ladakh, Tibet and the Central Himalayan Range. In their breeding range, the bird is observed to be quite shy and elusive in nature whereas it sees a complete change in character by being one of the most pleasant and friendly of our garden birds during their winter stay here in the city.

In India, the bird essentially sticks to areas near wetlands, open cultivation, scrubs and pleasant gardens and orchards. It savours worms, insects like grasshoppers, or fallen fruits with a curious croaking, a short tsip, tucc-tucc every now and then. While it mostly forages on the ground for grub, it may also catch insects in flight at times.

The males display black or dark-grey upper parts, black breast, and rufous underparts. The females and younger first-year males however, are almost entirely dusky-brown with rufous-orange wash on their lower flanks and belly. Two races of these birds P. phoenicuroides (in Western Himalayas) and P. Rufiventris (in Central and Eastern Himalayas), both come to Delhi in the winters. The primary difference between the two races is that the male of the former has a grey crown, nape, and lower back while these are much darker in the latter.

The bird has a black bill (beak) and legs and the eye colour is mostly dark brown, when seen in good light, else appear dark.

Both sexes display a bright rufous-orange tail that is best seen in flight or when they flash it open while shivering (tail movement) when perched. They do this most often after relishing a meal from the vicinity.

After this month, the bird will return to its preferred breeding grounds. During its stay here, it is generally spread throughout the country, even till the extreme south of the peninsula, frequenting groves of trees, orchards, gardens, and the vicinity of old buildings like the Humayun’s Tomb and Hauz Khas in the capital.

The males pair-up and rear their young with females, thereby protecting their partners and offspring against other males. It is not uncommon for these males to also mate with other females in the area. If you’re sitting still somewhere, keep an eye out on low branches serve as perches for the Black Redstarts. They tend to have preferred perches they return to, unless disturbed.
