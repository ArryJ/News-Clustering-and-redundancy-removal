0,2020/03/03,Olympics could be postponed to end of year: Japan minister,"The Olympics are slated to start from July 24 and is set to continue till August 9.

Japan’s Olympic minister on Tuesday said that the Tokyo 2020 Games could be moved from the summer until later in the year due to fears over coronavirus outbreak.

In response to a question in Japan’s parliament, Seiko Hashimoto said Tokyo’s contract with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) “calls for the Games to be held within 2020”, as quoted by BBC Sport.

She added that “could be interpreted as allowing a postponement”.

The Olympics are slated to start from July 24 and is set to continue till August 9.

“We are doing all we can to ensure that the Games go ahead as planned,” Hashimoto added.

Japan's government, Tokyo organisers and the IOC have all pledged to hold the Games on schedule from July 24, but the fast-spreading virus continues to raise concerns.

“Looking at the contract once again, it says in Article 66 that the IOC holds the right to cancel the Games by deactivating the contract if... the Games are not held in 2020,” Hashimoto said.

“At this moment, the Tokyo 2020 committee, the IOC and Tokyo (city government) are doing their best to make sure the Games will be held from July 24,” she added.

“The government will fully support that.”

Hashimoto added that May looked like an “important benchmark” for deciding whether the Games go ahead as scheduled.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/myn3pj/article30974513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SeikoHashimoto,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/olympics-could-be-postponed-to-end-of-year-japan-minister/article30974512.ece
1,2020/03/03,Panghal gets top billing,"World championship silver medallist Amit Panghal (52kg) has been given the top billing while M.C. Mary Kom (51kg) has been seeded second in the women’s event of the Asian Olympic qualifiers for boxing starting here on Tuesday.

Eight men and five women from India will be aiming to secure Tokyo Olympics berths at the continental event being conducted by the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) Boxing Task Force.

While Panghal is the lone Indian man to be seeded, two-time World bronze medallist Lovlina Borgohain (69kg) and Pooja Rani (75kg) have been seeded second and fourth in the women’s competition.

The Indian team arrived in Jordan last Friday after a training stint in Assisi (Italy). “Everything is fine here. The team is in high spirits and we are looking forward to a strong performance,” said Indian boxing’s High Performance Director Santiago Nieva.

“We have worked on some areas to ensure that our opponents do not stand a chance,” he asserted.

The tournament has 63 quota places on offer and a boxer will be assured for a Tokyo ticket if he reaches the semifinal stage.

Among the men, Commonwealth Games silver-medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg) is a strong contender to book a Tokyo spot along with Panghal and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Vikas Krishan (69kg).

The Indian squad:

Men: Amit Panghal (52kg), Gaurav Solanki (57kg), Manish Kaushik (63 kg), Vikas Krishan (69kg), Ashish Kumar (75kg), Sachin Kumar (81kg), Naman Tanwar (91kg), Satish Kumar (+91kg).

4,2020/03/03,Fed Cup tennis: China takes an unbeatable 2-0 lead,"The top two teams in the six-nation Asia/Oceania Group I will qualify for the Play-offs, to be held next month.

Ankita Raina put up a brave performance against world No. 29 Wang Qiang, but China took an unbeatable 2-0 lead against India in the opening league match of the Fed Cup Asia-Oceania women’s tennis tournament here on Tuesday.

The 27-year-old Ankita, ranked 160 in the world, survived two match points to stretch the contest against Wang Qiang, who eventually prevailed 1-6, 6-2, 6-4, in two hours and 24 minutes.

In the first singles, world No. 35 Shuai Zhang beat the 433rd ranked Rutuja Bhosale 6-4, 6-2 to provide a strong start for China.

The defeat apart, it was a good start for India which will have four more matches against Uzbekistan, Korea, Chinese Taipei and Indonesia in that order, in the round robin league.

With two teams qualifying for the next stage, India still has a good chance to step it up after the strong fight against the best team in the field.

5,2020/03/03,"Portronics Harmonics Twins Mini review: Economic, ergonomic, but not exceptional","The earbuds is good enough for music, not so much for calls

In the iconic opening scene of Mani Ratnam’s Alaipayuthe (2000), R Madhavan, smartly dressed in a bright blue shirt and cream trousers, rides a Hero Honda Splendor while listening to a pop-rap song on his headphones, connected to his Walkman (it was probably the coolest affordable gadget on the planet, then).

Apart from grousing about not wearing a helmet, I want to ask him, how often was he inconvenienced by the headphones? How many times, in a frantic search for his house keys in his trouser pockets, did he curse the existence of the headphone’s wire? What if he collided with an MLA’s car and was taken to the police station? Would he appear before the inspector with the headphones around his neck? We don’t see him carrying a bag to put his headphones in...

Madhavan, perhaps, wouldn’t look as cool as he did with wireless bluetooth earbuds. But, having constantly dealt with one of the two hassles listed above with wired earphones, I can assure him that they are significantly more comfortable for driving. Apart from the benefit of size (you can quickly shove them in your pocket if you have to meet the aforementioned inspector), a tap can pause a song and attend or cut a call; two taps can change the soundtrack.

If I am sounding like one of those overtly enthusiastic salespeople one sees on television, it is because I have started using wireless earbuds only recently.

I, actually, had no qualms using the wired earphones that came with my phone until I started using Portronics’ Harmonics Twins Mini. Now, I have first world problems if I am asked to use earphones again, especially while driving.

Twins Mini hasn’t as many features as its superior family member, Twins II, which comes with ‘soft touch’ (instead of buttons), a more powerful battery and a greater water resistance.

The true wireless stereo technology (with Bluetooth 5.0) untangles you from all cable-related hassles. Through the 8 millimetre speakers, the music is delivered without much noise even if you are walking on a busy street. The sound quality, however, doesn’t match the high-end wired earphones.

The ergonomic design prevents the buds from falling off your ears when during a run. You can probably put the design to test by using them while speed-climbing or doing upside-down asanas.

As their product description claims, the case is pocket-friendly and has an in-built 320mAh battery (apart from the buds’ 40mAh in-built batteries), which can provide wireless music for three hours.

But contrary to their claim, the buds do not “mimic actual phone experience on calls” — a friend asked me why I sounded like I was talking to him from the bottom of a well.

Despite its shortcoming, the Twins Mini, priced ₹1999 (onwards), could be a contender for the top spot among budget wireless earbuds. It’s available in black, blue and green colours (the last two, however, appear dull) online and on offline stores and comes with a one-year warranty.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/vh5pd9/article30974882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25mp-HarmonicsTwinsMini-11jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/portronics-harmonics-twins-mini-review-economic-ergonomic-but-not-exceptional/article30974883.ece
6,2020/03/03,Netgear Nighthawk AX12 router: a monster for data speeds and network security,"The Netgear Nighthawk AX12 (RAX200) Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6 router is a pricey superhero with a couple of glitches

This year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas once again proved that Netgear is one of the big guys with their Nighthawk and Orbi series. The San Jose tech company has released quite a line-up of spaceship-esque network appliances since around 2016. This market is a competitive one, with demands for a safer network at home or at work on the continuous rise.

Reviewing the latest from the Nighthawk (Marvel fans would love the name for the species of supervillains-turned-superheroes) AX12 series, the RAX200, would familiarise me with the industry’s quick progress.

While I have not interacted much with Orbi or Nighthawk, the Netgear family is no stranger to my home. My daily router is the Netgear R6120 AC1200 Dual Band, which is paired with a TP-Link TL-WA850RE extender. The extender — while certainly furthering coverage — has compromised my existing bandwidth to less than half of my paid-for speed.

So, I would not just be testing the AX12 RAX200, but I would also gauge its ability to work with an extender.

Pretty on the outside

Unboxing the AX12 RAX200 was not a cumbersome experience; minimal packaging (high-five to the environment) still lent support to the fragile yet mammoth router that would be unveiled. The router itself is not too heavy at just over a kilogram. The glossy finish and wing-like antennae offer a futuristic finish to the industrial design. According to Netgear, the antennae are positioned at slight angles to offer optimal Wi-Fi delivery. Yes, this is a good-looking gadget for the modern home.

Since last spring, my home has converged with smart tech, the entire ecosystem requiring a stronger bandwidth with no dropouts. Naturally, bringing the AX12 RAX200 into this equation was exciting. And considering it is priced at just under ₹75k, I almost wanted to power up my entire building.

Setting up the AX12 RAX200 was no small feat. First, one has to download the Nighthawk app (available on iOS and Android) which is not only a setup wizard but also helps you monitor and manage your network, both remotely and on-site. The app itself works pretty seamlessly, but I would suggest setting it up on a tablet or an Android rather than an iPhone.

The configuration documentation, available online as a standard, was helpful with the initial stages, but when it came to final configurations, I started feeling palpitations from the sheer stress. Much to my shame, I had to bring in a third party to help with the final configuration, but I was deeply comforted by the fact that my helper was also scratching his head in confusion and that there was a problem with the lines in my area.

Just silly fast

The security protocols on the Nighthawk series are layered and complex, and should be satisfactory to most users. In the six days of testing the device, there were two firmware updates; do not ignore these — for any router system you are using.

Probably one of the most aggravating experiences had to be the continual logout from the Wi-Fi. While my daily step count was upped from the back-and-forth between my nest in my room and the router placed upstairs, this should not have been an issue. I tried to put it down to the lines being down in the area, but my neighbours did not have any such issues. Additionally, the device claims to cater to large homes, but no such luck (I reside in a duplex apartment). People living in villas or independent homes could invest in an extender, but at the moment, the AX12 RAX200 does not have any official client devices, so fork cash over for a separate name.

But when the Nighthawk AX12 RAX200 is connected, it feels like a bullet train. Random speed tests across the six days through the Nighthawk app showed consistent speeds of 99.5 megabytes for download and uploads, and it reflected consistently in activities as simple as web browsing to using IoT devices which were more ‘on the ball’ with the data playground they were freely given. Responses came faster and smoother. Mobile phones can enjoy gigabit speeds too.

While using Netflix in Ultra HDR, paired with the streaming platform’s Adaptive Streaming technology, there were no glitches and experimental rapid switching between shows presented no issues. Apple TV+, which used to really grind my gums with its forever buffering, was the ultimate test, and the AX12 RAX200 passed.

The battle royale of speed and capacity was surely running every IoT device, mobile phone, smart television, laptop and tablet at the same time.

A speed test via Ookla showed a drop of nine megabytes a second. Not bad for Wi-Fi 6.

Would I pay around ₹75k for this? Not really, as I am sure there would be equally good router systems for a fraction of the cost which would actually have the sufficient coverage power.

The U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump on Wednesday were coalescing around emergency legislation to battle the spreading coronavirus with as much as $9 billion in new funding that would immediately be available to stem a health crisis.

Mr. Trump said the measure would appropriate about $8.5 billion — far above the $2.5 billion he initially requested last month. And House of Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, noting that the measure was still being written in Congress, said it could inject “$8 or $9 billion” into the U.S. economy.

Mr. Hoyer, who is in charge of scheduling debate of legislation on the House floor, said he was aiming for passage on Wednesday so that it could promptly be sent to the Senate for final approval, possibly this week.

The legislation is one part of a multipronged approach emerging from Washington following multiple deaths in Washington state this week from illnesses caused by the highly contagious coronavirus.

Earlier on Tuesday the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25% in an attempt to cushion the economy against the impact of the virus, which could slow consumer spending and disrupt business activities.

House Democrats said that as they get more information on the trajectory of the virus' spread, they could act to appropriate additional funds beyond what is expected to be approved in coming days.

U.S. health officials have been ramping up the government's ability to do more testing of patients suspected of having been infected by the new coronavirus, which was first detected in China late last year.

There also are efforts by pharmaceutical companies and Washington to speed the development of a vaccine for the coronavirus.

While details were still not available, the House's emergency spending could contain money to help state and local governments respond to local health emergencies, ensure that vaccines become plentiful and affordable, and possibly provide interest-free loans for small businesses affected by an outbreak, Democratic lawmakers said.

10,2020/03/03,U.S. Presidential Election 2020 | U.S. votes in crucial primaries after three ex-rivals back Joe Biden,"Klobuchar, Buttigieg and O’Rourke endorse the former V-P

Americans vote on Tuesday in primaries that play a major role in who will challenge Donald Trump for the presidency, a day after key endorsements dramatically boosted Joe Biden’s hopes against surging leftist Bernie Sanders.

The backing of Mr. Biden by three of his ex-rivals marked an unprecedented turn in a fractured, often bitter campaign.

The Democratic establishment is desperate to unite around a moderate candidate who can triumph over frontrunner Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, and face President Trump in November.

The 77-year-old former Vice-President is consolidating support among moderates eager to blunt the advance of Mr. Sanders, who could take a potentially insurmountable lead in the all-important delegate count after Super Tuesday.

Mr. Biden has been riding high with key endorsements that built into a political crescendo on Monday.

He took the stage at a rally in Dallas, Texas joined by Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, who told the crowd she was ending her campaign and endorsing Mr. Biden for president.

Mr. Biden later introduced Beto O’Rourke, who made a big splash early in the Democratic race but then fizzled out. Mr. O’Rourke remains popular in Texas, the state with the largest delegate haul on Tuesday after California.

“We need somebody who can beat Donald Trump (and) in Biden we have that man,” Mr. O’Rourke said.

12,2020/03/03,"COVID-19 | We are in uncharted territory, says WHO","Globally, COVID-19 has killed more than 3,127 people and infected over 92,000 in 77 countries

The world has entered uncharted territory in its battle against the deadly coronavirus, the UN health agency warned, as new infections dropped dramatically in China on Tuesday but surged elsewhere.

Globally, the virus has killed more than 3,127 people and infected over 92,000 in 77 countries and territories. A clear shift in the crisis emerges, with nine times as many new cases recorded outside China as inside, according to the World Health Organization.

China has imposed draconian quarantines and travel restrictions to keep large swathes of the population indoors — a strategy that appears to have paid off as new cases have been generally falling for days.

“We are in uncharted territory,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

“We have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can also be contained with the right measures.”

Community transmission means infections within a population are not imported from another virus-hit area.

While Italy has locked down towns, other countries have stopped short of imposing mass quarantines and instead have discouraged large gatherings, delayed sporting events and banned arrivals from virus-hit nations.

Twitter told staff across the world to work from home.

South Korea, Iran and Italy have emerged as major COVID-19 hotspots. With concern growing about the impact on the global economy, G7 Finance Ministers and central bank chiefs will hold talks on Tuesday.

13,2020/03/03,MP challenges Nasheed on India stand,"Muslims who are suffering in India deserve our attention, says Ali Hussain

A Maldivian legislator has challenged Speaker and Former President Mohamed Nasheed on his “selective” response to the treatment of Muslims in the neighbourhood.

In a tweet on February 28, Mr. Nasheed said: “I am delighted that Amal Clooney is working with Maldives to fight on behalf of the Rohingya people. As good Muslims, Maldivians have a duty to help our brothers and sisters, and it makes sense to begin with those who are closest to us.

Also Read Ranil Wickremesinghe's keynote address at The Huddle 2020

It followed the Maldivian government’s decision to join the Gambia in challenging Myanmar’s treatment of Rohingya people at the International Court of Justice.

Apparently responding to Mr. Nasheed’s tweet, Ali Hussain, an MP from the ruling coalition, said in a tweet the same day: “Also the Muslims who are suffering in India deserve our attention. India is closer to us in many ways so there is no reason why we can’t raise our concerns.”

Asked about his tweet, Mr. Hussain told The Hindu via telephone from Male: “Yes, I strongly believe that we cannot be selective in our pursuit of justice.” “Whether it the revocation of Article 370 [that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir], or the passage of the Citizenship [Amendment] Act, I have closely followed many discussions in academic circles, among lawyers, including many of my classmates,” said Mr. Hussain, an alumnus of the National Law School, Bangalore.

“Reading on the Citizenship Act and listening to arguments made by many, I am able to appreciate the concerns over the infamous amendment that is not just discriminatory, but also arbitrary,” he said. “Moreover, the transfer of a senior judge [Justice Muralidhar] just hours after he questioned the Delhi police on the recent violence raises serious questions about the space for independent judiciary [in India],” he said.

The Maldives is home to nearly 4,00,000 four lakh Sunni Muslims. Male-New Delhi relations, which were tense until the election of President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih in 2018, have since seen a drastic improvement, marked by high-level visits and greater bilateral cooperation.

Observing that India was a “close friend”, Mr. Hussain said it was therefore Maldives’s duty to urge its friend to be fair to all its citizens.

On the other hand, Mr. Nasheed has maintained that the Kashmir issue or the CAA was India’s “internal matter”, and has refrained from commenting, like much of the Maldivian leadership in government now.

The same day, Mr. Nasheed also tweeted: “Very pleased to be speaking alongside @DrSJaishankar at @indfoundation Ideas Conclave in Gujarat. India’s founding principles of anti-colonialism, equality before the law, and democracy set it in good stead to be a responsible rising superpower.”

Asked about Mr. Hussain’s position, Mr. Nasheed, widely hailed as pro-democracy, human rights activist, said “racial disturbances” anywhere were “unfortunate”. The idea upon which India was born was “co-existence”, despite different languages, ethnicities or religions, he said.

“India, as a democracy, with the rule of law, will be able to address the issue,” he told The Hindu over telephone.

“Religious extremism and intolerance is a sad reality of the political landscape in many parts of the world…It’s not just about race or religion, it is about a fellow human being unfairly hurt. It doesn’t help bringing religion into this,” said Mr. Nasheed, who had called upon “good Muslims” in his tweet on the Rohingyas.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/licp06/article30975160.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Mohamed-Nasheed,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mp-challenges-nasheed-on-india-stand/article30975161.ece
14,2020/03/03,COVID-19 | Iran orders troops to fight coronavirus outbreak as death toll rises to 77,"“Whatever helps public health and prevents the spread of the disease is good and what helps to spread it is sin,” Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said

Iran’s supreme leader put the Islamic Republic’s armed forces on alert on March 3 to assist health officials in combating the outbreak of the new coronavirus — the deadliest outside of China — that authorities say has killed 77 people.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s decision was announced after state media broadcast images of the 80-year-old leader planting a tree wearing disposable gloves ahead of Iran’s upcoming arbor day, showing how concern about the virus now reaches up to the top of the country’s Shia theocracy. Iranian media reported that 23 members of Parliament now had the virus, as did the head of the country’s emergency services.

“Whatever helps public health and prevents the spread of the disease is good and what helps to spread it is sin,” Mr. Khamenei said, who has not worn gloves at past arbor day plantings.

After downplaying the coronavirus as recently as last week, Iranian authorities said on March 3 they had plans to potentially mobilize 3,00,000 soldiers and volunteers to confront the virus. It wasn’t clear if Mr. Khamenei’s order would set them in motion helping sanitize streets, direct traffic and track possible contacts those ill with the virus had with others, as initially suggested.

There are now over 2,530 cases of the new coronavirus across the Mideast. Of those outside Iran in the region, most link back to the Islamic Republic.

Yet experts worry Iran’s percentage of deaths to infections, now around 3.3%, is much higher than other countries, suggesting the number of infections in Iran may be far greater than current figures show.

High-ranking officials killed by virus

Iran stands alone in how the virus has affected its government, even compared to hard-hit China, the epicentre of the outbreak.

The death of Expediency Council member Mohammad Mirmohammadi on March 2 makes him the highest-ranking official within Iran’s leadership to be killed by the virus. State media referred to him as a confidant of Mr. Khamenei.

The virus earlier killed Hadi Khosroshahi, Iran’s former Ambassador to the Vatican, as well as a recently elected member of Parliament.

Those sick include Vice-President Masoumeh Ebtekar, better known as “Sister Mary”, the English-speaking spokeswoman for the students who seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and sparked the 444-day hostage crisis, state media reported. Also sick is Iraj Harirchi, the head of an Iranian government task force on the coronavirus who tried to downplay the virus before falling ill.

On March 3, lawmaker Abdolreza Mesri told Iranian state television’s Young Journalists Club programme that 23 members of Parliament had the coronavirus. He urged all lawmakers to avoid the public.

“These people have a close relationship with the people and they carry different viruses from different parts of the country, which may create a new virus, so we recommend the lawmakers to cut off their relationship with the public for now,” Mr. Mesri said.

Head of Iran's emergency medical services infected

The semiofficial ILNA and Tasnim news agencies in Iran also reported that Pirhossein Koulivand, the head of the country’s emergency services, had come down with the new illness. They offered no other immediate details.

Also read: Passengers from Italy, Iran too will be screened, says DGCA

An activist group also said on March 3 that Wikipedia’s Farsi-language website appeared to be disrupted in Iran after a close confidant to the supreme leader died of the new coronavirus.

The advocacy group NetBlocks linked Mirmohammadi’s death to the disruption, though Iranian officials and its state media did not immediately acknowledge it. Authorities face increasing criticism from the Iranian public over the outbreak amid concerns the number of cases from the virus may be higher than currently reported.

NetBlocks described the disruption to accessing Farsi Wikipedia as being nationwide, saying its technical testing suggests the online encyclopedia is being blocked by the same mechanism used to block Twitter and Facebook. Those social media websites have been banned since Iran’s disputed 2009 presidential election and Green Movement protests.

Internet disruptions

Some Iranians said they couldn’t access Wikipedia’s Farsi website since March 2 night. Others said they could, including through the site’s mobile-friendly pages.

“The new restrictions come as Iran faces a growing crisis following the loss of senior state figures to coronavirus and a spate of criticism and misinformation have spread through social media,” NetBlocks said in its analysis.

The Wikimedia Foundation, which oversees the volunteer-edited encyclopedia, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NetBlocks previously reported internet disruptions affecting Iran in recent days and users across the Islamic Republic have reported problems.

The disruption raises fears of Iran potentially shutting off the internet entirely again, as it did for a week during economic protests in November. Iran separately has created its own so-called “halal” net of government-approved websites.

Meanwhile on March 3, the Middle East’s largest airline, Emirates, said it had to reduce or ground flights due to the new virus. Because of the slowdown, the government-owned carrier has asked its employees to take paid and even unpaid leave for up to a month at a time. Emirates’ operates out of Dubai, the world’s busiest for international travel.

“We have been tested before and Emirates will come out stronger,” Chief Operating Officer Adel Al-Redha said.

The world’s largest airline trade association, IATA, says Mideast carriers have already lost around $100 million in revenue due to a drop in ticket sales because of disruptions caused by the virus.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/y6jx1w/article30972970.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-IRANI-KHAMENEI-AP-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-iran-orders-troops-to-fight-coronavirus-outbreak-as-death-toll-rises-to-77/article30972971.ece
15,2020/03/03,"Taliban attack Afghan army bases, throwing peace talks into doubt","The intra-Afghan negotiations are due to begin March 10 according to a U.S.-Taliban deal signed in Doha on Saturday

The Taliban carried out more than a dozen attacks on Afghan army bases, officials said on Tuesday, hours after ending a partial truce and throwing into doubt peace talks between Kabul and the insurgents.

The intra-Afghan negotiations are due to begin March 10 according to a U.S.-Taliban deal signed in Doha on Saturday, but a dispute over a prisoner swap has raised questions about whether they will go ahead.

Also read | A big, bad deal: On U.S.-Taliban agreement

The agreement includes a commitment for the Taliban to release up to 1,000 prisoners and for the Afghan government to free around 5,000 insurgent captives — something the militants have cited as a prerequisite for talks but which President Ashraf Ghani has refused to do before negotiations start.

The row has highlighted the tough road ahead, with the Taliban’s decision to end a partial truce Monday complicating matters further.

A defence ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP of overnight attacks on government forces in 13 of the country’s 34 provinces.

Two soldiers were killed in one of the attacks that happened in southern Kandahar province, a government statement said.

Also read | Who won the Afghan war?

An attack in Logar province near Kabul — which was not included in the defence ministry official’s tally — killed five security forces, the provincial governor’s spokesman Didar Lawang told AFP.

The halt to the limited truce, which began on February 22, ends what was a welcome reprieve for ordinary Afghans who have born the brunt of the deadly violence.

But experts said the move was unsurprising as both sides seek to exploit whatever leverage they hold to force the other’s hand.

“Of course violence will go up, was bound to happen. no surprise Mr. Ghani balking on prisoner release: 1 of his few levers,” Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, tweeted.

Also read | India hails peace deal in “contiguous neighbour”

Kabul-based analyst Ahmad Saeedi told AFP the uptick in attacks reflected the insurgents’ belief that “they have to keep the battlefield hot to be able to win on the negotiating table, as they did with the Americans.”

Mr. Ghani’s government last week sent a delegation to Qatar to open “initial contacts” with the insurgents but Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen on Tuesday said the militants would not meet Kabul’s representatives except to discuss the release of their captives.

Apparent differences between the Doha agreement and a joint U.S.-Afghan declaration released in Afghanistan underline the obstacles facing negotiators.

The U.S.-Taliban deal committed to the release of prisoners while the Kabul document only required both sides to determine “the feasibility of releasing” captives.

In a statement, the U.N.’s Afghanistan mission called for “continued reduced violence to maintain & enhance an environment conducive to the start of intra-Afghan negotiations“.

Since the deal signing, the Taliban have been publicly claiming “victory” over the U.S..

Speaking to Fox News, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo played down the militants’ comments.

“So I’ve seen lots of remarks. Just watch what really happens. Pay less attention to statements, pay less attention to things people say,” Pompeo said.

“Watch what happens on the ground. There’s been a lot of work done at detailed levels about how this will proceed. So far, so good.” Under the terms of the deal, foreign forces will quit Afghanistan within 14 months, subject to Taliban security guarantees and a pledge by the insurgents to hold talks with Kabul.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/l414r2/article30972769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AFGHANISTANPEACEDEALIMPACT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taliban-attack-afghan-army-bases-throwing-peace-talks-into-doubt/article30972697.ece

17,2020/03/03,Comment | Who won the Afghan war?,"With the U.S.’s phased withdrawal, the Taliban has got what it wanted. How does this benefit Pakistan and what do they want?

Who won the Afghan war?

With the U.S. planning for a phased withdrawal from Afghanistan as part of its agreement with the Taliban, the insurgent group is clearly in an advantageous position. Throughout the 18-year-long war, its key demand has been the expulsion (or withdrawal) of foreign troops from the country.

The Taliban has got what it wanted and did not shy away from declaring victory. Sher Mohammad Abas Stanikzai, the Taliban's deputy negotiator, called the day of signing a ""day of victory"". The group’s multimedia chief characteristically called it ""the defeat of the arrogance of the White House in the face of the white turban"", according to the New York Times.

But the Taliban is not the only winner. There has always been a shadow player in the Afghan war - Pakistan. From its inception, the Taliban has had good ties with the Pakistani military establishment. Barring some tactical realignment in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., Islamabad has never abandoned the Taliban. It continued to host the Taliban leadership and the Haqqani Network, an internationally declared terrorist group that has close ties with the Pakistani military and is now an influential actor within the Taliban fold. So, the strengthening of the hands of the Taliban in Afghanistan is good news for Pakistan.

How has the U.S. lost the war?

The Taliban was Pakistan’s most important bet to increase its influence in Afghanistan. Pakistan had always been worried about getting sandwiched between India and a pro-India government in Kabul.

When the Taliban was in power during 1996-2001, Pakistan had its greatest influence on the country in Afghanistan’s history. The Taliban regime of Mullah Omar was increasingly dependent on Pakistan for its engagement with the outside world. But after the Taliban was ousted from power by the Americans in 2001, Pakistan’s influence started receding.

Simultaneously, India stepped up its engagement with the post-Taliban government, made investments in rebuilding the country, and cultivated strong ties with different political groups, which heightened Pakistan’s insecurity. Pakistan was also facing a strategic dilemma - it can’t antagonise the U.S. which was leading the war on terror, but it can’t shun the Taliban either, which would weaken its geopolitical standing in the region.

Also Read A big, bad deal: On U.S.-Taliban agreement

To overcome this dilemma, Pakistan adopted a double game: continue to fight alongside the U.S. in the war on terror while retaining its deep ties with the Afghan Taliban. Directorate S, a unit of the Inter-Service Intelligence, Pakistan’s spy agency, secretly continued its operations assisting the Taliban. American journalist Steve Coll has reconstructed this dual play of Pakistan in the Afghan war in his book, Directorate S, arguing that Pakistan’s main concern in the post-Taliban Afghanistan was India’s growing influence in the country. And when the U.S. went to other wars such as Iraq, Libya and Syria and lost its focus on Afghanistan, it became easier for Pakistan to continue its double game.

What does Pakistan want?

Pakistan wanted two things. One, it wanted to curtail India’s influence in Afghanistan. Two, it wanted a bargaining chip in dealing with the U.S., which was pivoting towards India. The Taliban was its answer to both these problems. The calculation was that if the Taliban was not defeated in the war, the U.S. would be forced to engage with the group, and the road to engaging with the Taliban goes through Islamabad. And if the U.S. directly engages with the Taliban and pulls out of Afghanistan, it would strengthen the Taliban vis-a-vis the Afghan government. This is what appears to be happening now.

By the time the U.S. realised that it was losing the Afghan war, Pakistan had already rebuilt its influence in Afghanistan through a resurgent Taliban. Desperate to get out of the conflict, the U.S. had to reach out to Pakistan to kick-start direct talks with the Taliban. The U.S. would continue to need Pakistan’s assistance to save the deal and retain some influence on the Taliban.

On the other hand, the mainstreaming of the Taliban in Afghanistan, would naturally enhance Pakistan’s standing in the country. If the Taliban captures power in the future or even if the Taliban is accommodated into the government as part of some peace agreement, Pakistan would use its leverage on the Taliban to undercut India’s influence in Kabul.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/podcast/58tpy3/article30964819.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Zalmay-Talibanjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/comment-who-won-the-afghan-war/article30970762.ece
18,2020/03/03,U.S. peace deal leaves Afghans to determine post-war landscape,"The Taliban say they have changed. Girls will be allowed to go to school, and women to work. Women can be judges but not the chief justice; they can participate in politics but not be president, they say.

Now that the U.S. has signed a deal with the Taliban to eventually leave Afghanistan, it will soon be up to Afghans on both sides of the conflict to decide what peace will look like.

The stakes are high.

The big question for many — and particularly those who remember the religiously repressive Taliban rule that ended with the US invasion in 2001 — is whether the newly emboldened militants have changed their ideology. Women, especially in the cities, worry that their rights will be bargained away.

The Taliban say they have changed. Girls will be allowed to go to school, and women to work. Women can be judges but not the chief justice; they can participate in politics but not be president, they say.

The Taliban, however, will likely not back down on segregation of the sexes, said Hakim Mujahed, the Taliban’s representative at the United Nations during their five-year rule. They will not accept co-education nor will they accept women and men working together, he said.

They also say hijab, or a head covering, will be a must, though they won’t insist on the all-enveloping burqa, according to Mujahed. The burqa predated the Taliban by decades, particularly in rural Afghanistan, but became a symbol of their repression of women during their rule. It is still worn in much of rural Afghanistan and is seen even in the capital of Kabul.

Certainly they are not in favor of co-education. They are not in favor of co-working, said Mujahed who quietly returned to Kabul after the Taliban were ousted in 2001 and eventually joined a government peace committee tasked with making peace with the Taliban.

But they are in favor of providing the conditions for education, for work, for economic and political activities for women ... but within the framework of Islamic teachings, said Mujahed who kept his long unkempt beard and wears the turban.

Though the turban is common throughout Afghanistan __ not just in Taliban areas — they made it a signature of their rule, requiring all government employees wear one. They also demanded all men wear beards.

In any negotiations, the two sides are expected to hammer out the form of government and constitution. The current constitution decrees that no laws may contradict Islamic principles — and trying to define that vague term is where issues of women’s rights and broader civil rights are likely to come to the fore.

Activists want negotiators to write in guarantees up front that provisions on Islamic principles can’t be used to later violate those rights.

Najiba Ayubi, who is director of an organization devoted to women and media development and a strong proponent of free speech, said Afghan women can’t rely on Afghan men to fight for their rights. She said women need strong female representation at the table.

Otherwise, no men will fight with or for us ... because they are not aware what we are facing, and maybe for some of them it is not important what will happen to women, she said.

Afghanistan is a conservative and male-dominated, and men always think women are second-class citizens,” Ayubi said, adding it will take years to change.

Ayubi has good reason to fear the Taliban. When they ruled, she was twice beaten for being improperly covered, even as she walked hidden behind the all encompassing burqa. Her sisters — one a doctor and the other a judge — were forced to stay home.

Still, she welcomed the chance to bring to an end 40 years of war and said she was confident the Taliban of today were not the Taliban of 2001.

The Taliban know that this is another time. This is not the Afghanistan of 20 years back, she said.

Today, the country has a thriving social media scene and several media outlets and a data-savvy younger generation that cannot be easily silenced. The Taliban too have a younger generation, who will not be denied their music and their videos, which were banned during their rule.

Still, getting Afghans to agree won’t be easy.

Even getting them to the table is proving a formidable task. The deal between the US and Taliban envisioned talks between Afghans on both sides of the conflict starting March 10, most likely in Oslo. But so far there’s no confirmation that important next step will take place.

Washington won’t likely wait around. Its withdrawal is not tied to Afghanistan’s warring sides figuring out how to talk to each other, let alone coming to an agreement on what peace among them will look like.

According to Saturday’s deal, all 13,000 U.S. troops will leave Afghanistan within 14 months if the Taliban meet their obligations to America. Those promises are tied to fighting terrorism, preventing Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for terrorists, denouncing terrorist groups, severing past links with the likes of al-Qaida and helping fight the Islamic State group affiliate.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qqx1is/article30970437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AFGHANISTANPEACEDEALIMPACT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-peace-deal-leaves-afghans-to-determine-post-war-landscape/article30970439.ece
19,2020/03/03,Challenges facing new Malaysia PM after controversial takeover,"The legitimacy of Muhyiddin's government, which came with the support of Malay nationalist parties he previously opposed, has been questioned by the opposing camp led by his former boss Mahathir.

Muhyiddin Yassin was sworn in as Malaysia's new prime minister on Sunday after a week of political turmoil triggered by the surprise resignation of Mahathir Mohamad, but he has yet to name any cabinet colleagues.

The legitimacy of Muhyiddin's government, which came with the support of Malay nationalist parties he previously opposed, has been questioned by the opposing camp led by his former boss Mahathir.

What happened?

Malaysia's king on Saturday named Mr. Muhyiddin (72), as being the most likely candidate to be able to command a majority in parliament after days of political twists and turns.

Mr. Mahathir (94), disputed the decision saying he instead had the numbers in the 222-member parliament. Mahathir, however, said he had not been able to convey to the palace that he had the majority.

In his first address to the nation, Mr. Muhyiddin defended himself.

“I know there are those who are angry with me. As expected, there are those who branded me a traitor. Listen well, I am no traitor,” he said on Monday.

Mahathir resigned because he had been angered by pressure from supporters of old rival Anwar Ibrahim (72), to set a timeline to hand power to him as part of a deal reached to fight the last general election together two years ago.

In the end, both Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Anwar got sidelined by their former coalition partner Mr. Muhyiddin, who moved quickly to seek support from people the other two would not work with.

What could happen next?

Mr. Muhyiddin's opponents have called for parliament to reconvene on March 9 as originally scheduled so that his majority claim can be tested.

That, however, will likely not happen, his supporters said, because the new premier needs time to first appoint ministers and focus on reviving the economy that grew at its slowest pace in the fourth quarter.

“By convention you need a cabinet, and then they need some time to adjust themselves to understand their ministries,” said Wee Ka Siong, a lawmaker from the new ruling coalition. “Then only can they answer questions.”

The last parliament session ended on Dec. 5, and according to the constitution, the first day of the new session must be held within six months of that, which in this case would be by June 5.

Mr. Mahathir said a delay in reconvening parliament may give ”these very rich and powerful people” in the new ruling coalition time to try and secure a majority.

What will change?

The return to power of parties that lost the last election may mean renewed focus on the country's decades-old positive discrimination policy for majority Malays, who enjoyed preferential access to everything from public financing to a 30% quota for equity holdings in businesses.

Unlike Mr. Mahathir's multi-ethnic government, the new administration may also be willing to put more Malays back into key positions, and veer towards religious conservatism in the largely Muslim country.

There have been some low-key protests against the new government by people who have accused it of disrespecting the 2018 mandate, which was driven by popular anger against alleged corruption by parties now backing Mr. Muhyiddin.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7rgga2/article30949795.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUHYIDDINYASSIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/challenges-facing-new-malaysia-pm-after-controversial-takeover/article30970089.ece
20,2020/03/03,Child drowns at sea off Greece in first fatality after Turkey opens border,"More than 10,000 migrants, mostly from Syria, other Middle Eastern states and Afghanistan, have reached Turkey's land borders with EU states Greece and Bulgaria.

A young Syrian boy died on Monday after being pulled from the sea when a boat capsized off the Greek island of Lesbos, Greek officials said, the first reported fatality since Turkey opened its border last week to let migrants reach Europe.

Separately, two Turkish security sources told Reuters a Syrian migrant had died from injuries on Monday after Greek security forces intervened to prevent migrants crossing from Turkey into Greece, but Athens branded the claim “fake news.”

More than 10,000 migrants, mostly from Syria, other Middle Eastern states and Afghanistan, have reached Turkey's land orders with EU states Greece and Bulgaria since Ankara said last Thursday it would stop keeping them on its territory.

Farther south, at least 1,000 migrants have reached Greece's eastern Aegean Islands since Sunday morning, Greek police said.

“This is an invasion,” Development Minister Adonis Georgiadis told Skai TV.

The surge, which has led to Greek and Turkish police firing tear gas into crowds caught in the no-man's land between the two borders, has revived memories of the 2015-16 refugee crisis, when more than a million people arrived in Europe from Turkey.

“We have children four days without food,” one man shouted from behind a wall of barbed wire near the Kastanies border post as Greek riot police stood ready to repel any breaches of the frontier. Nearby soldiers unrolled more coils of barbed wire.

The migrants, some with white flags, chanted “Peace!”

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' office said he had discussed the border situation with U.S. President Donald Trump who, it said, had “recognised the right of Greece to enforce the law on its borders”.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, who keeps warm ties with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, flew to Ankara on Monday to meet him. Bulgaria has seen no significant migrant inflows.

Borissov said he had tried to arrange a meeting between Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria but Erdogan was unwilling to sit at the same table with Mitsotakis. Erdogan said that Greek soldiers had killed two migrants and wounded a third one. Greek government officials denied it.

“No shots have been fired by Greek border forces against any individuals attempting to enter the country illegally,” government spokesman Stelios Petsas tweeted.

The boat that capsized off Lesbos had been escorted there by a Turkish vessel, the Greek coast guard said, underlining the escalating tensions between Ankara and Athens. The dead boy was aged about six, they said, but provided no other details.

More boats arrived at Greece's islands on Monday. About 4,000 people are believed to have drowned in the Aegean during the 2015-16 crisis trying to reach Europe, while some 42,000 migrants are still living in severely overcrowded camps on the Greek islands.

‘We’re stuck here’

The latest migrant surge follows Turkey's decision to stop enforcing a 2016 accord with the European Union whereby it stopped migrants entering the bloc in return for cash.

Turkey, already home to 3.7 million Syrian refugees, has another million arriving on its doorstep from a new surge of fighting in northern Syria and says it cannot handle any more.

Greece accuses Turkey of orchestrating a coordinated effort to drive migrants across the frontier.

One Greek policeman accused Turkish soldiers at the Kastanies border gate of “giving cutters” to migrants to cut holes in the fence to get through. Reuters could not verify the report.

Some migrants camped near the border had erected makeshift tents or built bonfires to stay warm. “What can we do, we're stuck here, we can't go back home and we can't cross (the border),” said Jamal Kassar, a Syrian migrant.

Greeks living near the border said they were tired of seeing waves of migrants passing through.

The EU's chief executive, Ursula von der Leyen, expressed sympathy on Monday with Turkey over the conflict in Syria but said its decision to let refugees and migrants cross into Europe “cannot be an answer or solution”.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel also said Turkey should not express its dissatisfaction with the EU “on the back of refugees.”

21,2020/03/03,Australian Associated Press closing after 85 years,"AAP’s more than 170 journalists will cease operations by June 26.

National news agency Australian Associated Press said on March 3 it was closing after 85 years, blaming a decline in subscribers and digital platforms distributing news content for free.

“The saddest day- AAP closes after 85 years of excellence in journalism. The AAP family will be sorely missed,” AAP editor-in-chief Tony Gillies said in a tweet.

AAP’s more than 170 journalists will cease operations by June 26. Its Pagemasters editorial production service will also close at the end of August, the company said.

“The unprecedented impact of the digital platforms that take other people’s content and distribute it for free has led to too many companies choosing to no longer use AAP’s professional service,” the company said in a statement. “We have reached the point where it is no longer viable to continue.”

AAP Chairman Campbell Reid said the organization had been for generations “journalism’s first responder”.

“It is a great loss that professional and researched information provided by AAP is being substituted with the un-researched and often inaccurate information that masquerades as real news on the digital platforms,” Mr. Reid added.

AAP’s domestic nationwide news coverage with bureaus in every state and territory is complemented by alliances with the major international news agencies including .

The AP licenses its news text and photo services to AAP for redistribution into the Australian media market and its customers. AP is also contracted to use AAP text and photos.

AAP was started in 1935 by newspaper publisher Keith Murdoch, father of News Corp. founder Rupert Murdoch. AAP is owned by Australian news organisations News Corp. Australia, Nine Entertainment Co., Seven West Media and Australian Community Media.

Australian media organisations are under mounting financial pressure with global digital giants Google and Facebook taking a growing chunk of advertising revenue.

Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, the journalists’ union, described the decision to shut down AAP as a “gross abandonment of responsibility by its shareholders — Australia’s major media outlets”.

“Bean-counters at the top of media organisations might think they can soldier on without AAP, but the reality is it will leave a huge hole in news coverage,” the union’s federal president Marcus Strom said in a statement.

“Filling those holes will fall to already overburdened newsroom journalists. Or coverage will simply cease to occur,” he added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4oz47w/article30969920.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03AAP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/australian-associated-press-closing-after-85-years/article30969921.ece

23,2020/03/03,Kim watches N Korea military drill alongside masked officers,"The report by the Korean Central News Agency came a day after South Korea’s military detected what appeared to be two short-range ballistic launches of projectiles that landed in the North’s eastern sea.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised an earlier live-fire rocket artillery exercise to confirm his military’s combat readiness and “further kindle the flames of training revolution,” state media said Tuesday.

The report by the Korean Central News Agency came a day after South Korea’s military detected what appeared to be two short-range ballistic launches of projectiles that landed in the North’s eastern sea.

Pyongyang’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper published photos of rockets soaring out of multiple rocket launchers and an island target buried in smoke.

Missiles are seen as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visits a drill of long-range artillery sub-units of the Korean People's Army, in North Korea in this image released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency | Photo Credit: KCNA

Mr. Kim smiled widely while watching from an observation post. He wore a black fur hat and leather coat but was not wearing a face mask, though other military officials had black masks in an apparent reflection of the country’s campaign against the coronavirus.

Analysts have speculated North Korea reduced training and other activities with large troop gatherings to reduce the chance of the virus spreading in its military. North Korea has not revealed if it has any cases of the illness, though state media has hinted at some people being quarantined while showing symptoms.

KCNA said of the drill that North Korean troops “proudly demonstrated” accurate marksmanship with their long-range artillery pieces, but it didn’t further specify the weapons involved.

""[Kim] expressed great satisfaction with the fact that the artillerymen are prepared to make rapid reaction to any circumstances and perfectly carry out their firepower combat duties,” the agency said.

""Saying that the victory of the socialist cause is guaranteed by the powerful military force and a war deterrence, he said that the People’s Army should keep full combat-readiness to protect the sky, land and sea of the country from any encroachment.”

The report did not mention any direct comments by Mr. Kim toward the United States or South Korea.

Kim Dong-yub, an analyst from Seoul’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the weapons involved would have included a “super large” multiple rocket launcher the North first revealed last year, judging by the flight data announced by Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Since the collapse of a second summit last year between Mr. Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump, North Korea resumed ballistic activity and weapons launches to expand its military capabilities. Mr. Kim had entered the new year vowing to bolster his nuclear deterrent in the face of “gangster-like” U.S. sanctions and pressure.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8x34t5/article30969239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NORTHKOREALAUNCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kim-watches-n-korea-military-drill-alongside-masked-officers/article30969240.ece

26,2020/03/03,Sri Lankan President dissolves Parliament,"Snap elections will be held on April 25

Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved Parliament ahead of schedule on Monday and set new elections for April, in which he aims to secure a strong majority that will enable him to push for constitutional changes to increase presidential powers.

The dissolution comes six months before the parliamentary term was scheduled to end. The decree signed by Mr. Rajapaksa said elections will be held on April 25.

Mr. Rajapaksa was elected to office last November but has said he cannot work freely because his presidential powers were reduced. He has also faced restrictions because the opposition commanded a majority in the 225-member Parliament.

The election campaign period will include the first anniversary of a series of Islamic State-inspired suicide bombings that killed more than 250 people in churches and tourist hotels on Easter Sunday last year.

Mr. Rajapaksa rode to power criticising the previous government of serious security and intelligence lapses that paved the way for the bombings, the worst incident of violence since the country’s 26-year civil war ended in May 2009.

Constitutional changes initiated by Mr. Rajapaksa’s predecessor, Maithripala Sirisena, reduced presidential powers and gave them to the Parliament and to independent commissions.

The change virtually created two political power centers — the President and the Prime Minister, with the PM in charge of Parliament and government Ministers.

27,2020/03/03,Peace deal with Taliban is conditions-based agreement: U.S. Defence Secretary,"Noting that the agreement calls for reduction of troops to 8,600 within 135 days, U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper said that he has already given his consent to start the drawdown.

The peace deal signed with the Taliban in Doha over the weekend is a conditions-based agreement, U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper has said, reiterating that this is an important first step towards a political solution to end the war in Afghanistan.

Also read | A big, bad deal: On U.S.-Taliban agreement

After 18 years of war, the U.S. and the Taliban signed the peace deal in Doha on Saturday to facilitate intra-Afghan dialogue in Oslo this month and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Afghanistan in 14 months.

“This was an important first step toward a political solution to end the war in Afghanistan. As I reiterated to our Afghan partners, this is a conditions-based agreement,” Mr. Esper told reporters on his return from Afghanistan.

In an interaction with Pentagon reporters, Mr. Esper said that the U.S. is watching the Taliban’s actions closely to assess whether they are upholding their commitments.

“This agreement was enabled by the tremendous sacrifices our servicemen and women have made over the past 18 plus years,” he said.

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Mark Milley said that a negotiated political settlement is the only responsible way to end the war in Afghanistan, and this was an important step.

“This agreement would not have been possible without the thousands of soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines that have served and sacrificed over the last 18 years. We owe an extraordinary debt of gratitude to America’s sons and daughters who made the ultimate sacrifice and their families, who have given their all to this nation,” he said.

Responding to a question, Mr. Esper said that their expectation is that a reduced level of violence would occur and it would decrease over time as they move forward.

“So, this is going to be a step-by-step process, and we’ll evaluate each day,” he said.

Noting that the agreement calls for reduction of troops to 8,600 within 135 days, Mr. Esper said that he has already given his consent to start the drawdown.

“Our agreement, our commitment under the agreement was to enable, to facilitate the exchange of persons between the Taliban and the government of Afghanistan. And I’ve said over and over, it’s all conditions-based, but we are going to show good faith and begin withdrawing our troops and we can stop that at any moment. We can pause it based on, again, changing circumstances,” Mr. Esper said in response to a question.

The mission, he said, is to make sure Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorists to attack this country.

“We’ve been very successful for the past 18 years for doing that; and then number two, support our Afghan partners in the process; and then number three, again, as we can, bring our troops home, withdraw our presence in the country,” Mr. Esper added.

28,2020/03/03,Trump withdraws nomination of Pentagon official who questioned Ukraine aid freeze,"Withdrawal of McCusker's nomination to be under secretary of defense (comptroller), made in November, was announced by the White House in a statement.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday withdrew the nomination of Elaine McCusker to a senior Pentagon post, after reports that she had questioned the suspension of military aid to Ukraine, a key element in the inquiry leading to Mr. Trump's impeachment.

Withdrawal of McCusker's nomination to be under secretary of defense (comptroller), made in November, was announced by the White House in a statement.

The decision, following the ouster of several other officials who testified in the impeachment inquiry, was criticized by Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

“The termination of her nomination is collateral damage by a President who has vindictively purged career national security professionals caught up in the impeachment inquiry,” Mr. Reed said in a statement.

Mr. Trump was impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives in December. Democrats said Trump held back $391 million in security aid to Ukraine and coveted White House meeting for President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as leverage to force Kiev into interfering in the 2020 election by smearing Democratic candidate Joe Biden.

Mr. Trump, who branded the impeachment effort a witch hunt, was acquitted last month after a trial in the U.S. Senate, where his fellow Republicans have a majority.

Following Mr. Trump's acquittal, the White House moved quickly to oust key officials whose testimony had been seen as hurting his case, including ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and National Security Council staffer Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman.

Mr. Reed said witness testimony and leaked emails between Ms. McCusker and the Office of Management and Budget showed that “McCusker repeatedly raised concerns about the President's unexplained hold on Ukraine security assistance and sought to ensure that the Administration was in compliance with the law.”

Pakistan’s anti-corruption watchdog on Monday filed fresh cases against former Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif and Yousuf Raza Gilani and former President Asif Ali Zardari for misuse of authority and buying vehicles given by foreign leaders as gifts.

The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) filed the cases in an accountability court in Islamabad.

According to NAB, during his tenure as Prime Minister, Mr. Gilani relaxed rules to allow Mr. Zardari and Mr. Sharif to buy expensive vehicles gifted to them by foreign leaders.

As per law, the vehicles were state properties and could not be used for personal purposes.

NAB claimed that Mr. Zardari and Mr. Sharif used dishonest and illegal means and bought the vehicles by paying a “nominal payment of 15% of the total value”.

It said Mr. Zardari made the payments for the vehicles through the Omni Group CEO and his son “for which he has no plausible justification“.

“It was established during investigation that these amounts are in the context of illegitimate laundered proceeds for the benefit of the accused,” the NAB said.

NAB had also named Omni Group CEO Khawaja Anwar Majid and his son Khawaja Abdul Ghani Majid as accused in the case.

Mr. Gilani was also accused of illegally relaxing the rules about the acceptance and disposal of gifts to prime minister and president.

“The accused (Gilani) floated and suppressed the law and the procedure to grant undue concession, and benefits resulting in wrongful loss to the national exchequer,” NAB said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/vszl26/article10259045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gil-01,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistans-anti-corruptionn-watchdog-files-fresh-cases-against-sharif-gilani-zardari-in-money-laundering-case/article30969056.ece
32,2020/03/03,Britain vows ‘hard bargain’ in list of demands for U.S. trade deal,"After leaving the EU in January, Mr. Johnson wants to pursue a trade deal with Washington to put pressure on the bloc in separate talks on a future relationship

Britain on Monday unveiled its mandate for trade talks with the United States, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowing to drive a hard bargain in negotiations that are set to test the two allies’ “special relationship”.

After leaving the European Union in January, Mr. Johnson wants to pursue a trade deal with Washington to try not only to champion Britain’s new independence, but also to put pressure on the bloc in separate talks on a future relationship.

As a negotiating team heads to Brussels to start those discussions, the government set out its mandate for talks with the United States, warning that London would walk away if its demands are not met.

Britain said it wanted to achieve “huge gains” by removing barriers to trade, but that its much-loved National Health Service (NHS) would not be on the table in talks, and that its food standards would be maintained.

That could set the two sides on a collision course, putting additional pressure on a relationship already strained by London’s decision to allow China’s Huawei a limited role in its 5G mobile network, as well as a proposed digital services tax.

“We have the best negotiators in the business and of course, we’re going to drive a hard bargain to boost British industry,” Mr. Johnson said. “Most importantly, this transatlantic trade deal will reflect the unique closeness of our two great nations.”

Jeff Emerson, spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative’s Office, said Washington was reviewing Britain’s negotiating objectives and was looking forward to starting talks.

“The United States remains committed to negotiating an ambitious trade agreement with the United Kingdom that is good for both countries,” he said.

Britain’s mandate hinted London could reconsider its plans to introduce the tax on big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon in April after criticism by Washington.

A spokesman for Mr. Johnson said the government’s policy had not changed, adding that while ministers were working to find a global solution, “we have put forward proposals for a digital services tax”.

The government said its analysis showed a deal with the United States could boost transatlantic trade by 15.3 billion pounds ($19.61 billion) over 15 years and increase the size of the British economy by 0.16%.

The United States is currently Britain’s biggest trading partner after the EU, accounting for nearly 19% of all its exports in 2018 and 11% of imports. By comparison, the EU accounted for 45% of all UK exports and 53% of UK imports.

Scottish salmon for stetson hats

Mr. Johnson, the face of Britain’s campaign to leave the EU, has repeatedly said the ability to strike new trade deals with other countries is a major benefit of Brexit.

But opposition political parties said the modest potential boost to gross domestic product would not make up for the economic hit Britain will take from leaving the EU.

“Today’s analysis is clear: the gains from the best-case trade deal with Donald Trump will not come close to outweighing what we expect to lose from leaving the EU,” said Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for International Trade.

The government said manufacturers of cars, ceramics, food and drinks, and professional services, including architects and lawyers, would be among the biggest winners from the trade deal.

“Trading Scottish smoked salmon for Stetson hats, we will deliver lower prices and more choice for our shoppers,” Mr. Johnson said.

Both sides hope a deal can be reached as soon as this year, but there are many hurdles.

The government reiterated that the NHS was “not for sale” - addressing criticism that a deal could let private U.S. healthcare providers into Britain’s state-funded health system.

It also vowed to uphold high standards on food safety and animal welfare amid fears from farmers that the government will allow U.S.-produced chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef into Britain.

“In a trade deal with the U.S., we will not diminish our food safety standards and we will also not put the NHS on the table,” British trade minister Liz Truss said. “If we don’t get the deal we want we will be prepared to walk away.”

Speaking later to parliament, she said she wanted the two allies to agree quickly to remove retaliatory tariffs on British and American products related to the U.S.-EU aircraft subsidy dispute “to show goodwill”.

Washington’s negotiating objectives, published last year, include pressing for full market access for U.S. pharmaceutical products and medical devices, which would require changes to NHS pricing restrictions and could increase the cost of drugs.

33,2020/03/03,"COVID-19 outbreak will spread, British PM Johnson says","The United Kingdom so far has 40 confirmed novel coronavirus cases

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that Britain must be prepared for the new coronavirus to spread further.

“I think it's very important to stress that this is a problem that is likely to become more significant for this country in the course of the next days and weeks,” Mr. Johnson said.

“We'll be making every possible preparation for that, and this country is very, very well prepared.”

The United Kingdom so far has 40 confirmed novel coronavirus cases. Mr. Johnson said the government would announce its main action plan for the outbreak on Tuesday.

“We've also agreed a plan so that, as and when, if and when, it starts to spread, as I'm afraid it looks likely that it will, we are in a position to take the steps that will be necessary ... to contain the spread of the disease as far as we can,” Mr. Johnson said.

In an interview with the BBC later, Mr. Johnson said the government was ready for the potential economic impact of the virus.

Asked about the possibility of widespread closures of schools, cancellations of major events and lockdowns of large areas, Mr. Johnson said such measures were among the possible range of responses.

“The issue will be when and how and with what logic to deploy them,” he said, adding that at the moment, beyond vigilance in handwashing, “it should be business as usual”.

The Bank of England said it was working with international partners and the finance ministry to ensure “all necessary steps are taken” to offset the economic hit from the virus.

Mr. Johnson's spokesman said British finance minister Rishi Sunak and the Treasury had been in discussions with the Bank Of England about the virus, but that the annual budget statement would go ahead on March 11.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cr85uc/article30958445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BORISJOHNSON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-outbreak-will-spread-british-pm-johnson-says/article30968836.ece
34,2020/03/03,China’s U.N. envoy says Beijing confident it will meet economic goals despite COVID-19 outbreak,"Zhang Jun made the statement at a news conference at the United Nations to mark China’s presidency of the Security Council for March

China’s U.N. ambassador, Zhang Jun, said on Monday that while the coronavirus outbreak has had a “negative impact” on the country’s economy, Beijing was working to revitalize and was confident it would reach its economic goals for 2020.

“Definitely the epidemic, the coronavirus, has caused a negative impact on the Chinese economy,” Zhang told a news conference at the United Nations to mark China’s presidency of the Security Council for March.

“But meanwhile because of the strong resilience, because of the enormous domestic consumption and the domestic market and because of the solid foundation of the Chinese economy, we are very much confident that we are able to realize the goals we have set for this year, the economic goals, the social goals,” Zhang said.

Despite that optimism, China faces a big challenge in getting its economy back on track after the prolonged shutdown caused by the outbreak.

Economists estimate the extreme measures taken by the Chinese government to contain the outbreak mean growth slowed substantially, and may have even contracted in the first quarter.

“We do have confidence about the future of the Chinese economy,” Zhang said.

The virus broke out in China’s Wuhan city late last year and has since infected more than 86,500 people, mostly in China. Outside China, meanwhile, more than 60 countries now have cases, with more than 8,700 infected and more than 100 deaths.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vyjrt9/article30968057.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-OUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinas-un-envoy-says-beijing-confident-it-will-meet-economic-goals-despite-coronavirus-outbreak/article30968058.ece
35,2020/03/03,Trump administration to cut number of employees at Chinese media outlets in U.S.,"Citing a “deepening crackdown” on all forms of independent reporting inside China, administration officials said Beijing's attack on free speech was worse than it was a decade ago

The United States on Monday said it was slashing the number of Chinese employees permitted to work at the U.S. offices of major Chinese state-owned media outlets to retaliate against Beijing for “long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists.”

Citing a “deepening crackdown” on all forms of independent reporting inside China, administration officials said Beijing's attack on free speech was worse than it was a decade ago, comparing it to that of the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.

Effective March 13, Washington will be capping the number of U.S. based employees of Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International and China Daily Distribution Corp to a total of 100, from 160. Beijing's U.N. ambassador said the move was not “appropriate”.

China last month revoked the visas of three Wall Street Journal reporters in Beijing after the newspaper declined to apologize for a column with a headline calling China the “real sick man of Asia”. Another reporter with the paper had to leave last year after China declined to renew his visa.

“For years, the government of the Peoples Republic of China has imposed increasingly harsh surveillance, harassment, and intimidation against American and other foreign journalists operating in China,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.

Monday's decision was not particularly linked to the Wall Street Journal case, senior state Department officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told reporters, neither was it linked to the content these outlets produced.

“We've been imploring the Chinese for years and years now to improve their treatment of journalists in China. So, this is not linked to any one particular incident,” one U.S. official said, but added that the expulsion of Journal reporters was a “fairly egregious” example.

While the U.S. officials said the move was not an expulsion of these Chinese nationals, they acknowledge that the people whose visas are contingent on their ability to work in the United States may be forced to leave the country.

The four outlets were among five designated by the United States as foreign embassies earlier this month, as a first step of this move.

Further action

Tensions between the two superpowers have escalated since President Donald Trump came to office three years ago, with disputes over issues ranging from trade to accusations of Chinese spying in the United States and to U.S. support for Taiwan.

“We have some differences but we do not think it is appropriate for the United States to take steps in interfering with the work of journalists coming from China, China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told a news conference.

On Monday, the Foreign Correspondents Club of China said in a report that the Chinese government has “weaponised” visas as part of a stepped-up campaign of pressure on foreign journalists.

“It is our hope that this action will spur Beijing to adopt a more fair and reciprocal approach to U.S. and other foreign press in China,” Pompeo said, while State Department officials said Washington was ready to take further action if Beijing retaliated.

“If in fact they decide to take this in a further negative direction however of course..all options would be on the table. I can't tell you what in particular we would do, but wed sit down review the circumstances and then consider all of our options,” the official said.

The personnel caps would be placed on the entities as opposed to people hence it would be up to the media outlets to decide the necessary staffing cuts, the officials said.

The United States would also be announcing in near future limits on duration of stay for Chinese citizens, administration officials said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bob1jg/article30968482.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/QATAR-US-AFGHANISTAN-DIPLOMACY-CONFLICT-TALIBAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-administration-to-cut-number-of-employees-at-chinese-media-outlets-in-us/article30968484.ece
36,2020/03/03,COVID-19 | Virus deaths rise to six in Seattle area as U.S. pushes for more testing,"Eight of the 14 total cases in his jurisdiction are linked to an outbreak at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland

Six people in the Seattle area have died of the illness caused by the new coronavirus, health officials said on Monday, as authorities across the United States scrambled to prepare for more infections with the emphasis on increasing testing capacity.

Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for the Seattle and King County Public Health agency, announced the increase in fatalities from the previous two in Washington state.

Eight of the 14 total cases in his jurisdiction are linked to an outbreak at a nursing facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, including four deaths, Duchin said at a news conference.

At least four of the six people who died were either elderly or had underlying health conditions or both, Duchin said.

The total number of cases detected by the public health system in Washington state now stands at 18, the most of any state. In addition to the 14 King County cases, four residents of nearby Snohomish County have tested positive for the virus, officials said.

“We expect the number of cases will continue to increase in the coming days and weeks, and we are taking this situation extremely seriously,” Duchin said.

However, he also said the vast majority of diagnosed patients have mild to moderate disease and do not need hospitalization.

In addition to confirmed cases, King County has about 29 potential cases awaiting test results, so the number there could soon rise, officials said. Tests were being conducted on about 200 samples per day, and health officials said they expect to boost the number of tests to at least 1,000 a day in the near future.

Duchin said his county was not recommending school closures or cancellation of any events at this point.

“You can expect over the next two weeks to hear more from us about community mitigation measures and the right time to do it,” he said. “We can't expect people to go for months and months without going to work, without going to school,” he said.

As of Sunday, the number of confirmed and presumptive cases in the United States had risen to 91, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. Many of those were among people repatriated to the United States, either from the Diamond Princess cruise ship previously quarantined in Japan or from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the global outbreak originated.

The number of presumed cases reported by states but not yet officially confirmed by the CDC stood at 27, up from seven previously. The CDC will confirm the tests sent by states with their own diagnostics. So far, 10 states, including California and New York, have confirmed or presumed cases.

Test kits

U.S. stock markets briefly pared gains following the announcement of an increase in fatalities but closed higher - the S&P 500 by 4.6%, the Dow Jones by 5% and the NASDAQ by 4.5%. World stock markets had a weeklong slide last week on coronavirus fears.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo welcomed a CDC decision allowing New York to test for the virus that has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide since it emerged in China in December.

“I would like to have a goal of 1,000-tests-per-day capacity within one week because, again, the more testing, the better,” Cuomo said at a briefing on Monday.

Federal health officials have said the number of test kits for coronavirus would be radically expanded in coming weeks. The United States appeared poised for a spike in cases, partly because there would be more testing to confirm infections.

Protective gear and test kits were being distributed to U.S. military facilities with a priority on distribution to the Korean Peninsula, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army General Mark Milley, said at a briefing.

South Korea is one of the hardest hit countries with 4,335 cases and 26 deaths.

U.S. government military laboratories were working to develop a vaccine, Milley said.

President Donald Trump said his administration has asked pharmaceutical companies to accelerate work on the development of a coronavirus vaccine, but provided no details.

Top U.S. health officials have said any vaccine is up to 18 months away and there is no treatment for the respiratory disease, although patients can receive supportive care.

Trump and his task force on the outbreak were meeting with drug company executives on Monday afternoon. U.S. health Secretary Alex Azar said the administration is working on supply chain challenges for pharmaceutical companies in response to coronavirus as many active ingredients come from China.

The White House is also expected to meet this week with top executives from U.S. airlines and the cruise industry over the impact of the virus to their businesses, two people briefed on the matter said.

There have been more than 87,000 cases worldwide and nearly 3,000 deaths in 60 countries, the World Health Organization said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ye5ri4/article30967654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIRUSOUTBREAKUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-virus-deaths-rise-to-six-in-seattle-area-as-us-pushes-for-more-testing/article30967655.ece
37,2020/03/03,"Syrian government forces re-enter strategic town, Turkey vows to keep up strikes","Turkey and Russia, which have come closer than ever to direct confrontation in Syria in recent days, traded threats over air space after Turkish forces shot down two Syrian government warplanes

Syrian government forces entered parts of a strategic rebel-held town on Monday, and Turkey said it would keep hitting President Bashar al-Assad’s troops after ramping up operations in its biggest intervention yet into the Syrian civil war.

Turkey and Russia, which have come closer than ever to direct confrontation in Syria in recent days, traded threats over air space after Turkish forces shot down two Syrian government warplanes and struck a military airport.

Fighting has escalated dramatically in recent days in northwest Syria, where Turkey has sent thousands of troops and military vehicles in the last month to counter Syrian government forces’ advances in the last remaining bastion held by rebels.

A million people have been displaced since December near Turkey’s southern border, causing what the United Nations says may be the worst humanitarian crisis in nine years of war.

A Syrian state television correspondent in the town of Saraqeb said the army was combing the town after the retreat of Turkey-backed rebels. Rebel sources said clashes were continuing in western parts of the town. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor group said rebels were trying to regain control.

Saraqeb has already changed hands twice in less than a month, reflecting its importance as a gateway to the government-controlled northern city of Aleppo and to rebel-held Idlib city to the west.

Rebels said Turkish drones had been striking Syrian army positions on the Saraqeb frontline, hitting at least two rocket launchers. Turkey’s Defence Ministry said one of its soldiers was killed and another wounded in shelling by Syrian government forces in Idlib on Monday.

Turkey, which has backed rebels fighting Assad for much of Syria’s nine-year civil war, stepped up its intervention in response to the killing of 34 Turkish soldiers in Idlib last week, the deadliest strike against the Turkish army in decades.

On Sunday it shot down two Syrian planes in Idlib and struck at least one military airport in Aleppo province, taking the battle deep into territory controlled by forces loyal to Assad.

“The (Syrian) regime’s human and equipment losses are just the beginning,” Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech in Ankara. “If they do not withdraw to the borders Turkey has determined as soon as possible, they will not have a head left on their shoulders.”

Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Turkish forces had so far destroyed eight helicopters, scores of tanks and five air defence systems.

Russia, for its part, said it could not guarantee the safety of Turkish aircraft over Syria, and Damascus said it was closing Syrian air space over the Idlib region.

Hopes for Putin talks

Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin are due to meet in Moscow on Thursday to seek agreement on Idlib.

“We will go to Moscow to evaluate these developments with Mr. Putin. My hope is that we take the necessary steps there, whether it is a ceasefire or any other steps needed,” Erdogan said.

Turkey has insisted it seeks no conflict with Moscow, but its barrage of strikes on the Russian-backed forces around Idlib have raised the risk of a direct confrontation.

“A solution is expected to emerge from the talks but attacks and attempts which the (Syrian) regime carries out in this period will not go unanswered,” a senior Turkish security official told Reuters.

Backed by Turkish shelling and drone strikes, rebels say they have now retaken several villages that they lost last week in the Syrian government offensive.

Erdogan demanded in early February that Syrian forces withdraw by the end of the month from a “de-escalation zone” around Idlib agreed by Turkey, Russia and Iran in 2017, or face being driven back by the Turkish military.

“The (Syrian) regime will be forced to leave the de-escalation zone before the Putin-Erdogan meeting,” a senior Syrian opposition source said.

Already hosting 3.6 million Syrian refugees, Ankara is determined to prevent any further influx of migrants from Syria.

Turkey opened its western borders on Friday to let migrants reach Europe, in an apparent move to demand EU support in Syria by repudiating a 2016 agreement to shut the frontier.

The European Union’s chief executive, Ursula von der Leyen, expressed sympathy with Turkey over the conflict in Syria, but said sending migrants to Europe cannot be the answer.

Turkey had shut the border in return for EU funds under a 2016 deal to end a crisis in which more than a million people entered Europe and 4,000 drowned in the Aegean Sea. On Monday, a child died after being pulled from the sea when a boat capsized off the Greek island of Lesbos, Greek officials said, the first reported fatality since Turkey re-opened its border last week.

Two Turkish security sources told Reuters a Syrian migrant also died from injuries on Monday after Greek security forces acted to stop migrants entering Greece by land. Athens denied the incident.

More than 1,000 migrants have arrived by sea on Greek islands since Sunday and more than 10,000 have attempted to cross by land at the border, where guards from both sides have fired tear gas into crowds caught in no-man’s land.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/d07fzw/article30967539.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SYRIA-TURKEY-CONFLICT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/syrian-government-forces-re-enter-strategic-town-turkey-vows-to-keep-up-strikes/article30967540.ece
38,2020/03/03,"Netanyahu set to declare narrow victory in Israeli election, says party spokesman","A win for Mr. Netanyahu, after inconclusive ballots in April and September, would be testimony to the political durability of Israel's longest-serving leader

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu planned to declare victory in Israel's election on Monday, a spokesman for his party said, after television exit polls showed him just a seat short of a governing majority in parliament.

A win for Mr. Netanyahu, after inconclusive ballots in April and September, would be testimony to the political durability of Israel's longest-serving leader, who fought the latest campaign under the shadow of a looming corruption trial.

It would also pave the way for Mr. Netanyahu to make good on his pledge to annex, after the election, Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, and the region's Jordan Valley, under a peace plan presented by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Palestinians have rejected the proposal, saying it was killing their dream of establishing a viable state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

A spokesman for Mr. Netanyahu's right-wing Likud said the prime minister would deliver a victory speech at the party's election headquarters in Tel Aviv at 2145 GMT.

Israel's three main TV channels projected Likud and like-minded parties would capture 60 of parliament's 120-seats, just one short of a majority.

“A giant victory for Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu, 70, tweeted after the projections were released.

During the campaign, right-wing and religious parties had pledged to join a Likud-led coalition government. But if the 60-seat projection held true, after actual results on Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu would still have to enlist other allies in coalition negotiations.

A Likud spokesman said that after the exit polls were released Mr. Netanyahu telephoned the leaders of parties that have already partnered with Likud and “they agreed to form a strong, national government in Israel soon.”

There was no immediate reaction from Mr. Netanyahu's main challenger, former armed forces chief Benny Gantz of the centrist Blue and White party.

The exit polls showed Likud taking between 36 and 37 parliamentary seats to 32 or 33 for Blue and White - a gap that would make it far harder for Mr. Gantz to find a path to putting together a governing coalition.

Security first

Mr. Netanyahu campaigned vigorously on his strongman ”security-first” platform that Israeli voters have become familiar with over decades, and his loyal base has stood firmly behind him throughout, seemingly unfazed by his imminent trial.

“While we need to wait for the final results, there is no doubt that Prime Minister Netanyahu has won a significant political mandate from the Israeli people,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute. ”Israelis voiced their support for the man they perceive to have brought them security and prosperity,” he said.

Mr. Netanyahu's re-election bid has been complicated since the last election by his indictment on charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud over allegations he granted state favours worth millions of dollars to Israeli media barons in return for favourable press coverage and that he wrongfully received gifts.

The first trial of a sitting prime minister in Israel is due to begin on March 17. Mr. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.

During the campaign, Mr. Gantz termed Mr. Netanyahu “the defendant” and has accused him of seeking to retain power to promote legislation that would bar authorities from putting a serving prime minister on trial.

Mr. Netanyahu has portrayed Mr. Gantz, 60, as a “coward”, saying he would need Arab politicians' support in parliament to form a government and that they would tie his hands.

In the final days of the campaign, opinion polls had forecast further deadlock, but turnout was high despite concerns about the spread of the new coronavirus.

40,2020/03/03,U.S. Supreme Court takes up Democratic bid to defend Obamacare,"The Court's decision to intervene means the fate of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) will be up in the air during the ongoing presidential race

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a politically explosive case on whether Obamacare is lawful, taking up a bid by 20 Democratic-led states including California and New York to preserve the landmark healthcare law.

The impetus for the Supreme Court case was a 2018 ruling by a federal judge in Texas that Obamacare as currently structured in light of a key Republican-backed change made by Congress violates the U.S. Constitution and is invalid in its entirety. The ruling came in a legal challenge to the law by Texas and 17 other conservative states backed by President Donald Trump's administration.

The Supreme Court's decision to intervene means the fate of the law formally called the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the signature domestic policy achievement of former Democratic President Barack Obama, will be up in the air during the ongoing presidential race.

The court is expected to hear arguments and decide the case in its next term, which starts in October and ends in June 2021, meaning a ruling is not likely before the Nov. 3 election in which Mr. Trump is seeking a second term in office.

“As Texas and the Trump administration fight to disrupt our healthcare system and the coverage that millions rely upon, we look forward to making our case in defense of the ACA. American lives depend upon it,” said California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat who is leading the defense of the law.

Other leading Democrats including House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi welcomed the court's decision to intervene.

“The sooner the GOP's dangerous anti-healthcare lawsuit is ended, the better,” Ms. Pelosi said, using shorthand for the Republican Party.

The coalition of Democratic-led states have asked the Supreme Court to overturn a Dec. 18 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that declared that the law's “individual mandate” that required people to obtain health insurance ran afoul of the Constitution. The 5th Circuit ruling, which did not resolve the question of whether the law should be struck down entirely, came in an appeal of U.S. District Court Judge Reed O'Connor's prior ruling that the entire law must fall.

“Without the individual mandate, the entire law becomes unsupportable. The federal government cannot order private citizens to purchase subpar insurance that they don't want, and I look forward to finally settling the matter before the U.S. Supreme Court,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican.

Mr. Trump has said he supports a prohibition on private insurance companies denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions — a provision contained in Obamacare — even as his administration has urged courts to invalidate it.

Chief justice in the spotlight

The Supreme Court has a 5-4 conservative majority that includes two justices appointed by Mr. Trump. In 2012, it ruled 5-4 to uphold Obamacare. All five justices in the majority in that case — four liberals and conservative Chief Justice John Roberts — remain on the court. For the law to be struck down this time, Roberts likely would have to reverse course and join the other conservatives.

Obamacare has helped roughly 20 million Americans obtain medical insurance either through government programs or through policies from private insurers made available in Obamacare marketplaces. Republican opponents have called the law an unwarranted intervention by government in health insurance markets.

The law was signed by Obama in 2010 over strenuous Republican opposition.

In the lawsuit led by Texas, O'Connor ruled that the entire law was unconstitutional. The 5th Circuit, while agreeing with O'Connor about the individual mandate, sent the case back to him for reconsideration on whether any parts of Obamacare could be salvaged. The Supreme Court will now decide the issue.

In the 2012 case, the Supreme Court upheld most Obamacare provisions including the individual mandate, which required people to obtain insurance or pay a financial penalty. The court defined this penalty as a tax and thus found the law permissible under the Constitution's provision empowering Congress to levy taxes.

In 2017, Mr. Trump signed into law tax legislation passed by a Republican-led Congress that eliminated the financial penalty under the individual mandate, which gave rise to the Republican lawsuit. The tax law meant the individual mandate could no longer be interpreted as a tax provision and is therefore unlawful, the Republican challengers argued.

Trump's administration supported the legal challenge although it has suggested that not all Obamacare provisions need to be struck down. The administration had urged the Supreme Court not to take up the appeal because the 5th Circuit decision was not final.

Mr. Trump's efforts to persuade Congress to repeal Obamacare have failed even when his fellow Republicans controlled both the House and Senate. His administration has not said what it would replace Obamacare with.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/x2352i/article30966530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OBAMACAREWHATSINANAME,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-supreme-court-takes-up-democratic-bid-to-defend-obamacare/article30966531.ece
41,2020/03/03,Taliban rule out taking part in Afghan talks until prisoners freed,"The statement came as a reduction of violence period came to an end, and the Taliban said a resumption of operations against Afghan government forces could now take place

Taliban militants will not take part in intra-Afghan talks until the Afghan government releases about 5,000 of their prisoners, a spokesman said on Monday, presenting a major possible barrier to ending the war.

The statement came as a reduction of violence period came to an end, and the Taliban said a resumption of operations against Afghan government forces could now take place.

Under an accord between the United States and the Islamist Taliban signed on Saturday, the two sides are committed to working towards the release of combat and political prisoners as a confidence-building measure.

The agreement calls for up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners to be freed in exchange for up to 1,000 Afghan government captives by March 10. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, not involved in the talks, has rejected that demand.

“We are fully ready for the intra-Afghan talks, but we are waiting for the release of our 5,000 prisoners,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.

“If our 5,000 prisoners — 100 or 200 more or less does not matter — do not get released there will be no intra-Afghan talks.”

Also Read Return to chaos in Afghanistan?

The United States has said that after more than 18 years of war, it hopes negotiations towards a permanent political settlement and ceasefire can start in coming days, but Western diplomats and analysts see stark challenges ahead.

Mr. Ghani said on Sunday U.S. President Donald Trump had not asked for prisoner releases and that this issue should be tackled as part of a comprehensive peace deal.

“The Afghan government has not made any commitment to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners before the start of any potential negotiation,” Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Mr. Ghani, said in response to the Taliban's statements on Monday.

Also Read Taliban says will resume operations against Afghan forces

A joint U.S.-Afghan government statement says the Kabul government will take part in discussions on the “feasibility of releasing significant numbers of prisoners on both sides” but does not mention the specific number or time frame.

U.S.-led forces ousted the hardline Islamist militants from power in 2001.

Reduced-violence period ends

The Taliban's Mujahid said a deal on a reduction in violence in the seven days leading up to Saturday's pact had formally ended.

“As we are receiving reports that people are enjoying the reduction in violence, we don't want to spoil their happiness, but it does not mean that we will not take our normal military activities back to the level that we were before,” he said.

“It could be any time, it could be after an hour, tonight, tomorrow or the day after.”

Two Taliban leaders who declined to be named said the group had initially decided to extend the reduction in violence period for two days beyond Saturday. At a meeting on Monday, the Taliban decided the arrangement would continue to apply to U.S. forces but would end for Afghan government forces, they said.

Also Read A deal that increases uncertainty

A senior NATO defence source told Reuters that the reduction of violence period was indeed technically over, meaning technically the Taliban could attack Afghan forces.

But U.S. General Scott Miller, commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, said that the United States expected the Taliban to ”be very serious” about their obligations.

“The reduction in violence was a confidence builder...The United States has been very clear about our expectations - the violence must remain low,” he said in a tweet.

An explosion at a football field in Afghanistan's southeastern province of Khost killed at least three civilians and injured 11 on Monday, the interior ministry said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Mujahid issued a statement denying any Taliban involvement.

The Afghan war has been in stalemate for more than 18 years, with Taliban forces controlling or contesting more territory yet unable to capture and hold major urban centres.

A full withdrawal of all U.S. and coalition forces would occur within 14 months, a joint statement said.

42,2020/03/03,With love to Bangalore,"Jazz musician, Radha Thomas, speaks of her album Bangalore Blues, where seven tracks has her take on the city

Bangalore Blues is the latest album by Jazz vocalist and author Radha Thomas who is all set for the release. It all started in 2011 as a Google search for Radha who was looking for a piano player and found Aman Mahajan just two streets away in Cox Town. “A match made in musical heaven” she says as they have since been working together, composing and playing much music across India and Europe. While their music is rooted firmly in jazz, there are definite strains of India in the songs. But Radha, who grew up mostly in a boarding school in Panchgani, joined a rock and roll band and later lived in New York.

Radha Thomas spoke more with Metroplus about the making of her album.

Is your album Bangalore Blues a melancholic tribute to the city?

The album didn't happen overnight. Aman (Mahajan) and me, have been writing and trying to perfect the music for almost ten years. It's only now that we felt ready to make an album. It's called ‘Bangalore Blues’ because that's the title track. This is a song I wrote a while ago, when I wasn't in this city, and missing it a lot. I was feeling all nostalgic about Bangalore. The song got completed after I met Aman and he added his magic to it.

The album is not so much an ode to Bangalore as it is a just a statement of fact. I think that missing Bangalore and writing a sad song about that is very different to living in the city and facing day-to-day issues.

We have another song called ‘Load Shedding,’ which is all about the power cuts in town. So it's not all rosy. Sometimes it's black and candle lit. We have a video for this song, actually shot entirely in candlelight by this gifted film maker, Sharath Holla. https://youtu.be/PMo6jDg5TEQ

Could you talk about the process of creating the album?

I wrote all the lyrics to all the songs. Two of the melodies were composed by Aman, ‘Leifmotif’ and ‘Load Shedding.’ All the others were mine, but with huge inputs from Aman in terms of chords and arrangements and so on. It's a very collaborative effort. Aman and I tend to get the same ideas almost simultaneously.

Could you describe the songs?

‘The Morning After’ with Indian melodic influences and a jazz treatment, describes the after effects of a night with super-sized gin and tonics with a girlfriend in lower Manhattan. ‘Jailer’ is a waltzy song that talks about a terrible experience that I had years ago. Rather than tackling the abuser, it was happier writing songs about it. ‘Would I Lie for you’ is a funky tune used with a typical Mridangam korvai to suit lyrics. The Indian influence is evident, but the treatment is neo jazz.

‘Leifmotif’ a delicate composition by Aman is in seven beats for the most part. The origins of this song are in raag Yaman but with many jazz substitutions. ‘Only Illusion’ has syncopating rhythms and changing time-feel...a meditative song of love and longing. The piano work is almost classical in nature. ‘Bangalore Blues’ talks of a snowy winter’s day in New York, when I longed for jacaranda trees and greenness of home.

What made you bring in artist Paul Fernandes to do the artwork for your album and video?

Paul Fernandes is a chronicler of Bangalore an he has a quaint, ironic and witty way of capturing this city in his art. He is really quite astonishing. I asked him if he would let me use his art for my album and to my utter joy he said yes. Not only that, we decided to use many of his artworks for a video for the title track.

After training in Hindustani how did you find the shift to Jazz cope with your timbre?

I studied Hindustani music a long time ago. And even then, I was already in a rock and roll band. I took lessons to help me sing better and also to be able to incorporate the improv techniques with my own singing.

Your huge break in the 70s is after you joined the rock ‘n’ roll band, Human Bondage?

I was auditioned by a very serious organisation called Jazz India when I was about 18 and singing at Chin Lung Restaurant in Bangalore. They said if they liked my singing, they would help my career - if they didn't like me, I was out of luck. I guess I was good enough, because they paved the way for me to New York to meet some amazing musicians and perform and get myself a little experience.

The musical duo

Aman Mahajan says Radha and he have worked together for almost a decade now, playing all kinds of music together with many different groups, focussing mostly on jazz standards and original music. What sets Bangalore Blues apart he says is “a collaboration in the truest and most basic sense – a completely stripped-down piano-voice duo version of songs by the two of us.”",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/6drnoa/article30972738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25bgm-jazzradha2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/bangalore-blues-radha-thomas-aman-mahajan/article30972740.ece

45,2020/03/03,Cement industry capacity utilisation to moderate,"Sustainability of demand revival key to support price hike: ICRA Ratings

The domestic cement industry’s capacity utilisation is likely to moderate in FY20 to sub-70% levels, says ICRA Ratings.

The demand revival trend witnessed in recent months is likely to continue in the fourth quarter of FY20. However, sustainability of the same is critical to support the increase in prices, it added.

According to the rating agency, the cement demand growth is expected to remain flat in FY20 against the decade high growth of 13% witnessed in the previous year.

This growth along with expected higher capacity additions at 20-22 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in FY20/FY21 (17 MTPA in FY19) is likely to result in moderation of industry’s capacity utilisation in the current fiscal.

“The incremental/new supplies are not fully integrated and most of it is backed by old limestone mining leases. Also, given that the grinding capacity addition is higher in relation to the clinker capacities for these new units, the actual production from new capacities could be lower,” said Anupama Reddy, assistant vice-president, ICRA Ratings.

“The eastern region is expected to lead the expansion and is likely to add around 15-19 MTPA during FY20-FY21. Increase in capacities with no commensurate increase in demand would result in a decline in utilisation rate to 68% in FY20 from 71% in the previous fiscal,” she added.

In the nine months of current fiscal, the production, at 247.4 million tonnes, was marginally higher by 0.7% compared with the corresponding year-ago period. The production has been increasing on an month-on-month basis from September 2019. A double-digit growth in cement demand of 11.8% was witnessed in December 2019, ICRA said.

At the pan-India level, the prices in most markets were higher in ten months of FY20 compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. In the Mumbai and Hyderabad markets, the prices were higher by 7-8% and in Delhi, around 20-25% was witnessed in December 2019. The prices witnessed some increase in the range of ₹5-20/bag across regions in January-February 2020.

“There has been some demand revival in November – December 2019 and as per our channel checks, the trend is likely to continue in Q4 FY20. The sustainability of this is critical to support the recent increase in the cement prices,” she said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cement-industry-capacity-utilisation-to-moderate/article30975515.ece

The domestic sales turned positive after several months due to network expansion, combined with sustained brand and marketing initiatives.

At the same time, exports posted a contraction of 8%, after impressive growth in January, although export volumes were still above 2,000 units.

During February, Royal Enfield sold over 61,000 bikes in the domestic market compared to 60,066 units. It exported 2,348 motorcycles against 2,564 units.

Reliance Capital has defaulted on term loans of Axis Bank and HDFC Ltd. as on January 31, the company informed the exchanges.

Reliance Capital (an NBFC) has defaulted on interest payment of ₹4.76 crore to HDFC Ltd. and ₹0.71 crore to Axis Bank.

The total principal amount for HDFC Ltd. was ₹523.98 crore with the rate for interest at 10.6-13% while the principal for Axis Bank was ₹100.63 crore at 8.25%.

Reliance Capital said the default was due to a Delhi High Court order that placed a restriction on the sale of assets belonging to the company.

“… delay in debt servicing is due to prohibition on the company to dispose off, alienate, encumber either directly or indirectly or otherwise part with the possession of any assets pursuant to order dated November 20, 2019 passed by the Delhi High Court,” Reliance Capital said.

“Further, pursuant to the proceedings initiated by Vistra ITCL (India) Ltd., the Debt Recovery Tribunal has also prohibited the company from transferring, alienating, encumbering or otherwise parting with the possession of assets owned by the company,” it added.

Reliance Capital said the total outstanding borrowing from banks and financial institutions was ₹641.74 crore which including accrued interest upto January 31, 2020.

48,2020/03/03,Sensex regains on hopes of global booster dose,"‘G7 meeting will be keenly watched’

After seven straight sessions of losses, Indian equity indices gained ground on Tuesday on the back of a global rally as investor sentiment improved over hopes of global coordinated measures to address the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.

The 30-share Sensex gained 479.68 points, or 1.26%, to close at 38,623.70. The broader Nifty ended at 11,303.30, gaining 170.55 points or 1.53%. “After witnessing a trending fall in the last seven days, the market rebounded today but not before exhibiting volatility in intraday trades,” said Shrikant Chouhan, senior V-P, Equity Technical Research, Kotak Securities.

“Volatility at the bottom of the fall means the market is starting to form a short term bottom. The G7 meeting and its outcome would be a keenly watched event. If the result is good then it will be good for the equity markets,” Mr. Chouhan added.

Incidentally, a joint statement from G7 nations issued after the close of Asian markets did not suggest any concrete steps to address the growing economic fallout of coronavirus pandemic.

Elsewhere in Asia, the benchmarks of China, Indonesia, Taiwan and South Korea all gained ground even as the overnight Dow Jones registered one of its biggest single day gain of nearly 1,300 points.

49,2020/03/03,AM/NS India acquires Bhander plant,"ArcelorMittal is preferred bidder for Odisha’s Thakurani iron ore mine

AM/NS India, a JV between ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel, has acquired the 500 MW Bhander Power Plant at Hazira in Gujarat from Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Company.

The natural gas-based thermal power plant will be captive for AM/NS India’s steel manufacturing operations at Hazira.

Bhander, which was commissioned in 2006 and commenced commercial operations in 2008, was acquired by AM/NS India under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act. Earlier this month, ArcelorMittal Indiaemerged the preferred bidder for an iron ore mine licence in Odisha in an auction by the State government.

Thakurani block in the district of Keonjhar, with estimated reserves of 179.26 million tonnes, is expected to make a valuable contribution to AM/NS India’s long-term raw material requirements, according to the company.

Dilip Oommen, CEO, AM/NS India, said: “We are pleased to have acquired these important ancillary assets for our steel-making facilities. This is in line with an intent to secure a robust captive power and commodity supply chain as we continue to make strong strides in our production and operational performance. Efforts to become increasingly self-reliant, in this case through the procurement of a key energy source in Gujarat and an iron ore rich reserve in Odisha, form part of AM/NS India’s medium to long-term strategy to significantly grow our production capacity in India.”

On conclusion of the licence award process, AMIPL will proceed to seek requisite clearances, as well as mine development and production agreements, ahead of commencing mining operations.

The Supreme Court has set aside the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (NCLAT) order against the approval of Dhanuka Laboratories’ resolution plan for the debt-ridden Chennai-based Orchid Pharma.

The SC order in the case filed by the State Bank of India paves the way for the takeover of Orchid by Dhanuka Laboratories, whose resolution plan was approved by the Chennai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in June 2019.

Orchid informed the exchanges about the apex court’s order on Tuesday.

The SC’s division bench comprising Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman and Justice S. Ravindra Bhat said NCLAT’s order had to be set aside in view of a recent judgment, where it was categorically held that no provision in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code or regulations have been brought to the court’s notice under which the bid by any resolution applicant has to match the liquidation value arrived at in the manner provided in the relevant regulations.

“Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the judgment of the NCLAT is set aside,” the order said. Orchid Pharma owes about ₹3,200 crore to a total of 24 banks.

51,2020/03/03,Rupee in free fall on COVID-19 fears; RBI soothes markets,"Ready to take action, says central bank

The rupee fell for the third consecutive session on Tuesday on concerns over the deadly COVID-19 spreading in India amid the central bank stepping in to calm investor sentiment.

The rupee dropped below the 73-a-dollar level even as the equity markets bounced back, snapping a seven-day losing streak.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stepped in to issue a statement saying the central bank was closely monitoring the situation and stood ready to take appropriate action.

The central bank acknowledged that the spillover of the global financial market turmoil in India had been largely contained as there were hopes of coordinated policy action.

Spillover contained

“Globally, financial markets have been experiencing considerable volatility, with the spread of the coronavirus triggering risk-off sentiments and flights to safe haven. Spillovers to financial markets in India have largely been contained. Growing hopes of coordinated policy action to mitigate a broader fallout to economic activity have boosted market sentiment today,” the RBI said.

“The Reserve Bank of India is monitoring global and domestic developments closely and continuously and stands ready to take appropriate actions to ensure orderly functioning of financial markets, maintain market confidence and preserve financial stability,” it added.

The rupee opened stronger at 72.45 a dollar compared to its previous close of 72.76, but weakened after reports of the COVID-19 spreading in India.

A school in Noida was reportedly shut down after a student’s parent tested positive for COVID-19. The Indian currency ended the day at 73.23, down 0.65% from its previous close — a 16-month low.

The spread of the virus, the impact of which is expected to be higher than that of the SARS outbreak in 2003, is likely to affect global trade. The IMF has lowered global GDP growth projections by 10 basis points to 3.2% in 2020.

Impact on exports

Since India and China are major trading partners, a sharp hit to their exports and imports is likely.

“Slowdown in economic activity in China is likely to weigh on exports from India. China’s economic growth is likely to moderate to below 6% in 2020,” said Abheek Barua, chief economist, HDFC Bank.

“Export of commodities like ores (India exports 72% of its total ores to China), organic chemicals, cotton, etc. is likely to get hit should the disruption from the COVID-19 continue for an extended period,” Mr. Barua said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/e0jjv1/article30975427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04BURBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rupee-in-free-fall-on-covid-19-fears-rbi-soothes-markets/article30975428.ece

The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an appeal challenging the grant of bail to former Union Minister Swami Chinmayanand in a sexual exploitation case lodged by a law student.

A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and Navin Sinha found no reason to “warrant interference” in the High Court decision of February 3.

“The high Court was monitoring the investigation. Police protection is being provided to the complainant in a substantial manner. Every aspect has been included in the chargesheet. Now, when charges have to be framed, law will take its course,” Justice Sinha observed orally.

The court agreed however to hear a separate plea filed by the woman and her father seeking transfer of the trial from Uttar Pradesh to a court in Delhi.

The court refused to stay the proceedings before a trial court in Uttar Pradesh. It nevertheless issued notices to the State, Chinmayanand and others on the transfer petition. They have to file their replies within a month.

The Centre on Tuesday said it was in discussion with States that had expressed concerns about the updation of the National Population Register (NPR) from April 1 to September 30.

Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai told the Lok Sabha that no document would be collected during the exercise, which would be carried out along with the house-listing phase of Census 2021.

“The government is in discussion with the States having concerns in regard to the preparation of NPR,” Mr. Rai said. “The demographic and other particulars of each family and individual are to be updated/collected during the exercise of updation of NPR. No document is to be collected during this exercise,” he added, while replying to a written question.

Punjab, Kerala, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh are some of the non-BJP ruled States that have expressed apprehensions about the proposed new format of the NPR and are critical of the exercise. The Union Cabinet has approved an outlay of ₹3,941.35 crore for the NPR exercise.

The “pretest” or the trial NPR form collected details from 30 lakh respondents last year on 21 parameters and sought specific details on the “place of birth of father and mother, last place of residence” along with other information like Aadhaar particulars (optional), voter ID card, mobile phone and driving license numbers. The new NPR form, for the first time, is also expected to collect information on a respondent’s “mother tongue.” In 2010 and 2015, the NPR collected details on 14 parameters.

59,2020/03/03,"Government pulls up Twitter, Facebook over Delhi riots","The Ministry of Home Affairs convened a meeting of social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp on Tuesday.

The Centre on Tuesday pulled up representatives of social media platforms including Twitter and Facebook for not blocking objectionable content, hate messages and videos flagged by the police during the communal riots in northeast Delhi last week. The representatives were also warned of legal action for not complying with requests from law enforcement agencies, a senior government official said.

A wave of communal violence convulsed northeast Delhi between February 23-25, in which as many as 48 people were killed. The death toll is likely to go up.

The Ministry of Home Affairs convened a meeting of social media platforms including Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp on Tuesday.

“The representatives of the social media platforms were told that they cannot take an unusually long time to pull down content and accounts that incite communal tensions and are inflammatory,” said a senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “There were several accounts that were peddling false information,” the official added.

While government officials assert that social media aggravated the violence, several local residents have complained that the police did not come to their help despite repeated calls to the police control room.

On Tuesday, Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai informed the Lok Sabha in a written reply that “a close watch is being kept on social media platforms which may disseminate rumours and unfounded propaganda.” Mr. Rai also said that “investigating officers are collecting CCTV footage and seeking out videos from public to bring the guilty to book” and prohibitory orders under Section 144 CrPC were being implemented in riot affected areas.

“There are legal provisions under which action can be taken against the social media platforms for not complying with requests of police and other law enforcement agencies,” said the official. “The courts can take a decision,” the official added.

Asked about the meeting, a Twitter spokesperson said, “Twitter remains committed to working with governments around the world, including in India, to encourage healthy behaviour on the service. We appreciate the importance of the work being undertaken by the Ministry of Home Affairs and we thank them for their inclusive engagement.”

A representative of one of the social media platforms, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the company would work closely with the police and help in amplifying their messages aimed at dispelling rumours.

Delhi Police has registered 21 FIRs against various social media accounts operating on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for posting “provocative content.”

“Several social media accounts and web links involved in circulation of unlawful offensive content were suspended and removed through concerned platforms,” a police official said, declining to be identified.

63,2020/03/03,"Centre yet to notify CVC, CIC appointments","No official order even two weeks after selection; Cong. leader cites conflict of interest in choice of vigilance chief

Two weeks after a high-power committee (HPC), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, selected the new Chief Vigilance Commissioner (CVC) and the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC), the Centre is yet to officially notify the appointments.

Also read | Scrap Sanjay Kothari appointment as CVC as process is vitiated, says Congress

A day after the selection panel had selected Sanjay Kothari, currently Secretary to the President of India, as the next CVC, the Congress on February 19 demanded that the appointment be scrapped “alleging violation of laid-down procedure”.

A senior official of the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) — the nodal Ministry that handles government postings — told The Hindu that the delay was due to the process of getting a replacement for Mr. Kothari and not because of objections raised by the Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, a member of the HPC.

Other appointees including CIC designate Bimal Julka have been sent a letter from the DoPT Ministry, officially informing them of the government’s decision.

But the date of their taking charge has not been fixed in the absence of the notification, the DoPT official said.

Though there is no rethink by the government on the appointments, the delay could be linked to fresh objections raised by Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury in a letter to the Prime Minister in which he cited conflict of interest against the CVC designate.

Chowdhury’s letter

In his letter of February 20, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said: “Gross violation of power and misutilisation of opportunity has been observed in getting self-appointment of CVC by the Secretary to the Honourable President of India. The self-appointment, therefore, seems to be highly irregular, immoral and unjustified.”

In a separate note attached to the February 20 letter, Mr. Chowdhury explained that Sanjay Kothari could be vetting his own appointment before President Ram Nath Kovind gives his approval.

“The Secretary to the present President is Sh. Sanjay Kothari. However, he has been appointed by the President as the CVC which is a Constitutional post. If one goes by the procedure in vogue in appointment of the CVC by the President, it looks strange that the secretary to the President got himself appointed as CVC? Is there no conflict of interest as it is seen that the same secretary to President processed the file for his own appointment as the CVC and got it approved from the President of India,” Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury’s note reads.

The Congress, sources said, has not ruled out the option of approaching the courts once the CVC appointment gets officially notified but a final view is yet to be taken, a senior party source said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lcn7hj/article30864407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KOTHARI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/centre-yet-to-notify-cvc-cic-appointments/article30975140.ece
64,2020/03/03,Parliament comes to a stand still after ruckus over Delhi riots,"Opposition pressed for debate in both Houses on Delhi riots

Proceedings in both Houses of Parliament were disrupted for the second day on Tuesday over the Opposition’s insistence on a discussion on the Delhi riots, with the Lok Sabha once again witnessing unruly scenes between Opposition and ruling party members.

Also read | Parliament proceedings: Budget Session-part II, Day 2 as it happened

The uproar was triggered when Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, after the Lok Sabha met again at 2 p.m., stated that the House would debate the Delhi riots on March 11, after Holi.

‘After Holi’

“We are working for the benefit of the country. Keeping in mind the situation in the country, celebrate Holi festival in peace and harmony ...Government is ready to discuss the issue after Holi on March 11,” he said, which prompted Opposition members to storm into the Well to press for an immediate discussion.

In the midst of loud sloganeering, when Mr. Birla allowed Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to move a financial Bill, tempers rose as MPs were seen crossing the Well.

Also read | Parliament stalls as Opposition wants Amit Shah out

Even though Mr. Birla warned members from both Opposition and Treasury benches during the uproar that he would suspend them if they crossed over to the other side, it failed to restore order.

Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury walked over to the side of the Treasury benches, which led to a commotion between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Opposition members.

Commotion ensues

Other Opposition MPs too followed Mr. Chowdhury and a commotion ensued as BJP members blocked their way. Locket Chatterjee, BJP MP from West Bengal, was seen having an animated argument with the Congress members when Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad stepped in to pacify them.

Amid a jostle between BJP and Congress members, when some Opposition members banged a partition door near the Lok Sabha Secretary General’s desk, the Speaker adjourned the House for the day.

Even after the adjournment, Union Minister Smriti Irani was seen engaged in a heated argument with Opposition members over the banging of the partition door, with other BJP members trying to calm her down.

Earlier in the day, the Opposition’s demand for an immediate discussion led to two disruptions, with the entire first half of the session getting washed out. As soon as the House met at 11 a.m., members from the Congress, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Trinamool Congress and other Opposition parties were on their feet, demanding an immediate discussion on the Delhi riots.

Not heeded

The Speaker as well as the Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi told the Opposition members that they could raise the issue during Zero Hour, but Mr. Joshi made it clear that the government would want “peace and normalcy restored in the affected areas” before having a discussion on the floor of the House.

DMK leader T. R. Baalu said the government was yet to respond on the issue in Parliament, while Mr. Chowdhury demanded an immediate discussion. Referring to an all-party meeting, the Speaker reminded the House that members had agreed they would not cross over to the other side and not bring in placards. When the protesting MPs did not pay heed to Mr. Birla’s direction of returning to their seats, and displayed placards, an angry Speaker adjourned the House.

“There is already a Holi of blood in north-east Delhi and bodies are still being fished out. This government is running away from a discussion as it is responsible,” Mr. Chowdhury told reporters outside.

Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singh called called the government’s argument — wait for normalcy to return — a “spurious” one.

In Rajya Sabha

In the Business Advisory Committee meeting held on Tuesday morning led by Rajya Sabha Chairperson Venkaiah Naidu, Opposition parties told the government in no uncertain terms that they would not let the Parliament function till a structured discussion on the Delhi riots took place.

The Rajya Sabha saw multiple adjournments, with the first one coming within three minutes of its convening. When Minister of State Anurag Thakur stood up to lay the papers from his Ministry, Opposition members started jeering him. Many Opposition members were heard shouting “goli maaro” in a reference to Mr. Thakur’s comments at a public rally during the campaign for the Delhi Assembly elections. Mr. Naidu said that no slogan would go on record. “You don’t want any business to be transacted, you don’t want any discussion, any zero hour mention — five of you stand and argue with me,” he said.

In the post lunch session, though the Rajya Sabha Chair finally conceded to the Opposition’s demand to hold a discussion on the Delhi riots, Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh informed the House that Chairman Naidu would have to take a call on the timing of the discussion, and adjourned the proceedings after Telangana Rashtra Samithi MP K. Keshava Rao said the House should be adjourned to send a “message” that the “first concern was the people”.

‘It will be odd’

Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad reiterated, “The whole world is discussing the incidents and if the Parliament of India does not, then it will be odd.”

While Leader of the House Thawarchand Gehlot said the government was “ready for a discussion”, Trinamool’s Parliamentary party leader Derek O’ Brien told reporters that the Opposition is hopeful the discussion would happen on Wednesday.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/v5hstb/article30975111.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THPARLIAMENTARYPROCEEDINGS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-comes-to-a-stand-still-after-ruckus-over-delhi-riots/article30975112.ece
65,2020/03/03,Supreme Court to hear plea on violence against doctors,"It seeks to make such cases a penal offence

The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear in the last week of March a petition seeking to make violence committed against doctors and medical personnel and establishments a separate penal offence.

Senior advocate K. Subramanian, appearing for the petitioner, pointed out that while the Union Health Ministry is reported to have finalised a draft Bill, there was delay due to some interdepartmental consultation with the Ministry of Home Affairs.

“I therefore request an early date so that the Bill can be introduced during the ongoing session of Parliament,” Mr. Subramanian said.

The petition was filed by Dr. S. Gurushankar, president of the Tamil Nadu chapter of the Association of Healthcare Providers (India).

It said police hardly swing into action to prevent incidents of violence against the the medical community. “Unless such attacks are checked, there will be serious repercussions on patient care,” it added.It has sought action against perpetrators indulging in violence against medical professionals, medicare service providers, and causing damage to clinical establishments.

‘Serious repercussions’

The petition said police hardly swing into action to prevent incidents of violence against, or the protection of, the medical community.

The medical fraternity has become demoralised by the increasing numbers of attacks on them. This is one of the reasons why doctors avoid serving in rural areas.

“Unless such attacks are checked, there will be serious repercussions on patient care,” the petition said.

The petition has pointed out that small and medium private healthcare establishments form the bulwark of the healthcare sector. The Prevention of Violence Against Medicare Persons and Institutions Act, which has been notified in 19 States in the past ten years, has failed to address the issue, the petition said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/uvkqo3/article18029081.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THDOCTORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-on-violence-against-doctors/article30975059.ece

Ms. Deo has lodged a formal complaint with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla.

On Monday, Ms. Haridas had complained of assault by women MPs of the BJP, including Jaskaur Meena, who, in turn, had said she was trying to defend herself against aggressive behaviour from the Opposition benches.

Ms. Haridas and Ms. Meena also filed complaints with Mr. Birla.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi also made a move to have a resolution moved against Congress MPs Gaurav Gogoi, Ramya Haridas and Ravneet Bittu.

As many as 2,593 officials of Public Sector Banks (PSBs) were facing trial on various charges as on January 31, the Ministry of Finance told Parliament.

Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha, the Ministry said in January itself, 11 cases had been registered and six officials were punished/convicted.

Last year, 136 cases were registered and 143 officials were found guilty. As per the government data, 2,633 officials were under trial as on January 31, 2019.

The Central Bureau of Investigation had sought sanction for prosecution in respect of 801 PSB officials and staff, which included Presidential appointees, in 2017, 2018 and 2019 and up to January 2020.

The agency reported that requests for sanction in respect of 139 accused officials during this period had been declined. “In cases where sanction is declined, the advice is tendered in consultation with the Central Vigilance Commission,” said the Ministry.

The Ministry said several measures had been taken to combat corruption in the PSBs. “Board-approved loan policies of PSBs now mandate tying up necessary clearances/approvals and linkages before disbursement, scrutiny of group balance-sheet and ring-fencing of cash flows, non-fund and tail risk appraisal in project financing,” it said.

“Use of third-party data sources for comprehensive due diligence across data sources has been instituted, thus mitigating risk on account of misrepresentation or fraud.

68,2020/03/03,Black carbon levels spike at Himalayan glaciers,"Being a pristine zone far from sources of pollution, the measurements are critical to establishing a baseline for pollution loads

Black carbon concentrations near the Gangotri glacier rose 400 times in summer due to forest fires and stubble burning from agricultural waste, and triggered glacial melt, says a study by scientists at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology (WIHG).

Also read | Water crisis looms large in Himalayan regions, finds study

The team of scientists from WIHG, led by P.S. Negi, measured variations of black carbon concentration at Chirbasa, near the Gangotri glacier in the Indian Himalaya, and located at an altitude of 3,600 metres, during the year 2016. “The monthly mean concentration of EBC (equivalent black carbon) was found to be minimum in August and maximum in the month of May. The observed seasonal mean concentrations of EBC indicated a pristine glacial source and an absence of EBC sources in the locality,” an accompanying press statement noted.

Second largest contributor

Black carbon results from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and biomass. The fine particles absorb light and about a million times more energy than carbon dioxide. It is said to be the second largest contributor to climate change after CO2. But unlike CO2, which can stay in the atmosphere for years together, black carbon is short-lived and remains in the atmosphere only for days to weeks before it descends as rain or snow.

The concentration varied from a minimum of 0.01μg/cubic metre in winter to 4.62μg/cubic metre during summer. Being a pristine zone far from sources of pollution, the measurements are critical to establishing a baseline for pollution loads and estimating the contribution of various sources to pollution.

Second largest emitter

India is the second largest emitter of black carbon in the world, with emissions expected to increase dramatically in the coming decades, says an April 2019 study in the journal Atmospheric Research, with the Indo Gangetic plains said to be the largest contributor.

Black carbon absorbs solar energy and warms the atmosphere.

The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has written to the Ministry of Railways to take into consideration not only tiger-bearing areas but also tiger corridors while planning infrastructure projects.

NTCA member secretary Anup Kumar Nayak in a letter to chairperson Railway Board, Vinod Kumar Yadav said in addition to the tiger reserves, the NTCA has already mapped out 32 major reserves at the macro level, which are available in the public domain and uploaded on its website.

The letter, sent earlier this year under the subject, “Promoting efficient, smart and green rail infrastructure and minimising its impacts on biodiversity/ecosystem functions in tiger landscapes” highlights that there are “tiger corridors delineated in adjoining areas as part of the Tiger Conservation Plans (TCPs) of the tiger reserves”.

Pointing out that there are 50 tiger reserves in 18 tiger-range States with a coverage of 7,2749. 20 sq. km. ( 2.21 % of the country geographical area), the NTCA said for infrastructure development the statutory role of the NTCA has been outlined under various Sections of the Wildlife (Protection ) Act, 1972.

“Therefore, it is kindly requested to inform the railway authorities to take into consideration the above-mentioned tiger-bearing areas, while planning for the development of green infrastructure projects for promoting/development of green rail infrastructures,” the letter said.

As per the information made public by the NTCA, three tiger corridors are located in the Shivalik Hills and the Gangetic plain landscape, 11 in the central Indian and eastern ghat landscape, eight in the western ghat and 10 in the northeastern landscape.

Mr. Nayak told The Hindu: “It is not that railways are not taking any steps. But there has been deaths of tigers due to existing railway tracks,” he said.

Mr. Nayak pointed out that most run over deaths have been reported in Maharashtra where there are large number of tigers outside the reserves and tigers travel long distance to adjoining Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Chhattisgarh.

Two private schools in Noida were shut on Tuesday for the next few days and several persons, including family members of the individual from Delhi who tested positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), have been quarantined or kept in isolation as authorities stepped up prevention efforts including extending suspension of existing regular and e-visas to nationals of Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan who have not yet entered India.

On February 4, India had cancelled the existing visas for Chinese nationals and foreigners who had visited the neighbouring country in the preceding two-week period, following the COVID-19 outbreak, which has now spread to over 60 countries and claimed over 3,100 lives. Over 90,000 have been infected.

Data | Is COVID-19 spreading faster outside mainland China?

Officials said the sample of an Italian tourist in Jaipur, which was sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, was found to be positive after the first two tests gave contradictory results. The 69-year-old man, part of a group of 20 tourists, is admitted to an isolation ward in Sawai Man Singh Government Hospital.

With this, six cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the country so far.

As concerns over the spread of the virus mounted after two more persons tested positive on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held an extensive review on the preparedness. He urged people not to panic and to take basic protective measures.

The Civil Aviation Ministry, too, conducted a meeting with all the airports to review and update guidelines.

Delhi case

Sources said the patient from Mayur Vihar in Delhi, who had travelled to Italy recently, was shifted to a quarantine ward at Safdarjung Hospital on Sunday night.

One school in Noida, in the outskirts of Delhi, said it would remain shut from March 4 to March 6, while another said it would be closed till Saturday. Board exams would not be affected, messages sent by the schools to the parents said.

Explained | Why is COVID-19 not a pandemic yet?

This follows reports that the individual who tested positive has a child studying in one of the schools and that some children had met family members for a party on Friday. Samples from five students from the school have been taken to check for the virus, Noida’s Chief Medical Officer Anurag Bhargava said.

Fumigation was also underway in both the schools and a Health Department team led by Mr. Bhargava visited the site, an official said.

Agra on alert

While some family members of the individual and others who came in contact with him were asked to remain quarantined at their homes in Delhi and Agra, six others from Agra with “high-viral load” have been kept in isolation at the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi and their samples sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, officials said.

Contact tracing of the persons who had come into contact with these six persons was also simultaneously being done through the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) network, officials added.

Hotels and the authorities at tourist sites in Agra have been told to inform the office of the Chief Medical Officer as soon as visitors from Italy, Iran or China arrive, so that they can be screened for the infection, Agra Chief Medical Officer Dr. Mukesh Vats said.

The other patient who tested positive for the COVID-19 infection, a 24-year-old software engineer , has been admitted to a hospital in Hyderabad and had recently travelled to Dubai and Bengaluru.

Karnataka Health Minister B. Sriramulu said a medical team is monitoring the health condition of all those people who had come in contact with the software engineer.

“It has come to our knowledge that the coronavirus-hit person in Hyderabad had gone from Bengaluru. Therefore, all the members in the house where he had stayed have been identified and are under watch,” Mr. Sriramulu tweeted on late Monday night.

The software engineer had worked with persons from Hong Kong in Dubai last month where he is suspected to have contracted the virus, Telangana Health Minister E. Rajender told the media in Hyderabad.

The individual had reached Bengaluru on February 19-20 and later went to Hyderabad in a bus. He had been treated for a fever after coming to Hyderabad and was admitted to a private super speciality hospital in the city. When it did not subside, he came to the State-run Gandhi hospital on Sunday evening, Mr. Rajender said.

India had earlier reported three cases from Kerala, including two medical students from Wuhan in China, the epicentre of the deadly virus. All three individuals have recovered.

Regular visas/ e-visas

The Union Health Ministry on Tuesday said all regular visas/e-visas granted on or before March 3 to nationals from Italy, Iran, South Korea, Japan, who have not yet entered India, stand suspended in view of the emerging global scenarios with regard to the virus.

Visa on arrival (VoA) issued on or before March 3 to Japanese and South Korean nationals, who have not yet entered India, have also been suspended.

It also said diplomats, officials of the United Nations and other international bodies, OCI cardholders and aircrew from the above countries were exempted from such restriction on entry, although medical screening was compulsory.

“Passengers of all international flights entering into India from any port are required to furnish duly filled self-declaration form [including personal particulars i.e. phone no. and address in India] and travel history, to health officials and immigration officials at all ports.

“Passengers [foreign and Indian] other than those restricted, arriving directly or indirectly from China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan must undergo medical screening at port of entry,” it said.

The Ministry said all previous advisories stand superseded in view of the fresh instructions.

It also asked all Indian citizens to refrain from travelling to China, Iran, South Korea, Italy and asked them to avoid non-essential travel to other countries affected by the virus.

The Ministry also said India was in discussions with authorities in Iran and Italy, two countries affected badly by the infection, to evacuate the Indian nationals there.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi said a review had been undertaken to asses the level of preparedness for the virus. “Had an extensive review regarding preparedness on the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus. Different ministries and states are working together, from screening people arriving in India to providing prompt medical attention,” the Prime Minister said in a tweet.

“There is no need to panic. We need to work together, take small yet important measures to ensure self-protection,” he said, while also sharing a Health Ministry post.

Meanwhile in Lucknow, samples of an Uttar Pradesh resident who had returned from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday morning have been sent for testing. He will be quarantined for 14 days in the hospital, according to Chief Medical Officer Dr. Narendra Agarwal.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the detection of fresh coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in India, saying he should quit wasting India’s time “playing the clown” with his social media accounts when India is facing an emergency.

Mr. Gandhi’s attack came after India on Monday reported two new cases of the novel coronavirus, including one from the national capital.

“Dear @PMOIndia, Quit wasting India’s time playing the clown with your social media accounts, when India is facing an emergency. Focus the attention of every Indian on taking on the Corona virus challenge,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted.

With the message of “Here’s how it’s done”, Mr. Gandhi also tweeted a video of Singorean PM Lee Hsien Loong addressing Singaporeans on how to deal with coronavirus.

Mr. Gandhi’s tweet also took a dig on PM Modi’s tweet that he was thinking of giving up his social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube this Sunday.

On Tuesday, Mr. Modi said on Women’s Day he will be handing over his social media accounts to women who inspire and urged people to share stories of such women with him.

Earlier, Mr. Gandhi said a “true leader” would be completely focussed on averting the massive crisis about to be unleashed by the potentially deadly virus on the country and its economy.

“There are moments in the life of every nation when its leaders are tested. A true leader would be completely focussed on averting the massive crisis about to be unleashed by the virus on India and its economy,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted.

He also tagged his February 12 tweet in which he said the coronavirus is an extremely serious threat to “our people and our economy”.

“My sense is the government is not taking this threat seriously. Timely action is critical,” he said.

73,2020/03/03,COVID-19: India restricts drug exports as threat of coronavirus rises,"The outbreak of coronavirus has shut factories in China and impacted supplies, leading to fears of a shortage of drugs and medicines.

India, the world’s largest maker of generic drugs, on March 3 restricted the export of common medicines such as paracetamol and 25 other pharmaceutical ingredients and drugs made from them, as it looks to prevent shortages amid concerns of the coronavirus outbreak turning into a pandemic.

Besides over-the-counter painkiller and fever reducer paracetamol, drugs restricted for exports included common antibiotics metronidazole, and those used to treat bacterial and other infections as well as vitamin B1 and B12 ingredients.

A notification by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) said the export of 26 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and formulations would require licence.

Though India is a source of about 20% of the world’s generic drug supply, pharma companies in the country are dependent on China for two-thirds of the chemical components needed to make them.

The outbreak of coronavirus has shut factories in China and impacted supplies, leading to fears of a shortage of drugs and medicines.

“Export of specified APIs and formulations made from these APIs is hereby restricted with immediate effect and till further orders,” the DGFT said in the notification.

While three new cases of coronavirus were reported in India on Monday, “high viral load” was detected in six people who had been in contact with a coronavirus-infected patient. Since its outbreak in China, the deadly virus has killed more than 3,000 people globally.

The government issued a travel advisory suspending all regular visas/e-visas granted on or before March 3 to nationals of Italy, Iran, South Korea, Japan who have not yet entered India. Earlier, there were no restrictions on outbound shipments of the 26 drugs.

India’s API imports stand at around $3.5 billion per year, and around 70%, or $2.5 billion, come from China.

API is the raw material for pharmaceutical.

Although India is heavily import-dependent for APIs from China, it exports a limited quantity of pharma ingredients.

India exported APIs worth about $225 million last year.

Restrictions on the exports are important as there would be an increase in demand for these products in the country.

Apart from paracetamol, vitamin B1, B6 and B12, other APIs and formulations over which the export restrictions have been imposed include tinidazole, metronidazole, acyclovir, progesterone, chloramphenicol, ornidazole, formulations made of chloramphenicol, clindamycin salts, neomycin, and paracetamol.

In February, the Department of Pharmaceuticals (DoP) asked the DGFT to issue orders restricting the export of 12 APIs and formulations in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

A high-level committee formed by the DoP under the Chemicals and Fertilizers Ministry to monitor the supply of raw materials for drugs from China had recommended the restrictions.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/osk7s6/article30973337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-DRUGS-SOUTHKOREA-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-restricts-drug-exports-as-threat-of-coronavirus-rises/article30973338.ece

76,2020/03/03,Defence Ministry withdraws disability pension order,"The directive comes after a circular against tax exemption on disability pension for veterans

The Ministry of Defence on Tuesday directed the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (PCDA) to stop deducting tax on disability pensions of veterans and withdraw the contentious circular issued to that effect.

“In view of the directions of the Supreme Court, PCDA(P), Allahabad may be advised to issue a circular to Pension Disbursing Agencies not to make recovery of income tax on disability pension as per CBDT circular No. 210… dated February 20, 2020, till a final decision is taken by the Supreme Court in the matter,” the ministry said in an order. The order was issued with the approval of Secretary (Defence Finance).

The PCDA, Allahabad had issued a circular, dated February 20, for “necessary action” on a Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) June notification, which said tax exemption on disability pension would be available only to armed forces personnel who had been invalidated from service and not to personnel who had been retired on superannuation or otherwise.

Acting on the PCDA circular, the State Bank of India had at the end of last week debited tax at source for the entire financial year from the February pension of veterans receiving disability pension as a result of which several pensioners received as little as ₹100 in their accounts.

However, the Supreme Court, which is hearing the matter, had in its order dated August 30, 2019, directed all parties to maintain ‘status quo’ on the matter. “The PCDA order is a contempt of Court as there is a stay on the issue,” said a defence official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

I-T Department didn’t oppose exemption

Even the Income Tax Department, in its affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court in December 2019, had not opposed tax exemption on disability pension for veterans, defence officials said.

“Rather the affidavit was supporting disability pensioners and said the intention was not to withdraw any tax exemption from disability pensioners but to only clarify that such exemption is not available to personnel who superannuate and thereafter develop a disability,” another defence official, who declined to be identified, said.

In its submission to the apex xourt, the I-T department had also submitted that it “fully understands that the health of military personnel is effected by hostile conditions and separation from family and they have not passed any instructions for deduction of income tax,” the official added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/equmlm/article30955478.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGLOKSABHAELECTIONKARNATAKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/defence-ministry-directs-pcda-to-withdraw-contentious-disability-pension-order/article30972957.ece
77,2020/03/03,"COVID-19 | The SARS-CoV-2 is mutating, say scientists","We’re aiming at getting a better understanding of the virus, they say.

Even as the world is grappling to contain the COVID-19 epidemic spreading like a wildfire across the world with more than 3,000 deaths and over 90,000 cases across 76 countries, senior scientists at Australia’s national science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), have said the virus dubbed SARS-CoV-2 is mutating.

A top scientist at CSIRO, Professor S.S. Vasan, who leads the CSIRO Dangerous Pathogens and the virus preclinical research has said: “We have analysed the 115 published genome sequences from the current COVID-19 outbreak to understand how changes in the virus affect its behaviour and impact.”

Also Read Pope Francis tests negative for COVID-19, says Italy report

“Some of these ‘errors’ in the virus known as ‘mutations’ may be significant for the development and evaluation of new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines, so it is very important for us to understand it. We are also investigating the physical and molecular characterisation of this virus to find differences and similarities with other known coronaviruses,” he said.

The Hindu Group’s Business Line revealed on February 3 that the global Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), backed by the Indian government’s Department of Biotechnology, is working with the CSIRO to establish animal models to test vaccine candidates. It seems that this research has succeeded in the initial phase.

According to Prof. Vasan, CSIRO is in the process of testing new potential vaccines for the epidemic which has emerged as the single biggest threat to the world economy amidst plummeting stock markets as the virus is marching to new geographies.

“We’ve grown the virus for our research and have also reconfirmed the genomic sequence published by the Peter Doherty Institute. We have got promising results with our initial susceptibility studies and are in the process of conducting natural disease progression studies,” he said.

Also Read All about COVID-19

“Next we’re aiming to get a better understanding of the virus, so CSIRO can begin testing new potential vaccines and therapeutics being developed for efficacy.”

Associate Professor Denis Bauer, who leads the CSIRO Transformational Bioinformatics Group, has said: “Finding the difference amongst 30,000 letters of the viral genome is not an easy task, akin to finding a needle in a haystack. The CSIRO has adapted bioinformatics algorithms, first developed for the human genome, to tackle the problem efficiently.”

“However, this only gives us a picture of the general genomic variability rather than the individual functional consequences. For example, it is very likely that disease severity is a combination of personal predispositions as well as viral properties,” she said.

The CSIRO team is calling on the international community to share more genomic sequences of the virus alongside de-identified information about clinical symptoms and co-morbidities. This will help monitor the changes and form a better understanding of how important genetic differences are to the disease’s progression, potentially leading to better diagnostics and treatment, they have said in a news release.

The COVID-19 is already estimated by the Asian Development Bank to result in $100 billion in global economic losses based on a comparison with the 2003 SARS outbreak.

According to Prof. Vasan, potential loss of tourism revenues due to a severe epidemic outbreak could be substantial.

Experts and scientists believe that there are over 500 coronaviruses identified in bats, but their true number may be 10 times higher, according to the WHO.

Due to a combination of factors, they can jump from their natural host (usually bats but not always) to humans via intermediate host, but not all human coronaviruses cause severe disease.

For instance, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E caused only mild symptoms, whereas SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the current SARS-CoV-2 are associated with relatively severe symptoms.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/wmedvf/article30972997.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03IN-DISEASE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/covid-19-mutation-significant-for-development-of-diagnostics-and-vaccines-say-scientists/article30972925.ece

84,2020/03/03,Defence Ministry simplifies aerial photography rules,"New paperless system developed by Defence Ministry came into force from March 1 and hopes to cut down delays, bringing in efficiency.

Obtaining defence and regulatory permissions for aerial photography or remote sensing surveys has become simpler, with the government launching a web portal for quicker permissions and transparency.

The new paperless system developed by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) came into force from March 1 and hopes to cut down delays, bringing in efficiency.

Currently aerial photography and surveys are done for establishing everything from encroachments around the Dal Lake in Srinagar to ensuring reliable power supply to residents in Delhi and mapping of several mineral mines in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana.

Aerial surveys are being regularly proposed by various government agencies, autonomous bodies for developmental projects and also by private agencies or individuals for private purposes.

As per the existing procedure, applications for grant of No Objection Certificate (NoC) for aerial photography/surveys received by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) are forwarded to various stakeholders of Single Point Clearance Committee (SPCC) under the MoD for their recommendations. Bases on the inputs of the authorities concerned, the Ministry decides upon grant/refusal of NoC.

“Done typically using aeroplanes, helicopters and UAVs/drones, aerial surveys help provide information on many things that are not visible from the ground and are much sought after by both the government and private agencies besides individuals”, a senior DGCA official said.

Geomatics method

The aerial survey is a geomatics method of collecting information by using aerial photography, LiDAR (using laser lighting) or from remote sensing imagery using other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum such as infrared, gamma or ultraviolet.

It can also refer to the Area of Interest (AoI) identified on the basis of Latitude /Longitude nodes, chart or map made by analysing a region from the air.

85,2020/03/03,PM Modi to hand over his social media accounts to 'inspiring women' on March 8,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke the overnight suspense about his announcement that he would consider giving up his social media accounts on March 8, by tweeting that he would hand over his accounts to “inspiring women”.

March 8 is international Women’s Day.

This is the first time the Prime Minister would be giving access to his social media accounts for such a campaign.

This put to rest feverish speculation all of Monday night after Mr. Modi’s announcement that he is considering renouncing his social media accounts. Speculations ranged from this being a curtain- raiser for an India specific “Weibo” like platform to a social media detox campaign after a rash of dangerous rumours that swirled during the riots in Delhi.

The government has lined up a series of events to mark international Women’s Day, including commemorating women members of India’s Constituent Assembly, telecast of 14 women-oriented films on Doordarshan, a special programme by chef Sanjeev Kapoor, and a round-table on women empowerment.

88,2020/03/03,U.N. rights body to move Supreme Court on Citizenship Amendment Act,"MEA says the world body has no right to file plea.

In an unprecedented and rare move, the Geneva-based Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has announced that it plans to file an application in the Indian Supreme Court, asking to be impleaded in the petitions challenging the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

And the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said the United Nations body had no right to file a petition that will ask the court to appoint the Commissioner for Human Rights as an assistant or ‘amicus curiae’ in the case.

Watch | All about the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019

The OHCHR plan has been criticised by diplomatic and legal experts here, including one of the 22 petitioners in the case, as an “overreach” by it.

“The High Commissioner [Michelle Bachelet] intends to submit an ‘amicus curiae’ brief shortly on the Citizenship [Amendment] Act [CAA] in the Indian Supreme Court, in accordance with the Court’s established procedures, and she has informed the Indian Permanent Mission in Geneva of her intention,” Rupert Colville, OHCHR spokesperson based in Geneva, confirmed to The Hindu.

“The amicus curiae will focus on providing an overview of relevant and applicable international human rights standards and norms to support the Court’s deliberations in the context of its review of the CAA,” the spokesperson said.

Last week, Ms. Bachelet informed the Human Rights Council that the UN body had “great concerns over the CAA”. She had also met with MEA Secretary (West) Vikas Swarup, who had travelled to Geneva to represent India at the 43rd session of the Human Rights Council last Thursday. On Monday, the Indian Mission in Geneva was formally informed of the OHCHR’s plans to file the petition.

‘Internal matter’

MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said on Tuesday, “The Citizenship Amendment Act is an internal matter of India and concerns the sovereign right of the Indian Parliament to make laws. We strongly believe that no foreign party has any locus standi on issues pertaining to India’s sovereignty. We are confident that our sound and legally sustainable position would be vindicated by the Honourable Supreme Court”.

Former Solicitor-General Mohan Parasaran said that in his opinion, the U.N. official could not be impleaded on international law in a domestic matter. “The CAA has to be tested on the touchstone of the Indian Constitution and not some U.N. Convention. If such interventions as 'amicus curiae' are allowed, it will set a wrong precedent,” he observed.

Last month, a Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde took “note” of a plea made by a U.N. Special Rapporteur in a case related to the rights of Rohingya refugees, but forwarded it to the government for a response without ruling on it.

Former Indian Foreign Service officer Deb Mukherji, who is a petitioner in the original case filed in December, said the U.N. move would not change their case against the CAA. “I am not aware that international bodies can implead themselves in our courts, that is for the honourable Supreme Court to decide. We have been waiting for weeks to be heard, and hope our petition will be taken up soon,” he told The Hindu.

Former External Affairs Minister K. Natwar Singh described the U.N. rights body's move as “absolutely unprecedented in the diplomatic history of India”.

Agreeing, former envoy to the U.N. Chinmaya Gharekhan said the move was “objectionable”, as the U.N. was an inter-governmental body and “they are not supposed to approach the Supreme Court of India.""

In her address to the Human Rights Council on February 27, Ms. Bachelet expressed “great concern” over the CAA.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday stressed that peace, harmony and unity of society were the prerequisites for the country’s ‘vikas’ (development) and the BJP MPs should take the lead in ensuring them.

Mr. Modi was addressing the MPs at a parliamentary party meeting for the first time in the second part of the Budget session and after the riots in north-east Delhi last week that claimed over 40 lives.

Sources present at the meeting said Mr. Modi also took potshots at the Opposition, which had been highly critical of the government’s handling of the riots and the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Mr. Modi noted that while “political interests were supreme” for “some parties”, for the BJP, national interest was above everything, a senior party MP said.

An officially released transcript of Prime Minister Modi’s speech said: “I feel sad when I see some parties hesitating to chant Bharat Mata ki Jai [Hail Mother India]. They look at it [Bharat Mata Ki Jai] with suspicion, as though there was a strange odour emanating from it. Given all this BJP must keep to its principles of keeping national interest upper most.”

The mention of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” was a riposte to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s speech on February 22 at a book launch that the chant connoted a “militant idea of India”, the sources said.

Sending out a stern message, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Tuesday said members from Opposition and Treasury Benches who cross over to the other side during the time of uproar in the House will be suspended for the session.

Mr. Birla’s announcement in the House came a day after some Congress and BJP members pushed and shoved each other in the House as tempers rose over the issue of violence in Delhi.

Opposition members sought to raise the issue of Delhi violence as soon as the Speaker decided to take up the Question Hour.

Citing earlier discussions among various parties, the Speaker said it was decided that howsoever serious the issue is, the same can be raised during the Zero Hour.

There should be cooperation among members so that the House can function well.

Referring to an all-party meeting, Mr. Birla said he is giving a ruling that any member who crosses over to the other side during proceedings would be suspended from attending the House for the remaining session.

Such action would be taken against members from Treasury as well as Opposition sides, he said.

Opposition members, including from Congress, DMK, TMC and other parties, wanted a discussion on Delhi violence. DMK’s T R Baalu said the government is yet to respond on the issue in Parliament while Congress leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury demanded an immediate discussion.

Amid the uproar, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said the Opposition can raise the matter during the Zero Hour.

Emphasising that “restoration of peace and normalcy” is the topmost priority, Joshi said, “charcha keliye taiyyar hai (we are ready for a discussion)“.

However, Opposition members were not satisfied and demanded that there should be an immediate discussion.

In response, Mr. Joshi said the Speaker should decide.

Later, Mr. Birla also said that placards would not be allowed in the House, triggering protests from the Opposition side.

A visibly peeved Speaker wanted to know from the agitating members whether they wanted that placards should be allowed in the House.

“Does it work that way?,” Mr. Birla asked agitating members and amid the ruckus, adjourned the House till noon.

As soon as the House convened, many ruling party members shouted ‘Vande Mataram’

93,2020/03/03,Punjab CM promises to protect Sukhna lake,"Advocate General to examine HC order declaring Chandigarh water body as living entity

A day after the Punjab and Haryana High Court declared Chandigarh’s Sukhna lake as a living entity, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has asked Advocate General Atul Nanda to examine, in detail, the High Court order with respect to constructions in the area around Sukhna lake.

The Chief Minister on Tuesday told journalists that his government had received a copy of the judgment today and the Advocate General would examine it and make his recommendations.

“The State government will take whatever decisions, legislative or judicial, needed to resolve the issue. We stand by the people and will do everything to protect their interests,” he said in response to a question here.

States fined

The court directed Punjab and Haryana to pay ₹100 crore each as exemplary, punitive, special damages for restoration of the catchment area of Sukhna lake falling in their respective areas. This amount shall be deposited with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

The Bench of Justices Rajiv Sharma and Harinder Singh Sidhu also ordered the demolition of all the structures in Sukhna’s catchment area.

The court orders have come in a suo motu petition of 2009 initiated over problems of silt in the lake, which has resulted in its drying up.

In its order on March 2, the court observed that “...the acts of the States of Punjab, Haryana have caused permanent damage to the catchment area of Sukhna lake. It was expected from the State agencies to foresee that the permanent structures in a catchment area would impede the flow of water in Sukhna lake”.

‘Enormous damage’

“The States should have taken precautionary measures to save the catchment of Sukhna lake. It is the duty of the States of Punjab and Haryana to restore the catchment area. The State government has also failed to take precautionary measures to save the catchment area. The damage caused to the catchment area is enormous. The State is bound to pay exemplary-penal damages under the doctrine of ‘Polluter Pays’,” read the order.

It added: “The officers-officials of the States of Punjab and Haryana, instead of protecting-conserving-saving the catchment area, have permitted raising of permanent structures in this area. Since immense damage has been caused to the catchment area of Sukhna lake, at least ₹200 crore would be required to restore the catchment area.”

The court also declared Sukhna as a living entity. “We, by invoking our parens patriae jurisdiction, declare Sukhna lake as legal entity-legal person-juristic person-juridicial person-moral person-artificial person for its survival, preservation and conservation having distinct persona with corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a living person. All the citizens of Union Territory, Chandigarh, are hereby declared as loco parentis as the human face to save Sukhna lake from extinction,” read the order.

‘Illegal, unauthorised’

The court also declared all commercial, residential and/or other structures constructed in the catchment area falling in the areas of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, as delineated in the map prepared by the Survey of India on 21.9.2004, as illegal and unauthorised, and ordered them to be demolished within three months.

Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh have also been directed to provide alternative sites to the owners whose building maps were approved and who have constructed their buildings in the catchment area, for their rehabilitation after the demolition of their houses. The States and UT shall also pay compensation of ₹25 lakh uniformly to these owners.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/ro188x/article26407790.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03SMSUKHNALAKE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hc-declares-chandigarhs-sukhna-lake-living-entity-fines-punjab-haryana-100-cr-each-for-damaging-catchment-area/article30969711.ece

The Jammu Municipal Corporation (JMC) is on a name-changing spree in Jammu city — resolutions have been passed to rename the Jammu Airport and the Jammu University after Hindu Dogra monarchs Maharaja Hari Singh and Maharaja Gulab Singh, respectively.

“Two proposals [to rename Jammu Airport and Jammu University] were passed with full majority during the general house meeting,” Councillor Narotam Sharma said.

BJP in majority

At least two meetings of the JMC’s general house were held last week by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-affiliated councillors to change names of streets and buildings in Jammu. The BJP has a majority of 43 Councillors in the 75-member Municipality.

The resolutions have paved the way for calling the airport Maharaja Hari Singh Jammu Airport and the local university as the Maharaja Gulab Singh Jammu University. “People should know their history and the contribution of the Dogra rulers to J&K,” Mr. Sharma added.

Maharaja Gulab Singh founded the Dogra dynasty and became first monarch of J&K in 1846. Maharaja Hari Singh was the last Dogra monarch, who acceded to India in 1947.

Chowks renamed

Meanwhile, the JMC has already renamed Jammu’s historic City Chowk as Bharat Mata Chowk and the Kachi Chawni Chowk as Atal Bihari Vajpayee Chowk. A bust of the late Prime Minister will be installed at the roundabout soon, according to a JMC proposal.

The name-changing comes at a time when the BJP is facing criticism from the Dogra community over the party’s failure to secure domicile laws on land use and job reservations for locals after the revocation of Articles 370 and 35A on August 5, 2019. Local parties like the J&K Panthers Party has accused the BJP of failing to meet the aspirations of the people of Jammu.

Several veterans entitled to disability pensions had a shock when they received just few hundred rupees in their bank accounts as pension for the month of February. This was due to an order by the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts (PCDA), Allahabad, to deduct tax on disability pensions despite assurances to the contrary by the government and an order by the Supreme Court.

“There is a status quo by the Supreme Court on the matter and the PCDA has still gone ahead and issued the circular,” a Defence official said on Monday on condition of anonymity. It is also a violation of a Reserve Bank of India directive against deduction of TDS (tax deducted at source) in one go, he stated.

‘Widespread outrage’

Senior Defence Ministry and Army officials have discussed the matter with the State Bank of India (SBI) and also with concerned officials, another Defence official said, adding, “After widespread outrage on social media, Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar also sought details from veterans. The issue should be resolved in a few days.”

According to several veterans, the PCDA issued a circular dated February 20 for “necessary action” notification dated June 24, 2019 by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Ministry of Finance, which said tax exemption would be available only to Armed Forces personnel who have been invalidated from service and not to personnel who have been retired on superannuation or otherwise.

However, after strong reactions from the military fraternity and on social media, the government clarified that it would look into the matter and that the issue has also been sub judice.

Retrospective deduction

Following the PCDA order, last week, SBI deducted TDS on disability pension retrospectively for the this financial year. However, other banks had not implemented the order. Since then, some veterans have served a legal notice to the PCDA over contempt of the Court order.

“SBI implemented the taxation policy retrospectively, calculated tax arrears and deducted the entire pension for the month.

98,2020/03/03,Centre to lift onion export ban from March 15,"The move comes in the wake of a bumper harvest that is likely to push down prices of the kitchen staple

The Centre will allow the export of onions from March 15, according to a notification issued by the Directorate General of Foreign Trade. The move comes in the wake of a bumper harvest that is likely to push down prices of the kitchen staple. The decision has been taken in the interest of farmers, said Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal.

The export ban had been imposed in September 2019 when prices had rocketed above ₹100 per kg in many parts of the country. Over a quarter of the kharif or summer crop had been destroyed by excess rainfall and flooding in major producing States, resulting in a supply shortage. Prices remained high through much of the winter, leading the Centre to import onions, impose stock limits, and take steps against hoarders and black marketers, apart from banning exports.

India's approach to dealing with the coronavirus outbreak has been an exercise in “integrated government”, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Monday. The Minister’s comments coincided with a slew of measures by the government to deal with the outbreak in Iran where hundreds of Indians are stuck after New Delhi suspended flights from Iranian airlines.

“There are two big lessons: this is the extent of globalisation, it tells you how integrated we are. The second, will be how central China is to the world. If Chinese production slows down, which seems to be happening, it will not just affect the Chinese growth rate, it is going to end up with [huge damage everywhere],” said Mr. Jaishankar at the CPR Dialogue 2020, organised by the Centre for Policy Research here.

GoM forms policy

The Minister said the Indian government has set up a group of ministers and secretaries who meet regularly to frame policy and began screening in airports and sea ports early. “We set up a quarantine facility in Manesar. We then looked at restricting travel to India.”

India had suspended flights from Iran after the outbreak of coronavirus in the country which stranded a large number of pilgrims from India visiting the holy cities of Iran and the capital Tehran.

The Indian Embassy in Tehran, however, said that 64 pilgrims from Srinagar and Kargil, who are stuck in the Iranian capital, met officials. “Embassy officials are in discussions with Iranian counterparts to work out modalities for restarting limited number of commercial flights between India and Iran. This will enable Indians and Iranians stranded in both countries to return to their respective homes,” the Indian embassy said in a social media post.

Mr Jaishankar also said in a social media post that he was personally following the case of Indians stranded in Iran because of cancellation of flights. “We are collaborating with the Iranian authorities to set up a screening process for return of Indians,” he said.

Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muralidharan also said that he is tracking the condition of Indians including a group of fishermen from Kerala who are stuck in Iran due to the virus outbreak.

104,2020/03/03,"‘Govt. will approach World Bank for ₹1,783-crore loan’","All efforts being made to clear dues to liquor suppliers: Deputy CM

Deputy Chief Minister (Excise and Commercial Taxes) K. Narayana Swamy on Tuesday said the government would approach the World Bank to lend ₹1,783 crore for clearing dues to liquor suppliers in the State.

Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Mr. Narayanaswamy said the dues were pending since the previous government. The AP State Beverages Corporation Limited (APSBCL), which procures liquor from the distilleries, has no land to mortgage for securing a loan. “We will adopt other means to achieve the objective,” he said.

A TDP leader has encroached 17 acres land of the APSBCL in Vijayawada city. Refusing to reveal the name of the alleged encroacher, the Deputy CM said steps were being taken to free the land of illegal occupation.

The government was going ahead with the plan of enforcing liquor ban in a phased manner “to protect people’s health.” After the YSR Congress came to power on May 30 last year, the government took over the liquor retail business and reduced the number of outlets from 4,380 to 3,500.

Poser to TDP

“You can't give up the habit in one go. So we will do it in a phased manner. This year, we will reduce the number of liquor shops in the State by 25 %,” he said.

Recalling how former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu watered down the prohibition policy brought in by late Chief Minister and TDP founder N. T. Rama Rao, he demanded that the TDP spell out its stand on liquor ban.

“We are going ahead with a good intention,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/c1nvv6/article30978536.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJPAGEEDEPUTYCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-will-approach-world-bank-for-1783-crore-loan/article30975924.ece

A day after the High Court set aside the GO earmarking 59.85% quota for weaker sections in the local body elections, Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has asked the officials to take steps to conduct the elections within a month.

“The High Court has also given directions in this regard. The officials will meet the Election Commission tomorrow. The elections to MPTC, ZPTC, panchayat and municipal bodies will be conducted in a month,” Mr. Jagan said at a review meeting on the Spandana programme on Tuesday.

Mr. Jagan recalled that the government promulgated an ordinance amending the Panchayat Raj Act. Any candidate found to be violating the election code would be disqualified. Also, a punishment of three years would be awarded. At present, the punishment was between three and six months. If proven guilty even after winning the election, the candidate in question would be disqualified. Remote governance would not be permitted.

Elected representatives should be available to people every day. The ordinance gives an opportunity to persons who want to serve people sincerely and devotedly, he said.

‘Police should act tough’

Mr. Jagan said the ordinance was also aimed at curbing the influence of money and liquor. The Police Department should act tough on this front. The Superintendent of Police (SP) of the district concerned would have to take up steps to control the flow of money and liquor during the elections. The services of Police Mitras and Mahila police in villages would be fully utilised for the purpose, he said.

The local body elections in the State should be set an example and be a role model for the entire country. An app has to be developed to curb irregularities in the elections as was done in the general elections. The data should be readily available to the police. The app should be made available to the Police Mitras, Mahila Mitras, village volunteers and the public.

With the neighbouring Telangana registering its first case of COVID-19 (novel coronavirus), the Andhra Pradesh government has gone into the alert mode, and reviewed the preventive measures required, the arrangements in place to identify persons with a history of travel to the affected countries/places, and create awareness among the people.

The development in Telangana has come as a cause for worry for many persons who have been to Hyderabad in the recent past.

The helplines – 0866-2410978, 1100 or 1902 – set up by the government received many calls from the people with symptoms of common cold on Tuesday, officials said.

However, none of them has a travel history to the affected places.

Rapid response teams

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, at a review meeting, asked the officials of the Health Department to take preventive measures, besides creating awareness among the people on the precautions to be taken.

An official press release here said that Mr. Reddy asked the authorities to be alert and constitute rapid response teams should the need arise.

Mr. Reddy, however, said that there was no need for the people to fear. He asked the officials to ensure availability of isolation wards at the district hospitals and teams of trained doctors.

‘Keep masks ready’

He further directed the officials to display at the ward and village secretariats the precautionary measures to be taken, and ensure that sufficient masks were kept ready by immediately placing the purchase order.

Minister for Health Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas said that at present eight hospitals were equipped with the isolation wards and four more were being readied.

He said the State was well-equipped to deal with any eventuality.

“At present, the State has a stock of 1,10,340 N-95 masks and over 12,000 personal protection masks. A contingent will attend the national training programme to be organised in New Delhi on March 6 on how to handle the cases,” the Minister said.

Special Chief Secretary (Medical, Health and Family Welfare) K.S. Jawahar Reddy said, “The situation is being monitored round the clock and the helplines are functioning 24 hours.”

He said all persons entering the State from abroad were being screened and asked to isolate themselves, irrespective of the signs of the disease.

“So far, 263 persons have come to the State after visiting the coronavirus-affected countries. All of them have been placed under observation. Of them, 211 have completed the 28-day observation period and 50 asymptomatic persons are under home isolation,” he said.

“Out of 11 samples sent for examination, 10 tested negative for the virus and one person’s report is yet to be received,” he added.

The Health Department bulletin said that two symptomatic persons were hospitalised as of Monday.

The SIT, which had started its investigation in the month of November last year, have so far received about 1,400 applications and it has already examined over 400 applications.

Of the 1,400 applications pertaining to various complaints such as encroachment of government land and NOC lands, it has received close to about 250 applications pertaining to 22A issue.

“Of the 250-odd applications under 22A, we have examined around 80 of them and have found that about 20 applications have been wrongly categorised under 22A. We have recommended it to the District Collector to denotify them from the list,” speaking to The Hindu, former IAS officer Vijay Kumar, who is heading the SIT, said.

According the other applications in the 80-odd examined so far, all have grossly violated the 22A norms and have blatantly encroached upon land belonging to the government, public sector units or endowment or Wakf board.

Four categories

Under 22A there are four categories: 22 A 1(a) all assigned lands or land given to individual for the purpose and which cannot be sold or transferred, 22A 1(b) land belonging to the Union and the State Governments, 22A 1(c) land belonging to endowment, Wafk board or any religious institution, 22A 1(d) land notified under ULC (urban land ceiling), and 22A 1(e) land allotted by government to institutions or private establishments for a purpose.

A 26-year-old widow from Madanapalle division, who had gone to Kuwait 11 months ago to eke out livelihood as domestic help, reportedly committed suicide at a rural village near Kuwait city. Though the incident is said to have occurred six days ago, information reached her father here only on Sunday night, following which he approached the local police seeking justice to the family.

Madanapalle Taluq Circle Inspector M. Srinivasulu said that Ramana and Sunanda of Pasamvaripalle of Penchupadu panchayat of Madanapalle mandal had performed marriage of their daughter Varalakhshmi with a man from a a neighbouring village. A couple of years ago, she had returned home along with her daughter, following the demise of her husband. As Ms. Sunanda had earlier worked in Kuwait as a domestic help, the mother-daughter duo had planned to go there again.

By the end of 2018, they had approached a Gulf job agent at Madanapalle by name Shaik Sahid Pir who arranged jobs for them in Kuwait rural side within 10 days. In the last week of February, Varalakshmi had sent voice messages to her father, saying that she was ‘facing hell’ from her employer. She had reportedly asked her father to arrange ₹3 lakh meant as payment to her owner for violating the contract period, and return home early. The father in turn had assured the daughter that he would do something to get her relieved from there.

In this backdrop, Varalakshmi’s mother, working at another household at a neighbouring locality, received information that her daughter had committed suicide five days ago, and that her body was at a mortuary at a rural hospital. Ms. Sunanda in turn passed on the message to her husband, revealing the tragedy on Sunday night. On Monday morning, Ramana approached the agent at Madanapalle and blamed him for his daughter’s death. The Circle Inspector on preliminary inquiry found that the agent had not collected any amount from the women, except for arranging them flight tickets.

“Regarding transportation of the woman’s body, the matter would be pursued with the Indian embassy there in Kuwait. We have suggested to Mr. Ramana to approach the Kuwaiti police if he wanted to launch any complaint against his daughter’s death there,” the police officer said.

Noted balladeer Vangapandu Prasad Rao on Monday said that modern ways of life had an adverse impact on Telugu folk literature.

Mr. Prasad and his troupe presented a demonstration on folk dance and songs, highlighting the dialect of the north Andhra region at the two-day seminar on ‘folklore knowledge and impact of globalisation’ that began at the Adikavi Nannaya University (ANU) here.

ANU Telugu Department and Telugu Janapada Vignana Parishad Amaravati are organising the seminar. Singing the song ‘Em Pillado Eldamostava’, the 75-year-old balladeer observed, “Folk literature, song and dance have the ability to enlighten the society. However, folk literature is missing its link with the village life. My song Em Pillado Eldamostava is being sung in around 50 languages, proving the need for the protection of the Telugu folk literature. Reviving the glory of folk literature is the need of the hour.”

ANU Registrar B. Ganga Rao said many folk songs, once being sung by villagers in agriculture fields in the Godavari districts, have been lost, owing to the change in the way of life.

He put the blame on the lack of patronage for folk literature. T.

The High Court on Monday directed Director-General of Police Gautam Sawang to appear in person before it on March 12 and explain the procedures followed in detaining TDP president and Leader of the Opposition N. Chandrababu Naidu in Visakhapatnam four days ago.

A Division Bench headed by Chief Justice J.K. Maheswari gave the ruling after hearings on a petition filed by former TDP MLA T. Sravan Kumar contending that the way Mr. Naidu was detained and prevented from going ahead with ‘praja chaitanya yatra’ was against the established procedure of law. The police had also filed counter-affidavits explaining that Mr. Naidu was placed under detention after being served notices under Section 151 Cr.P.C. The court contended that notices are given under Section151 only in cases of possibility of the person concerned resorting to serious criminal activities.

The court contended it was not right for the police to grant permission first and later issue notices asked the Superintendent of Police of Visakhapatnam and Commissioner of Police, Vizag, to file counters and asked the DGP to appear in person.

High drama

Mr. Naidu was detained at Visakhapatnam airport last Thursday amid high drama as he was about to begin his yatra. After nearly five hours, Mr. Naidu took a flight to Hyderabad.

The TDP has made this incident a major issue, with a party delegation meeting the Governor. Later, Mr. Sravan Kumar filed a writ petition challenging the validity of detention and issuing notices under Section 151.

On the previous Friday, Mr. Sravan Kumar moved a lunch motion petition seeking court’s directions to accord permission for peaceful protests as part of ‘praja chaitanya yatra’ in Visakhapatnam.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/a985ve/article30969385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03ONGSAWANG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hc-issues-summons-to-dgp/article30969386.ece
115,2020/03/03,Deadlock over farmers’ dues continues at NCS Sugars Ltd.,"Rythu Sangham warns of fresh agitation from March 5

The deadlock over the payment of dues of farmers who have supplied sugarcane to the NCS Sugars Limited at Latchayyapeta in Sitanagaram mandal of Vizianagaram district continues, with the factory management failing to clear the arrears in time, citing issues pertaining to auction of land under the Revenue Recovery Act.

Farmers led by Rythu Sangham affiliated to the CPI(M) have been agitating, seeking the immediate payment of the dues. “The management has to pay around ₹20.7 crore to farmers for the sugarcane supplied in the last three crushing seasons between 2017 and 2019. The farmers will take up a fresh agitation from March 5, if the payments are not done immediately,” Rythu Sangham president Reddi Lakshmi Naidu told The Hindu.

The management could not clear the dues owing to the reported financial problems and lack of remunerative price for sugarcane. However, it has agreed to auction 62.47 acres belonging to the factory which is expected to fetch ₹27.47 crores.

Land auction delayed

However, the auction could not be done in last month. The management claims that despite a good response from many bidders, the process could not be completed owing to technical and procedural problems.

Meanwhile, the company has been directed to pay ₹2.43 crore dues to Employment Provident Fund (EPF), ₹1.56 crore to Excise Department and nearly ₹1 crore as GST.

“We have been trying sincerely to clear all the dues and that is why we have agreed to sell our precious land. Farmers need not worry. The auction process will be completed very shortly,” said NCS Sugars Limited Director Narayanam Srinivas.

‘Dull crushing season’

He said that the company might incur further losses this year owing to the steep drop in sugarcane crushing. “Around 2.79 lakh tonnes of sugarcane were crushed in 2018-19 fiscal. Given the situation, it would be around in 1.28 lakh tonnes at best in 2019-20 financial year,” said Mr. Srinivas.

The crushing season that began in November is all set to end by March-end. “Despite financial constraints, we are running the factory for the benefit of farmers. They should continue supplying sugarcane as the payment process is all set to begin,” added Mr. Srinivas.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qjqqtn/article30967166.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VJRJYPAGEDUESTOFARMERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/deadlock-over-farmers-dues-continues-at-ncs-sugars-ltd/article30967167.ece
116,2020/03/03,High Court strikes down GOon quota in local body polls,"Govt. asked to stick to the 50% cap in line with SC ruling

The High Court on Monday struck down GO Ms no 176, which has fixed reservations for BCs/SCs/STs at 59.85%, in the local body elections. Further, the High Court asked the government furnish within four weeks, the new quota without exceeding 50% .

A Division Dench headed by Chief Justice J.K Maheswari also declared ultra vires the Panchayat Raj Act.

In January, the Supreme Court had stayed the GO stating that reservations can not exceed 50 %. It had asked the High Court to decide on the matter within four weeks from the date of the stay order — January 20.

With this judgment, holding of local body elections has hit a roadblock again. Intermediate examinations are set to begin from March 4 (Wednesday and later Class 10 examinations and the government machinery would be preoccupied with them.

The government had issued the G.O on January 28, 2019, fixing 59.85% — 34 % for BCs, 19.08% for SCs, and 6.77% for STs.

119,2020/03/03,Coronavirus threat: vegetable farmers have a field day,"Chicken consumption plummets in Chittoor district

Fears of coronavirus, which left an upsetting effect on the poultry industry for wrong reasons, has resulted in amazing consumption of the greens and vegetables during the last one week. The farmers of the western mandals of the tail-end Chittoor district, cultivating the vegetables in vast stretches, are now a happy lot with rush of consumers to markets, post the onion crisis.

The coronavirus fears, which had initially threatened the fish markets in January, led to total absence of seafood. Later, the meat industry too took a beating, but it could romp back to normalcy soon. However, the chicken shops which bore the brunt of corona threat continue to suffer the worst following fast plummeting of the sales and prices. Chittoor district has a healthy number of poultry units, concentrated in the western mandals, from chicks to layers and broilers.

During the last one week, the chicken price took a nosedive from ₹190 a kg to ₹120 in several parts of the Chittoor district. However, in Nagari and surrounding villages in the eastern side, the price took a beating at just ₹80 a kg, and yet there are no takers.

The immediate impact of the scenario is that the vegetable markets and roadside vendors are reaping the benefits which they badly missed for over three months last year due to onion crisis.

The greens sold at ₹20 a bunch in August-September last year had later fell to ₹10 a bunch. “Now, we are selling three bunches for ₹10. The production of green leaves is terrific everywhere thanks to the rains north-east monsoon last year, and continuous soil and air moisture till now,” Murugesh, a vegetable shopkeeper in Nagari, said.

Chan Basha, a chicken shop operator in Madanapalle, observed that since the outbreak of coronavirus in China, the number of consumers visiting the shops here (Chittoor district) slowly dwindled. “It is very strange. We can’t convince the consumers that coronavirus has nothing to do with chickens. Time alone will allay their fears,” he said.

A poultry farm owner at Bangarupalem said that the chicken sales would take a sudden jump from March onward and would peak in May with the arrival of “jatara” season, when the public would celebrate the occasions at village temples. “Unfortunately, we are gravely missing the business now. The loss could be several crores of rupees in Chittoor district, with its two hundred plus poultry farms,” he said.

Awareness camps

Chittoor district’s Joint Director (Animal Husbandry) S. Venkatrao told The Hindu that despite the statement of the State authorities of the wing that chicken consumption has nothing to do with coronavirus spread, the public fears continues. “We are contemplating to organise a series of awareness camps all over the district to dispel public fears connecting coronavirus spread to chicken consumption. We will involve the municipal corporations and all the civic bodies,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/zbx7ax/article30966432.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03-VJ-CHICKENSHOP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/coronavirus-threat-vegetable-farmers-have-a-field-day/article30966433.ece
120,2020/03/03,EAS Sarma decries ‘bid to conclude’ n-reactor pacts,"‘Both Westinghouse and EDF/Areva are financially fragile’

Social activist and former IAS officer E.A.S. Sarma has strongly opposed the reported attempts by the Department of Atomic Energy to conclude reactor supply agreements with American company Westinghouse for 6x1000 MWe reactors for Kovvada in Andhra Pradesh and EDF/Areva of France for 6x1600 MWe reactors for Jaitapur in Maharashtra.

In a representation to Rajiv Mehrishi, Comptroller and Auditor General, he stated that from public audit point of view, both Westinghouse and EDF/Areva were financially fragile. EDF/Areva's projects in Finland and elsewhere have undergone huge time and cost overruns that have resulted in electricity from such projects becoming highly expensive and unaffordable.

He said in the Indian context, since the generation mix already stands acutely skewed in favour of the thermal mode, addition of new nuclear (thermal) generation capacity to the grid further adds to the unit cost of electricity

Mr. Sarma said while the Three Mile Island (USA) and Chernobyl (Russia) nuclear plant accidents were disastrous, the Fukushima accident in Japan in 2011 proved to be far more traumatic. He said according to pro-nuclear Japan Center for Economic Research, it has now been estimated the long-term costs of the 2011 Fukushima accident to be about $750 billion.

Cap on liability

“Globally, the nuclear reactor manufacturer lobby has succeeded in forcing the different countries to severely cap the liability that will devolve on the manufacturers in the event of a catastrophic accident attributable to deficient reactor design,” he pointed out.

Mr. Sarma said in USA, the Price-Anderson Act has imposed a cap of only $13 billion, which is minuscule compared to the Fukushima-like liability but the Act enables US Congress to intervene and modify the cap, if necessary. USA is a financially strong economy that can bear the brunt of a large nuclear accident liability, he said.

On the other hand, the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act of 2010 in India has imposed a far lower cap of 300 million Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) which works out to a little more than $400 million, quite negligible compared with the liability that will arise even when a minor accident takes place.

He pointed out “if a Fukushima-like accident were to strike a project in any State in India, the liability that will arise, on the basis of this assessment, will not only wipe out the State’s budget but it will also impose a huge burden on the Union Budget. C&AG should apprise the Parliament of this.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/j4duab/article30966390.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03-VZ-EASSARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/eas-sarma-decries-bid-to-conclude-n-reactor-pacts/article30966391.ece
121,2020/03/03,Government gives special nod to candidates of 2011 KPSC batch,"In a partial relief to Karnataka Public Service Commission (KPSC) aspirants, the State government has accorded one-time special permission to candidates who wrote the 2011 Gazetted Probationers (Mains) examination, conducted by the commission, to appear for the 2017-18 exam. The government issued an order in this regard on Tuesday.

According to sources, a similar special permission was given to the 2011 candidates for the gazetted probationers exam held in 2014, as many had crossed the age limit prescribed.

Issues surrounding the 2011 batch of candidates are expected to come up for discussion during the ongoing legislature session.

The special permission has been given in light of the controversy over the 2011 exam held for 362 posts, as the outcome still hangs in the balance amid allegations of corruption and bribery. The confusion over whether the list will be notified or not lingers on, sources said.

Sources also said that the candidates who wrote the 2011 exam have been urging the government to notify a re-exam for the 362 posts and to allow only those who wrote the exam in 2011 to appear for it. “Only 107 posts have been notified for the 2017-18 exam. We have been calling for re-examination for the 362 posts notified in 2011.

122,2020/03/03,"11,000 avians descend on Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary in 60 days","Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, near Srirangapatna in Mandya district, one of the largest bird sanctuaries in India, has witnessed an impressive number of arrivals in the past 60 days.

The Forest Department on Monday counted avians that have arrived to roost and breed at all 25 major islets, created by the Cauvery. It was found that Ranganathittu has welcomed around 10,800 birds since January 3.

The sanctuary hosted around 8,000 birds on January 2, when the year’s first such survey was taken up. The number rose to 17,000 by February 2, and then to 18,800 by Monday, senior officials said.

The number of cattle egrets was found to be around 5,500, while around 2,500 spot-billed pelicans, nearly 500 open-billed storks , and around 2,500 painted storks were spotted during the enumeration. An impressive number of night herons (1,500), little cormorants (600), and bats (1,200) were also counted. Varieties of bee eaters, parakeets, swallows, minas, darters, stone plovers, paradise flycatchers, ibis and others birds were also found in good numbers.

According to an official, bird censuses will help the department frame or modify policies, besides prompting the undertaking of various expansion and development plans.

The islets of Ranganathittu were formed during the construction of a barrier across the Cauvery between 1645 and 1648, by the then Mysore ruler Kantirava Narasaraja Wadiyar. It got the status of ‘bird sanctuary’ following the constant efforts of renowned ornithologist Salim Ali in the 1940s.

Since then, Ranganathittu has been attracting a variety of species of migratory and Indian birds. The bird sanctuary is also considered a safe place for river otters, marsh crocodiles (muggers), and several species of fish.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9l5qqf/article30975863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGMNDRANGANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/11000-avians-descend-on-ranganathittu-bird-sanctuary-in-60-days/article30975864.ece

125,2020/03/03,Tusker electrocuted in Chamarajanagar district on World Wildlife Day,"The World Wildlife Day celebrations on Tuesday were marred by the death of a wild tusker, which was electrocuted on an agricultural field at B.M. Halli village in Hanur range of M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary in Chamarajanagar.

The tusker was aged between 20 and 25. Drawn by the maize cultivated there, it had entered the field of one Chikkabasappa by crossing a narrow stream of water.

The elephant was feasting on the crop when it accidentally came in contact with an illegal live power line drawn by the farm owner and installed at a low level, ostensibly to target wild boars that tend to come to the field. The elephant collapsed and died instantly, with a portion of the maize that it was chewing on still in its mouth.

The Deputy Conservator of Forests V. Yedukondalu visited the spot. He said the incident took place in the early hours of Tuesday and the tusker is suspected to have entered the farmland around 4 a.m. It had quenched its thirst from the flowing stream in the vicinity and climbed the embankment to enter the field, he said. A search has been launched to nab Mr. Chikkabasappa, who is absconding. A forest offence case has also been registered with the police.

The agricultural farm is about 1 km from the forest boundary, and it is a common practice among local villagers to set up snares to trap and prevent wild boars from entering their fields. But a few of them draw power illegally to protect their crops from wild animals.

Awareness drive

Mr. Yedukondalu said a drive would be launched to create greater awareness among the rural people to desist from drawing power from HT lines as it poses a danger, not only to animals but also to humans.

The Forest Department has also urged the Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation to conduct periodic inspections to curb such practices.

The theme of this year’s World Wildlife Day was “sustaining all life on earth”, including wild animal and plant species as key components of the world’s biodiversity, according to the United Nations. But such celebrations tend to be meaningless on the ground where man-animal conflict is intense, given the severe competition for land.

This incident comes barely two days after two elephants died under similar circumstances in Tamil Nadu forests, which border M.M. Hills Wildlife Sanctuary.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/x6xeuu/article30975790.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGTUSKER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tusker-electrocuted-in-chamarajanagar-district-on-world-wildlife-day/article30975791.ece
126,2020/03/03,Mandya sugar units to be run on PPP model,"Steps to be taken to enhance crushing capacity

The government has proposed to run the loss-making Pandavapura and Mysugar factories, located in the sugarcane growing district of Mandya, on a PPP model.

Minister for Sugar Shivaram Hebbar said that both sugar factories have been incurring financial losses for many years and it was difficult for the government to run them since they required a huge amount of funds. It was proposed to either sell both factories to private parties or run it on PPP model, he said.

Steps for enhancing the crushing capacity and cogeneration of power in order to boost the functioning of the two factories will be taken along with repairs, he said.

In fact, many employees of Mysugar factory have opted for the voluntary retirement scheme.

A huge sum of ₹428 crore was spent on Mysugar in the past 10 years. Mysugar, which was established in 1934, is considered the source of sustenance for cane-growing families in more than 100 villages in Mandya and Srirangapatna taluks.

127,2020/03/03,19 resorts demolished near Hampi,"Three other resorts and residential structures spared for a day, says Koppal Deputy Commissioner

As per the Supreme Court order on February 11, the Hampi World Heritage Area Management Authority, with the help of Koppal and Ballari district administrations, demolished 19 illegal resorts at Virupapur Gaddi near Hampi on Tuesday.

The earthmovers, under security cover provided by the Koppal and Ballari police force, began to raze the structures around 6 a.m. in the presence of top officials from both the districts, including P. Sunil Kumar and S.S. Nakul, Deputy Commissioners of Koppal and Ballari, respectively. Prohibitory orders were imposed under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code and heavy police forces were deployed to avoid any untoward incident during the eviction drive.

Three resorts whose petitions were pending in the High Court and Supreme Court were not demolished as the authorities chose to wait for the final orders from the courts. Similarly, the residential structures were also spared for a day.

Some women who owned the illegal resorts were found crying before the Deputy Commissioners as their business establishments were razed to the ground.

“There was no resistance or disturbance from owners of the resorts as they were prepared after the apex court order to demolish them. We have demolished 19 resorts. The operation is still on. We have not touched any residential structure today. But, we have given the residents a day’s time to collect their belongings and vacate the islet. We will begin the demolition of residential structures on Wednesday or a day after once the clearance of business establishments is over,” Mr. Sunil Kumar told The Hindu.

“The government had initiated the process of clearing illegal structures in the islet in 2011, but the resort owners moved courts and continued their legal battles in the High Court and Supreme Court. The apex court issued a final order on February 11 dismissing the resort owners’ appeals against the Karnataka High Court’s judgment of April 27, 2015, which held the structures in question in the islet illegal and ordered for their demolition. As per the Supreme Court order, we have undertaken the demolition drive,” Mr. Sunil Kumar said.

Upholding the High Court order, the top court had concluded that “these constructions were in violation of Section 20(1) of the Mysore Ancient and Historical Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1961” and “no development is permissible there even as per the Master Plan 2021 prepared under the Hampi Act.”

130,2020/03/03,Bidar sedition case: School management members granted bail,"The Principal District and Sessions Court in Bidar, on Tuesday, granted conditional bail to five functionaries of Shaheen School management — Abdul Qadeer, Allauddin Pasha, Mehtab Sait, Bilal Inamdar and Abdul Khaleq — who moved anticipatory bail in a sedition case slapped against their school recently.

Conditions

Senior advocate B.T. Venkatesh from Bengaluru argued for the petitioners. Managoli Premavati Mallikarjuna granted bail on certain conditions, including execution of personal bond of ₹2 lakh each.

The sedition case was filed against the Shaheen School management for its children staging a play as part of their annual day celebrations on January 21, in which a character had allegedly delivered a dialogue against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

While Nazbunnisa, the mother of the child who had allegedly delivered the dialogue in the play, and Fareeda Begum, the headmistress of the school, were arrested, they were subsequently released on bail last month.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bidar-sedition-case-school-management-members-granted-bail/article30975348.ece
131,2020/03/03,"Farmers welcome Mahadayi verdict, but questions remain","Road ahead for Karnataka is clear or not, they ask

Farmers’ organisations have welcomed the Supreme Court verdict on the Mahadayi dispute that dismissed Goa’s objection to Karnataka going ahead with the project. But questions remain about whether the road ahead for Karnataka is clear or not.

“We are happy that the court has allowed Karnataka to go ahead with the drinking water project. However, we are not sure of the details,” said Sidagouda Modagi, a Krishik Samaj leader. “Major and Medium Irrigation Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi had announced a hydroelectric project along with the drinking water scheme. But the court judgment clearly seems to approve only of the drinking water project. In that sense, it is no cause for celebration,” he said.

Ashok Chandaragi, convener of the action committee of Kannada organisations, said that Mr. Jarkiholi has committed an error by terming it an irrigation project. “All these years, Karnataka obtained exemptions and approvals from the Union government by saying that the project was a drinking water scheme. But the Minister has wrongly called it an irrigation project. This could be used against us by Goa and some environment groups that are opposing the project,” he said.

Environmentalist Giridhar Kulkarni said that if the construction of the project becomes inevitable, the State government should declare the forest area surrounding the project site as a protected wildlife sanctuary and ecological preserve. That will ensure that further degradation of forestland does not happen and the fragile ecosystem would be protected,” he said.

The response in Goa has been guarded. While Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has welcomed the verdict and said it was in the interests of Goa and it would protect the forest and wildlife of the Mahadayi basin, Opposition leaders have criticised it. The Chief Minister said the SC had made it clear that Karnataka could not go ahead without taking necessary permissions. Opposition leader Digambar Kamat has criticised the State government for failing to protect the interests of the State. “It played down our apprehensions about environment damage arising from the project. The Union government is conniving with Karnataka. The environment ministry has already granted permission and the Centre would soon grant it all other permissions,” Mr Kamat said.

Officials say they are not sure of the implications of the order either. “Each such project needs permissions from three departments - environment, forest and wildlife. We had got exemptions from the environment ministry as we had listed the project as a drinking water scheme. Only the forest and wildlife permits were pending. But the SC order seems to point out that we need to take all the approvals afresh. That would raise some issues. We have asked our legal team to clarify,” said a senior Irrigation Department official.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ag76ri/article30975322.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGMAHADAYI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/farmers-welcome-mahadayi-verdict-but-questions-remain/article30975323.ece

134,2020/03/03,"Opposition protest disrespect to Constitution, says Speaker","Govt. acting against Constitution principles by shielding MLA: Oppn.

Angered by the Opposition Congress’ refusal to withdraw its protest in the Legislative Assembly against the controversial remarks of BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal even after he initiated a special debate on Constitution, Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri on Tuesday said their protest had brought disrespect to the Constitution, people of the State and the House.

“Your protest is against the spirit of the Constitution. I do not agree with your conduct of refusing to withdraw the protest even after the Speaker has ruled against it,” Mr. Kageri said. Before beginning his speech, the Speaker made an appeal to the Opposition members, who were staging a dharna in the well of the House, to end their protest and go back to their seats. When the Opposition members did not heed, he adjourned the House for some time.

When the Opposition members refused to withdraw their protest even after the House reassembled, he read out his speech amidst slogan-shouting by the protesting members.

Kannada and Culture Minister C.T. Ravi alleged that the Congress’ protest showed that they did not respect the Constitution. This angered the Opposition, who shot back, saying that it was the government which was acting against the principles of the Constitution by shielding the ruling party MLA who had made derogatory remarks against a veteran freedom fighter.

In his speech, Mr. Kageri traced the history of the Constitution and outlined its aspirations. He appealed to the members to work towards creating awareness as well as commitment among youth about the aspirations of the Constitution.

Setting the agenda for debate, he observed that there were questions on the extent to which the Constitution could bring about transformation and whether such a change could be above people’s mandate. “Also there was a question as to what extent the Constitution could change itself to suit the changed political and social circumstances,” he noted.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2ax0d0/article30975208.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGWOMENMLAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/opposition-protest-disrespect-to-constitution-says-speaker/article30975209.ece

136,2020/03/03,AIISH screening of newbornsat Cheluvamba launched,"56,000 babies had been checked over the last one year

Screening of new-born babies by the audiologists of All India Institute of Speech and Hearing was formally launched at the State-run Cheluvamba Hospital, a healthcare facility for women and children, here on Tuesday to mark the World Hearing Day.

Kannada actress Amulya inaugurated the screening that helps to detect hearing loss among the infants using state-of-the-art devices.

March 3 is observed as World Hearing Day to ensure early identification of hearing loss. All India Institute of Speech and Hearing, Mysuru, a premier institute for addressing communication disorders working under the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, has taken the lead role in spreading awareness on the importance of early screening and detection and hearing care by conducting camps and activities.

AIISH Director M. Pushpavathi, Mysore Medical College and Research Institute Dean and Director C.P. Nanjaraj and others were present during the launch.

The AIISH has been conducting newborn screening in 19 hospitals in Mysuru and has additional 14 newborn hearing screening centres spread across the country. More than 56,000 babies had been successfully screened for hearing loss over the last one year.

Later, Ms. Amulya visited the AIISH campus and inaugurated smart class for the children with speech and hearing impairment.

The AIISH, in a release here, said the 2011 Census had revealed that nearly 19 per cent of the population suffers from hearing impairment.

This is an alarming figure and particularly in case of children born with hearing loss, it is necessary that they are detected early (within one month) and rehabilitated within six months of age.

However, since hearing loss is a hidden disability, parents fail to detect it early and initiate rehabilitation. It needs experts such as audiologists to detect hearing loss well within one month of age and parents should make every attempt to get their newborn baby tested for hearing abnormalities as it will extremely impact speech and language development, the experts at the AIISH said.

The Department of Special Education, AIISH, Mysuru is catering to educational services of children with various communication disorders. Around 300 children with various communication disorders are availing the services at the department.

To facilitate fast and enjoyable learning atmosphere to the children, the department has come up with the innovative teaching practices.

A Digital Teaching System (DTS) or smart class had been installed in 20 classrooms of the department. After the launch, Ms. Amulya interacted with the special children at the department.

The students of JSS Institute for Speech and Hearing also observed the World Hearing Day by organising a cyclothon. The event was aimed to educating the public on the importance of taking good care of hearing and timely evaluation of hearing health.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bkopw4/article30975170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03MYSAIIISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/aiish-screening-of-newborns-at-cheluvamba-launched/article30975171.ece
137,2020/03/03,Focus on more awareness as not many are patronising Hosur bus terminal,"The new boarding point in Hubballi was inaugurated on Sunday and services launched on Monday

A day after long-route buses started originating from the Hosur Regional Bus Terminal, passengers are yet to patronise services from the new terminal which consequently has forced the authorities to focus more on creating awareness.

Although the services were formally commissioned from the new terminal on Sunday, the services were launched on Monday. The authorities of North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) have diverted the services of a total of 628 buses to the Hosur Terminal and the New Bus Station on Gokul Road.

As per the changes now, 309 buses would originate from the Hosur Bus Terminal and 319 buses would originate from New Bus Station on Gokul Road. While the passengers are used to the New Bus Station, the old Bus Station near the Kittur Chennamma Circle is the preferred boarding point for many.

Now, as per the changes, buses moving towards Raichur, Mantralayam in Andhra Pradesh, Gadag, Koppal, Badami, Ballari, Athani, Bagalkot, Vijayapura, Jamkhandi, Solapur in Maharashtra and other destinations are scheduled to start from the Regional Bus Terminal and people are finding it cumbersome to go to Hosur despite NWKRTC offering feeder services to the new terminal from the old Bus Station.

Divisional Controller of Hubballi Division of NWKRTC H. Ramanagoudar said that people would take time to get adjusted to the changes and this was no different as passengers have been using the old Bus Station for several decades now.

“But change is necessary as Kittur Chennamma Cirlce is getting congested. We are taking every step to make people start availing themselves of bus services from Hosur Regional Bus Terminal and to facilitate this, regular announcements are being made at the old Bus Station. We have also installed information boards about the changes in bus services,” he told The Hindu.

He said that already volunteers have been pressed into service to guide passengers about the changes in bus services and the routes within the city. “We are installing more sign boards on the road leading to Hosur Regional Bus Terminal for the benefit of the passengers and also for bus drivers of long-route buses. As many as 10 more volunteers will be deployed to guide passengers,” he said. Admitting that any change would take time to be accepted, he said that the plan was to avoid Kittur Chennamma Circle as far as possible to escape from traffic congestion. “There are a few more technical problems, particularly because of ongoing road works. But we are confident of overcoming them with cooperation from the general public,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hzqro9/article30975009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04HBHUBBALLIBUSTERMINAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/focus-on-more-awareness-as-not-many-are-patronising-hosur-bus-terminal/article30975010.ece
138,2020/03/03,Mobile-based app made mandatoryfor drivers of water supply tankers,"The districts that face drinking water crisis during summer are largely dependent on tankers. Though the process is considered as the best option to meet the demands of the people, it has been faced with illegality and corruption in claiming bills for long.

To prevent the misuse of funds and ensure that water reaches the people, the State government has got a special mobile-based app designed which has been made mandatory for all tanker drivers to use if they want to offer service.

“The government has made it mandatory for all water tanker drivers to use the app; else they will not get any contract to supply water,” according to Deputy Commissioner Y.S. Patil.

Speaking to The Hindu, he explained the functioning and advantages of using the app.

He said that the tanker drivers must have smart phones where they will have to download the application for supplying water.

“The drivers will have to upload pictures of the source of water and the destination where they will deliver water. Both distances would be geo-fenced. This will help avoid drivers misleading the officials about water source and destination,” he said.

Mr. Patil said that since the application works off-line, the driver need not have internet connection every time.

He said that the whole process will prevent drivers from giving wrong information or claiming bills with fake information.

“In the absence of an effective tracking system, we were unable to ensure transparency in the supply of water through tankers; thus, often, there were reports of misuse of money,” he said.

Mr. Patil said that the district administration has already conducted training on the use of the new application for revenue officials who are responsible for monitoring water tankers.

At the same time, tanker drivers have also been trained in using the app. “Though not all drivers attended the training programme, since we have made it compulsory, they will have no choice but to train themselves if they want water supply contract,” he said.

Mr. Patil hoped that the new system will bring in greater transparency in the functioning of water tankers. Now, water will reach only the earmarked areas for a stipulated number of trips and it would also help save public money, he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mobile-based-app-made-mandatoryfor-drivers-of-water-supply-tankers/article30973695.ece

The district administration is chalking out plans to utilise funds under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) for public works and officials of various departments have been asked to submit plans.

Chairing a meeting in this connection here on Monday, Deputy Commissioner M. Deepa has directed the officials to work out an action plan and submit it within three days.

Ms. Deepa said that under this plan, it has been decided to take up development of parks, enhancing educational facilities and infrastructure in government schools and beautification of local tanks, among others.

To take up various development works, ₹ 50 crore is available. If the departments concerned show interest in taking up new projects, it will be easy for the administration to scrutinise the check-list and release funds for the proposed projects. The officials should focus on innovative ideas to utilise the funds and the proposed projects should help the general public. Transparency should be maintained on fund utilisation and the benefits should reach the public speedily, she said.

She said that officials can mull over development of Bal Mandirs, beautification of parks and road medians, development of tennis courts, making government school classroom smart, developing sports infrastructure, free coaching classes for students appearing for NEET, IIT, JEE and other competitive examinations, development of primary health centres and taluk hospitals, setting up of rainwater harvesting projects at schools and hospitals, setting up of bio-toilets at bus stands and market areas, donating washing machines to blind, deaf and dumb school, providing new safety gears to fire personnel, among others.

The officials should walk the extra mile to identify projects that people needed and design their plan accordingly, she said.

142,2020/03/03,Plantation workers worried as elephants roam free,"According to Forest Dept. officers, the elephants are moving to coffee estates in search of food as paddy fields have become empty

The repeated incidents of human-elephant conflict in Sakleshpur taluk have left the people in shock and worry. Planters and workers, busy picking coffee beans, are worried about their safety as more than 55 elephants are roaming in different parts of Sakleshpur, Yeslur and Alur forest ranges. Parents are worried about the safety of their school-going children.

Rapid response teams have been active in all three ranges keeping a track of the elephants’ movement. The teams can alert the people in advance, but cannot drive the animals back to forest areas. When an elephant ransacked a cattle shed at Heggodde in Sakleshpur on Monday morning, members of the team were tracking the herd’s movement and alerting the people around. The people affected have been demanding a permanent solution to the problem. They want all elephants are captured and relocated.

According to officers of the Forest Department, the elephants are moving to coffee estates as paddy fields have become empty. In search of food, they land in coffee estates, leaving the workers in danger. Many planters are deputing a couple of workers to keep an eye on elephants’ movements so that others could continue the work without fear.

As many as 108 local people are part of the rapid response team. Based on the information they collect from the field, they inform planters and workers on the whereabouts of the herds. Depending upon the information, the planters decide whether to take up the work that day or not.

Sivaram Babu, Deputy Conservator of Forests, told The Hindu, “Our teams have been following the herds and keep the local public informed about the elephants’ movements. This exercise has helped avoid man-animal conflicts.”

The department is planning to radio-collar three elephants so that the movement of herds could be tracked effectively. “We have sought the permission to radio-collar the elephants and soon we will conduct the operation”, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/plantation-workers-worried-as-elephants-roam-free/article30972504.ece

145,2020/03/03,KFD cases in Kerala put Mysuru health teams on their toes,"Tribals, and forest and police staff working in areas close to the forests to take precautionary measures against tick bites; health teams put on alert

The health authorities in Mysuru are on their toes with an alert sounded in the bordering areas of the district after two positive cases of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), commonly known as monkey fever, were reported in the neighbouring Mananthavady-Wayanad area in Kerala.

KFD was entirely new in the area but it had been reported among two Kerala residents in January last year who recovered following medication. These two residents had visited a tribal hamlet in the area bordering H.D. Kote taluk.

The monkey fever cases are usually reported from Shivamogga district and some suspected cases had also been reported recently from Chikkamagaluru.

The two recent cases of KFD in Kerala had led the health authorities to step up surveillance against the viral infection, and the forest authorities had been asked to report any unusual deaths of monkeys, particularly langurs.

The health authorities from Mysuru and Wayanad had a joint meeting at Mananthavady on Saturday to discuss the steps to be taken by them in the wake of two confirmed cases and the coordination that needs to be established for checking the further spread of the infection.

Sources in the Health Department said uncontrolled fever for over a week, severe muscle pain, skin rashes, and severe cold were among the primary symptoms of KFD. If the fever does not come under control in 3 to 4 days, it needs to be treated symptomatically like dengue.

The meeting discussed about unravelling the source of the infection besides checking any unusual deaths of monkeys, particularly Grey Langurs, on the Karnataka-Kerala border adjoining H.D. Kote taluk as abnormal deaths were considered a major evidence for authenticating the outbreak of the disease like in Shivamogga district where such deaths had been reported.

The virus infects langurs and the ticks on their bodies suck blood of such infected monkeys, spreading the infection to humans.

But the disease does not spread from humans to humans, according to Chidambar, District Vector-Borne Diseases Control Officer, Mysuru, who attended the meeting along with other health officers. Revenue and health officials from Kerala attended the cross-border meeting.

He told The Hindu that the forest staff, tribals and others living on the forest fringes had been vaccinated against the disease and the booster dose would be given shortly following the scare. Vaccination is given to those on the forest fringes once a year. The forest and the police personnel working in the area had been asked to use tick repellents as a precautionary measure, he added.

Dr. Chidambar said a joint inter-state coordination team had been constituted for working together for surveillance and preventing the disease from spreading further.

149,2020/03/03,"We’ve to continue the fight to realise the dreams of Sharanas, says writer","Need seen for raising one’s voice to help uphold real meaning of values

Expressing concern over the “increasing cases of attributing inverse meaning to values” in present-day Indian society under the domination of right wing forces, progressive writer and activist Siddanagouda Patil stressed the need for raising one’s voice for preserving and upholding the real meaning of values.

“I am very much concerned about the way values are being defined. Mahatma Gandhi’s life and work were seen as a symbol of courage, simplicity and self-respect. Now, it is being projected as that of a coward. Nathuram Godse, who assassinated Gandhi, was seen as an anti-national. Now, he is being projected as a patriot. There was a time when people who raised their voice against the establishment were seen as society’s conscience-keepers and now, they are being labelled as anti-nationals. In this situation, we have to continue to raise our voice against such distortions and fight for preserving and upholding the real meaning of values,” he said.

He was addressing a gathering of progressive activists after receiving the S.S. Alagur Activist Thinker Award presented by Prof. S.S. Alagur Foundation at the S.M. Pandit Rangamandir here on Sunday. In his address, he said that he had received the award on behalf of millions of activists who were fighting for the establishment of an egalitarian society free from all forms of exploitation and oppression.

150,2020/03/03,SBR students excel in future technology,"Innovative teaching methods and exposure to the emerging areas in the field of Science and Technology at the high school level given to the students of Sharanbasaveshwar Residential Public School in Kalaburagi have helped them excel in the field of robotics and space technology.

Students pursuing their education in the seventh to ninth standards in the institution who have been trained in the areas of robotics and machines used in the exploration of space by Bengaluru-based Ahana Systems and Solutions in the last two years have emerged as budding scientists and technocrats.

The students, including Kaif Ahmed Siddique and Abdul Rehman Khan, have assembled working models of humanoids under the guidance of their teachers and expert faculty at Ahana Systems and Solutions.

Two others, Mohammad Mujtaba Kashif of Class 8 and S.R. Prasanna of Class 9, have come out with a lunar rover used for exploration on the Moon and Mars missions. The humanoids and the miniature lunar rower with all sensors and a roving camera in place were the cynosures of all eyes during the Science Cay celebrations. More than 30 humanoids and a few lunar rovers were all around the auditorium where the Science Day was celebrated much to the awe of the audience.

School principal N.S. Devarkal said that it has always been the aim of the school to prepare students in future technology and prepare them to face the challenges in higher education. Nearly 2,000 students of Sharnbasaveshwar Residential Public School and the Appa Public School have trained in these two emerging areas apart from their regular classes.

Mr. Devarkal said that the school was also laying stress on opening windows of education in the basics of Artificial Intelligence, which is another emerging area. The basics of the Python language programme is taught to students.

They have been given exposure to Python Language programme and Artificial Intelligence from the centres of higher education, including IIT Mumbai and IIT Kharagpur.

151,2020/03/03,Expectations high in Vijayapura as CM prepares to present State Budget,"With Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa preparing to present the State Budget on Thursday, expectations from it are high in Vijayapura district.

Since the district is known for horticulture crops and tourism, people here are expecting some major announcements to boost these sectors.

With a major portion of grapes produced in the State being cultivated in the district, farmers here are unhappy with the successive governments for not providing facilities to help them carry on their activities in a sustainable manner.

Fighting for the welfare of grape growers, Abhaykumar Nandrekar, State president of Grape Growers Association, blamed the successive governments for neglecting grape growers.

“We have only one demand, if that is met, it would provide significant help to grape growers. The government should constitute a grape development board on the lines of areca, mango, coconut and lemon development boards,” he said and hoped that the demand would be met in the budget.

The airport project, which has remained on the back burner for long, is another project that the people are hoping will find a place in the budget. It has been over a decade since the foundation stone for the project was laid.

Even after allotting over 700 acres of land for the project, no development has taken place. The airport project is expected to boost tourism and the horticulture sector as it would facilitate arrival of tourists and also direct transportation of horticulture produce.

With regard to the education sector, the demand for a government medical college has intensified in the last five years. Shivanand Patil, who was Health Minister in the previous coalition government, tried to get a collage granted but failed.

The district has three BJP MLAs, and since the BJP is in power, it would be interesting to see whether they put pressure on the government to get the college granted here.

Since Vijayapura district is known for droughts, irrigation facility is the only way to provide water to this parched area.

152,2020/03/03,"NWKRTC fare hike not to affect student, concessional passes","‘However, there will be an increase in general monthly bus pass rate’

The bus fare hike by North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) and the Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System (HD-BRTS) would not affect student and other concessional pass holders but there would be a hike in the prices of the general monthly passes, NWKRTC and HD-BRTS managing director P. Rajendra Cholan has said.

Speaking to presspersons on the sidelines of a function here on Sunday, Mr. Cholan said that excluding GST, the government has effectively allowed HD-BRTS to increase bus fare by an average 17 %.

While the State government has allowed the four transport corporations to increase their bus fares by 12 %, the HD-BRTS had increased the fare roughly by 23 %, including 5 % GST, which will go to the State government.

Mr. Cholan said that stage-wise the HD-BRTS has increased fare by 17 % to 23 %. In other words, the HD-BRTS has increased the fare by ₹ 1.38 per km, where as, actually, it would get only ₹ 1.16 per km for the AC bus service provided. However, the State government has allowed BMTC to increase its AC bus service fare by ₹ 3.48 per km.

Passengers, since February 25, have been paying ₹ 28 (old fare ₹ 24) to use the services between Hubballi and Dharwad.

The hike in bus fares that has come into effect after six years, will help the transport corporation to better its balance sheet that was severely affected due to a steep rise in fuel price and increase in payment of salaries.

The fare hike has helped in increasing HD-BRTS revenue collection.

On the day after the State government approved fare hike, the HD-BRTS collected ₹ 5 lakh.

He also said that people have accepted the service provided by the HD-BRTS and the fare hike would not give any advantage to Bendre Transportation Service which is operating local city services, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nwkrtc-fare-hike-not-to-affect-student-concessional-passes/article30969415.ece

154,2020/03/03,Music varsity still waits for land to set up full-fledged campus,"It continues to function out of an existing 100-year-old building

More than 10 years after its establishment, the Karnataka State Dr. Gangubai Hangal Music and Performing Arts University, in Mysuru, continues to wait for land for a full-fledged campus.

Though the State government allotted land on three occasions, it turned out to be problematic every time and hence the varsity continues to function out of an existing 100-year-old building at Lakshmipuram, which was once a government school.

The varsity, founded in 2008-09, was allotted 100 acres at Varakodu in Varuna hobli a few years ago but it transpired that the land was actually a deemed forest and hence there could be no land conversion.

Sources in the varsity told The Hindu that the issue was discussed at the highest levels in the government but the land could not be acquired.

Subsequently, nearly 40 acres were allotted at Dharmapura near Hunsur, almost 45 km from Mysuru.

However, there is no proposal to set up a campus there for the present. Sources said it is fine to establish a gurukula for resident scholars for practice and research but not for day-time classes owing to logistical issues and the distance from the city. The Mysuru Urban Development Authority (MUDA) allotted 10 acres at Sathagalli on the outskirts of the city. But this too is fraught with issues. High tension overhead cables have been drawn across the land. Besides, 10 acres is not sufficient to establish a varsity campus, sources added.

Hence, the varsity is expected to continue on the existing premises for a few more years. Meanwhile, Minister for Higher Education Ashwath Narayan has promised to pay a visit to the varsity to apprise himself of the issues and resolve them.

Also, the varsity does not have a full-time Vice-Chancellor for almost two years. The recruitment to fill the sanctioned strength of 15 full-time staff members is still a work in process.

However, the lack of a full-fledged campus has not affected the growth of the varsity, which has 331 students for the degree course and 161 students for the six-month evening course leading to a certificate. But as a major initiative, the university is set to take its unique courses in classical music and performing arts to different parts of the State from the new academic year.

Sources said that the university’s academic council and the syndicate has given concurrence to launch the regional centres at Dharwad, Kalaburagi, Mangaluru, Bengaluru, and Belagavi. “We have sent the proposal to the government for final approval and after that the divisional centres will start functioning,” said the officials.

The varsity will enter into MoUs with local colleges for affiliation and the use of their premises, the officials added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/p70gaj/article30966581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3BGMUSIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/music-varsity-still-waits-for-land-to-set-up-full-fledged-campus/article30966582.ece

Two maritime academies will be started in Kannur and Thalassery from this academic year and four more in other places soon, Kerala State Maritime Board chairman V.J. Mathew has said.

Classes have begun in the existing academies in Kollam and Kodungalloor. New academies would come up in Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha, Kochi and Kasaragod. A maximum of 40 students would be admitted for the courses, he told The Hindu during his visit to the Azheekal port in Kannur on Tuesday.

Short-term courses to groom students to be lascar, first class master, second master, first class driver and second master driver would be conducted in these academies. The courses have been started as per the Kerala Inland Vessel rules and these would help the students find jobs in inland vessels.

162,2020/03/03,Kerala order on biotech criterion put on hold,"Eligibility for botany and zoology teaching posts

Stung by criticisms from various quarters, the government on Tuesday decided to freeze its contentious decision to permit postgraduation in biotechnology as an eligibility qualification for botany and zoology teaching posts. The Higher Education Department, which received numerous representations in protest against its earlier move, has issued an order to suspend all related activities until any further decisions are taken on the issue.

The government had issued an order on the basis of a recommendation made by the State-Level Academic Committee, which had considered representations from two MSc Biotechnology holders.

Intervention

The intervention came following numerous rejections by the Board of Studies of various universities which had ruled that biotechnology could not be considered an allied subject of botany or zoology.

Official sources had maintained that the three subjects, along with others, were recognised as part of the discipline of life sciences. Besides, a common National Eligibility Test which formed the basis for appointment to zoology and botany teaching posts applied for biotechnology as well.

163,2020/03/03,Railways mull Tejas Express for Kozhikode,"Service proposed primarily for rail commuters of the city

A proposal of Southern Railway to operate the semi-high-speed Tejas Express in the Mangaluru- Kozhikode- Coimbatore route is expected to give a fillip to the transportation network in north Kerala. If introduced, it will be the first Tejas Express to run in the State.

The proposal is to operate the train six days a week, except Mondays. With one commercial stop at Kozhikode, the service will benefit daytime passengers in the sector.

Nascent stage

Railway sources say the proposal of the inter-city train service is in its infancy though the mechanical department of the Salem division and the Palakkad division have worked out the feasibility of the service. A final decision on operating the service would be taken only after getting the approval of the Railway Board.

One of the reasons for not hastily going ahead with the proposal is that the Mangaluru Central station has to facilitate the primary maintenance of the new train. The sources say the existing pit line at the Mangaluru station is saturated. But steps are being taken to set up a new pit line at the station. Another is the issue of the inadequate number of platforms there.

The non-availability of platforms is forcing the authorities to terminate intra-Karnataka trains at other stations than Mangaluru Central. Besides, a lobby in Mangaluru is against using the station for north Kerala commuters, the sources said.

The train had been proposed primarily for the benefit of rail commuters of Kozhikode, the sources said.

The railway authorities have not decided on the fares. The coaches of Tejas Express will be fully air-conditioned.

The train will have an executive class chair car and regular air conditioned chair chairs.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mikc06/article30975827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tv-railTejascol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/railways-mull-tejas-express-for-kozhikode/article30975800.ece

Even as road accidents continue unabated in Kottayam, a joint team of officials on Tuesday visited the 10 ‘high risk accident black spots’ on roads in the district to assess the ground condition and recommend corrective action.

The team comprises officers of the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC), Motor Vehicles Department, Police and the Public Works Department.

Flaws

During the examination, the officials inspected the black spots, starting from the Lalam bridge junction in Pala to Thottuva and Thuruthy junctions on Main Central Road and identified several flaws in road design and other factors.

Of the 10 black spots identified in the district, five of them are on Main Central Road.

While Kuravilanagadu accounted for three black spots, Ettumanur and Changanassery followed with two each.

According to officials, each of the black spots were identified based on the occurrence of five or more fatal or 10 grievous accidents between 2016 and 2018.

Commenting on the initiative, Tojo M. Thomas, Regional Transport Officer (Enforcement), said the problems highlighted included road banks, steep gradients, sharp turns, and blind spots. Similarly, the absence of road accessories, including signages, road markings, rumbling strips and blinker signals, also contribute to the accidents.

Detailed report

“NATPAC will prepare a detailed report regarding each of these locations by taking into account our suggestions and submit it for consideration of the Kerala Road Safety Authority. The agency, in turn, will give directions to the agencies concerned with regard to the steps for rectifying these black spots,” he said.

A decision to survey these locations was made during a meeting convened by the Principal Secretary of Transport recently. The inspection on Tuesday will be followed by a detailed survey to identify the precautionary measures to be initiated for avoiding the rising number of accidents.

Earlier last month, District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu sent a letter to the NATPAC director seeking its assistance in reviewing the reasons behind the accidents and to suggest directions to prevent causalties on roads. Based on this, the agency conducted a primary survey at locations where accidents are concentrated.

As per estimates, the roads of Kottayam have claimed over 30 lives in the first two months of 2020.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6g6ljy/article30975651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tvktNATPAC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kottayam-accident-black-spots-inspected/article30975652.ece
167,2020/03/03,TDB chief flays move to limit Vallasadya,"Decision to restrict Vallasadya

The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has taken exception to a decision of the Palliyoda Seva Sanghom (PSS) to restrict the number of Vallasadya (feast) at Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple to 10 a day.

Responding to a report in The Hindu, TDB president N.Vasu on Tuesday said the PSS was not entitled to take any decision on matters relating to offerings made by devotees to the TDB temple.

The TDB had engaged the PSS too in conducting the Vallasadya at the temple when the former faced a financial crisis, Mr. Vasu said adding that it could not be considered as a right to take unilateral decisions.

Mr. Vasu said the board was getting only a meagre revenue by way of the rent for the Oottupura (dining hall) and the Nadappanthal from the PSS for conducting the ritualistic feast there.

In devotees’ interest

PSS secretary P.R. Radhakrishnan said the sanghom had been organising the Vallasadya, in liaison with the TDB, over the past several years. He said the PSS decision was in the interests of devotees and aimed at smooth conduct of the ritualistic offering at the temple.

He said the PSS remitted ₹1.36 crore to the TDB towards rent for the Oottupura for conducting the Vallasadya in the past four years.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tdb-chief-flays-move-to-limit-vallasadya/article30975649.ece
168,2020/03/03,Efforts on to get GI tag for Onattukara sesame,"Studies by research station under KAU have found that oilseeds grown in the region have added medicinal values

The Onattukara Regional Agricultural Research Station (ORARS), Kayamkulam, along with the Intellectual Property Rights Cell (IPR Cell) of the Kerala Agricultural University (KAU), has started efforts to secure Geographical Indication (GI) tag for Onattukara sesame.

Studies conducted at the ORARS under the KAU have revealed that the oilseeds grown at Onattukara have added medicinal values.

Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar says the GI tag would make Onattukara sesame popular across the globe. “The State government is trying to get GI registration for agricultural products like Onattukara sesame. It will increase its market value and benefit farmers in a great way,” Mr. Kumar says. The Agriculture Department has initiated measures to revive sesame farming in Onattukara.

After 12 years

Although, once known for its sesame cultivation and production, the farmers had shelved the practice owing to low yield and lack of support. However, after a gap of 12 years, the Thamarakulam grama panchayat has joined hands with farmers to revive sesame farming in the region. Around 50 farmers under the Thenginal Vayal Nellulpadaka Samithi and Kannanakuzhi Arya Nellulpadhana Samithi had undertaken sesame farming in 23 acres last month. While farmers under the Thenginal samithi have sown seeds in 13 acres, the Kannanakuzhi samithi is carrying out sesame farming in 10 acres of land.

The Agriculture Department has given seeds free of cost. The farmers engaged in sesame farming are set to receive ₹7,000 per hectare as financial aid from the panchayat. In addition to it, the State Agriculture Department will provide farmers ₹5,000 per hectare. The harvest is expected in May. Officials say the sesame cultivation would be expanded to more areas with an aim to increase its production.

The IPR Cell has helped obtain GI tag for agricultural products including Marayur jaggery, Chengalikodan nendran banana, Central Travancore jaggery, Kaipad rice, Jeerakasala rice, Gandhakasala rice, Pokkali rice, and Vazhakulam pineapple.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/8bgjis/article30975646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4tvalsesame,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/efforts-on-to-get-gi-tag-for-onattukara-sesame/article30975647.ece

170,2020/03/03,HC allows Arooja’s School students to write exams,"Declaration of their results will be subject to further orders of the court

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday directed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to permit as many as 34 class X students of Arooja's Little Star School, Thoppumpady in Kochi to write the remaining CBSE examinations provisionally.

A Bench comprising Justice A.M. Shaffique and Justice V.G. Arun, while issuing the interim order, observed that the declaration of their results would be subject to further orders of the court.

The court also permitted four Class X students of Al-Azhar Public school, Palluruthi, to write the ongoing Board examinations. The next examinations would be held on March 4, 12 and 18.

TocH Public School, Vyttila, Kochi, has been allotted as an exam centre for Arooja’s School students while the four students of Al-Azhar School can write their examinations at Bhavan’s Adarsh Vidyalaya, Kakkanad.

The interim order was issued on an appeal filed by the students of Arooja’s Little Star School, challenging a single judge’s order declining the students’ plea to allow them to write the remaining CBSE exams which began on February 24.

Students’ plea

When the petition came up for hearing, T.Sanjay, Counsel for the students argued that the single judge should have taken into consideration the urgency of the matter and allowed the pleas of the students. In fact, the delay in allowing their pleas would jeopardise their future as the examinations had already begun.

The single judge’s repeated directives to the CBSE to file affidavit one after another did not address the issues faced by the students.

The petitioners said that the students and their parents were kept in the dark by the school management till the very last minute about the affiliation. The students should not lose one year for the failure of the authorities in inspecting the school functioning.

The CBSE counsel submitted that the school was functioning without the recognition of the State government. In fact, several CBSE schools were functioning without complying with the norms prescribed by the board.

The court orally observed that if it was found that the Arooja’s School was functioning without the norms prescribed by the CBSE, the decision of the court would not be in favour of the students.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-allows-aroojas-school-students-to-write-exams/article30974046.ece
171,2020/03/03,Kunjali Marakkar biopic runs into controversy,"Zamorin’s naval chieftain’s descendants seek stay on film

A descendant of Kunjali Marakkar has filed a writ petition in the Kerala High Court seeking to stop the release of the upcoming Mohanlal-starrer Arabikadalinte Simham (Marakkar: Lion of the Arabian Sea) based on Kunjali Marakkar IV, the naval chieftain of the Zamorin of Calicut, “for distorting the history” of the 16th century hero.

The suit, filed by Mufeeda Arafath Marakkar, wife of Muhammed Yaser Arafath Marakkar of Koyilandy, says the big-budget moview with mega stars “disseminates a wrong message to scholars and researchers” through a perverted version of the history of the Marakkars.

The epic historical drama, said to be the most expensive Malayalam film ever made, directed by Priyadarshan is scheduled for release on March 26.

The petitioner alleges that the film offends the religious sentiments of Muslims by showing the great martyr in poor light. Kunjali Marakkar is portrayed as a romantic hero and “a dancer singing songs with women.”

The history of Kunjali Marakkar is a component of the school curriculum and if this version is exhibited it would have a serious impact on the minds of the children in their formative years.

To ascertain the authentic history and trace minute details, the respondents have failed to approach or consult the descendants of Kunjali Marakkar who reside in Kottakkal and other areas of Koyilandy taluk. Kunjali Marakkar IV was a bachelor and had no love affairs in his life. But a leaflet published by the respondents shows vulgar scenes of the great martyr, bringing disgrace to his family.

Distorted history

The movie shows the perverted attire of Kunjali Marakkar. He was a pious Muslim and his attire was according to the religious tenets of his time. However, the leaflet shows him sporting an image of Lord Ganapaty in the centre of his turban. As pointed out by Portuguese historians, Kunjali Marakkar and his 40 lieutenants were promised pardon by the Portuguese if they embraced Christianity but they opted death to conversion. In movie fiction is allowed to a lesser extent, but it cannot distort the original history. The Central Board of Film Certification has given a U/A certificate for the movie without application of mind.

The petitioner’s father-in-law P.V. Muhammed was a research scholar and has written a book in Malayalam, Ariyappedatha Kunjali Marakkar, and it was edited by the petitioner’s husband and published by Kunjali Marakkar Smaraka Vedi , Kottakkal, in May 2015.

The petition names the Union of India; the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting; chairman, CBFC; Regional Officer, CBFC; State Home Department; M.J. Antony (Antony Perumbavoor), producer; chairman, Confidential Group; Priyadarshan, film director; and film distributors as respondents.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/orw3jz/article30976106.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tvkunjalimarakkarstill02,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kunjali-marakkar-biopic-runs-into-controversy/article30973685.ece
172,2020/03/03,MCC embroiled in row over student’s suicide,"Student from Punjab killed himself following denial of permission to write exam due to attendance shortage

Malabar Christian College (MCC) here has been embroiled in a row since Sunday after one of its students hailing from Punjab committed suicide following denial of permission to write his semester examination due to attendance shortage.

Jaspreet Singh was pursuing BA in Economics. He did not have the attendance as mandated by Calicut University’s regulations to write the final semester exam. His family members accuse the college authorities of being unsympathetic to his plea for a relaxation in the norm citing domestic problems, but the Principal and other teachers claim they have only followed the regulations.

The Kerala Students Union took out a march to the campus on Tuesday. Following a minor scuffle, its activists were arrested by the police. The Students Federation of India had staged a protest the previous day.

Family’s charge

An inconsolable Manmohan Singh, Jaspreet’s father, told media on Tuesday morning that the Principal and college authorities were adamant even after they requested them to let Jaspreet write the exam. His sisters Balvind Kaur and Gurpreet Kaur pointed out that Jaspreet’s request to make up the attendance shortage was not considered even after a medical certificate was produced. When Jaspreet approached the university authorities, they clarified that it was up to the Principal to grant permission to write the exam.

Godwin Samraj, Principal, however, denied the allegations and said there had been no discrimination against the student. He told a press meet in the afternoon that every student should have 75% attendance to be eligible to attend the semester exam. Students could be granted 20% relaxation on medical grounds. This could be utilised as 10% each during two semesters or 20% as a one-time measure.

Mr. Samraj pointed out that Jaspreet had already utilised the second option. “The family members never approached me or the grievance redressal cell. Though someone had called me to ask about Jaspreet, I don’t recall his name,” the Principal said. Students can check their attendance status every day using their login ID and password.

Louis J. Kattady, Head of the Department of Economics, claimed that nobody from Jaspreet’s family had spoken to him.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mcc-embroiled-in-row-over-students-suicide/article30972720.ece
173,2020/03/03,Move against illegal houseboats comes a cropper,"Not many vessels turn up for survey by KMB, Ports Department

The latest move to bring houseboats without registration on board the licensing system has failed miserably. Only 39 vessels including 19 houseboats and 20 shikara boats have turned up for a survey conducted under the aegis of the Kerala Maritime Board (KMB) and Ports Department in Alappuzha recently.

“Earlier, a meeting convened by the Chief Minister decided to bring all illegal houseboats on board the licensing system. Following this, we received 667 applications for registration in an adalat conducted last year. However, 242 applicants failed to produce necessary documents or appear for the survey as part of the registration process. On February 27, 2020 it was further decided to give them a last chance to register with the Alappuzha Port of Registry. However, only a small number of boats have come up for the survey,” says an official with the Ports Department.

The official added that it was now up for the government to decide on the action against houseboats and other vessels operating flouting norms.

Drive fails

Earlier last week, a drive conducted to seize unregistered houseboats also came a cropper. The Ports Department officials said that they were forced to abandon the drive midway following a “direction from the top echelons of the district administration.”

The move was in the wake of recurring incidents involving houseboats on the Vembanad Lake.

According to the Ports Department, the licensing authority, the number of registered houseboats in the backwaters stood at 775. However, they are clueless about the actual number of illegal houseboats.

Attitude of authorities

“The failed drive against the illegal houseboats shows the lackadaisical attitude of the authorities towards a critical issue. To bring order in the houseboat sector, the government should act tough against illegal operations. It should also restrict houseboats registered in other districts from operating in the waters of Alappuzha. The illegal houseboats are eating into the business of genuine operators and the industry is on the verge of collapse,” says Kevin Rozario, general secretary, All Kerala Houseboat Owners and Operators Samiti. Meanwhile, District Collector M. Anjana has convened a meeting later this week to discuss illegal houseboat operations and safety issues.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/move-against-illegal-houseboats-comes-a-cropper/article30972499.ece

178,2020/03/03,Kozhikode metro a distant dream?,"Question arises whether the tier-two city needs big-ticket projects

Every city aspires for a dream project. A big dream of Kozhikode has been a rail-based mass rapid transport system, which could overcome the imbalance of vehicle population and land use in the city.

Such a project would have been a game changer for the city and its suburbs. At least, many thought so. The ambitious monorail project, initiated more than a decade ago, was proposed initially. The proposal that gained traction following the visit of delegations from Singapore Mass Rapid Transit Train Limited and Kuala Lumpur Monorail to the city in mid-2000s was presented as an answer to traffic congestion in the city.

The plan to establish a 23.5-km monorail from Kozhikode Medical College to Ramanattukkara in two phases at a cost of ₹920 crore gained momentum when the State government roped in E. Sreedharan, former managing director of Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), to head the project. The first phase of the project was to commence in January 2014.

The ball was set in motion with the opening of a project office in the city in April 2012. The government formed a company with the Chief Minister as chairman and other ministers and heads of departments as directors. Perhaps, what forced the government to shelve the project was its huge estimated cost. Bombardier Transportation (Holdings) USA Inc, the lone bidder, had quoted ₹10,392 crore, instead of the estimated ₹5,581 crore, for monorail projects for both Kozhikode and Thiruvananthapuram.

Consequently, then government decided to set up a light rapid transit system (light metro) in August 2014. It is another matter that the ₹2,500-crore light metro project is yet to obtain clearance from the Public Investment Board. Also, the reluctance on the part of the State government to sign the turnkey consultancy agreement for preparatory work for the transit system forced DMRC to pull out of the project and shut down its office in Kozhikode three years ago. Had the project been started on time, it would have been a reality in 2021.

It is only reasonable to ask whether the project was conceived considering the urban context of Kozhikode. Studies on mass rapid transport systems for urban areas showed that each city had different choices such as metro rail, light rail transit, monorail, bus rapid transit system, and personal rapid transit. In all modes, peak hour peak direction traffic (PHPDT) on the proposed corridor, population of the city agglomeration, and the average trip length are the given criteria.

Kozhikode does not qualify in any of these as PHPDT is 20,000 here as of 2030, and the city population should be in the range of 10 lakh to 20 lakh as per the 2001 Census. Question arises whether Kozhikode, a tier-two city, needs big ticket projects.

The government ought to have given preference to strengthening and encouraging public transportation and improving infrastructure such as construction and expansion of roads and flyovers in and around the city to ease traffic snarls.

179,2020/03/03,Conditional nod for parading tusker,"Ban on Thechikkottukavu Ramachandran after it killed two persons last year

The District Monitoring Committee of Captive Elephants Management and Maintenance has given conditional permission for parading elephant Thechikkottukavu Ramachandran during festivals.

The committee has imposed conditions for parading the elephant, which enjoys a huge fan following, considering a wound on its right hind limb.

For two months

The permission has been given on trial basis for two months. The main conditions are: people should be kept five metres away from the elephant while parading, it can be paraded for festivals in Thrissur and Palakkad districts alone, and there should be a gap of two days between parades.

The parading of the elephant will be under strict surveillance of the monitoring committee. Four mahouts should accompany the elephant while it is being paraded. Fitness tests should be done every week. Thechikkottukavu Devaswom officials should give the schedule for the parading of the elephant in advance to the monitoring committee.

The Devaswom will be responsible for any damage caused by the elephant if it went unruly. No reception or other such programmes should be held while the elephant is brought for the festivals. The Divisional Forest Officer and veterinary doctors in the area should be informed when the elephant is paraded.

Affidavit to Collector

180,2020/03/03,Opinion | The ‘patronising’ Dravidian movement,"The DMK has failed to condemn the recent remarks by its MP R. S. Bharathi on Dalit appointees to the Madras HC

The recent remarks by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Rajya Sabha MP R.S. Bharathi that the appointments of members of Scheduled Castes as Judges of the Madras High Court was nothing but “alms provided by the Dravidian movement”, only reflects the patronising attitude of the leaders of the Dravidian movement.

In fact, late DMK leader and former Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi would often publicly state that he was a sambandhi of Dalits (a reference to the marriage of his son M. K. Alagiri to a woman belonging to a Scheduled Caste). He would also list out Dalits who were appointed to top bureaucratic positions in his government.

Dalit uplift neglected

This attitude should be placed against the backdrop of the criticism that the Dravidian movement, despite its remarkable contribution to social reforms, represented the interests of those who came next, after the Brahmins, that is the intermediate castes on the caste social ladder, but paid little attention for the uplift of Dalits.

The fact remains that members of Scheduled Castes have had to contend with less important posts in Dravidian party organisations and in the government. DMK MP A. Raja, who held the powerful portfolio of Communications and Information Technology at the Centre, may be the only exception.

‘Common mindset’

When asked about Mr. Bharathi’s comments, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi leader Thol. Thirumavalavan said though his [Mr. Bharathi’s] intention was not to insult [Dalits], it only manifested the common mindset and psyche of Hindu society.

“Mr. Bharathi had actually responded to critics who have been holding the Dravidian movement responsible for all the degeneration. But Dalits secured all their rights through the Constitution and not through an individual or a party,” Mr. Thirumavalavan said.

C. Lakshmanan, Associate Professor, Madras Institute of Development Studies (MIDS) pointed out that though Mr. Bharathi did not mean to be derogatory, the way he extended the debate was not good.

“He should have expressed regret for saying something unconsciously. But in a later interview to a television channel, he further deteriorated the debate by saying that his driver and cook were Dalits,” Dr. Lakshmanan pointed out.

He felt that it was not just the Dravidian movement, “but all those engaging with self-respect, human dignity, democracy, Left and emancipatory politics, should be doubly conscious of their subconscious, where the relationships are stored in terms of master-slave, superior-inferior, giver-receiver and pure-impure”.

‘Extensively compromised’

“In the early stages of the Dravidian movement, when electoral politics was not a part of the agenda, sensitivity was very much there. When power politics, particularly electoral politics, occupied the centrestage, self-respect, which is the most important element underpinning the Dravidian movement, was extensively compromised,” Dr. Lakshmanan explained.

“What is disturbing is the failure of the DMK leadership to condemn Mr. Bharathi in no uncertain terms,” Prof. Lakshmanan said.

Writer Imayam, justifying Mr. Bharathi’s comments, said that but for the Justice Party and the Dravidian movement, Tamil Nadu would have “remained a backwater in social development, like Bihar and Odisha”.

“Tamil Nadu could take strides in the fields of science, education, health and transport because of the Dravidian movement. It set an example for the entire country by introducing reservation in education and employment,” said Mr. Imayam, who identifies himself as a writer on the Dravidian movement.

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami launched the Tamil Nadu Health System Reform Programme (TNHSRP) in Chennai on Tuesday. The Programme will be implemented with funding support from the World Bank.

The Programme aims at achieving result-oriented outcomes in healthcare delivery and over a five-year period, aims to improve the quality of care, strengthen the management of non-communicable diseases (NCD) and injuries, and reduce the inequities in reproductive and child health services in the State. The total cost of the programme is ₹2,857.003 crore, of which ₹1,999.902 crore is being funded by the World Bank.

He said facilities in government hospitals and primary health centres will be enhanced, ambulance services upgraded and a suicide prevention hotline will be set up. “By 2030 we want to reduce maternal mortality rate in the State, which is already low compared to the rest of the country, to 30,” he said.

Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam said with the implementation of the TNHSRP, government hospitals will be able to provide health services on par with the best private hospitals. Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar explained some of the features of the Programme.

Dr. Junaid Kamal Ahmed, Country Director, World Bank, lauded Tamil Nadu’s healthcare system and said the Bank through this programme supports moves towards quality of health, deals with NCDs and last-mile delivery to close equity gaps. He said the World Bank was bringing in global expertise and capacity support and this was the first Program-for-Results (PforR) project for the Bank in India and the first for Tamil Nadu.

“We hope Tamil Nadu becomes the lighthouse for supporting health reforms across India. The biggest partner for World Bank for all projects across India is Tamil Nadu,” he added.

The proposed activities under the Programme include improving quality of care in all government health institutions, including interventions to address quality of care in primary, secondary and tertiary-level facilities, NQAS and NABH quality accreditation of select hospitals and primary health centres, interventions for screening, diagnosis, treatment and management of NCDs, an improved mental health programme, reduction of deaths due to road traffic accidents and strengthening of reproductive and child health programmes.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/90vtns/article30970485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03MARTH--CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/edappadi-launches-tamil-nadu-health-system-reform-programme/article30970486.ece
183,2020/03/03,High Court summons Director of Fisheries,"The Madras High Court on Monday summoned the Director of Fisheries to appear before it on March 16 to explain how the State spent the ₹300 crore allotted by the Centre under the Blue Revolution-Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries scheme for rehabilitation of fishermen arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy on the charge of crossing the maritime border.

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar also directed the State government to file a detailed counter affidavit to a public interest litigation petition filed by Fishermen Care, a non-governmental organisation, represented by its president L.T.A. Peter Ryan, seeking funds for rehabilitation of affected fishermen.

They wanted to know when the funds were received from the Centreand how they were spent.

In its counter affidavit filed last month, the Centre told the court that it had released ₹184.93 crore in the last five years to the State government for the implementation of the Blue Revolution-Integrated Development and Management of Fisheries scheme. Further, another ₹300 crore was allocated for providing assistance for deep sea fishing and constructing a fish landing centre at Kunthukal in Ramanathapuram district.

A specific advice had also been issued to the State government to give priority to fishermen, who had lost their boats, while granting assistance, it said. The scheme was being implemented for the benefit of fishermen belonging to Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Pudukottai and Ramanathapuram and those who fish in the Palk Bay region. They were being provided financial assistance for provision of housing, drinking water and construction of community halls, it said.

The fishermen were also being trained in deep sea fishing, long lining and on-board processing of fish and the Centrally sponsored scheme provides for conversion of trawlers into resource specific deep-sea fishing vessels through 100% subsidy with a ceiling of ₹15 lakh per vessel, the Centre said.

It also informed the court that since 2015 Sri Lanka had stopped releasing boats of Indian fishermen apprehended on charges of trespassing into foreign waters and involving in illegal fishing.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yj7rnp/article30976515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MadrasHighCourtvg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-summons-director-of-fisheries/article30967097.ece

The Tamil Nadu Information Commission has directed the Health Department to respond to a petitioner who sought to know whether a doctor performing eye surgeries at the district headquarters hospital in Perambalur had passed a post-graduate course and registered himself with the Medical Council of India.

He sought details of patients who underwent eye surgeries in the hospital and a copy of the government proceedings permitting the surgical ophthalmologist to perform the surgeries.

He alleged that the doctor in question had not passed the postgraduate course and also not registered with the MCI (now National Medical Commission). State Information Commissioner S. Selvaraj observed that complete information was not provided to the petitioner.

After the Office Superintendent, Office of the Joint Director of Health Services, who represented the PIO, requested 15 days’ time to give the complete details, the Commission directed him to send the reply, including details of patients on whom the doctor performed eye surgeries from the date of his joining service till November 12, 2018, to the petitioner within one month.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-information-commission-asks-health-department-to-provide-details-of-doctor/article30967056.ece
185,2020/03/03,"GST evasion amounting to over ₹3,000 crore detected in Tamil Nadu","₹1,513 cr. recovered and 29 arrested, says data tabled in Lok Sabha

As many as 1,004 cases of evasion of Goods and Services Tax (GST), adding up to ₹3,223.54 crore, were detected in Tamil Nadu and nearly 50% of the amount had been recovered, according to data presented in Parliament.

The data pertains to the period from July 2017 to January 2020 and the cases were booked by Central GST authorities.

Anurag Singh Thakur, Union Minister of State for Finance, presented the data in a written reply in the Lok Sabha to a query by Dean Kuriakose (Congress). As per the data, ₹1,513.83 crore had been recovered in the State and 29 arrests had been made and one case was being prosecuted in court.

“There is no evidence to suggest that tax evasion has increased after the implementation of GST. However, the government is vigilant on the issue of tax evasion,” the Minister said in his reply.

He said that efforts were on to curb evasion in GST with the help of inputs from Directorate General of Analytics and Risk Management (DGARM).

Measures initiated

The Directorate-General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) and the Central GST field formations were initiating various other measures in this regard, including checking evasion through the e-way bill mechanism and taking action on specific intelligence, Mr. Thakur added.

Last year, D. Jayakumar, Fisheries Minister and State’s representative in the GST Council, had pointed out that the growing number of tax evasion cases was a cause for concern and had requested traders to desist from indulging in unhealthy practices.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/gst-evasion-amounting-to-over-3000-crore-detected-in-tamil-nadu/article30967034.ece

The Madras High Court on Monday refused to grant interim relief to S. Seeman, 53, chief coordinator of Naam Tamilar Katchi, on a petition filed by him to quash a criminal defamation case lodged by the State for reportedly likening Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to a “mason” who acts as per the instructions of the Centre.

Justice G.K. Ilanthiraiyan refused to pass order after Additional Public Prosecutor M. Mohamed Riyaz said the interview given by the petitioner to various TV channels on July 14 last year was per se defamatory in nature and directly relates to the public functions discharged by the Chief Minister.

However, in his petition, the NTK leader refuted the charge of having committed criminal defamation and alleged that the complaint had been lodged only due to political vendetta. He claimed that the intention of the government in invoking Section 499 (criminal defamation) of Indian Penal Code was to curtail freedom of speech and expression.

“The statement made by the petitioner is not a defamatory interview but only a criticism which was made to create awareness amongst the public in good faith and it is in decent and respectful language. The right of criticism cannot be atrophied by constant launching of criminal prosecution for defamation on each and every issue to silence the critics.

“The complaint filed against the petitioner is an absolute misuse of power by the State machinery...

187,2020/03/03,Vacate stay on buying unwanted temple land: State government to High Court,"State argues that the properties purchased will be used for granting house site pattas to the poor

The State government on Monday urged the Madras High Court to vacate an interim stay granted last year on the government’s decision to purchase unwanted temple land for granting house site pattas to the poor. It said the intention was to purchase only around 600 acres out of 4.78 lakh acres of temple lands in the State and distribute it to some 20,000 landless families, with each getting about three cents.

Appearing before a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy, Advocate General (A-G) Vijay Narayan said a government order issued on August 30 last year provides for regularisation of residential encroachments on unobjectionable government lands and provision of alternative house sites to the landless poor who had been occupying objectionable government lands for years together. The decision was taken since it was the State’s duty to provide house sites to poor families, most of whom belong to the Scheduled Castes, and who could not afford to buy house sites on their own and assist them in building houses through schemes such as Prime Minister’s Gramin Awaaz Yojana. Though the government had taken the decision in 2018 itself, the implementation got delayed due to intervening elections.

A recent survey found that it many districts, including the delta districts of Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam, there were absolutely no freehold land available to put up dwelling units and the government had to necessarily purchase unwanted temple lands to provide such facilities to the poor.

Survey findings

“As per the survey, 19,717 poor families are living in 13,156 huts and 6,561 tiled dwelling units on temple lands.

“Apart from these huts and dwelling units located on lands under the control of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department, another 2,355 poor families were residing in 748 huts and 1,507 tiled units on other temple lands. Nagapattinam district alone has 10,908 huts and Tiruvarur, 6,773 huts on encroached temple lands. There are also some villages where almost the entire extent of land is owned by temples,” the A-G said.

Making it clear that most of the temple lands under encroachment were not fetching enough income required for performance of pujas in temples, Mr. Narayan said the government would be paying a handsome amount to those institutions. He also stated that the decision to sell the lands would be taken by the HR&CE department Commissioner on a case by case basis and not through a blanket order.

‘Fiercely independent’

Asserting that the HR&CE Department had always been fiercely independent in its decision-making process and it had in the past rejected proposals for acquiring certain temple lands even for Tangedco and construction of government hospitals, the A-G said, “The department had taken decisions based on best interests of the temple and not simply toed the line of the government.”

188,2020/03/03,HC takes a different view of maternity leave for govt. servants,"‘Women having more than one kid from first delivery not entitled’

Taking a view contrary to the one taken consistently by many single judges of the Madras High Court since 2010, the first Division Bench of the court, led by its Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi, has now held that women government employees are not entitled to 180 days of paid maternity leave for their second delivery if they had given birth to more than one baby during their first delivery and if all those children were surviving.

Laying stress on the words “with less than two surviving children” found in the Central Civil Services (Leave) Rules of 1972, the Bench, also comprising Justice Subramonium Prasad, said those who had begotten twins, triplets or quadruplets in the first delivery would not be entitled to full paid maternity leave benefits for their next delivery since the intention of the rule makers was to restrict the pecuniary benefits depending upon the number of children and not number of deliveries.

Even otherwise, it is a debatable subject as to whether a delivery in which a woman gives birth to twins or more babies could be technically termed as a single delivery, the Bench said.

“When twins are born, they are delivered one after another. Their age and inter-se elderly status are also determined by virtue of the gap of time between their arrivals which amounts to two deliveries and not one simultaneous act,” the judges said and expressed their disinclination to elaborate any further.

Ruling set aside

The judgment was passed while setting aside an order passed by a single judge on June 18, 2019 for grant of paid maternity leave of 180 days to M. Asiya Begum, a Sub Inspector in Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), for her second delivery in 2017 though she had given birth to twins during her first delivery in 2015. “Without taking note of the rules and the aforesaid facts, the learned single judge appears to have extended the benefit erroneously,” the Bench concluded.

Senior Central Government Standing Counsel K. Srinivasa Murthy pointed out that the single judge had simply followed a series of decisions rendered by three other single judges of the High Court in cases related to State government service rules, which had also restricted the 180 days of paid maternity leave benefit only to women government servants with less than two surviving children. The single judges had interpreted the service rule to mean that women should be accorded the benefit of paid maternity leave for at least two deliveries irrespective of the number of babies delivered.

Otherwise, “it may produce ridiculous results. To cite an example, if during the first delivery, a woman government servant delivers a single child and by the second delivery if she delivers twins or triplets, then should she be disqualified,” one of the judges had asked.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/w4qngw/article30966948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MadrasHighCourtvg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-takes-a-different-view-of-maternity-leave-for-govt-servants/article30966907.ece
189,2020/03/03,Road accidents in Cuddalore drop by 6.39% in 2019,"Awareness campaigns, zero-tolerance rule enforcement by police yield results

The district has witnessed a 6.39% dip in road accidents in 2019 compared to 2018. Increased enforcement and sustained awareness campaigns carried out by the Cuddalore district police have started yielding results.

According to statistics available with the Cuddalore police, the number of fatal accidents decreased from from 415 in 2018 to 403 in 2019. The number of non-fatal accidents declined from 3,048 in 2018 to 2,421 in 2019. The police prepared a database of accidents in the district over the last three years, including information on accident-prone stretches, the nature of accidents and the time they occurred.

The police identified 71 ‘black spots’ across the district. A study conducted by the traffic police revealed that the Cuddalore-Salem National Highway, Cuddalore to Panruti Road and the stretch of the East Coast Road from Reddichavadi to Chidambaram were the most accident-prone stretches in the district.

Poor road engineering

Majority of the accidents took place either due to lack of awareness or poor road engineering at road intersections and highways.

The police installed solar blinkers and high frequency LEDs in strategic areas along national highways to avoid road mishaps and to strengthen the road signalling system.

“Road safety awareness campaigns, cracking down on usage of cell phones while driving and enforcing helmet rule helped reduce road accidents. The police adopted a zero-tolerance approach towards towards traffic violations. The number of cases booked against talking on mobile phones while driving and not wearing a helmet registered an increase of 100% when compared with the previous year,” Superintendent of Police M. Sree Abhinav said.

Police booked as many as 4,19,968 cases under the Motor Vehicle Act in 2019 as against 2,37,298 cases in 2018. Since 2018, the compound fee collected in the form of fines for various traffic violations has increased. While ₹3.53 crore was collected in 2018, the figure rose to ₹4.19 crore in 2019.

Remedial measures

The police identified black spots across the district and suggested necessary remedial measures in an effort to curb accidents.

Tenders have been floated to install blinkers at a cost of ₹43 lakh across the district. Cuddalore is the only district to have a separate Road Safety Awareness team and the members visited all educational institutions creating awareness among students. All these measures contributed to making roads safer, Mr. Abhinav added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/71vmgb/article30966860.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THMARPY13AUTOMATICBLINKER2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/road-accidents-in-cuddalore-drop-by-639-in-2019/article30966861.ece
190,2020/03/03,"Rescue fishermen stranded in Iran, kin urge Collectors","Amid the COVID-19 scare, the fisherfolk have been told to remain in the harbour

The families of 57 fishermen from the district who have been stranded in Iran in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak have petitioned Tirunelveli Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish, seeking her intervention to rescue them at the earliest.

The fishermen had neither been allowed to venture into the sea for fishing nor leave the harbour to get food, medicine, drinking water and other essentials, they said. The petitioners said the 57 fishermen hailing from 10 coastal villages in the district, who were hired by Iranian nationals to work on their mechanised fishing boats, had been asked to remain inside their boat.

The Union government, which operated special flights to China to bring back Indians stranded in the neighbouring country, should similarly send a special aircraft to rescue the fishermen stranded in Iran, the petitioners said.

A similar appeal was made to Kanniyakumari Collector Prashant M. Wadnere by the families of fishermen from the district who have been stranded in Iran.

Led by Rev. Fr. Churchill, general secretary of the South Asian Fishermen Fraternity (SAFF), the kin of the fishermen submitted a petition to the Collector. They said the breadwinners of their families, who were employed in eight places across Iran, had been told to remain inside the harbours, which had been closed for fishing activities due to the COVID-19 scare.

‘Scary conditions’

“The fishermen are unable to come out of the harbour or venture into the sea. Their Iranian sponsors are not ready to provide them with food. The fishermen are staying in their boats, berthed at the harbour. Since they are living in unhealthy and scary conditions even as the virus threat looms large, they should be evacuated from these places and brought back to India through special aeroplanes,” Rev. Fr. Churchill said.

The SAFF has also sent appeals to the External Affairs Minister and the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/c676z5/article30966834.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03FISHER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rescue-fishermen-stranded-in-iran-kin-urge-collectors/article30966835.ece

BJP national general secretary P. Muralidhar Rao called on Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami at his residence on Monday.

194,2020/03/03,Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal's Rakshan: ‘Sivakarthikeyan’s success makes directors look at people like me’,"The popular television anchor, who grabbed eyeballs with his starring performance in the recent Dulquer Salmaan film, on his unusual climb to success

Rakshan has been at the receiving and giving end of con jobs in his life.

As the victim, it was quite hard to take lying down. Being duped off huge sums of money seldom elicits a pleasant feeling about the self, especially when said money was raised after pawning your mother’s jewels.

“I was trying so hard to break into films then,” says Rakshan, of a time in the late Noughties and early 2010s.

“People whom I approached [for opportunities] asked me money. They told me to get ₹50 lakh to ₹1 crore. I collected some ₹15 lakh and gave it to a ‘director’ who promised to make me a hero. It was money that my mother helped gather by pawning things including her nose ring. One day after I gave them the money, the entire team working on that film vanished,” he adds.

The Star Vijay anchor, who made a star turn in Desingh Periyasamy’s recently-released Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal as a con artist alongside Dulquer Salmaan, is a real live wire. When quizzed of the con job he pulled off, he says, “It is actually like a scene straight out of a movie.”

Pulling off a con

Out of cash and out of luck, Rakshan, whose real name is Ram Kumar, gave up on his screen dreams, albeit temporarily, and came to terms with the fact that he had to enter the salaried workforce to keep his family afloat.

There was just one problem. A school dropout is not likely to be highly thought of by potential employers.

“I had problems studying. I dropped out after Class X. I found it difficult to follow what was being taught. My friends tell me I’m dyslexic. I don’t know. What I know is that I couldn’t copy what my teachers were writing on the board. I couldn’t even copy from my friends during exam!”

And so, when he had to take up a job, his friends prepared a fake resume. “It was a job opportunity at a BPO centre. They (his friends) put all kinds of things on it like I was Quality Analyst and such. I had no idea what it was,” he says.

On the day of the interview, as he was pacing about the office floor not knowing what to do, Rakshan stopped to ask for a glass of water. He was shown the way to a water dispenser, which was placed on the floor where the company’s many call centre employees were handling one phone call after another.

“I listened into a conversation. One guy was being yelled at by a customer. He escalated the issue to his superior, who asked him a few questions like: ‘Is it an inbound or outbound call?’ The guy said outbound. The supervisor then asked him if he had done a ‘sales pitch’ and the guy said ‘yes’. I stood there observing their exchange silently. When I went into the interview room, the recruiters looked at my profile and asked me if I had worked in inbound or outbound calls. I said ‘outbound’ and then they asked me if it was tech support or sales pitch. I said, ‘sales pitch’, and then managed to make up an imaginary example based on what I had just witnessed outside. That was it. I got the job,” he chuckles.

Charting his own path

It is not an isolated incident in the life of Rakshan. His street smartness took him through several jobs and businesses; he has done it all — from being a pharmacy help to selling clothes, restoring totalled cars and getting into the middleman business helping pet owners sell puppies to others for a commission.

But it is his uncanny ability to memorise events and scripts, however many pages it may be, that brought him to the doorstep of success and eventual fame with Star Vijay.

“It is what I used to do as a host of Kalakka Povathu Yaaru. It is something that (actors) Sivakarthikeyan anna and Simbu (STR) anna appreciated me for; though if you ask my teachers, they would not have anything nice to say about me.”

Once bitten twice shy goes the saying. So when his TV fame brought along offers, Rakshan was happy to pass them over as he thought they would never materialise.

“When I learnt that I was playing a full fledged role alongside Dulquer, I was sold. I remember thinking... ‘Aha, inime Kerala la puttu and kadala curry namakku free’. But I don’t know how to thank Dulquer for giving me that space. Knowing him, he would only ask why should I need to thank him,” Rakshan remarks.

Kannum Kannum... received a positive response at the box office, and Rakshan is hopeful that the film’s success will lead to better offers. But he is not about to turn his back on television.

“I will only try cinema as a parallel to my television commitment. People smile at me when I’m in a restaurant, asking me how I am doing because of my television presence. The audience connect is better there,” he says, adding in conclusion: “It is Sivakarthikeyan anna’s success in cinema that has made it possible for producers to sit up and take notice of people like me, you know... anchors. I don’t know if it is confidence or superstition on their part. But as long as it continues, I will be happy.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/5eryn/article30972538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPRakshan-4,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/sivakarthikeyans-success-makes-directors-to-look-at-people-like-me-rakshan/article30972542.ece
195,2020/03/03,Woody Allen’s memoir ‘Apropos of Nothing’ to release on April 7,"It was reported last year that the filmmaker was pitching his memoir to several publishers, but was rebuffed in the wake of the #MeToo movement

Filmmaker Woody Allen’s memoir Apropos of Nothing will finally be releasing on April this year.

Grand Central Publishing, a division of Hachette Book Group, will bring out the memoir on April 7, the company said in a statement to Variety.

“The book is a comprehensive account of his life, both personal and professional, and describes his work in films, theatre, television, nightclubs, and print,” the publishing house said.

The book, in which Allen has also written about his relationships with family, friends, and “the loves of his life”, will also release in Canada, Italy, France, Germany and Spain, besides the US.

It was reported last year that Allen was pitching his memoir to several publishers, but was rebuffed in the wake of the #MeToo movement.

The multi-hyphenate director has become a subject of discussion over the resurfacing of the sexual assault allegations levelled against him by his step-daughter Dylan Farrow which caught steam in the wake of the #MeToo uprising. He has repeatedly denied the accusations.

Incidentally, Hachette’s division Little, Brown and Company published Catch and Kill, by Allen’s estranged son Ronan Farrow in 2019. In the book, Farrow wrote about his reporting during the #MeToo movement that led to the downfall of many powerful Hollywood executives.

Dylan took to Twitter to slam the company for betraying her brother with their decision to publish Allen’s memoir.

“Hachette’s publishing of Woody Allen’s memoir is deeply upsetting to me personally and an utter betrayal of my brother whose brave reporting, capitalised on by Hachette, gave voice to numerous survivors of sexual assault by powerful men. For the record, I was never contacted by any fact checkers to verify the information in this ‘memoir’, demonstrating an egregious abdication of Hachette’s most basic responsibility,” she said in a statement posted on the micro-blogging site.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dw8t3m/article30972328.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NYSPECIALSCREENINGOFIRRATIONALMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/woody-allens-memoir-apropos-of-nothing-to-release-on-april-7/article30972329.ece

It has been two years since Sridevi passed on. Recently, on February 25, many celebrities across industries remembered the mark she had left on cinema. Tomorrow, March 4, will be her second death anniversary according to the Hindu calendar.

According to a press statement, there will be a small pooja at her Mylapore home tomorrow at 11 in morning in her remembrance. Boney Kapoor, along with Janhvi Kapoor and Sridevi’s family, will also be present during the occasion.

Boney Kapoor is now a familiar producer in Kollywood, having debuted last year with Ajith’s Nerkonda Paarvai, which was the Tamil remake of Pink.

197,2020/03/03,"Parthiban on 'Iravin Nizhal', his next attempt which will be a single-shot feature","After 'Oththa Seruppu Size 7', the director-actor has moved on to yet another unique attempt

“I wake up every day dreaming about Iravin Nizhal, my upcoming film,” says actor-director Radhakrishnan Parthiban. Iravin Nizhal is another first-of-its-kind; it will be a single-shot feature. “The idea has been in my head for five years and it is finally taking shape,” he says.

Parthiban is well known for his unique attempts — as an actor and director. His last film was a thriller, Oththa Seruppu Size 7, a solo act with only one character played by him. Considered a rare attempt in Indian cinema, Parthiban thought that it would be nominated for the Academy Awards 2019. “I spent several lakhs on screenings to jury members to take my film directly to the Oscar list,” he says. That, however, did not happen. But the actor is undeterred. “I have been trying to make Oththa Seruppu Size 7 for 15 years. The audience has welcomed it and the response was uplifting. My audiences are my friends, and I keep my fans close to me.”

Parthiban says he tries pushing himself with every project. “One of my earlier films Kathai Thiraikathai Vasanam Iyakkam came with a tagline ‘A film without a story’ and it clicked with the audience. I was amazed by their comments on social media.It’s not about celebrating me, but my ideas. I still get claps (ISI marked claps!) from my audience because I reinvent myself.” Remembering the legends of Tamil Cinema, Parthiban says, “Kalaignar [Karunanidhi], Kavignar Vaali and K Balachander are always amidst us. The spontaneity and wit of Kalaignar is something I cherish every single day. My satire is nothing in front of his dialogues in Parasakthi. Also, K Balachander... there have been many days when I have stayed back in theatres to watch back-to-back shows of his films. They still live on through their work.”

What’s coming up? Parthiban will be acting with Vijay Sethupathy in Tughlaq Darbar, and feels that this pairing will be something to look out for. “Our pairing will be something to look out for,” promises Parthiban. He is also acting in a web series called Suzhal directed by Pushkar and Gayatri, the husband and wife filmmaker duo who made films like Oram Po, Va-Quarter Cutting and Vikram Vedha.

He describes the women in his family as his ‘strength’. “Be it my amma or my daughters Keerthana and Abhi, they are my pillars (when I ask my daughters if I should buy an apartment or make another Oththa...they pick the film). Even in my first film, it is the husband who falls at his wife’s feet. In Kathai, Thiraikathai... it’s the husband who gives his wife a foot massage. You don’t have to necessarily always hold a woman’s hand to say that you are there for her... you can also touch her feet,” he says.

When he started out as an assistant director with actor-director K Bhagyaraj, he says he was amazed by the talent he saw around him. “I didn’t have a choice but to sharpen my skills to survive. I grew up watching classics that consumed me and sucked me into a different world. When I started looking for work in cinema, there have been times when I went hungry for several days. I owe everything to cinema. I want to keep dreaming big and stay new. I want to hold on to the warmth of my dreams.”

198,2020/03/03,BiFFes: ‘You can see different architectural styles in Bengaluru’s theatres’,"Historian Suresh Moona also delved into the history of the city at a talk, organised as part of the film festival

“The most important thing is to create awareness about the past,” said historian Suresh Moona at a talk on Bengaluru’s cinema theatre landscape: then and now, organised as part of BiFFes on February 29 at Orion Mall.

Stating that it was important for everyone living in Bengaluru to have a basic idea of the city’s history, Suresh told the audience that his focus would be on the architectural features of the theatres. “Bangalore has been known for different types of architectural sights. We had Tudor, Hoysala, later colonial architecture, Indo-Saracenic… If you observe the (old) theatres, you will see these architectural styles in their construction.”

However, he also made it clear to the audience that he had less time than originally planned and would have to speed through the presentation. Beginning by displaying an artist’s impression of Kempegowda’s Bangalore on the screen, he said, “There are many similarities between Kempegowda’s Bangalore and Londonium. Londonium was 1,500 years old when Kempegowda conceived building a new city. January 14, 1537 is considered to be the date of the founding of Bangalore. Imagine his thinking to go beyond the seas, think globally and bring those concepts locally. All these things paved the way for Bangalore in the future to become a city with multicultural aspects, and a city with film culture.”

Suresh then talked about the history of the rulers of Bengaluru, starting from the Kempegowda family and ending at the present administration by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike. The theatre (plays) movement emerged, which was a “springboard” for film development to take place, he said. Film activities in Bengaluru started with the distribution of Hindi films at Gandhinagar, he said and added that the spot needed to be commemorated.

“Kempegowda Road was the hub of the film theatres while the Cantonment area catered to the British. According to one estimate, in the 1970s, there were 148 theatres in the city.”

Suresh then said many theatres were built with the purpose of being choultries, adding Paramount Theatre, Doddanna Hall, was one such. Talking about the structure, he said that it was built in the Tudor style.

Showing photos, he also spoke a little on theatres including Select Picture Palace, Theatre Majestic, Opera, Elgin, BRV Talkies, Rex, Shivaji, Galaxy, Plaza, Everest, Sharda, Kapali, Navrang and Vijayalakshmi.

He concluded by talking about film societies, film historians, and the advent of multiplexes. Suresh suggested that in order to preserve our heritage and make future generations aware of it, it was important to put up information boards, print postcards of old theatres and display photographs of the theatres in public spaces.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/1pjaaa/article30971773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03bgmpphoto2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/you-can-see-different-architectural-styles-in-bengalurus-theatres/article30971775.ece

200,2020/03/03,Oscar-winning actor Timothy Hutton accused of raping 14-year-old girl in 1983,"Actor, most recently seen in Netflix series ‘Haunting of the Hill House’ and movie ‘Beautiful Boy’, denies the claims

Oscar winner Timothy Hutton has been accused of rape by a Canadian former model who claims the actor sexually assaulted her in the 1980s when she was 14. The actor, who was most recently in Netflix series Haunting of the Hill House and biographical drama Beautiful Boy, said he “completely and unequivocally denies” the claims and called it an attempt to extort money.

In an interview with BuzzFeed News, Sera Johnston has alleged that the veteran actor raped her in 1983 when she was a junior high school student in a Vancouver hotel room while another man looked on and participated.

Hutton was shooting the 1984 film Iceman and he and two friends began a conversation with her and two of her classmates. He then invited them back to his hotel to hang out, according to the new report.

When the girls returned to the actor’s room, they were served drinks and Johnston said Hutton got close to her, brought her to his bedroom and raped her while a friend watched.

Johnston said she doesn’t remember how she was led to the actor’s bedroom, but said he asked whether she had ever had sex.

She said she initially told the men she was 17, then later admitted she was 14 years old. The age of consent in Canada is 16 years old now, but was 14 years old in 1983. There is no statute of limitations for sexual assault, misconduct or battery claims in Canada.

“I don’t think this is a good idea. I don’t think my mother would be too happy about this,” the ex-model, who was also a working actor at the time, recalled saying to Hutton.

She said she wanted to leave. “To everything I would say, it was, ‘It’ll be OK, it’ll be OK. It won’t last long, and you’ll be fine’,” Johnston said.

Johnston said she begged the men.

“Please, don’t do this. I can’t do it. I can’t,” she said, adding Hutton told her she would like it and that his friend was going to watch.

Johnston filed a criminal complaint with the Vancouver police late last year about the alleged incident.

Lawyers for Hutton said Johnston’s story is “fabricated” and contains “patently false, scurrilous, and defamatory statements“.

In a statement, his lawyer said the actor, whose Fox series Almost Family concluded its first season in February, has never met Johnston at all.

“(He) will not spend one more minute dignifying these allegations as they are patently false and designed only to extort money from him. (Johnston) has provided salacious, heinous, and graphic details of this made-up sexual encounter that supposedly occurred 36 years ago. Although these were disgusting details any smut fiction writer could conjure up. There is no evidence to support them,” Hutton said.

Johnston countered she was advised by one attorney to reach a settlement considering that she was within the legal age of consent at the time of the alleged incident.

She added Hutton agreed to an initial settlement of USD 135,000 (less than the USD 1.5 million her lawyer had suggested), but she later scrapped the deal.

The veteran actor has enlisted two law firms and three spokespeople to counter Johnston’s claims.

201,2020/03/03,COVID-19 | Panic grips colony where techie stayed,"Many residents of the locality near Mahendra Hills move out of their houses to avoid contacting the virus

Panic has set in a posh colony in Secunderabad where the COVID-19 hit techie resides, with the local residents hurriedly moving out of their houses to avoid contacting the virus.

Tuesday was not a normal day for the residents as a flurry of activity was witnessed since morning. Adding to the tense moments were the media personnel, who had made a beeline to the colony, and began to beam live footage of the locality and went into an overdrive trying to describe the situation out there.

Since morning the sanitary workers of Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) rushed to the area and started spraying disinfectant and bleaching powder all around. A double-storied building in the colony became the cynosure of all eyes as it was the place where the techie used to reside along with eight other members of the joint family. The building too had tenants.

Once it became known that the techie was down with COVID-19, the entire family is being quarantined in Gandhi Hospital and is undergoing tests. The tenants too had locked their houses and moved away to the relatives’ places. Soon some more colony residents followed suit.

A colony resident, said on condition of anonymity, said that they were all worried. “What can we do now? We have to take precautions and avoid contacting the disease,” he said even as he requested the sanitation staff to sanitise the area.

Going by the panic created in the very first coronovirus case in the city and State, it is unlikely that normality would be restored in the next few days in the colony.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/wqvli1/article30975719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04CORONAVIRUSCOVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/panic-grips-colony-where-covid-hit-techie-stayed/article30975720.ece
202,2020/03/03,Poor testing led to online property tax errors,"Data integration could not be rigorously tested, say officials

The Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department has warned that property tax defaulters will face legal notices under the provisions of the new Telangana Municipalities Act with just about 25 days to go for the final payment to be made.

However, it is now clear that the missing demand notices, properties and even erstwhile villages from the tax portal is because of the lacunae in the newly introduced online payment system. Much before the merger of 175 gram panchayats into the adjoining municipalities and formation of new ones, the officials had decided to go for a revamped tax portal considering the new attributes and enhanced coverage of more local bodies.

Senior officials, wishing to remain anonymous, explained that the next generation system developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) took a while for being developed and by the time the new system was ready for testing and trials, the municipal elections came into picture throwing the entire exercise into a disarray.

Data migration and integration from the erstwhile gram panchayats gathered from the e-panchayat and also from the old municipalities was taken up in right earnest but what it required before rolling out the exercise for the citizens to make use of the system is take up extensive testing with random sampling from various urban local bodies (ULBs), they said.

Most of the gaps that have come to the fore during the payment process of the property owners and also during the self-assessment of the property tax could have been detected during the testing phase itself if it was rigorous and the system would have been more robust, testify senior officials.

While there is no sign of any corrective step so far to improve digital network, the municipal officials focus continue to be on collecting the monies by putting the pressure on bill collectors, supervisory teams and the commissioners on a daily basis till the month-end.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/poor-testing-led-to-online-property-tax-errors/article30975219.ece

Responding positively to the request of Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the Centre has agreed to procure another one-lakh tonnes of redgram under the price support scheme in the State. It would be in addition to 51,625 tonnes already agreed to be procured.

According to officials of the Agriculture Department, Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar has agreed to the Chief Minister’s request to procure another one-lakh tonnes of redgram at the minimum support price of ₹5,800 per quintal based on the fair average quality of the produce brought to the procurement centres.

In a letter addressed to the Union Minister recently, the Chief Minister is understood to have explained that extent of cultivation of redgram and its production had increased in Telangana owing to favourable seasonal conditions and improved irrigation facilities. He is said to have explained that redgram was cultivated in about 2.86 lakh hectares during the kharif season and the production would be around 3 lakh tonnes, although the conservative estimates of the second advance estimates of crop production put it at 2.07 lakh tonnes.

Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili of Telangana High Court on Tuesday disposed of a writ petition filed by Malkajgiri Congress MP A. Revanth Reddy for enhancement of security, directing him to file a fresh representation on the matter to Union Ministry of Home Affairs.

The judge said the new request must be filed within two weeks to Union Home Secretary. He directed the Home Ministry to consider the fresh application by the MP in accordance with the law within six weeks of receiving it. The judge also asked the Home Ministry to consult Telangana State, if necessary, on the matter as per the provisions of the law.

Mr. Reddy filed the writ petition stating that he had threat to his life from real estate tycoon Jupally Rameshwara Rao and some leaders of the present regime in Telangana State since he was fighting against them on different issues. He stated that despite Union Home Minister responding through a letter to his representation for providing 4+4 personal security guards, the Union Home Secretary did not respond.

206,2020/03/03,Plans to promote tapioca farming to help improve ryots’ income in Telangana,"A team led by Agriculture Minister visits TN to study crop cultivation

Telangana government is planning to promote one of the popular tuber crops tapioca cassava, karra pendalam, with a view to encourage farmers to diversify from water-intensive paddy crop and cultivate it as a commercial horticultural crop in the irrigated-dry method.

Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy along with a team of officials visited the Tapioca and Castor Research Station of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University at Yethapur near Salem on Tuesday to study the cultivation of crop. He was accompanied by Managing Director of Telangana State Seed Development Corporation K. Keshavulu and others.

The study has been taken up to encourage farmers to go for crop change with an aim to improve their income by diverting from traditional crops with which they were unable to get the expected income, an official of the visiting team said. Stating that there was huge demand for tapioca in the national and international markets, the official said it could be cultivated as an irrigated-dry crop and achieve high yield.

Officials at the research station explained to the Minister that tapioca is main raw material in the production of 18 products, including sago (suggu biyyam/sabudaana), starch powder, chips, textile industry and others. With a crop period 7 months to 10 months, production up to 12 tonnes per acre could be achieved as a rain-fed crop and up to 15 tonnes as an irrigated-dry crop, they stated.

The Minister said Telangana government was planning to promote the tuber crop as part of its plans to set up crop colonies and encourage farmers to diversify from the traditional crops. As part of such plan they had already decided to encourage oil palm cultivation in the erstwhile Mahabubnagar district areas. The government would encourage the farmers to go for tapioca crop and explore the opportunities of establishing a processing unit in the event the cultivation crossed 1,000 acres.

Stating that tapioca is cultivated on a large scale in South Africa, the research station officials told the visiting team from Telangana that it is being cultivated in about 2 lakh hectares in India with about 80% of it in Tamil Naud and Kerala. Farmers in other States, including Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Puducherry, Odisha, Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Assam, Lakshadweep and Andaman & Nicobar Islands, in smaller extents. The current market price of the crop was in the range of ₹8,000 to ₹12,000 per tonne.

The Minister stated that a field visit for awareness of the farmers would be organised soon on tapioca cultivation. The government would also promote castor seed production in the erstwhile Mahabubnagar district as its products were used in making soaps, oils and ointments.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/s63tbj/article30975972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy04Niranjan-Reddy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/plans-to-promote-tapioca-farming-to-help-improve-ryots-income-in-telangana/article30974280.ece

208,2020/03/03,‘Limitations on judicial review of government’s policy decisions’,"Advocate-General B.S. Prasad argues at final hearing on PILs on Secretariat building demolition

Citing several verdicts of the Supreme Court, Advocate-General B.S. Prasad on Tuesday contended in Telangana High Court that courts cannot transgress into the area of policy decisions of government unless they violate Constitutional provisions.

As the final hearing began on a batch of PIL petitions challenging Telangana government’s decision to pull down existing Secretariat building, the AG said there were limitations on judicial review of governments’ policy decisions. He was presenting government’s contentions before a Bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy.

When a policy decision, like Telangana government’s proposal to demolish existing Secretariat building and construct a new one, was not against any law, one cannot say it was arbitrary and unreasonable, he told the court. Referring to two of the PIL pleas, the AG said one petitioner was a Member of Parliament and another was a Member of Legislative Council.

‘Politically motivated’

Being political opponents, the petitioners chose to file the PIL petitions challenging the government’s policy decision, Mr. Prasad said. Just because they were political opponent would they lose an opportunity to file a PIL petition, the CJ asked. The AG said the apex court in a verdict stated that Public Interest Litigation should not be “publicity interest litigation” or “private interest litigation” or “politics interest litigation” or the latest trend of “paise income litigation”. Referring to the PIL pleas on Secretariat demolition, the AG said the petitioners cannot dictate to government whether to demolish Secretariat or not.

Only if there was any infringement of statutory or Constitutional provisions, the people or the courts can interfere, he said. Quoting from the counter affidavits filed by government earlier, the AG explained to the Bench that elements of parking space, security of VVIPs, need for bigger meeting halls with seating capacity of 500 persons, dwindling soundness of existing buildings drove government to decide for construction of a new Secretariat building.

Independent review

Senior lawyer Satyam Reddy, counsel for one of the petitioners, appealed to the Bench to direct the government to get the condition of the present Secretariat building reviewed by a Central agency or IIT-Hyderabad. The technical committee comprising four chief engineers naturally tends to give a report favourable to government decision, he said.

But that would trigger arguments on the disputed question of facts which the Bench cannot allow, the CJ said. It had to direct the petitioners to approach the civil court to adjudicate the matter based on the reports given by different agencies, the CJ said.

The matter was posted to Thursday for next hearing.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/n8tnm3/article30978593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04TELANGANAHIGHCOURTBUILDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/limitations-on-judicial-review-of-governments-policy-decisions/article30973962.ece
209,2020/03/03,"Centre procuring 51,625 tonnes of redgram in TS","Minister tells in LS during Question Hour

Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that the Centre has approved procurement of 51,625 tonnes of redgram in Telangana, 25% of the estimated production, under the price support scheme — Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) — this year.

In a written reply on the issue raised by MPs Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and Bandi Sanjay Kumar as part of the Question Hour, the Minister stated that production of redgram as per the second advance estimates in the country during 2019-20 was estimated at 36.9 lakh tonnes, including 2.07 lakh tonnes in Telangana. Based on the proposals received from several States, including Telangana for procurement of the crop, it was approved to procure 47,500 tonnes initially and later it was increased to 51,625 tonnes, he explained.

Further, he explained that as per the prescribed guidelines of the price support scheme the government agencies such as National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) and Food Corporation of India (FCI) were told to procure the major pulses crop at minimum support price of ₹5,800 per quintal fixed for the year for produce brought with fair average quality specifications to prevent the market price of the produce falling below the MSP.

Accordingly, 45,500 tonnes of redgram was procured from farmers in Telangana till as on February 22, he noted.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/centre-procuring-51625-tonnes-of-redgram-in-ts/article30973752.ece
210,2020/03/03,Budget compulsions to put bifurcation issues on hold,"Meeting of TS, AP chief secretaries to resolve pending issues unlikely soon

The next meeting for continuing the dialogue between the chief secretaries of the two Telugu States — Telangana and Andhra Pradesh — to resolve pending bifurcation issues appears to be unlikely any time soon.

The administration of the two States will be engaged in the Budget session for most part of the current month and this is expected to keep senior officials busy till the time the Budget of the respective States is passed by their legislatures. The two chief secretaries Somesh Kumar of Telangana and Nilam Sawhney of AP met at the BRKR Bhavan on January 30.

The meeting follows the instructions of Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his AP counterpart Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy who resolved to iron out the differences and evolve mutually agreeable solution to the pending bifurcation issues. The two top officials discussed several pending issues, including the persisting differences on bifurcation of the Schedule IX and Schedule X institutions, during the close to six-hour meeting.

The minutes of the meeting is, however, said to be still under finalization and the fixing the date for the next meeting would not be possible till the exercise is completed. “The minutes of the meeting give clarity about the issues on which there is broad-based agreement. This will be helpful in understanding the issues where differences still persist and thereby, finalise the agenda for the next meeting for continuing the dialogue,” a senior official told The Hindu.

Stalemate over the bifurcation of the Schedule IX and X institutions between the two States continues as Telangana gave its consent for division of assets and liabilities of 68 out of the 89 institutions while the neighbouring State gave its consent only for 53. The Union Home Ministry has directed the two States to settle the differences pertaining to these institutions on case-by-case basis with mutual discussions.

The Andhra Pradesh government addressed a letter to the Centre asking it to treat the entire recommendations made by the expert committee headed by Shila Bhide as one lot. The Telangana government, however, objected to this claiming that it had objections to certain recommendations made by the panel that were unilateral and in favour of AP. “The differences still persist. That is why the Union Ministry favoured case-by-case resolution. But this will be possible only if the meetings between the two States continue,” a senior official said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/b9dnc7/article30974975.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04MEETING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/budget-compulsions-to-put-bifurcation-issues-on-hold/article30973706.ece

213,2020/03/03,Kollur to become mini-township soon,"Two apartment complexes to accommodate about 70,000 people

Come July 2020, Kollur village, now part of Tellapur Municipality, will become a major habitation. About 70,000 people are expected to be accommodated in the residential two-bedroom apartments that are coming up there.

Kollur Township 1 is coming up in 14 blocks with as many as 2,052 houses. It is estimated that if each house will have four members, then these can accommodate about 8,000 people. It will have cellar parking and stilt parking plus nine floors.

Thirty-eight lifts are being installed for the residents. The construction was taken up by KBR Infratech Private Limited, a Bengaluru-based company. Construction of all the structures is over and now interior work and painting is on. By March the apartments will be ready to be handed over and laying of roads will be completed by June. “We will hand over the entire housing complex by May,” said a representative of the construction company.

About two kilometres away from Kollur Township 1, on the other side of the road, another big residential complex would be coming up — Kollur 2. With 117 blocks, this complex can have 15,560 families and can accommodate about 62,240 people, assuming there are four in a family. Here, there are some blocks of silt plus 10 and stilt plus 11 floors. About 5,000 labourers are working to complete the works and already 60 blocks were handed over to the officials concerned. This township will have 234 lifts.

Three shopping complexes, police station, fire station, anganwadi, milk booth, 10 underground sumps with 1,100-kilolitre capacity and some with 750-kilolitre capacity, each block with two overhead tanks with 80,000 kilolitres capacity, two electrical sub-stations and one mini vegetable, meat/fish market would be established in this complex.

Hyderabad based DEC Infrastructure and Projects India Private Limited has taken up the work about one-and-half years ago.

“The buildings were almost completed and infrastructure will be in place by the end of June or July. As half of the buildings were already handed over to the authorities, the remaining will be handed over by the middle of this year.

214,2020/03/03,"They come in droves, hoping to find a day’s work","Warangal has 286 labour addas where thousands gather daily

At the break of dawn, thousands of people from surrounding villages head to Warangal city in search of work for the day to make ends meet.

They all gather at the city corners such as Public Gardens and wait for a long time looking for prospective employers – property owners, masonry contractors and others. Many are lucky, though they are not sure of their day and the job. Some return disappointed. They all come in autorickshaws and on bicycles hurriedly in the wee hours and wait.

Raju, a resident of Pegadapally village in Hasanparthy mandal which is close to the city, says he distributes milk in the early hours and rushes to Warangal city to find work. If he is lucky, he would earn ₹400 or above for the work and sometimes may not get any work.

There are 286 labour addas (pick-up points) in erstwhile Warangal district where thousands of daily wage workers gather everyday in search of work.

The day starts for these labourers as early as 5 a.m. and ends at around 5 p.m. and even late, depending on the work.

Unaware of schemes

Often they get a raw deal – they do not have a shed to wait under and they stand in the open or under the shade of trees. Though there are schemes for their welfare, many are not aware of them.

Warangal city is growing fast with lot of construction taking place owing to its close proximity to the State capital Hyderabad and a new national highway coming up. Many now prefer the city unlike in the past. Several new colonies are coming up everywhere. As a result, around 80 labour addas have sprung up within the tri-cities – Warangal, Hanamkonda and Kazipet.

The women workers earn anywhere between ₹200 to ₹400 while men get ₹350 and above per day if they find work.

The mason team leader gets ₹800 to ₹1,000. Local MLA D Vinay Bhaskar roped in his party workers and followers to help scores of labourers get enrolled into various welfare schemes in a special drive some time ago. According to him, the break-up of registered workers with the Telangana Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (TBOCWWB) is — Warangal Urban 58,237; Warangal Rural: 26,851; Jangaon 22,090; Mahabubabad 18,390; Jayashankar-Bhupalpally (including Mulugu) 16, 376.

Ragula Ramesh, the honorary president of Telangana Building and Other Construction Workers Union Warangal district (combined), said though the government was offering various welfare schemes, over one lakh workers are not aware of it.

‘Special drives needed’

The government should conduct special drives to ensure that the construction workers benefit. “Even though the Minimum Wages Act stipulates ₹ 650 a day, not many are getting it,” he pointed out.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sbynnk/article30966778.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03WOREKRS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/they-come-in-droves-hoping-to-find-a-days-work/article30966779.ece

216,2020/03/03,An Aesop’s fable retold to drive home a corporate performance message,"Imagine the hare and the tortoise are again in a match-up — this time on a corporate playing field. Here goes...

If it had stretched any further, the nap would have cost the hare the title. When she was in the land of nod, the tortoise gained on her and overtook her, and walked and walked till the sleeping hare was just a speck behind her.

Along the line, the hare shook herself out of the deep slumber, ran at a clip, overtook the tortoise on the last leg and won the race. The tortoise lost, but became a poster-girl for near-victories, especially of the kind that are hardly noticed though managed in unusual circumstances, especially in an unequal playing field such as the one the tortoise found herself in.

The organisers declared the hare and the tortoise joint-winners, and so, that day, many tortoises among the spectators were fired with a new hope.

With due deference to Aesop, the corporate world certainly needs newer hare-and-tortoise race stories that focus as much on efforts as on success.

As they celebrate small and usually less-evident victories, such stories will do much more for morale and motivation than the freakish tortoise-trounces-hare fable.

Growth mindset

“Organisations that have a growth mindset will focus more on learning than on success,” organisational psychologist Aarti Shyamsunder has this to say, in response when we present the idea behind the tweaked fable to her.

Aarti adds that such organisations will have a broader narrative that recognises and celebrates near-successful efforts as well as what the outliers — tortoises, in this case — have to bring to the table.

This attitude comes with a commitment to promoting inclusivity, one aimed at motivating under-represented sections to aim for higher than what they previously thought they were capable of.

“Organisations have to be deliberately inclusive. When the achievements of someone from an under-represented group are highlighted and rewarded, it will help others from that group aspire and work towards achieving the same level of recognition. The principle “you can’t be what you can’t see” is at work here. It is all about the optics. If you want your workforce to be characterised by inclusion and diversity, you have to promote the idea wherever you can, in your rewards programme and even in what you choose to display on your website,” explains Aarti

Many winners

When we present this reworked Aesop fable to Debleena Majumdar, who focusses on story-telling in the context of organisational development, this is her response:

“The original Aesop story proves the ‘small commitments’ theory, which is that keeping at doing the small things over a sustained period is the best bet to achieve long-term goals. It takes focussed short-term actions to meet a long-term goal — something teams and organisations can easily lose sight of. The hare lost sight of that, and lost the race.”

Debleena continues, “On the other hand, the message from this reworked story that is worth keeping is: Performance management will be more aligned with realistic expectations and more potential-focussed than result-oriented when it is approached with contextual intelligence. It is necessary to assess performance in the light of the circumstances that brought it about. It is also necessary to measure what has been achieved against the individual’s capabilities. In this scenario, there will always be winners to be found in the very bowels of defeat. In this reworked story, we see this principle at work. The hare wakes up to a rude shock, and is trying to make up for lost time; considering that she is pitted against the tortoise, she manages it successfully, sailing over the finish line ahead of the tortoise. However, in a less-obvious and deeper level, the race is already over. By giving her utmost and almost making it, the tortoise has already won the race; and to their credit, the organisers recognise the imaginary finish line the tortoise has crossed. By rewarding both hare and tortoise, they are promoting a culture that acknowledges not only results, but also efforts that are impressive but don’t cover the entire ground. More importantly, the recognition that comes the tortoise’s way encourages the other tortoises — the slow-movers — to give it their best shot too.”",careers,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/ec655y/article30975325.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04OPTORTOISE-1,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/an-aesops-fable-retold-to-drive-home-a-corporate-performance-message/article30975326.ece
217,2020/03/03,French students learn the art of Indian handicrafts,"A profusion of colour: In East Meets West workshops, French students learnt the art and craft of Indian handicraft at Tharangini Studios

On a pleasant Tuesday morning, a group of 40 students from LISAA School of Design, Bengaluru, including 20 from France, were busy at work at a dyeing and block printing workshop at Tharangini Studios. Cloths in striking colours and prints, ranging from the traditional to the contemporary, were hung to dry. At one end, students were learning the technique of block printing from 67-year-old Krishna Bhatt, who has been working at Tharingini for 40 years. “I taught them how to print, how to take the colour, I then showed the design,” says Krishna as a student combines blocks on a cloth and layers it with different colours. “The first is the outline (in black), then comes the second colour (red) and the third (yellow).”

The students worked with natural fabric dyes made from Indian herbs such as mehndi and mulethi. Padmini Govind, proprietor, Tharangini Studios, says: “This is our third year with LISAA. Our goal at Tharangini is to sustain in handblock printing in natural dyes.” Padmini carries forward their sustainability mission by conducting workshops and exposing next generation designers to traditional handicrafts.

“We conduct workshops in association with LISAA and other colleges. We started in a small way with LISAA. The Bangalore students were coming to us for shorter programmes. This is the first time the third year students from Paris came along side the first year students of Bangalore, so that is a rich learning experience especially for the junior students because not only did they learn the craft, they learnt how to interpret it through the seniors as well.”

The overall theme of the three-day long workshop, says Padmini, is sustainability. “People use the word ‘sustainability’ a lot these days. We teach students how we put that in context of what we do as textile producers. So more than coming and learning the hand craft, the students need to understand the larger context of how hand craft is applicable to fashion today in a context of an art globalised world.”

Avi Keswani, director LISAA School of Design, Bengaluru, agrees and adds: “There are a lot of dying arts and being educators there is only so much we can do. We follow a glocal curriculum, which is global with a local outreach and local adaptation. Padmini and I were on the same page. She told me newer motifscan only come from students, teachers and artisans who have had a different exposure.”

The students not only clearly enjoyed the workshop, but also quickly understood and learnt the essence of traditional hand craft. Julianne, a French student, says: “I liked that the colours are sustainable. And I loved to work with block prints. I like psychedelic designs. I used Indian designs in this workshop since I am in India. I am inspired by the music I listen to.”

Rachel Rebecca Thomas, a student at LISAA, Bangalore, says: “I enjoyed the pigment printing workshop because I personally like working with colours. I like the feeling of being in touch with my roots because as we are progressing in a technological, modern world, we are slowly losing touch with it.” She says her inspiration for design comes from “My grandmother’s saris. Both my grandmothers have a wide variety of saris that are traditionally printed.”

Elizabeth John, co-ordinator and faculty of the fashion department at LISAA, says the students learnt three different dyeing and printing techniques over three days. “On the first day, they learnt the resist dyeing technique, on the second day, a pattern printing technique commonly known as Shibori and how to do discharge printing, and on the third day, they learnt block printing.”

The students also went to Channapatna, Karnataka, well-known for their traditional wooden toys. Avi says: “The goal was to understand a local art form.

Avi says, “I want to promote Indian art forms. Germans, for example, are known to use the highest number of wooden toys. They have kept these toys contemporary. We want the students take back the traditional know-how of wooden toys. We want Indian art forms to go abroad, our goal as educators is create awareness on how Indian art works.”

Padmini says her artisans enjoyed the workshop too.

“They enjoyed this experience because they saw how the same block print is interpreted in a different way.”

As morning gives way to noon, one doesn’t know how time flies. This is because at Tharangini’s beautiful environs makes you forget the hustle-bustle of the city. There is a lot to discover in the studio, Padmini points us to one patch. “We have started a natural dye medicinal plant garden. The other discussion we had was the overlap of medicinal plants with natural dye, because it is all connected at the core. If we don’t spread awareness on these traditions, they will get lost with every generation.”",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/wggz3n/article30971347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGMTHARANGINI2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/a-profusion/article30971353.ece

Prasad Natarajan was wrapping up a bird watch at Lakkavalli, Karnataka when he spotted a lone bird perched on a wooden stump at a distance. He zoomed in with his camera.“I saw the white and brown feathers of the Ospray and almost jumped out of my skin with excitement. It was my dream to spot it and that was a moment of fulfilment. I sketched it for an hour and by the time I was done, there was a heavy downpour and the bird was gone, ” recollects the wildlife artist. This-36 year-old from Bengaluru was recently in Chennai to conduct a workshop organised by Canopy Nature Academy.

Prasad confesses that when he began drawing in his school days, “I drew only landscape and Gods. I am self taught and learnt through trial and error.” It was his time spent at an uncle’s farm in Tumkur where he began to enjoy Nature. There was a forest next door and it was there, he was exposed to a number of plants and animals. “I loved the experience so much that I visited him every year,” he says. But it was not until 2005 that he started to draw animals. “I followed the blogs of Pip Mcgarry, a leading wildlife artist from the UK. I was so impressed that I sent him a mail asking him for tips. He advised me to do regular field trips and to practise my art everyday. I follow those instructions to this day.” Prasad also attended an online course by US based-artists, Jan Martin Mcguire and Carel Pieter Brest van Kempen in 2017 and that inspired him to experiment with acrylic colours. “Till then I was working with pencil, water colours and pen and ink.”

Getting the details right is important for a wildlife art. “It is a lot of work. I generally paint birds that I have seen and photographed. This helps me get the colours and anatomy right. I also check with experts if I have any doubts,” he explains.

His favourite subject is the Southern Oriental Kingfisher that he first spotted in 2018 at Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary. “It is the size of a fist and is the smallest kingfisher that can be found in India. The bird is orange, purple and blue. It was such a joy to watch it fly, perch and feed on lizards.” One of his paintings features two spotted owlets.“I merged two photographs, one taken by well known wildlife photographer Vipul Ramanuj and another taken by me for the painting. I sent him a print of my work and he loved it.”

Thanks to painting from Nature, he learnt a lot, says Prasad. “I learnt about a lot of species in depth and about their habitats.” Prasad believes that understanding Nature automatically makes one conserve it.

Artists for Wildlife and Nature (AWN) Prasad is the founder of the Bengaluru-based trust called Artists for Wildlife and Nature. He started it in 2017 to “bring artists from around the country to showcase their works, meet other artists and share their knowledge”.

In the past three years, the trust has organised eight shows in Bengaluru. “The trust provides awards and cash prize for the best works. AWN also has an online community with 1300 members from across the world. Of this 800 artists are from India,” he says.

He wishes more galleries in India would promote wildlife art. But he admits that it is not yet mainstream. “This could be why acclaimed artists like Carl d'Silva from Goa was not an active participant in exhibitions in the country. The paintings do not have many takers and therefore artists are hesitant to take it up as a full time profession. Those who do it also confine themselves to a few species like lions, tigers and elephants,” he rues.

Prasad is on a mission to change this trend and his paintings are of birds, reptiles and butterflies. He is now planning to organise a national level wildlife art exhibition at Coimbatore. “It will be in June. I am also working to build a museum with at least 200 wildlife paintings. I have started my collection for the same,” he smiles",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/lrpky7/article30971237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26cmProfileImage3Prasad-Natarajan,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/prasad-natarajan-on-his-love-for-wildlife-art/article30971240.ece
219,2020/03/03,Milburn Cherian’s allegory on canvas,"Milburn Cherian, a Mumbai-based artist, brings to the city 20 years of her work, in a solo exhibition

In her second solo in Delhi, Milburn Cherian shows her characteristic style of people and possessions living in tight spaces on her artwork. In her 80 works, titled Living Between the Times 2020, Cherian, a Mumbaikar, who has had solo shows in Kolkata, London, and group shows across the world, talks of how displacement is one of the major themes, apart from suffering and healing.

For instance, “Outside The City Walls,” done in 2011, shows “people having to move with families and all their belongings in the hope of seeking shelter elsewhere,” she says. “The light in the gateway is to give some hope to their plight and separation from the new life they look forward to.” Her work also has the stain-glass-like quality of a church window.

“Maybe one had a premonition about the crisis (Delhi riots),” she adds, speaking about how, in the post-Babri Masjid demolition riots, her husband, E. Cherian, an interior designer, helped Muslim artists stay safe: “He hid them in his car.”

Uma Nair, an art curator and critic who introduces the show to visitors through an essay, says Cherian’s work has always been about the people: “To look at Milburn's paintings is to see a picture from a Shakespearean tragedy. Just as Shakespeare’s histories were crowded with ordinary people making or witnessing history, mingling the high drama of politics with earthy tales, in the same way Milburn re-imagines narratives as tumultuous, abundant, and resonantly human.”

Her paintings “Village Resettled”, “The Healing”, “Give Ear To My Prayer”, “Life Goes on”, “Feed The Hungry”, and “Broken Bridges” best show the parables of the poor and the oppressed.

“Many of my works depicts the human condition, obviously manmade. I paint because I am well aware of how selfishness and greed has kept this country divided and in constant turmoil,” says Cherian.

The works on display, most acrylic on canvas, and some watercolours,measure about 14x12 inches, while some like “Tsunami”, “Sienna Earth” and “The Healing”, spread out to 61 inches.

“I like detailing,” says Cherian, who can take upto 11 months on a single work. Life was sometimes a struggle, especiallysince she lost her parents at 18. Though an NID grad, she calls herself self-taught. She grew up reading Asterix and was inspired by Pieter Brueghel the Elder, when her sister gave her a book on the Flemish printmaker, when she was 27.

The State government has launched a probe into the matter and the woman teacher, who asked the student to remove his turban, has been removed from the examination duty, an official said on Tuesday.

The incident took place on Monday when the student was appearing for an examination at a centre set up at the Government Girls School in Dhamnod.

The student, while talking to reporters after the incident, alleged that during the checking, a teacher asked him to remove his turban.

He, however, refused to do and contacted the centre in-charge, who also asked him to follow the rules. Later, his turban was removed and checked and he was then allowed to appear in the examination, the student said.

221,2020/03/03,Punjab and Haryana High Court orders demolition of structures in catchment areas of Chandigarh’s Sukhna Lake,"Will do everything to protect people’s interests: Amarinder

A day after the Punjab and Haryana High Court declared Chandigarh’s Sukhna Lake as a living entity, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh has asked Advocate General Atul Nanda to examine, in detail, the High Court orders with respect to constructions in the area around the lake.

The Chief Minister on Tuesday told journalists that his government had received a copy of the judgment and the A-G would examine the same and make his recommendations.

“The State government would take whatever decisions, legislative or judicial, needed to resolve the issue. We stand by the people and will do everything to protect their interests,” he said in response to a question.

Declaring Sukhna Lake as a living entity, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has fined Punjab and Haryana ₹100 crore each for causing damage to Sukhna’s catchment area.

Demolitions ordered

The Bench of Justices Rajiv Sharma and Haridner Singh Sidhu also ordered the demolition of all commercial, residential and or other structures in Sukhna’s catchment area.

The court orders have come in a suo motu petition of 2009 initiated over problems of silt in the lake which has resulted in its drying up.

‘Permanent damage’

In its order on March 2, the court observed that “... the acts of the States of Punjab, Haryana have caused permanent damage to the catchment area of Sukhna Lake. It was expected from the State agencies to foresee that the permanent structures in a catchment area would impede the flow of water in Sukhna Lake.

“The States should have taken precautionary measures to save the catchment of Sukhna Lake. It is the duty of the States of Punjab and Haryana to restore the catchment area. The State government has also failed to take precautionary measures to save the catchment area. The damage caused to the catchment area is enormous. The State is bound to pay exemplary penal damages under the doctrine of ‘Polluter Pays’,” read the order.

It added: “The officers-officials of the States of Punjab and Haryana instead of protecting-conserving-saving the catchment area have permitted raising of permanent structures in this area. Since immense damage has been caused to the catchment area of the Sukhna Lake at least ₹200 crores would be required to restore the catchment area.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/d4tw6c/article30975741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03-SUKHNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hc-orders-demolition-of-structures-in-catchment-areas-of-sukhna-lake/article30975742.ece
222,2020/03/03,Haryana Cong. MLAs disrupt Assembly session,"Their protest march was earlier halted

The Haryana Assembly proceedings on Tuesday witnessed disruption by Congress legislators, who alleged that their protest march against the ruling BJP-JJP government was stopped at a distance from the entry point of the Assembly complex.

Haryana Congress MLAs led by Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda held a protest march outside the Assembly complex against the State government for its alleged non-fulfilment of promises made during the 2019 Assembly poll campaign.

“This government has not taken one single step to fulfil the promises it has made in the election manifesto. Corruption and scams were at it peak in Haryana yet the government is not keen to investigate the allegations, be it paddy or mining scam. We have been demanding a CBI probe but why is the government reluctant?” asked Mr. Hooda, as party leaders shouted slogans while displaying placards and posters.

Inside the Assembly, the Congress MLAs stormed into the well of the House over the non-entry issue. They alleged that the government was acting in a dictatorial manner. Speaker Gian Chand Gupta informed the members that no placards, posters etc were allowed inside.

223,2020/03/03,Gang giving fake contracts for new ration cards busted,"No new ration cards needed: Centre

Delhi Police have nabbed a Jharkhand-based group of alleged scamsters, who fraudulently gave contracts for issue of plastic cards under the ‘One nation, One ration card’ scheme.

Announcing the arrests on Tuesday, Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Danve Raosaheb Dadarao reiterated that no fresh card is needed for the portability scheme, under which existing ration card holders can avail subsidised food anywhere in the country. The scheme is set to be rolled out in 20 States from June onwards.

Last month, Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan had said the ministry had lodged an FIR over a fake letter purporting to come from the ministry and claiming that private vendors were being engaged to prepare new ration cards. “No new ration cards are being made under the One Nation One Ration Card scheme. The existing card will be accepted across the country to get subsidised foodgrain,” Mr. Paswan had tweeted.

However, as no individual victim had been identified at the time, the Delhi Police could not make much headway in its investigations, said Deputy Commissioner of Police Eish Singhal.

On Monday, a Maharashtra resident Bhagwat Sahebaro Wayal approched the ministry in Delhi and alleged that he had been defrauded by a Jharkhand resident Pratush Kumar Rana, who had charged him up to ₹15 lakh for a contract to print new cards in one district. Delhi Police arrested the accused and his associate with the forged letter in the city on Tuesday.

225,2020/03/03,"Jharkhand govt. announces farm loan waiver, unemployment dole","Free power and free treatment also part of welfare steps in State budget

The Hemant Soren government on Tuesday announced a slew of welfare measures including farm loan waiver, unemployment allowance, free power, free treatment for critical illness and universal scholarship for students in government schools.

Jharkhand Finance Minister Rameshwar Oraon presented the first budget of the alliance government led by Mr. Soren, which came to power in December last year.

“The annual budgetary allocation for the year 2020-21 is estimated at ₹86,370 crore. The revenue and capital expenditure has been estimated at ₹73,316 crore and ₹13,054 crore respectively,” Mr. Oraon said in the State Assembly.

“More than 75% of Jharkhand’s population depends on agriculture and allied activities. The government is determined for development of people associated with the sector. The government has decided to start a short-term loan waiver scheme for people whose lion’s share of income goes in repaying farm loan,” he said.

‘Pro-poor budget’

Welcoming the budget, Mr. Soren said: “The budget is a reflection of our pro-poor outlook. We have made our priorities public. We have turned the direction of our governance towards shanties. In the first phase, farm loan up to ₹50,000 will be waived.”

The Minister said the State would assess the number of farmers who have taken loan and the total amount that needs to be repaid.

As per major budgetary provisions, people consuming less than 300 units of power will not have to pay electricity dues for first 100 units.

Unemployed youths, who had earned their bachelor and master’s degree in the past three years and registered with employment exchanges for jobs, will be paid an annual unemployment allowance of ₹5,000 and ₹7,000 respectively. The government has made budgetary provision of ₹146 crore under this head.

The government also proposes to provide universal scholarship for students enrolled in government schools from Class I to XII under the Chief Minister Special Student Scholarship scheme.

The government will facilitate free treatment for critical illness such as cancer and kidney and liver ailments in top-notch health institutions of the country for families having annual income of less than ₹8 lakh

226,2020/03/03,New regional alliance formed in Tripura,"Primary aim tribal council elections, say leaders

Two regional parties in Tripura have come together to launch an alliance to contest in the elections to the 28-member tribal autonomous district council likely to take place in May. The Tipraland State Party (TSP) and the IPFT (Tipraha) hoped that some more indigenous parties would join the United Progressive Regional Alliance (UPRA).

Alliance leaders like Binay Debbarma, Badhu Debbarma and Chitta Debbarma said primarily their aim has been the tribal council elections but they would essentially deal with contentious issues like the CAA, the NPR and the NRC vis-a-vis the benefit and interest of the State’s 33% indigenous community.

Like the other regional parties, the new platform opposed the CAA and the NPR but supported the demand for the introduction of the NRC in Tripura.

The leaders said they would approach other indigenous-based political parties to join the UPRA to take on the BJP and the Opposition Congress and the CPI(M) in the elections to the council which was constituted under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/new-regional-alliance-formed-in-tripura/article30974022.ece
227,2020/03/03,No major terror attack in country’s hinterland in last three years: Home Ministry informs Lok Sabha,"Jammu and Kashmir reported over 1,500 terror incidents during the period, it said.

No major terror attack took place in the hinterland of the country during the last three years, except a grenade attack in Amritsar in November 2018, the Home Ministry informed Lok Sabha on Tuesday.

Jammu and Kashmir reported over 1,500 terror incidents during the period, it said. The grenade attack in Amritsar took place at a prayer hall in Adliwal village on November 18, 2018, wherein three persons were killed, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy said.

“As per available information, the involvement of Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) and International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) has come to notice in this incident. The Punjab Police has arrested three persons involved in this attack,” he said.

The data presented by the Minister in response to a question also showed that 1,550 terror incidents were reported in Jammu and Kashmir between 2017 and 2019 and 251 security personnel, 118 civilians and 627 terrorists were killed during the period.

Mr. Reddy said terrorism is largely sponsored from across the border as Pakistan’s snooping and espionage agency ISI has close links with terrorist outfits such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, Hizbul Mujahideen and it provides them safe havens, material support, finance and other logistics to carry out terrorist activities in India.

“No major terror attack took place in the hinterland of the country during the last three years, except a grenade attack in... Amritsar, wherein three persons were killed,” he said.

On a question about under-trial terrorists, the Minister said the data is maintained by the State governments since ‘Public Order’, ‘Police’ and ‘Prison’ are State subjects as per the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.

At the Central government level, he said, the cases relating to terrorist acts are investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).

The National Investigation Agency Act, 2008, provides for constitution of special courts, registered by the NIA, where such cases are heard on day-to-day basis and get precedence over other cases.

“Accordingly, 49 courts all over India have been designated as Special NIA Courts for speedy disposal of cases relating to all accused arrested by NIA in terror cases,” Mr. Reddy said.

He said financial assistance is given to victims of terror attacks. The State government initially gives financial relief to the civilian victim or next of kin of victim, which is ₹5 lakh in case of death or permanent incapacitation, and then seeks reimbursement of the expenditure from the Centre.

“Apart from it, the concerned State governments also provide assistance to the victims as per their policy,” he added.

Mr. Reddy said a total reimbursement of ₹4.30 crore has been issued in fiscal years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19.

“The ex-gratia/compensation is paid to the families of security personnel as per the extant guidelines of CAPFs/Army/State governments and under the ‘Security Related Expenditure (SRE) Scheme’ for the State Police/Security Personnel/civilian victims,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m3r3fb/article30791060.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KISHANREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-major-terror-attack-in-countrys-hinterland-in-last-three-years-home-ministry-informs-lok-sabha/article30972689.ece
228,2020/03/03,Telugu speakers top South Indian population in Assam,"Hindi speakers, third behind Assamese and Bengali, outnumber Bodos

The population of Telugu speakers in Assam is almost twice that of the combined number of those who speak three other major South India languages — Malayalam, Tamil and Kannada in that order.

Hindi speakers are the third largest linguistic group in Assam after the Assamese and Bengali people, linguistic data from the 2011 census presented in the 126-member Assam Assembly has revealed.

Replying to a question from Congress MLA Kamalakhya Dey Purkayastha on Monday, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said people belonging to 116 linguistic groups, 32 Other Backward Classes, 29 Scheduled Tribes and 16 Scheduled Castes lived in the State.

The Assamese speakers, accounting for 48% of the State’s population, led the linguistic list with 1.51 crore people, followed by the Bengali speakers with 90.24 lakh people (38% of the total population of 3.1 crore).

The Hindi speakers, comprising 6.73% of the population, had 21 lakh people. They outnumbered the Bodo speakers – the largest plains tribe in the Northeast – by 6.85 lakh.

The Bodos were 4.53% of the total population, followed by the Mishing tribal dialect speakers with 1.98%, the Nepali speakers with 1.91% and the Karbi dialect speakers with 1.63%.

All are here

The data showed that Assam was home to people belonging to almost all the States and communities across India and beyond, as evident from 173 people listed as ‘Afghani’.

Among the speakers of the South Indian languages, the Telugus led the table with 26,630 people, followed 5,768 Malayalis, 5,229 Tamils and 2,597 Kannadigas. The total population of the speakers of Malayalam, Tamil and Kannada came to 13,994.

The Coorgis were a minuscule community with 15 people.

The data also revealed that there were 104 speakers of Sanskrit, besides 19 Ladakhi, seven Lahauli and four Balti speakers. Comparatively, the Konkanis were a majority with 413 people.

Among the religious groups in a separate set of data provided, the Hindus topped the list with 61.46%, followed by the Muslims at 34.22% and Christians at 3.73%.

While 0.16% of the population did not state their religion, 0.08% belonged to nature-worshippers and unclassified faiths.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/f728u4/article30972336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDPATOWARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/telugu-speakers-top-south-indian-population-in-assam/article30972338.ece
229,2020/03/03,"SC dismisses review plea by former Maharashtra CM Fadnavis in forgery, criminal defamation cases","Bench’s judgment on October 1 last year directed a Nagpur court to continue with the trial against Fadnavis for violation of the Representation of the People Act

The Supreme Court has dismissed a review petition filed by former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis against its October 2019 verdict directing him to face trial for suppressing information about two pending forgery and criminal defamation cases in his 2014 election documents.

“We find no ground to interfere in the review petitions. The same are dismissed,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra observed in an order dated February 18 and published on Tuesday.

The Bench, also comprising Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose, had reserved the case for orders on February 18 itself.

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, for Mr. Fadnavis, had earlier asked for a stay of the trial court proceedings, but was refused by the Bench.

The review petition was filed against the Bench’s judgment on October 1 last year directing a Nagpur court to continue with the trial against Mr. Fadnavis under Section125-A of the Representation of the People (RP) Act, 1951.

The October 2019 judgment had come in an appeal filed by Satish Ukey, a lawyer, against a Bombay High Court decision that had set aside a Sessions Court go-ahead to try Mr. Fadnavis for violation of the RP Act.

The October judgment had held that a “contesting candidate is mandated to furnish information concerning the cases in which a Competent Court has taken cognisance along with the cases in which charges have been framed”.

The Supreme Court had interpreted Section 33-A of the 1951 Act to hold that “information” to be disclosed by a candidate includes cases of which a court had already taken cognisance.

Mr. Rohatgi had argued that Section 33A was wrongly involved in his case.

The Supreme Court had held that the election affidavit under Form 26 of the Conduct of Election Rules of 1961, submitted to the poll officer along with the nomination papers, should contain details of not only cases in which charges had been filed but also those which had been taken cognisance.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5q16af/article30483435.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5BMDEVENDRAFADNAVIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sc-dismisses-review-plea-by-former-maharashtra-cm-fadnavis-in-forgery-criminal-defamation-cases/article30970336.ece
230,2020/03/03,"BJP has begun ferrying Congress, BSP, SP MLAs to New Delhi, alleges Digvijaya Singh","Support of non-BJP MLAs vital for Congress to secure third Rajya Sabha seat up for grabs later this month

A day after accusing BJP leaders of luring Congress MLAs in Madhya Pradesh to cross over, Congress MP Digvijaya Singh on Tuesday alleged the BJP had “begun the process” of taking Congress, BSP and SP MLAs, who support the Congress government in the State, to New Delhi.

Ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections for three seats from the State later this month, two sure in both BJP’s and Congress’s kitty each, Mr. Singh asked on Twitter, “Didn’t former BJP Minister Bhupendra Singh yesterday take BSP MLA Rambai in a charter flight from Bhopal to New Delhi? Shivraj ji, do you want to say something?”

Mr. Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP, however, wrote that the party exuded “full confidence” in Rambai Parihar, as she was an “admirer” of Chief Minister Kamal Nath and supported him.

Given the seat arithmetic in the Vidhan Sabha, with Congress having 114 members and BJP 106, the Congress needs the continuing crucial support of one Samajwadi Party (SP), two Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and four independent MLAs to secure the third Rajya Sabha seat.

‘BJP scared’

Attesting to Mr. Singh’s claim, Chief Minister Kamal Nath said the BJP was scared lest its “corruption” of 15 years in the State be uncovered.

“I completely agree with what Digvijaya Singh has said,” he told reporters in Bhopal. “Today the BJP is scared that in the coming days all their corruption of 15 years will be uncovered. I want to ask them where this money came from.”

Claiming that MLAs had approached him complaining the BJP was offering them a certain amount, he said that he told them, “Phokat ka paisa he le lena (It’s free money, so take it).”

On being asked if the government was stable amid the charge of horse-trading levelled by the Congress against the BJP, “There is nothing to worry about.”

Meanwhile, Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia, on Mr. Singh’s claims, in Gwalior told reporters, “I don’t have information about these facts. But the government is stable.”

He further said the Congress government was formed by people, and is standing on their support. “It has been committed to people, and will continue to be so,” he added.

BJP rubbishes Singh's charge

Meanwhile, BJP State media chief Lokendra Parashar said Mr. Singh was making such statements as he enjoyed being in the news. “That’s why he makes such frivolous remarks, both in politics and society. No one takes him seriously in any case,” he said.

BJP vice-president Shivraj Singh Chouhan is yet to respond to the charge.

In December last, BSP president Mayawati suspended membership of Ms. Parihar for breaking party discipline by not toeing the party line on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and supporting it publicly.

And Mr. Singh, on Monday alleged Mr. Chouhan and former BJP Minister Narottam Mishra, in an attempt to destabilise the Kamal Nath government, offered at least eight-ten Congress MLAs ₹25-35 crore each.

Furthermore, the BJP got another stunner on Monday, when its MLA Sharad Kol claimed the party did not give adequate representation to backward communities in its leadership, and that the party at the Centre and in the State ceded importance to only “one particular community”. He went on to praise the Congress government for slashing electricity bills, which, he claimed, brought happiness to the poor.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8yw201/article30897286.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23THDIGVIJAYASINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-has-begun-ferrying-congress-bsp-sp-mlas-to-new-delhi-alleges-digvijaya-singh/article30969988.ece
231,2020/03/03,"Kolhapur district bank official killed, two injured in yet another mishap on Mumbai-Pune expressway","A truck carrying industrial cargo rammed into their car from behind at high speed near Khopoli around 3 a.m. in the second accident in a little over 24 hours

In the second consecutive mishap to take place in 24 hours along the Pune-Mumbai Expressway, an official with the Kolhapur District Central Cooperative (KDCC) Bank was killed and two others travelling with him were severely injured after their car was rammed from behind by a truck in early on Wednesday.

The deceased, identified as Ranveer Chavan, 51, and hailing from Sangli district, was with the credit disbursement section of the Kolhapur DCC, police sources said.

Mr. Chavan was travelling with two authorities of the Sar Senapati Santaji Ghorpade Sugar Factory in Kagal in Kolhapur district, which is controlled by senior Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and State Rural Development Minister Hasan Mushrif.

The trio had set out from Pune late on Monday when a truck carrying industrial cargo hit their car from behind at high speed near Khopoli on the Mumbai-Pune expressway around 3 a.m., mangling the vehicle, the highway police said.

While Mr. Chavan was killed on the spot, his co-travellers were rushed to the MGM Hospital in Navi Mumbai.

Meeting with Minister

According to sources, the bank official was scheduled to meet with Mr. Mushrif at the Mantralaya on Tuesday.

The accident led to traffic congestion for a brief period before authorities, with the help of personnel from the ‘Delta Force’, cleared the debris away.

This is the second incident to take place on the expressway, notorious for its rising rate of fatalities, in a little over 24 hours.

Five persons standing near an exit point on the Eway stretch near Khandala were killed late on Sunday after they were crushed under a tempo coming down at high speed.

A sixth person, who was part of the group, sustained grievous injuries after the tempo, whose driver allegedly could not control the vehicle owing to its speed, turned on its side at a sharp bend.

All six were workers at the Talegaon MIDC.

In November last year, a Swift DZire car had rammed into a tanker near the Khalapur toll plaza along the expressway, killing four persons of a family and injuring two more.

In that case as well, the accident had occurred early in the morning with the driver of the Swift vehicle losing control and ramming into the rear of the stationary HP gas tanker.

232,2020/03/03,Delimitation in eight Manipur Assembly segments likely to provide relief to voters,"Non-tribals have not been able to contest elections for years

The forthcoming delimitation in Manipur is likely to give the democratic rights to the voters of eight Assembly segments who were denied the right to contest the Parliamentary elections.

Former Minister N. Nimaichand Luwang and now a BJP leader in one of the segments told The Hindu on Tuesday that elections in these segments had been one-way traffic. He explained that the voters in these segments, seven in Thoubal district and one in the Jiribam district, had the voting right only to elect a tribal MP but the majority non-tribals could not contest the elections.

On February 28, the government had issued a notification saying that delimitation works shall be started in four northeastern States, including Manipur.

These eight segments had been included in the Outer Manipur Parliamentary reserved for the tribals.

The Thoubal District Demand Committee has been demanding this democratic right all these years. Another group, the Joint Non-government Voluntary Organisation, Kakching feels that the delimitation will bring a final solution to the problem.

P. Somorendro, co-convener of the Thoubal MP Candidature Demand Committee, said that the voters of these segments had been denied the right to contest the Parliamentary election. In the past, people in these segments had even boycotted the elections.

The Manipur Assembly passed a resolution on May 13, 2003, on this impasse and sent a memorandum to the Centre demanding an early solution.

The eight Assembly segments had elected several Ministers from these segments as well as Okram Ibobi, a record holder since he is the first and only MLA who became Chief Minister for three consecutive terms.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/w1ytnl/article30798789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VOTEFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/delimitation-in-eight-manipur-assembly-segments-likely-to-provide-relief-to-voters/article30969636.ece
233,2020/03/03,"BJP, Trinamool have tacit understanding, say Left, Cong.","A day after Amit Shah’s rally, Left parties and Congress hit the streets

A day after Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s rally in Kolkata, the Left parties and the Congress hit the streets on Monday targeting both the BJP and the Trinamool Congress.

Slogans like ‘Modi Mamata Ek Hai’ (Modi and Mamata are one) were raised during the rally from Subodh Mullick Square to Mahajati Sadan in central Kolkata. The rally saw the presence of CPI(M) State secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra, Left Front chairperson Biman Bose, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member Mohd. Salim and State Congress president Somen Mitra among others.

Referring to the recent meeting between West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Mr. Shah in Bhubaneswar and the BJP leader’s rally in Kolkata on Sunday, leaders of both the Left and the Congress alleged a “tacit understanding” between the Trinamool and the BJP.

“We don’t get permission to hold rallies, organise processions in the city and Amit Shah held a rally without any opposition,” Dr. Mishra said. He dared the Chief Minister to take strong action against those who raised provocative slogans en route to the BJP rally.

Narada videos

According to the CPI(M) State secretary, many Trinamool leaders accused in the Narada sting videos and the Saradha scam are out of prison only because of the alleged understanding between the two parties.

Mr. Biman Bose said Ms. Banerjee was having lunch with Mr. Shah and she was greeting him with flowers. “It cannot be anything but an understanding,” he said.

Mr. Somen Mitra raised questions as to why there were no protests by the Trinamool when Mr. Shah visited the State. “This is a matter of shame for people in Bengal that after riots in Delhi, Home Minister will come and do a rally in Kolkata,” he said.

The Left parties and the State Congress have come together to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, but the rally was aimed at targeting both the BJP and the Trinamool. Supporters of the student and youth wing of the Left parties tried to wash the foundation of Sahid Minar claiming that it was turned “impure” by the Sunday rally. On Sunday also the Left and Congress supporters held protests in different parts of the city oppposing Mr. Shah’s visit.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/53fs59/article30967508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIAVIOLENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-trinamool-have-tacit-understanding-say-left-cong/article30967509.ece
234,2020/03/03,Body-builder in Ganjam triumphs over disability,"Young Gadadhar Sahu show exemplary courage in fighting the odds despite financial constraints

Despite losing both his legs in an accident, Gadadhar Sahu (26) of Odisha’s Ganjam district is preparing to make his mark in the field of body-building.

The physically challenged youth from a Below Poverty Line (BPL) family of Narendrapur village under Shergarh Block has shown exemplary courage in fighting the odds. He has completed his Bachelor’s degree and is trying hard to get a job. He helps out in his brother’s small fast-food kiosk and spends his free time in body-building.

In 2008, Mr. Sahu met with an accident while disembarking from the train in Surat, Gujarat, while on a trip to visit his older brother, who was working there. After seeing several physically challenged body-builders on the Internet, in 2015, he decided to take up the sport.

‘Will power’

“In everything else, the amputee condition of my body was my greatest obstacle in life. So, I decided to use body-building to prove that I can fight back through will power,” he said.

Anand Arnold, the first wheelchair-bound body-builder from India, is Mr. Sahu’s idol and inspiration. He has not yet been able to contact Mr. Arnold.

Self-taught, Mr. Sahu won the 51 kg wheelchair challenge for body-builders in the Junior Mr. Odisha competition of 2016, after which Dilip Kumar Mishra, trainer of a gymnasium at Hinjli, offered him professional coaching. Recently, Mr. Sahu won the wheelchair challenge at a ‘Mr. Ganjam’ competition.

Financial difficulties

With four brothers and three sisters, financial difficulties have always burdened Mr. Sahu. His friends help him out.

“A power sport like body-building needs a lot of expenditure on nutrition and gym costs,” he said. He is confident that with proper support, he can shine in national and international arenas. He has requested the government and other organisations to help him out, even as he is a source of inspiration for many around him.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/body-builder-in-ganjam-triumphs-over-disability/article30965064.ece

A case of dowry and domestic violence has been registered here against a man and his family members on a complaint by his wife, police said on Monday. The man also gave triple talaq to the woman over phone, they said.

The case was registered on Sunday on the orders of DIG, Manoj Kumar, SHO, Quila police station said. The police, however, said no case has been registered under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act which makes instant triple talaq (talaq-e-biddah) in any form spoken, in writing or by electronic means such as e-mail, SMS and WhatsApp illegal and void, with up to three years in jail for the husband.

“The woman (complainant) got married to Tasleem on May 9, 2014. After the marriage, her in-laws started harassing her for dowry,” he said. The officer police said the complainant was also allegedly molested by her brother-in-law.

“The woman’s brother-in-law Altaf often molested her and tried to rape her a few days back. When the woman resisted, he threatened to kill her by putting a knife on her neck. However, as the woman raised an alarm, Altaf fled from there,” Kumar said.

“On February 6, when the woman complained about the incident to her husband, he beat her up and threw her out of the house along with the children. Next day, he pronounced triple talaq on her over phone,” the officer added.

On Sunday, when the woman made a complaint in this regard to DIG Rajesh Pandey, a case of dowry and domestic violence was registered against seven persons, including her husband, brother-in-law, mother-in-law Reshma and sister-in-law Habiban Khatoon, police said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/up-woman-harassed-over-dowry-given-triple-talaq-husband-in-laws-booked/article30967532.ece

237,2020/03/03,"Govt. committed to resolving Dhangar quota issue, says CM","Opposition creates ruckus over reservation

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the government is committed to giving justice to the Dhangar community, after the Opposition raised the issues of the community’s pending demand for reservation, in the Legislative Council on Monday.

A special meeting on the matter will be held on Friday.

A question by Ramhari Rupanvar (Congress) on the status of reservation to the community came up for discussion in the House on Monday. The community has been demanding reservation, and based on a Tata Institute of Social Sciences report, the State had formed a sub-committee in March 2019 to study the demands.

In his written response, Tribal Development Minister K.C. Padvi said, “The proposal has been sent to the Advocate General through the Law Department for remarks. Further action will be taken based on his remarks. The Home Department has asked for a report from the Director General of Police about withdrawing cases against Dhangar reservation protesters. At present, the community has reservation under nomadic tribes.”

When the question came up for discussion during Question Hour, the Opposition came down heavily on the government for failing to provide this reservation. Legislators rushed to the well, raising slogans against the government, whereas Maha Vikas Aghadi members asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) what it did for the community in its five-year rule. The House was adjourned twice over the issue.

BJP ally Vinayak Mete said, “The TISS report was presented on March 2, 2019. The CM is here. This is a complex and important issue. I request the CM to give his opinion.” Leader of Opposition Pravin Darekar asked for a definite timeline for the decision.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab announced that compounded cases against protesters will be withdrawn, but criminal cases will have to be investigated individually. Chairman Ramraje Nimbalkar directed that a meeting be held in his chambers on Friday.

When the Opposition continued to create a ruckus, the CM said, “It is an old demand. Many people promised to resolve the issue and landed plum positions for themselves. They made their careers, but the community stayed deprived. We are committed to working for all communities. The issue needs to be studied and resolved once and for all. The Opposition should not think only they care about this issue. The government is committed to it.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/govt-committed-to-resolving-dhangar-quota-issue-says-cm/article30967387.ece
238,2020/03/03,"1,286 farmers ended lives in Vidarbha last year: Minister","242 farmer suicides recorded in State in December alone

Between January and December 2019, as many as 1,286 farmers committed suicide in Vidarbha, while there were 242 suicides in the State in December alone.

Relief and Rehabilitation Minister Vijay Wadettiwar informed the Legislative Council of the figures while responding to a query.

The Maha Vikas Aghadi government has repeatedly called farmers’ welfare its priority and announced a waiver of loans up to ₹2 lakh soon after coming to power. The government last week released the first two lists of beneficiaries. With the State legislature in session, the Opposition has been trying to corner the government on farmers’ issues, calling its measures inadequate.

Parinay Fuke (BJP) had asked the government for information on crop losses, resultant farmers’ suicides and the action taken.

In a written response to the House, Mr. Wadettiwar said unseasonal rain has caused losses of 70% of the kharif crop and a significant amount of the rabi crop in Vidarbha and Marathwada. In the 11 districts of Vidarbha, between January and December 2019, as many as 1,286 farmers committed suicide. Of these, 576 were due to farm-related distress, he said.

In December alone, 102 farmers committed suicide in the eight districts of Marathwada, and a total 242 in the State. Of the 242 farmers, 59 have been confirmed to be related to to agricultural distress. The government has disbursed aid to the tune of ₹7,30,936 lakh to 93 lakh farmers.

Sharad Ranpise (Congress) had also raised a query related to farmers’ suicides, also demanding to know if there were irregularities worth ₹9 crore in a farmers’ welfare scheme.

Mr. Wadettiwar’s response read, “Between October 2014 and August 2019, 14,591 farmers committed suicide. In November 2019, 308 farmers committed suicide.” However, he said, there were no irregularities.

The first list of farm loan waiver beneficiaries had covered 15,358 farmers, prompting the Opposition to criticise the government for its piecemeal approach.

The government on February 29 announced the second list of 21.82 lakh eligible account holders, bringing the total number of beneficiaries to 21.97 lakh.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1286-farmers-ended-lives-in-vidarbha-last-year-minister/article30967349.ece

Many parts of the State, including Nagpur, Amravati, Pune and Aurangabad, saw unseasonal rain last week. Mr. Wadettiwar told the Council that in 129 villages, farm land worth 2,820 hectares was affected by rain and hailstorms. “I have directed all district collectors to carry out joint panchnamas of the losses.

240,2020/03/03,‘Doubt if govt. can cope with rain damage’,"Raju Shetti hits out at MVA govt. for ‘floundering’ in implementation of crop loan waiver scheme

With yet another bout of unseasonal rain ravaging parts of the State, especially Marathwada, Vidarbha and western Maharashtra, farmers’ leader and Swabhimani Paksha chief Raju Shetti has claimed that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is incapable of dealing with this fresh crisis affecting the rabi crop.

“The scale of the damage wrought by the rain in the past 72 hours is undoubtedly massive. I doubt whether this government has the wherewithal to cope with this as it seems to be floundering in the implementation of its loan waiver scheme announced in December,” Mr. Shetti said to The Hindu.

Intense rain has been pounding parts of Beed in Marathwada, Akola in Vidarbha, and tehsils in Kolhapur, Sangli, Satara and Solapur in western Maharashtra since Saturday, wreaking havoc on fruit orchards, especially the grape crop, as well as the Rabi sorghum (jowar) and chickpea crops.

The former Hatkanangale MP also alleged that officials in the State Revenue Department were in cahoots with their counterparts in companies offering crop insurance and were siphoning off money from farmers.

“While farmers have been bearing the brunt of erratic climatic changes in the past three years, crop insurance firms are making hay with their corrupt practices. Despite [the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana] gathering evidence of their misdemeanour and submitting it to the government, no action has been forthcoming thus far,” Mr. Shetti said, expressing disappointment with the previous and current governments.

The MVA government announced the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule farm loan waiver scheme on December 21 last year, under which farmers with loans up to ₹2 lakh from April 1, 2015, to September 30, 2019, will get immediate relief. Last week, it rolled out the first list of 15,358 beneficiaries and second list of 21.82 lakh farmers two lists of beneficiaries.

However, Mr. Shetti criticised the slow pace of implementation. “We had gone with the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress in the elections and then supported the MVA government with the expectation that it would work for the weal of the farmer. However, these hopes have been dashed,” Mr. Shetti said.

Meanwhile, State Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat and Agriculture Minister Dada Bhuse said district authorities have been directed to ensure that panchnamas of the losses are done swiftly so as to decide the compensation.

Echoing Mr. Shetti, BJP State president Chandrakant Patil, too accused the MVA of inefficiency in dealing with the latest crisis. “This government has yet to recompense farmers for the crop damage suffered in October last year,” Mr. Patil said in Mumbai.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wgsc9k/article30967220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BMCROP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/doubt-if-govt-can-cope-with-rain-damage/article30967221.ece
241,2020/03/03,Baghel protests against use of CRPF in Chhattisgarh I-T raids,"Action an affront to cooperative federalism, CM tells Modi

The ongoing tax raids using Central forces in Chhattisgarh and the actions of the Union Finance and Home Ministries are an affront to cooperative federalism, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday.

Mr. Baghel said it is an “intriguing coincidence” that the raids coincided with the decision of the State government to initiate criminal investigations into corruption under the previous BJP government, led by Dr. Raman Singh.

He pointed out that as per reports, the Income Tax (I-T) Department has conducted at least 25 raids in a “clandestine manner” across various locations in the State since February 27.

“May I respectfully point out that the actions of Finance/Home Ministries of the Government of India are nothing short of an affront to the idea of cooperative federalism that you have often spoken about,” the Chief Minister’s letter said.

Also Read Congress links I-T raids to corruption probe in Chhattisgarh

Mr. Baghel said the action not only reflects “coercive and insecure centrism but also the actions of the Central agencies border on political vendetta on one hand and threaten the very core of our democracy on the other”.

“... As a former Chief Minister, you would agree that Law and Order is a State subject and Central forces cannot be deployed in a State without consent and prior intimation to the State government,” he wrote.

“If each one of us fails to adhere to this cardinal principle of our Constitutional democracy, we would become an undemocratic anarchy,” the letter stated.

The Chief Minister also questioned the “unconstitutional” use of CRPF personnel, who are to be used only for “emergencies” and exceptional circumstances, during the raids.

“May I respectfully point out that our State government has never refused any assistance to Income Tax or any other department of the Union. I take this opportunity to reiterate the availability of the police machinery or any other assistance in the quest to find and prosecute the corrupt. I am certain you will support my government’s endeavour expose corruption bereft of any ideology. This would be in tune with your good self’s assertions,” Mr. Baghel said.

Income Tax Department searches in Raipur on February 27 uncovered evidence of huge amounts of “unaccounted cash” generated from liquor and mining businesses, being paid to public servants and others every month, a statement from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said. So far, total unaccounted transactions amounting to ₹150 crore have been uncovered in the raids on a group of individuals, hawala dealers and businessmen, the CBDT added.

“Incriminating documents and electronic data seized during the search show that substantial amount of illegal gratification was being paid to public servants and others every month,"" said the statement adding that unaccounted bank accounts and transactions have also been found. “Details of benami vehicles, hawala transfers, transfer to Kolkata-based companies and creation of shell companies with huge land bank have also been found and seized.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8abnkc/article30965864.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THRDBAGHEL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/baghel-protests-against-use-of-crpf-in-chhattisgarh-i-t-raids/article30965865.ece
242,2020/03/03,Assam BJP MLA prescribes cow dung for COVID-19,"Suman Haripriya says smoke from burnt cow dung has the power to destroy viruses

A BJP legislator in Assam has claimed to have found in cow dung a cure for COVID-19 that has killed thousands in China, South Korea and elsewhere across the globe. Suman Haripriya, who represents the Hajo constituency, also says there are reasons to believe that ‘gomutra’ (cow urine) can be an antidote for cancer.

Discussion in House

“The government is researching on cow dung and cow urine. The smoke from burnt cow dung has the power to destroy viruses. I believe cow dung can help fight the deadly coronavirus too,” she told the 126-member Assembly during a discussion on cattle smuggling on Monday.

Ms. Haripriya, daughter of former Union Minister Bijoya Chakraborty, was a film-maker before joining politics.

“There are scientific reasons why cow dung and cow urine are used in Hindu rituals. Some hospitals in Gujarat treat their patients with Ayurvedic medicines. The patients there are kept alongside cows and given ‘Panchamrit’ prepared from cow urine and cow dung,” Ms. Haripriya said.

She batted for fighting cancer with an “alternative therapy” primarily using cow urine, claiming that she did a lot of research on the utilities of cows.

Health benefits

“People worshipped cows in the olden days because of health benefits. The basil plant is similarly worshipped because basil leaves have properties that can cure disorders such as diabetes,” the MLA said.

Unidentified miscreants on Sunday night vandalised a mosque in western Assam’s Baksa district and burnt several Islamic holy books, including the Quran.

Baksa is one of the four districts that are part of the politically volatile Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), where elections are due in April.

Local residents and organisations including the All Bodoland Minority Students’ Union condemned the crime at the Kalapani Anchalik Mosque and on Monday demanded the arrest of the miscreants within 24 hours.

“The people in the area have understood that they should maintain calm,” observed Mr. Kumar. “The situation is under control now,” he said, adding that the locals had been assured that the culprits would be brought to book.

BTC chairman Hagrama Mohilary blamed the incident on “elements that want to create unrest” ahead of the elections to the 40-seat council. He is also the chief of the Bodoland People’s Front, one of the two regional allies of the BJP in Assam.

244,2020/03/03,RLV Ramakrishnan’s love for Mohiniyattam,"Not many men learn Mohiniyattam, RLV Ramakrishnan is one of the few who do

The question is inevitable; RLV Ramakrishnan’s answer suggests that he expects it now. Why Mohiniyattam?

The dance form gets its name from Mohini — the female, enchantress form of Vishnu — and, conventionally, practitioners are women. Ramakrishnan is one of the few male dancers who practise it. He says, “Odissi has lasya — the graceful and feminine aspect — to a much greater degree than even Mohiniyattam, and Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra is one of the greatest practitioners of the form. ”

In a first for the event, Ramakrishnan performed at the Nishagandhi Dance Festival, Thiruvananthapuram, in January this year. The response was appreciative and therefore, encouraging, he says. “They don’t expect to see a man doing Mohiniyattam and they liked what they saw.” The dancer, who has been performing since 1998, says it is easier to get venues to perform now, perhaps due to his academic qualification in dance — he has a doctorate in Mohiniyattam. “Sometimes it is a struggle for recognition. Younger dancers don’t get a stage while established dancers do. In such a time I get my share,” he says, adding “it is better now.” When he started it was a mindset — that Mohiniyattam is not for women — he was challenging. “There were gurus who disagreed and then there were those who didn’t see a problem and taught me.”

Ramakrishnan performed parts of the Ramayana with Kochi-based dancer Soumya Satish. He essayed the male characters — he believes men should present male characters as feminine traits of female dancers interfere when they present masculine characters. “Natyashastra does not proscribe Mohiniyattam for men. Over the years the male perspective got sidelined because women sustained the form,” says the 43 year-old guest lecturer at Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit, Kalady. Among his students are men, according to him there is a change in attitude toward pursuing Mohiniyattam.

Dance Drama Saumya Satish first performed with Kalamandalam Ramakrishnan in December 2019 as part of the 25th anniversary celebrations of her dance school, Bharata Kala Mandiram (Elamakkara). ‘Bharatham Mohanam’ was choreographed by Ramakrishnan. Since then Saumya and Ramakrishnan have performed together in two other programmes.

A State winner in Mohiniyattam at the School Youth Festival and Kalathilakam, she first saw Ramakrishnan perform a couple of years ago. “I was impressed, but it was another two years until I contacted him. There were a couple of dance pieces that I wanted to learn from him,” she says. The dancers met last July, when Saumya began her lessons. “I asked why not we perform Mohiniyattam together, he had the same idea. And the first peformance was in December.” She states that there should be space for men in Mohiniyattam, as it infuses new ideas and helps growth.

His love of dance led him to quit an undergraduate course in science to join RLV College of Fine Arts , Tripunithura. He completed his post-graduation in Mohiniyattam with a first rank from the Mahatma Gandhi University. The younger brother of the late Kalabhavan Mani, Ramakrishnan has acted in two films — Chalakkudykaran Changathy, Mani’s biography and Theeta Rappai.

Choosing Mohiniyattam was easy, he says, as it is an indigenous art form. “When we have such forms in Kerala, why should I learn some other form from elsewhere?” Ramakrishnan adds that finding teachers was easy: those who did not want to teach refused and those who agreed became his gurus. Ramakrishnan mentions two who are special — RLV Anand, his first dance teacher and Dr. NK Geetha, his research guide. The topic of his doctoral thesis was Aatathinte Aanvazhikal (loosely translated ‘The Path of Men in Dance’).

At RLV College, though Ramakrishnan was the only male student, that did not bother his classmates or teachers. “There are those that are unwilling to accept men and then there are those who do. Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma teacher, a doyenne of the form, was open to men performing Mohiniyattam. Mindsets apart, even Kerala Kalamandalam, a deemed university, does not admit men for the Mohiniyattam course,” he says. The reason for the exclusion harks back to its lasya aspect.

Ramakrishnan refuses to accept the argument, “There are male characters. There is no harm if the masculine element is expressed by men. Also, what of teachers of yore like Ayyappa Panicker who taught Mohiniyattam, during Maharaja Karthika Thirunal of Travancore’s reign? The male nattuvanar - guru/choreographer/vocal percussionist — had an important role in Mohiniyattam. It was to his chollu (rhythmic structure) that the dance was performed and he, sometimes, would perform on the stage till poet Vallathol Narayana Menon’s time. He was instrumental in the revival of the dance form. The practise was discouraged as the perception was that the attention shifted from the performer. So how does the argument stand?” he asks.

245,2020/03/03,Completion of shutter repair works in KRP Dam likely by June,"Two and half years after the Krishnagiri Reservoir Project (KRP) Dam’s shutter breached spawning concerns over the dam’s structural safety, the replacement of shutters of the dam is gaining momentum here.

The works on the erection of shutters of KRP Dam has sped up, with 5 of the 7 shutters that were taken up for replacement completed. As on Monday, five shutters were already erected in place, and the works on the 6th shutter has commenced.

The dam’s first shutter had breached from corrosion in 2017, and the shutter was replaced a year later under the State funds. The reservoir’s full capacity of 52 feet was lowered after the breach raised concerns on the structural safety of the other shutters. In 2018, the project to replace the remaining shutters was set in motion, under the funds of World Bank under its Dam Rehabilitation and Improvement Projec (DRIP) in place here.

With the works under progress, any Summer showers will not allow storage in the reservoir. The water storage is at crest level with 25 feet, and any inflow above that will be let out.

The erection of shutters 2,3,8, 4 and 7 were completed but miscellaneous works such as welding, blasting, sand blasting, primer works remain. The authorities are hopeful the shutter works would be fully completed by June, a little ahead of the schedule assigned to the contractor. The dam would be ready in time to receive inflow from the monsoons after June.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/uy58ax/article30975890.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA04KRPSHUTTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/completion-of-shutter-repair-works-in-krp-dam-likely-by-june/article30975891.ece

248,2020/03/03,Demand for drinking water cans picks up,"As of now, 650 to 750 cans are sold at each Community Drinking Water Centre instead of normal 150 to 200

With 38 packaged drinking water units sealed in the district and the rest four units only functioning, people purchasing water in cans at the 20 Community Drinking Water Centres in the city has gone up by four-fold times in the past one week.

Following the Madras High Court order, Public Works Department officials had sealed 38 of the total 42 packaged drinking water units in the district that were functioning without no objection certificate for drawing ground water for commercial purpose.

These units supply 60,000 water cans, each 20 litre, during normal season and over one lakh water cans during summer season. Four units that currently function could meet the entire demand as their capacity is limited.

Hence, the demand for packaged drinking water has picked up in the city and in towns across the district.

The corporation has provided land for the private company that is vested with the responsibility of building, designing and operating the centre at its own cost. As many as 20 centres were established across the city that were functioning from April last selling protected drinking water at ₹ 1 a litre and ₹ 7 for 20 litre. These centres function round-the-clock and card holders can refill their cans when needed.

R. Ashok of Kollampalayam said that can water supply was stopped completely for the past four days and they are unwilling to purchase cans at huge cost. “We can manage with the water purchased from the centre”, he said who wanted the restriction on getting water to be eased at least till summer is over. Another resident in Edayankattu Valasu said that as summer season is expected to be intense, the demand for water will also be on the rise and wanted at least two cans to be supplied to households every day.

Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan told The Hindu that normally 150 to 200 water can is sold at each centre everyday which has increased to 650 to 750 cans per centre in the past few days.

He said that the civic body has plans to establish 40 more centres in the coming years so that all the 60 wards have one centre supplying protected drinking water to the people.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ursn60/article30975757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA04WATERCAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/demand-for-drinking-water-cans-picks-up/article30975758.ece

Aditya Vardhan was travelling in a boat through the Singapore River when he saw Esplanade-Theatres on the Bay near the mouth of the river. The building resembled a durian fruit and he was thrilled. “My boat was in great speed and I only had a few seconds to change the settings in my camera. I was not even sure if I had the building in focus when I clicked. But it turned out to be perfect,” says the 25-year-old. He calls this shot ‘Flow’ and it is displayed at Edifice, an exhibition/sale of his works in the city.

Edifice shows 11 photographs that he took in Pune, Bengaluru, Coimbatore and Singapore in the last one year. They are in black and white and in neon pink and blue. “The monochrome symbolises the mundane life and the neon shades represent inspiration or hope that keeps us going. I edited the original photographs to bring these colours,” he explains. The Lakshmi Mills is one of his subjects. “The construction is beautiful and it has an important role in the city’s history. I have two shots of the structure,” he says.

Another abstract work called Monarch shows a home in Pollachi. This piece won Aditya an honorary mention at the prestigious International Photography Award 2019 under the category Architecture and Abstract held in New York. “It was not expected. I was speechless when I heard the news,” he says. The photographer says that the most beautiful architecture he has seen is the DUO in Singapore. “The building resembles a honeycomb. Photography was not allowed in its premises and so I went to a nearby market from where I had a clear view,” he explains. He has captioned that photograph as The Hive.

Aditya’s interest in photography began when he was in school. His father gave him his first camera, a Nikon S8000 when he was in class XII, with which he started taking photographs of streets and forests.

The Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) of the BCCI is set to interview five candidates for the two vacant posts in the senior men’s national selection committee on Wednesday.

While BCCI president Sourav Ganguly reiterated that the “new selection panel will pick the team for the South Africa series,” the five who will appear for the interview are L. Sivaramakrishnan, Sunil Joshi, Venkatesh Prasad, Harvinder Singh and Rajesh Chauhan.

On Tuesday, the CAC, consisting of S. Madan Lal, Rudra Pratap Singh and Sulakshana Naik, met for the first time since its formation on January 31. The Hindu understands that, after going through the list of 44 applications in consultation with the BCCI office-bearers, the CAC pruned it to five.

While Joshi, Prasad and Sivaramakrishnan hail from the South Zone, Harvinder and Chauhan represented the Central Zone during their playing days.

266,2020/03/03,"It is just lack of form, Sehwag on Kohli’s failures","‘He is too good to allow this bad patch to continue’

Former India opener Virender Sehwag backed India skipper Virat Kohli to emerge from the “temporary hard phase” the latter had encountered on the tour of New Zealand. India had begun well by winning the T20 series but fared poorly to lose the one-day series and both the Test matches comprehensively.

Also read: Practice more to overcome slowing of reflexes: Kapil to Kohli

Even as former captain Kapil Dev observed that Kohli may have suffered due to slowing down of reflexes, Sehwag insisted it was “lack of form”.

All these days, when Kohli was shining in all formats and conditions, there was little for his critics to exploit but his form in New Zealand — a solitary half-century in 11 innings — has not only led to India’s batting decline but also brought him under scrutiny.

“When you are out of form, nothing works for you. It is not that Virat is not making efforts but luck has deserted him,” Sehwag told The Hindu.

Last week, Kapil and batting great Mohinder Amarnath had backed Kohli to come good. “It’s a matter of one innings,” both had said. “He is too good a player to continue to fail,” Kapil had opined. “I don’t see any technical shortcomings in Virat. He knows how to adjust,” Amarnath had remarked.

As far as Sehwag was concerned, “Virat certainly doesn’t have hand-eye coordination issues. Your hand-eye issue deteriorates over a period of time. Not overnight. I am sure it is just lack of form. Also, he has got out to good deliveries.”

In England, Sehwag emphasised, Kohli had failed in 2014 because he was not able to cope with swing.

Interesting read: Williamson pleased at outplaying world’s best

“Here (in New Zealand) the ball has seamed a lot and if you are not getting runs then the challenge multiplies. Of course, you can adapt, playing more on the front foot, by leaving the ball. For me, it is important to know which ball to leave and you can do that when you are feeling confident. The pressure also may have got to Virat.”

Reflecting on his experience with “bad” patch, Sehwag said: “Every player has to go through this phase. Sachin (Tendulkar), (Brian) Lara, (Steve) Smith have all experienced poor form. I faced and came out of it without comprising with my natural game. When countering difficult times, you have to be patient and back your instincts. I am sure Kohli will find his way back.

267,2020/03/03,"Ranji Trophy semifinal | From being a non-entity, Mukesh Kumar rises as hero of Bengal","Mukesh was carried on the shoulders of Akash Deep after he helped Bengal reach final after 13 long years.

From being a non-entity in Bengal cricket till six years ago to emerging a hero this season, it has been a rigourous yet rewarding journey for the low-profile pacer Mukesh Kumar, son of a migrant taxi driver from Bihar.

Pakistani great Waqar Younis did not find any worth in him when he appeared for trials, conducted by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) under their ambitious ‘Vision 2020’ project in 2014.

Also read: Ranji Trophy semifinal | Porel credits it to the hard yards put in

Cut to 2020, Mukesh was carried on the shoulders by fellow pacer Akash Deep on Monday after he helped Bengal reach Ranji Trophy final after 13 long years.

It sort of summed up duo’s story this season. They claimed 30 wickets each this season in Bengal’s success.

Mukesh was at his furious best in the semifinal against Karnataka, taking a career-best 6 for 61, to lead his side to a crushing 174-run win.

While he was rejected by Waqar, Bengal bowling coach Ranadeb Bose strongly backed him.

Mukesh used to play tennis ball cricket at that time.

“I’ve seen him grow from nowhere. Mukesh Kumar is a story on its own. Waqar had rejected him from the Vision 2020 squad. I requested Waqar to pick him because I liked him. He even did not have a pair of shoes, and I had to arrange his spikes,” Bose told PTI.

Mukesh did not play any cricket at competitive level and had malnutrition problem but convinced by Bose’s assessment CAB backed him fully.

“I called Sourav to say that this boy did not have money to do MRI. He was not a contracted player of CAB but the association went out of the way and took care of him. I told him ‘he’s got a future’ Ganguly agreed, he had a malnutrition problem so CAB spent money. We kept him in CAB accomodation, and he trained.”

But the next big task was to convince Ganguly to hand Mukesh a Ranji debut against a Virender Sehwag-captained Haryana in Lahli in 2015.

“Dada said he’s not even in the first division team and you want to play him Ranji. It was a very very tough call, against Haryana.

“My job was at stake, then at the end of day, the first wicket he got was that of Sehwag in Lahli. It saved his career and my job. Since then he’s been briillant.”

Mukesh dismissed a well-set KL Rahul (26) cheaply in the first innings, while another India batsman Manish Pandey fell to him successively in the match.

On a day Ishan Porel lost his rhythm, Mukesh who normally does the holding job went for the kill in a lethal spell of 9-4-28-5 en route his career-best six-wicket haul as the star-studded Karnataka collapsed like a pack of cards inside two hours on Tuesday.

“He should immediately play India A. He’s better than anybody who’s playing India A. His fitness is unbelievable.”

“He’s got a fantastic release. He might not look like he’s not putting an effort but off the wicket he’s very good. That’s where he’s special. One ball goes in and another out. That’s the biggest quality of a fast bowler if you can move off the wicket. Batsmen may not expect it would come fast but the ball just skids through,” Bose said.

Mukesh Kumar who is unable to straighten his middle finger due to an injury he suffered long back, said it has actually proved to be blessing in disguise.

“In 2015-16 season, I broke my finger and it did not straightened up. Now it’s helping me getting the movement,” he said.

Incidentally his late father Kashinath Singh, a taxi driver in Kolkata, brought Mukesh to the city in early 2000s in search of a career.

“I wanted to join Army or do a job but I chose cricket. Initially my father thought I would run away after getting to the rigours of cricket. He always would say ‘you are not good enough in cricket’ But I knew he wanted to bring out the best in me.”

His father died of a brain haemorrhage in December before the start of the season.

“But I got the full support of the team members I dedicate this show to my father. I know he’s watching me,” he signed off.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/oy4rwj/article30972892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUKESHKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-semifinal-from-being-a-non-entity-mukesh-kumar-rises-as-hero-of-bengal/article30972893.ece
268,2020/03/03,Ranji Trophy semifinal: Saurashtra sets Gujarat a daunting target,"On the last day, Gujarat still needs 320 more runs to enter the final.

Arpit Vasavada has trained with and lived in the same locality as Cheteshwar Pujara. On Tuesday, the left-handed Vasavada did his more famous mate proud by bailing Saurashtra out of trouble and virtually sealing a berth in the Ranji Trophy final for the second time in succession.

Thanks to Vasavada’s third hundred this season (139, 230b, 16x4, 1x6) — a knock he later termed as “the most important” of his career — Saurashtra extended its second innings into the last hour of the fourth day and set Gujarat a daunting target of 327.

Early strike

Captain Jaydev Unadkat then dismissed opener Priyank Panchal for a duck to leave Gujarat at seven for one at stumps on the penultimate day at the SCA stadium.

Having staged Saurashtra’s mini-recovery after taking guard at 15 for five on the third evening along with Chetan Sakariya (45, 118b, 6x4), Vasavada knew his job was far from over.

Sakariya continued to bat effortlessly to groom senior pro Vasavada in confidence. Even after Sakariya sacrificed his wicket after a misunderstanding while taking a run. Vasavada who was on 49 then didn’t loose his composure.

Jani’s dream run

With Chirag Jani (51, 143b, 6x4, 1x6) continuing his dream run, Vasavada ensured that the duo kept the scoreboard ticking to take the game away from Gujarat.

By the time Jani perished to Chintan Gaja off the second new ball, Vasavada had notched up his hundred and nearly taken Saurashtra to safety. His 434-minute vigil was finally over when he perished to Arzan Nagwaswalla’s short-ball ploy as Saurashtra’s innings came to an end.

270,2020/03/03,Virat Kohli indicates ‘mini transition’ of pace unit in near future,"With Indian team’s packed schedule across formats, Kohli said that it’s inhuman to “squeeze the life out of individuals”.

Aware that his star-studded pace attack isn’t getting any younger, India captain Virat Kohli says the team’s think-tank will need to have the next crop of speed merchants ready soon enough as one can’t “squeeze the life out” of established names.

While Jasprit Bumrah, 26, is expected to lead the pace pack for many more years, Ishant Sharma, who will be 32 this year, and Mohammed Shami (29) have already reached the peak of their prowess.

Also read: NZ vs IND: No blame game, says Jasprit Bumrah

Not to forget Umesh Yadav, who will turn 33 this year.

“These guys are not getting any younger so we need to be very careful and very aware and accept that these are situations that can potentially come up and have guys who can replace them and ready up and running as soon as possible,” Kohli said.

Ishant’s poorly handled rehabilitation, which saw a recurrence of ankle tear, and the kind of workload that Shami has taken in the past two years, are indicators that this team has to be ready for transition in the pace department in the perhaps the next couple of years.

Interesting read: Bumrah: '2019 has been a year of accomplishments and learning'

“...we do need to recognise who are the next three-four guys that can keep the standard up because you don’t want to feel a void suddenly if a couple of guys miss out,” Kohli gave enough indications that the management is zeroing in new talents with an eye on future.

With Indian team’s packed schedule across formats, Kohli said that it’s inhuman to “squeeze the life out of individuals”.

“That’s what happens in cricket. Mini transitions happen every now and then, and you need to be aware of them,” Kohli said.

“You can’t squeeze the life out of individuals, and when they are done, you have no back-up. I think we as a side are pretty aware that these things are quite possible,” he added.

Navdeep Saini is already a part of the set-up and there are two or three more names in the pipeline, the skipper said.

“Saini is one who has come into the system. We have two-three more that we have an eye on,” he said.

“We need to be very careful and we need to understand that this is one factor that has got us a lot of success and we need to make sure that standards are kept high,” he added.

Kohli wants the next rope to replicate the kind of success that the trio of Yadav, Ishant and Shami (Bumrah excluded) has got over years.

“We recognise and understand guys who can do a similar job potentially as well as these, Umesh included.”

While Kohli didn’t name any other fast bowlers but the ones in the pecking order for red ball cricket include Mohammed Siraj of Hyderabad, Sandeep Warrier of Kerala, Avesh Khan of Madhya Pradesh and Ishant Porel of Bengal.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ewcj33/article30972369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BUMRAH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/virat-kohli-indicates-mini-transition-of-pace-unit-in-near-future/article30972370.ece

Kapil Dev feels slowing down of reflexes could be the reason behind Virat Kohli’s struggles in New Zealand and the Indian skipper needs to “practice more” to overcome the age factor.

The 31-year-old Kohli managed just 38 runs in the two Tests at an average of 9.50 in New Zealand. In the preceding limited overs series, he managed to score 180 runs including a half century, making it a forgettable tour for the India skipper.

Interesting read: Kapil Dev: A bowler should set his own field, not the captain

“With every big batsman there comes a phase. This is the age, after turning 30 everyone says there is a dip in the eyesight and that takes 6 months to a year to get used to it,” Kapil Dev told ABP news.

“I think he (Kohli) needs to adjust his eyesight a bit. When big players start getting bowled or LBW to incoming deliveries then you have to tell them to practice more,” he added.

The World Cup winning Indian captain said that several batsmen like Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid and cricket legend Vivian Richards have had faced similar difficulties.

Also read: ICC Test ranking: India retains top spot, Kohli remains second

“It shows that your eyes and your reflexes have slowed down a bit and in no time your strengths turn into your weaknesses. From 18-24, your eyesight is at the optimum level but after that, it depends on how you work on it.”

“Sehwag, Dravid, Viv Richards all faced similar difficulties in their career. So Kohli needs to practice more.”

Kapil Dev feels Kohli needs to tighten his technique and practice more and said playing in the IPL will help the 31-year-old to adjust to the development.

“When your eyesight weakens then you have to work on your technique. The same ball which he used to pounce on so quickly, he’s getting late on it now.

“The IPL will help him as the more he plays the better understanding and idea he’ll get on how to deal with it.”

In his next over, the medium-pacer struck in back-to-back deliveries. K.V. Siddharth’s outside edge went to the first slip and S. Sharath was leg-before from superb length. The writing was on the wall for the visitors.

A determined Devdutt Padikkal, starting the day on 50, added 12 more before becoming Mukesh’s victim.

A different angle from round the wicket tricked the southpaw into edging to the ’keeper.

After Porel removed Gowtham, Mukesh dismissed Ronit More to claim his fifth wicket of the day and sixth of the innings.

275,2020/03/03,England cricketers replace handshakes with fist bumps over COVID-19 fears,"Sri Lanka confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in the country in January but the England captain expected the tour to go on as planned.

England players will not be shaking hands on their tour of Sri Lanka and will use fist bumps instead to greet each other following the COVID-19 outbreak, skipper Joe Root said.

Root's team were laid low by flu and gastroenteritis in South Africa and are cautious following the coronavirus outbreak that has killed over 3,000 people and infected more than 89,000 globally.

“After the illnesses that swept through the squad in South Africa, we are well aware of the importance of keeping contact to a minimum,” Root told reporters before flying to Sri Lanka on Monday night for a two-Test series.

“We've been given some really sound and sensible advice from our medical team to help prevent spreading germs and bacteria.”

“We are not shaking hands with each other, using instead the well-established fist bump and we are washing hands regularly and wiping down surfaces using the antibacterial wipes and gels we've been given in our immunity packs.”

England will play the first of their two practice matches from Saturday before the first Test in Galle from March 19 while Colombo hosts the second Test from March 27.

Sri Lanka confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the country in January but Root expected the tour to go on as planned.

“There is no suggestion that the tour will be affected. But, of course, it is an evolving situation so we are in regular contact with the authorities and will proceed as advised,” added the Yorkshire player.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cy775p/article30970149.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FISTKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/england-cricketers-replace-handshakes-with-fist-bumps-over-coronavirus-fears/article30969884.ece
276,2020/03/03,Cricket Advisory Committee to shortlist candidates today,"The replacements for M.S.K. Prasad and Gagan Khoda will be top priority since the selection meeting for picking India’s squad for the three-match ODI series against South Africa

The Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) of the BCCI will commence the process of appointing two selectors each in the senior and junior men’s panel at its meeting in Mumbai on Tuesday.

The meeting has been delayed for reasons unknown, but the CAC, comprising Madan Lal, Rudra Pratap Singh and Sulakshana Naik, will finally sit down along with the BCCI office-bearers for the first time since their appointment on January 31. The deadline for applying for the posts ended on January 24.

The Hindu understands that the CAC would be asked to shortlist candidates to be interviewed for the four posts. The list (44 for seniors and 20-plus for juniors) would be pruned to “four or six” for the senior as well as the junior committee.

The replacements for M.S.K. Prasad and Gagan Khoda will be top priority since the selection meeting for picking India’s squad for the three-match ODI series against South Africa, starting March 12, has to be convened soon.

According to a BCCI insider, the interviews are likely to be held on Thursday and Friday, and the new selectors will be appointed “before the weekend”.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/cricket-advisory-committee-to-shortlist-candidates-today/article30965756.ece
277,2020/03/03,Kapil Mishra: BJP’s new-found Delhi firebrand,"Kapil Mishra has added fuel to riot fire.

From terming the Delhi Assembly election an “India vs Pakistan” contest in reference to the Shaheen Bagh protest to issuing an “ultimatum” to the police to clear the streets of a similar protest at Jaffrabad, BJP leader Kapil Mishra has raised temperatures only to be defeated in the polls.

While his identity as a youth activist and social worker endeared him to the Aam Aadmi Party, his “significant presence on social media”, “Brahminical background” and publicly stated opposition to the AAP added to his value for the BJP State unit.

Mr. Mishra, 39, claims he had short stints of employment at Amnesty International and Greenpeace. The Water and Culture Minister of the AAP government in 2015 was sacked for “anti-party activities” and suspended from the party. He joined the BJP last year.

According to AAP sources, he “became close” to Mr. Kejriwal and his deputy, Manish Sisodia, shortly after obtaining a Master’s in Social Work from the Delhi School of Social Work while engaging in youth activism as the co-founder of a group called “Youth for Justice”.

Mr. Mishra exited the AAP levelling allegations of corruption against Mr. Kejriwal and the Ministers.

“For us, he was a bright young leader with all the required credentials — especially the party’s obsession with youth and social media — and the fact that his mother, Annapurna Mishra, was a BJP Mayor and an old, trusted hand. The fact that he was a Brahmin also endeared him to the senior State leadership,” a BJP source said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/va6ku0/article30975357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4TH-KAPIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjps-new-found-delhi-firebrand/article30975358.ece
278,2020/03/03,Tahir Hussain: A Delhi councillor on police radar,"Tahir is accused of murder and rioting

On February 24, the name of a little-known AAP leader in Delhi started making headlines, first as a victim of a violence in north-east Delhi and over the next three days as one of the accused in the violence: Tahir Hussain, AAP councillor from Nehru Vihar.

On February 27, an FIR was filed on charges of murder and rioting against him and later in the day, he was suspended from the party and has been absconding since then.

Mr. Hussain’s name first came up in media reports last week stating that protesters have broken into his house and destroyed property.

Later, the FIR was filed against him after family of an Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer, Ankit Sharma, blamed the AAP leader for Sharma’s death.

Mr. Hussain, hailing from Amroha in Uttar Pradesh, joined AAP in 2015-16, according to party leaders.

In 2017, he was pursuing his Class 10 from National Institute of Open Schooling and did not have any cases pending against him nor was he convicted in any case, according to his affidavit for the municipal elections.

“He had a very secular image in the area and was a businessman and also a social worker. He had joined the party through Kapil Mishra,” a senior AAP leader said.

A source close to him denied that Mr. Mishra had introduced Mr. Hussain to AAP.

Innocent or guilty?

Replying to the allegations about attacks being launched from his house, Mr. Hussain had said in a video message, “Whatever news about me is circulating is wrong. It is dirty politics to defame me ... Police had moved me from here along with my family.”

News agency ANI issued a clarification on Tuesday evening that Delhi Police “sources” have now told it that Mr. Hussain was not rescued on the intervening night of February 24 and 25. ANI said that police had received the news of the councillor being stuck, but upon investigation, it was found he was safe in his house.

Divided opinion

“He had a good image before this violence happened. People were throwing petrol bomb and stones from his rooftop on 24th (February) and he was present there,” said Danvanti Devi, 40, from Moonga Nagar, who lives opposite Mr. Hussain’s property, which is currently sealed.

In Mustafabad, about 400 metres away, he is considered as a secular figure and accessible. ""More than us, he worked for the Hindus. He would walk around and sit on corridors of the shops and talk to people,"" said Mohammad Kasim from Mustafabad.

“He used to roam around the streets and sometimes even with workers from the municipality. He sits at the office here almost every day,” said a 48-year-old who runs a business in the area.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/eeq63u/article30975289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4th-tahirhussain,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/a-delhi-councillor-on-police-radar/article30975290.ece
279,2020/03/03,"After meeting PM, Kejriwal appeared to have given ‘clean chit’ to Centre on Delhi violence: Cong","The Delhi chief minister called on the prime minister and discussed the situation in the riot-hit northeast Delhi

The Congress on Tuesday slammed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal following his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying he sounded like he was there to give a clean chit to the Centre and the PM over the communal riots in the national capital.

Also read: 79 houses, 327 shops gutted during Delhi violence: Manish Sisodia

Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said it seemed, from the way Mr. Kejriwal spoke to the media after meeting the Prime Minister, that “AAP was not the BJP’s B-Team but it was the saffron party’s team“.

The Delhi chief minister called on the prime minister and discussed the situation in the riot-hit northeast Delhi. Mr. Kejriwal said he had requested Mr. Modi that those responsible for the violence, irrespective of party affiliation, “should not be spared“.

It was Mr. Kejriwal’s first meeting with Modi after the Aam Aadmi Party returned to power in the national capital for a third consecutive term.

“The body language and the words of the Delhi Chief Minister sounded like he was there to give an official clean chit to the ruling party, the Centre and the Prime Minister,” Mr. Singhvi said at a press conference.

He slammed Mr. Kejriwal for not raising the issue of hate speeches by BJP leaders in Delhi with the prime minister.

“Did the CM seek registration of FIRs forthwith, did he say the Home Minister (Amit Shah) should either resign or be reined in, did he by name demand action against Kapil Mishra. It seemed to me that a supporter of the BJP or a member of the Union council of ministers was speaking after he met the PM,” Mr. Singhvi said.

“What is this weakness, what is this helplessness, what is this compulsion, what is this secret, what is this mystery, what is the mystery of this new found friendship, this support and why has the CM of Delhi succumbed or surrendered in this clear, crass manner,” the Rajya Sabha MP said.

Describing the meeting as a courtesy call by him after being reelected as chief minister, Mr. Kejriwal said he sought the prime minister’s help for the development of Delhi.

On February 25, Home Minister Amit Shah discussed the situation after the violence in Delhi with Mr. Kejriwal and leaders of various parties.

The AAP formed the government in Delhi for the third time on the trot after it swept the February 8 elections, winning 62 of the 70 seats. The BJP bagged the rest of the seats.

Bhambhani gave Delhi Police three months to install the cameras and added that if more time was required then it will be granted thereafter.

The Delhi High Court directed the police on Tuesday to take “immediate and urgent steps” to install CCTV cameras in vulnerable areas of the national capital, saying it would help in “curbing crime” and making women’s security a reality.

A Bench of Justices G.S. Sistani and A.J. Bhambhani gave Delhi Police three months to install the cameras and added that if more time was required then it will be granted thereafter.

The direction came after the police, represented by Delhi government standing counsel (Criminal) Rahul Mehra, told the court that installation of 6,630 cameras in 44 vulnerable locations in the city would be done only by March 28, 2021 as against the earlier estimate of completing the process by January this year.

Mr. Mehra said the approval for tendering process took time which is why the earlier time line could not be adhered to.

The court, however, said, “Delhi Police to take immediate and urgent steps to install CCTV cameras in the vulnerable locations in the city as it will go a long way in curbing crime and to make women’s security a reality.”

With the direction, the Bench listed the matter for further hearing on April 14.

The court was hearing a PIL initiated by it in 2012 after the horrific December 16, 2012 gang rape of a 23-year-old woman in a moving bus. She succumbed to her injuries days later.

The court has been from time to time issuing directions with regard to increasing the number of police officers in the city, installation of CCTV cameras in police stations as well as vulnerable or crime prone areas, reducing delay in testing of samples in forensic science laboratories (FSL) and ensuring speedy disbursal of compensation to victims of sexual assault.

Earlier, it had directed the Delhi government and the police to abide by the respective timelines given by them for filling up vacant posts in FSLs and installing CCTV cameras in police stations.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yph4nz/article30913911.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELHIHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/take-immediate-steps-to-install-cctv-cameras-in-delhi-to-make-women-safety-a-reality-high-court-directs-police/article30973136.ece

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia after visiting riot-hit areas in north-east Delhi on Tuesday said that as per police reports, 79 houses have been totally burned, 168 substantially burned, and 327 shops gutted in the riots.

The Delhi government has so far distributed a total of ₹38.75 lakh as compensation in riot-hit areas. The families of people killed in the violence have been given a total of ₹22 lakh, the injured have been provided ₹9 lakh and ₹7.75 lakh distributed to people whose households were damaged.

“Eighteen SDMs are pressed into action besides four Magistrates to assess the loss incurred in the violence as well as to coordinate the relief and rehabilitation works in the affected areas. If the houses in those areas are locked, officials are trying to contact the occupants through their neighbours so that their names and details shall be included in the SDM reports,” Mr. Sisodia said.

Apart from Mr. Sisodia, Ministers Rajendra Pal Gautam, Kailash Gahlot, and Imran Hussain took stock of the relief operations on the ground.

Over 1,000 people have moved to a relief camp in Mustafabad in the last 24 hours from Shivpuri, Mustafabad and Karawal Nagar, an official statement said. The Delhi government has also set up many helpdesks at the Mustafabad relief camp from where the families can get the compensations by filling a form.

The government also held a peacekeeping initiative at the community centre of Sri Ram Colony. “Members of both the communities were present, including SDMs, SHOs and others. Pardhan of Garhi Mendoo Bhikari ji came to invite the members of the Muslim community to relocate back to their homes at Garhi Mendoo. In the meeting, decision was taken that more such trust-building programmes will be held inside the Garhi Mendoo village and a peacekeeping Aman Committee will be formed,” the statement said.

283,2020/03/03,Delhi court directs lodging of FIR against senior police officer under SC/ST Act,"Additional Sessions Judge Sonu Agnihotri directed Joint Commissioner of Police, Western Range, to register the FIR against ACP Bijender Singh, who was the Investigating Officer of the criminal case, and asked the senior officer to file a compliance report on April 13.

A Delhi court has directed lodging of FIR against an assistant commissioner of police (ACP) under the SC/ST Act for allegedly neglecting his duties by failing to appear before the court despite notices and conducting a one-sided inquiry in a criminal case.

Additional Sessions Judge Sonu Agnihotri directed Joint Commissioner of Police, Western Range, to register the FIR against ACP Bijender Singh, who was also the Investigating Officer of the criminal case, and asked the senior officer to file a compliance report on April 13.

The court said the FIR has to be lodged under Section 4 of the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act which relates to punishment for wilful neglect of duties by a public servant.

The judge further directed the joint CP to get the matter properly investigated in view of the court’s observations and to file further charge sheet if warranted.

The criminal case relates to a parking dispute in a residential area that took place in July last year.

The complaint, lodged by the complainant of the criminal case, alleged that Bijender Singh did not conduct a fair investigation in the matter and he had sent various persons, including two Delhi Police constables, to the ancestral village of the complainant, an advocate, to pressurise him into taking back his complaint.

The court said the ACP has been alleged to delegate his responsibilities which is a clear violation of Rule 7 of the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) under which the case has to be investigated by a police officer not below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police.

“Investigating Officer should have conducted impartial inquiry into the matter and should have taken statement of complainant and witnesses cited by him and arrival of decision on the complaint should have been on basis of statements of both the sides,” the court said.

It also observed that he ACP along with other officials conducted a one-sided inquiry and failed to arrest the accused persons.

The court said that by failing to inquire the complaint impartially, the officer has violated the provisions of SC/ST Act and, therefore, is liable to be proceeded for dereliction of duties as provided under the law.

It said that the ACP despite being a senior police official did not take resort under suitable section of IPC when the witnesses refused to give statements in the criminal case.

“IO [Investigating officer] should have served notices to witnesses acquainted with facts and circumstances of present case on he coming to know about them with direction to them to speak truth regarding facts of the case and in event of their refusal should have proceeded against them in accordance with the law. DCP concerned failed to ensure compliance of Rule 12(2) of SC/ST (POA) Rules, 1995.

284,2020/03/03,All in a name: Northeast Delhi residents remove nameplates,"Economic activity in the riot-hit areas has been hit hard, and most shops continue to remain shut.

A nameplate in a house or a hoarding in a shop is generally put up as a mark of identity. But when the communal violence broke out in northeast Delhi last week, these were among the first things some of the residents removed as they moved to safer places.

A number of dark, narrow lanes deep inside Shiv Vihar, among the worst-hit areas, are empty. Similarly, many Hindu families in the area that borders Mustafabad have fled after locking their homes, while some among them took down or damaged their nameplates in a bid to hide their identity.

Deepak Rajora, 32, fled to his relative’s home in Ghaziabad when violence started on February 24. “But before running away, I took down the nameplate bearing the name of my father,” he said.

“A few others in our lane did the same thing,” Rajora said. “Houses in one corner of our lane have been completely gutted by the fire.”

In Burari, which is not far from the riot-affected northeast Delhi, Aqrab Saeed’s furniture shop is hard to find without a hoarding outside it.

“There was a large hoarding reading Iqbal Furniture House outside our showroom, but we cannot take any risk considering ours is the only Muslim-owned shop in the area,” a salesperson, who did not wish to be identified, said.

Yaqoob Malik, 55, tore off the hoarding reading ‘Malik Cloth House’ outside his shop in Shiv Vihar fearing that the mob would target it.

“My neighbour, Shiva bhai, who runs a chemist shop, scratched the ‘Om’ symbol painted on the glass door. Luckily, we did not suffer any damage,” he said.

Malik returned to his shop on Monday as paramilitary personnel stood guard nearby. “The situation is peaceful for now. People are returning to their shops,” he said. “This is how things will return to normal.”

Shah-e-Alam, 35, who runs a crockery shop in Bhajanpura, said he and his helper, Yunus, shut the power supply from the mains switch, took down the hoarding reading ‘Irfan Crockery and Plastic House’ and hid it inside the shop.

Alam said the situation remained peaceful in the area in the past six days, but shopkeepers had been wrapping up early in the evening as a precautionary measure.

Economic activity in the riot-hit areas has been hit hard. Though a large posse of paramilitary personnel has been guarding the volatile zones, most shops continue to remain shut.

Burnt electricity wires dangled outside charred shops, with walls covered in soot and ash.

“Only a few shops, generally the grocery stores, are open. The big showrooms are still shut as owners are not willing to take any risk,” a shopkeeper said.

Those which remain open have been wrapping up early, he said.

Abdul Aziz, who runs a small printing press in Maujpur, also took down the large hoarding that hung over the shutters the day violence erupted in the area.

“It was a targeted attack. Outsiders were involved in rioting and they knew if the owner of a shop was a Muslim or a Hindu,” he said.

“I saw them with rods and bricks, I saw their faces,” he said. “‘Dil me se dehshat nahi nikal rahi’ (I am still terrified).”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/47xqx8/article30972517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/shop,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/all-in-a-name-northeast-delhi-residents-remove-nameplates/article30972518.ece
285,2020/03/03,At least 185 students protesting against CAA detained while going to Ramlila Maidan,"Police said the students did not have permission for the march to Parliament, while the organiser argued they were denied the permission at the last minute.

At least 185 students were detained by police on Tuesday while they were going to the Ramlila Maidan here to protest against the new citizenship law and the recent communal riots in northeast Delhi. According to police, the protesters were detained from different locations in the national capital and taken to several police stations.

Around 200 students had gathered at Jantar Mantar on Tuesday morning in response to a protest call given by the Young India Coordination Committee, which comprises members from various student bodies. Former IAS officer and activist Kannan Gopinathan was also present.

However, the police restrained the students from proceeding towards the Ramlila Maidan to participate in the protest march against the Citizenship (Amendment) Law and over the communal violence in the national capital.

While many students claimed that hundreds of them were detained from several parts of the city, the police confirmed they had held 185 student protesters.

Police said the students did not have permission for the march to Parliament.

Former JNU Students’ Union president N. Sai Balaji, who was leading the march, said, “We had submitted the application for permission on February 27. We were informed on Monday about the permission being rejected. It is last-minute intimation.”

Later, student groups who arrived at Jantar Mantar raised anti-government slogans and demanded resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah over the recent communal riots in northeast Delhi.

Many students carried posters and banners that read: “Peace, Not Riot”, “Scrap Sedition Law”, “Reject anti-poor, Reject anti-Muslim,” “DU for communal harmony”, and “Stop police brutality on anti-CAA protestors”.

The former IAS officer, Gopinathan, said he was happy that there are still people who are not afraid to question the Centre.

Anyone who raises questions against the Centre is termed ‘anti-national’, he said while addressing the gathering. “When students question the government, they are termed as ‘tukde-tukde’ gang. If activists raise questions, they are termed ‘urban naxals’,” he added.

Balaji criticised the Delhi Police for not arresting BJP leaders for their allegedly provocative slogans.

“We are not Hindu or Muslim. We are youngsters of this country who are here to safeguard the constitution of this country,” he said.

“They (Centre) are scared of the youngsters of the country, so they frame us on false charges and the leaders of BJP who raise provocative slogans get a free run,” he added.

A student claimed the police were detaining the protesters even if they were assembling in small groups.

“We don’t fear anyone. We need to stand united at this hour and spread the message of peace,” said one of the protesters.

Another protester, a student of Lady Sri Ram College, said, “The rules and regulations are made for us. Our only way of expressing our dissent is through protests. What has happened in northeast Delhi is disheartening”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/zcuocv/article30972379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/protesters,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/at-least-185-students-protesting-against-caa-detained-while-going-to-ramlila-maidan/article30972380.ece

Additional DCP (Crime Branch) AK Singla said the accused, resident of Ghonda, was arrested from Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli and was brought to Delhi before he could flee further.

The police said he was fond of pistols and had bought one 7.65mm pistol and ammunition from one of his labourers two years ago. “The good quality semi-automatic pistol which he used in the northeast Delhi violence was bought from Munger in Bihar. He had fired three rounds out of five bullets he had as two of them fell. We are trying to recover the pistol,” Mr. Singla said.

Talking about the arrest, Mr. Singla claimed that they conducted extensive enquiries in many areas in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh and zeroed in on the area around Shamli and Kairana. “On the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, they received information that Shahrukh would be reaching the Shamli bus stand between 10 am to 12 noon to meet someone. A trap was laid and Shahrukh was apprehended,” he said.

During interrogation, the police said, he revealed that he opened fire in a fit of rage as stones were being pelted and that he had come alone and joined the crowd. After the incident, he roamed in Delhi but left after his video went viral and was shown on news channels. He then went to Punjab and had been hiding in Bareilly and Shamli at a friend’s place.

The police said Shahrukh is a college dropout and runs a shop selling socks in Ghonda. He is also interested in bodybuilding and modelling. He has uploaded vidoes on a video-sharing application as well. They said they are trying to ascertain whether he was associated with any gang. He is also being questioned about other participants known to him.

Shahrukh, on February 24, pointed his pistol at Head Constable Deepak Dahiya on the Jaffrabad-Maujpur road to threaten him but the cop faced him after which he fled. The video and the photo of Shahrukh were shared widely on social media.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/l3uooa/article30970471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAIRAPTI2242020000305A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ne-delhi-violence-man-who-pointed-gun-at-unarmed-policeman-arrested-from-up/article30970472.ece
287,2020/03/03,COVID-19: 2 Noida schools shut after Delhi man tests positive,"Parent of students had travelled to Italy; schools fumigated

Two private schools in Noida were shut on on Tuesday after the father of one of their students tested positive for coronavirus. The patient from Mayur Vihar in Delhi, who had travelled to Italy recently and tested positive on Monday, was shifted to a quarantine ward at Safdarjung Hospital on Sunday night.

One of the schools where the Delhi man’s son is a primary student, said it will remain shut from March 4 to March 6, while the other said it will be closed till Saturday. The Board exams will not be affected, messages sent by the schools to parents clarified.

Information that the infected man had hosted a birthday party last week for the child, triggered fears that those who attended it including other children and relatives, might be at risk. Samples from five students from the school have been collected, Noida’s Chief Medical Officer Anurag Bhargava said.

Fumigation was undertaken in both the schools and a Health Department team led by Noida’s chief medical officer visited the site, an official said.

Several people, including family members of the Delhi man, were quarantined or kept in isolation.

The Health Ministry said that following the Delhi case it has appealed for the passengers who flew on AI1-54 Vienna-Delhi on Feb 25 to follow protocol notified by the Ministry of Health regarding coronavirus “as one of the passengers has tested positive for the virus”.

“The Health Ministry is also working out detailed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for COVID-19 management in private hospitals,” a government release said.

UP health minister Jai Pratap Singh noted that a total of 34 samples have been sent for testing to NIV, Pune. “These persons were reportedly in contact with the Delhi patient. This includes six persons from Agra who were found to be in the “high-risk category” and had tested “positive” in the KGMU (King George Medical University) laboratory but their samples have been sent for re-confirmation to the NIV, Pune,” Mr. Singh said. The six have been transferred from Agra and admitted to Safdarjung hospital in Delhi, he added.

The 69-year-old Italian’s wife also tested positive for the virus on Tuesday but her samples are being sent to Pune for another test.

288,2020/03/03,"Those responsible for Delhi violence ‘should not be spared,’ Kejriwal urges Modi","During the courtesy call, the Delhi Chief Minister however did not specifically discuss the hate speeches given by BJP leaders

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday and discussed the situation in the riot-hit northeast Delhi and said he has requested Modi that those responsible for the violence — irrespective of party affiliation — “should not be spared”.

It was the first meeting of Kejriwal with Modi after the Aam Aadmi Party returned to power in the national capital for a third consecutive term.

The meeting, at the Prime Minister’s Office in Parliament, lasted half an hour.

Emerging from the meeting, Kejriwal appreciated the Delhi police for being proactive in controlling the situation when rumours were being spread on Sunday night.

“Delhi police acted in a swift manner to control the situation when rumours were spread on Sunday night. Had the police acted with the same efficiency on Monday & Tuesday last week when riots were confined in a district, so many lives could have been saved,” he told reporters.

Large-scale violence in northeast Delhi has left more than 46 people dead and some 200 injured.

Kejriwal said he also requested the prime minister that such incidents should not happen and Modi agreed.

Urging Modi to take stern action against those involved in the violence, Kejriwal said, “I told him we should try and ensure that such riots do not happen again in the national capital. Those who are responsible for the clashes — whether they belong to any party — should not be spared, I appealed to the prime minister.”

When asked whether he discussed the hate speeches given by BJP leaders, Kejriwal said they did not discuss it specifically.

Talking about the new coronavirus, he said he discussed with the prime minister the lethal disease it causes and how it can be stopped. “We should provide medicare to the infected as early as possible,” he added.

Describing the meeting as a courtesy call by him after being re-elected as chief minister, Kejriwal said he sought the prime minister’s help for the development of Delhi.

On February 25, Home Minister Amit Shah had discussed the situation with the Delhi chief minister and leaders of various parties.

289,2020/03/03,Delhi’s most wanted criminal held with three of his accomplices,"Gogi carried a reward of ₹6.5 lakh, was arrested from Gurugram

The Capital’s most wanted criminal, who was carrying a reward of ₹6.5 lakh on his head, was arrested along with his three accomplices from Gurugram on Tuesday, police said.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) Manishi Chandra said that the criminal Jitender Maan alias Gogi was arrested along with Kuldeep alias Fajja, Kapil alias Gaurav and Rohit alias Moi from an apartment complex.

Before he surrendered before the police, Gogi recorded a video saying that he has been surrounded by police and might get killed in an encounter because of which he is surrendering. Sources said that after the arrest when he was asked why he made the video, he said that he was anticipating a “Shootout at Lokhandwala’ [Bollywood film] style encounter because of sirens and lights pointing at them.

Police said that they were on the trail of Gogi, Fajja and Gaurav for a long time. “Police got a tip-off on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday and visited Kherki Daula Toll Plaza in Gurugram. When police reached the toll plaza, they got information that Gogi, along with his gang members, was residing in a flat at Mapsko Casabella, Sector-82, Gurugram,” Mr. Chandra said.

The officials were accompanied by a SWAT team and they moved towards Gogi’s flat. Police surrounded the B-4 block. Finding no escape route, they surrendered before the police. The operation lasted about 30 minutes.

Delhi and Haryana police had announced a reward of ₹4 lakh and ₹2.5 lakh, respectively on Gogi’s arrest. Fajja carried a reward of ₹2 lakh on his head announced by Delhi Police.

Rohit carried a reward of ₹2 lakh from the Delhi Police and ₹1 lakh from the Haryana Police. Kapil, is the new member of the gang, said the police.

Six imported pistols, over 70 live cartridges and a stolen car were recovered from their possession, police said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/syxdh3/article30055646.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23DECUFF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhis-most-wanted-gangster-gogi-held-in-gurugram/article30969302.ece
290,2020/03/03,Day 5 at govt. relief camps: no one in sight,"Officials suspect fear, distance and lack of information keeping riot victims away

At a relief camp set up by the AAP government in Shahdara’s Panchsheel Garden, caretaker Amrit Gulati (65) has two other officials and two homeless persons for company. Not a single riot victim has come to take refuge here in the last five days.

The off-white tiles are clean, the mattresses piled up neatly in one corner and the water container untouched at the night shelter which can accommodate up to 40 people. An NGO representative who is supposed to take care of the food for riot victims also waits in anticipation.

‘Arrangements in place’

“It has been four days since we started preparations to house riot victims, but no one has come. We will take care of their food, water and medication. All the necessary arrangements are in place,” said Mr. Gulati, adding that the food arrangements are only for riot victims and not the homeless who visit regularly.

An official who did not wish to be identified said the reason, he suspects, people are not coming is because of lack of knowledge and distance. “Few people are aware of the locations of the relief camps. This shelter is also over 2 km away from the affected areas.”

Mr. Gulati said because of the riots, the number of homeless persons coming in at night has also reduced to about 10 because many of them are migrant labourers and have left for their villages. Even if the numbers increase, Mr. Gulati said they won’t refuse anyone. “We will make sure they are all accommodated. Perhaps, ask two homeless persons to share a bed,” he said.

Appealing to people to take refuge in the shelters, Mr. Gulati said, “No matter what religion they belong to, we will take care of them. Our other caretaker is Mohammed Zaheer and we live here as a family. For us, everyone is equal.”

He said he understands the helplessness of someone who is homeless or forced out of house because he himself came from Punjab as a homeless man in 2012. His wife passed away 20 years ago and his children – both daughters – got married. “I stayed here homeless for three years and in 2015, they gave me the job to take care of this shelter.”

A few kilometres away in Kabool Nagar, another government relief camp is empty. An official suspected the riot victims are not coming to the camp “because the area is dominated by Hindus”. The official felt victims are scared and prefer the company “of their own”. “On Tuesday, when the violence was raging, three shops owned by Muslims in the area were vandalised,” he said.

In fact, the relief camp right outside Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, where hundreds of victims are undergoing treatmentand families of deceased are waiting for the bodies to be handed over to them, has only been visited by three persons. The caretaker of the camp, Rajesh Kumar, said, “Two persons had come on February 27, one came on February 28 and all the three came again on February 29. No one else has taken shelter here so far.”

He said another person had come to the camp but left as he felt scared being away from his community members. “I go inside the hospital, to the mortuary and where the families of the injured sit and ask them to come, but they refuse. They prefer going to their relatives’ houses. They feel scared,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/fcggel/article30967380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03RELIEFCAMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/day-5-at-govt-relief-camps-no-one-in-sight/article30967381.ece

293,2020/03/03,"Give names of arrested people, Rai tells top cop","Gopal Rai claims the police also picked up innocent people

Delhi Environment Minister Gopal Rai on Monday requested Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava to give proper information to the families of people who were arrested from violence-hit areas.

“Family members of the arrested people are not getting information. I have requested the police to make a system that ensures that these families get proper information,” Mr. Rai said.

Earlier in the day, the AAP Minister said that after talking to MLAs of Seelampur and Mustafabad, he understood that the police had picked up innocent people as well. “Their relatives have been searching for them in hospitals and police stations. The guilty should be caught and punished and the innocent should be released. A meeting has been scheduled with the Police Commissioner to discuss the issue,” he said.

Mr. Rai also visited a government-run shelter in Mustafabad on Monday, while Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam visited the violence-hit areas here.

Several activists also wrote to Mr. Shrivastava with a similar request.

They alleged that the police was not complying with Section 41-C of the CrPC that mandates displaying information regarding arrests and detentions.

294,2020/03/03,Muslim families shift from Chaman Park warehouses,"The makeshift shelters had become overcrowded and dirty, say volunteers

Hundreds of Muslim families, displaced from Shiv Vihar — one of the areas which saw the worst incidents of violence in north-east Delhi — who had taken refuge in warehouses in Chaman Park have been shifted, volunteers informed on Monday.

With a large number of media persons and aid efforts being directed to the small lanes in which the warehouses are located, the area was becoming overcrowded and dirty, the volunteers informed. While some have been relocated to their relative’s residence, smaller groups of people occupied houses of locals and others have been relocated to multiple tents set up at the Eidgah at Mustafabad. Legal clinics as well as centres to ensure that compensations are paid have been set up.

“How long can you stay in other people’s houses after all?” said Arshi Ansari who was living in a furniture warehouse in Chaman Park and shifted to the tents on Monday evening. Commenting on issues with government-run relief camps, most of which have reportedly seen no displaced people arriving, she said, there was a lack of facilities especially for women at such places.

Houses of most of these people were burnt down by mobs during the recent spate of violence. Many of them said that they had narrowly escaped death. Husbands and sons of many displaced women were still missing. A list of nearly 140 families, displaced from Shiv Vihar, was prepared and at least 50 are still reported missing, a volunteer added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/muslim-families-shift-from-chaman-park-warehouses/article30966977.ece
295,2020/03/03,Situation peaceful: police chief,"‘Over 300 FIRs filed in connection with Delhi violence’

Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Shrivastava on Monday said the police have registered over 300 FIRs in connection with the riots in north-east Delhi.

He said that the situation remained peaceful across the city on Monday and requested people to verify any unconfirmed reports of riots or disturbance with the central police control room. “We request people to come with any electronic evidence or their own testimony if they have witnessed any kind of violence. We have issued a WhatsApp number and an e-mail where people can send videos or other material that can help police identify the people involved in violence,” said Mr. Shrivastava.

The Police Commissioner did not make any references to the progress in investigation of previous cases of violence that broke out during anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in Central, South East and North East districts.

On December 18, protesters had pelted stones at policemen in the Seelampur-Jaffrabad area.

Mr. Shrivastava’s predecessor Amulya Patnaik faced much criticism for police action as well as inaction during anti-CAA protests that started on December 15 with violence outside Jamia Millia Islamia. His tenure saw policemen protest outside the police headquarters demanding ‘justice’ after their colleague was beaten up by a lawyer at the Saket Courts and the accused was not arrested.

Mr. Shrivastava was repatriated from the Central Reserve Police Force and appointed as Special Commissioner (law and order) of Delhi Police. He was drafted in the middle of the communal violence in north-east Delhi and has been taking stock of the situation since then. He has been seen more often in public than his predecessor.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/situation-peaceful-police-chief/article30966950.ece
296,2020/03/03,40 arrested for spreading riot rumours,"Police received over 2,000 distress calls on Sunday

The Delhi Police on Monday arrested 40 people after they received over 2,000 distress calls on March 1 in connection with rumours that riots had broken out in many parts of the city.

The maximum calls were recevied from south-east Delhi localities such as Shaheen Bagh and Govindpuri. Calls were also received from west and central Delhi.

“We have arrested 21 people from North West district, one from Rohini district and 18 from South district. The people were booked for spreading rumours under Section 7/51 of the Criminal Code of Procedure,” said a police officer.

As rumours about violence in several parts of the city spread like wildfire on March 1, news about a few metro stations shutting down fuelled fears, said residents. Metro officials, however, maintained that some stations were closed after a security advisory was issued by the Delhi Police.

Around 8 p.m. on March 1, Ramesh Nagar Jyoti, a resident of west Delhi, received a call from his relative: “Do not go towards Rajouri Garden. Riots have broken out”. Even as she passed on the information to her neighbours, four gates of the colony were shut.

Gurupada Mandal, a resident of Govindpuri, said: “I was on duty when I got a call from my wife saying there were shots being fired and people were running around with lathis. Most residents decided to lock themselves indoors. It was only later when the PCR vans started patrolling that the situation calmed down.”

Several residents of Madanpur Khadar also said they were “informed” about mobs roaming the streets even though “nothing happened to their houses”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/40-arrested-for-spreading-riot-rumours/article30966939.ece

299,2020/03/03,Nine Delhi districts had contaminated groundwater in 2019: Jal Shakti Minister,"The data was presented by Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in Rajya Sabha

Nine districts in Delhi had contaminated groundwater in 2019, according to data presented in the Rajya Sabha on Monday.

In the National Capital Region, which includes parts of Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh apart from Delhi, at least 30 districts had some form of pollutants in their groundwater, including arsenic, iron, heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and chromium, flouride, nitrate and salinity, the data showed.

The data was presented by Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in a written response to a starred question asked by D.P. Vats, a BJP MP and retired Lt. General.

He had asked whether the government was aware of “increasing groundwater pollution” in Delhi-NCR and that what action is being taken to prevent over-exploitation of groundwater in these areas.

In response, the Jal Shakti Minister said that the Central Pollution Control Board’s National Water Quality Monitoring Programme did not show any increasing or decreasing trends in Delhi’s groundwater pollution levels in 2018 and 2019.

However, the Central Ground Water Board’s quality monitoring data for 2019 showed that most districts in the Capital were partially affected by groundwater contaminants present at higher levels than declared permissible by the Bureau of Indian Standards, Mr. Shekhawat’s response showed.

Salinity issues

In Delhi, most districts had salinity issues, with electrical conductivity levels above the prescribed limit of 3,000 micro mhos/cm, as well as flouride and nitrate levels above the limits of 1.5 and 45 mg/litre respectively.

Arsenic above the safe level of 0.01 mg/litre was found in the groundwater of east and northeast Delhi. Iron was not a contaminant in Delhi, but lead was found along the Najafgarh drain in the North, West and South-West districts. Cadmium was found in South-West, while chromium was found in the North-West, South, East and New Delhi districts.

Taking into account the data for all of NCR, 30 districts had high nitrate levels, while 25 districts had high flouride levels.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/68ne63/article30966932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mapping-toxinscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nine-delhi-districts-had-contaminated-groundwater-in-2019-jal-shakti-minister/article30966933.ece
300,2020/03/03,‘We had spoken to him an hour before his death’,"Riot victim survived by wife, 8 daughters

The last time 35-year-old Mudasir Khan’s father spoke to him, he told him not to step out on the street. Shot dead in north-east Delhi’s Kardampuri area on February 25, Mudasir is survived by his wife and eight minor daughters, the youngest of whom is just 18-day-old.

Mudasir, who worked at a plastic scrapping factory in Loni, had gone to visit a relative and got stuck there as violence had erupted in the area.

“We had spoken to him just an hour before [he died] and told him not to venture out since the situation was volatile. He said he would not,” the victim’s father, Mohammad Yasin, said. The rest of Mudasir’s family were in Mustafabad when the violence broke out. They had been constantly contacting each other as violence had also ensued in Mustafabad.

Shot dead

Around the afternoon, when things seemed to have calmed down, Mudasir stepped out of the building to see if he could make his way back to Mustafabad, but was shot dead. “Before him, someone else was also shot dead,” said a relative. “We have no idea which side [group] the bullets came from,” said Mr. Yasin.

His body was taken to GTB Hospital for a post-mortem.

Mudasir’s oldest daughter is just 14. His wife Ayesha is distraught and is observing the period of iddah following her husband’s death.

Several officials of the Delhi government as well as the Lieutenant-Governor’s office had visited the bereaved and assured of compensation, the family said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/we-had-spoken-to-him-an-hour-before-his-death/article30966926.ece
301,2020/03/03,Gurugaman: On road to becoming Millennium City’s lifeline,"Within two years of its launch, the Gurugram city bus service — also known as Gurugaman — is clocking over 88,000 passengers daily on its 154 buses. Commuters are all praise for the cleanliness, reliability and safety of the service, but have issues with travel cards and recharging

As the bus negotiates its way through traffic at the busy Jharsa Chowk on the Delhi-Gurugram Expressway, commerce student Ashish says he has been availing the city’s bus service, Gurugaman, for the past eight months. “Overall, the experience has been good, except for the congestion and some issues with the travel card,” adds the 21-year-old student of Delhi’s Sri Aurobindo College who commutes from his home in Badshahpur.

Ashish takes route 134-B (IFFCO Chowk and Dhana Mor) — one of the busiest routes for the service — at its point of origin but still fails to find a seat most of the time. But that does not deter him, what he is most inconvenienced by is the fact that the travel card for the bus service cannot be recharged online. “The point of sale at IFFCO Chowk for recharging remains shut in the afternoon; there is no such facility at Rajiv Chowk,” grumbles Ashish.

Travel cards for the bus service are currently sold and recharged at six points of sale: HUDA City Centre metro station, IFFCO Chowk, Krishna Chowk, Gurugram bus stand, Dundahera bus stop, and Sector-56. The centres remain open from 8 a.m. to noon; and again from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m.

Fare rationalisation

Even as Ashish recounts his experience, 54-year-old Daljeet Singh, a security guard at a private firm, interjects to add that the fare needs rationalisation.

“While the fare for the first 10 stops is ₹10, it doubles to ₹20 for the next 10 stops. It would be better if another slab of ₹15 is introduced in between and is increased at the rate of ₹5. It will be more affordable. The public transport is for the convenience of the masses. The government should not aim at making profit from it,” he says, while praising the service for its frequency and comfortable seats.

Nishant Kumar, a 28-year-old civil engineer from Jharkhand, says that he loves the large windows in the buses that offer a wide view of the city and let in the much-needed fresh air. The long travel time due to frequent stops is a downside though, he adds.

Mohan Rao, who works at a private firm in Manesar’s Industrial Model Township (IMT), travels on the route daily. Though the 34-year-old from Andhra Pradesh finds the service “reliable” and “convenient” compared to autorickshaws, he too feels that the fare is bit on the higher side.

“Travelling by the city bus costs around ₹5 more for each trip compared to autos. Workers with meagre earnings still prefer to take autos. Also, a large workforce travels to IMT from Hayatpur village and a bus should run on this route as well,” suggests Mr. Rao, while praising the service for its “cleanliness, and courteous staff”.

He adds that the new routes introduced around eight months ago has been a boon for the women workforce. “The women working in the factories in IMT Manesar earlier had safety concerns travelling by autorickshaws late in the evening. Now, they feel safe and take the city bus,” says Mr. Rao, before he alights at Khandsa Mandi stop.

Bus conductor Vikram Singh admits that only 10-15 passengers daily use travel cards to pay for their trips “If the passengers pay through the travel card, it is a win-win situation. The customers get a discount, and we do not have to worry about arranging for change,” Mr. Singh adds.

Sunil Kumar, who drives a bus on the 28-km-long route — the longest in the service — says passengers mostly prefer to board or deboard at traffic signals and not at the designated stops. “The locations of most of the shelters is such that passengers do not prefer to stand there,” he adds.

Naveen Ranga, a munsi at the district and sessions court, says he is a regular on route 221-D and appreciates the service for being “economical and comfortable”. He, however, laments that most of the times the conductor refuses to accept the travel card citing technical issues.

“It is convenient and cheaper to use travel card as it offers ₹2 discount per trip, but almost 15 days in a month the conductor says that his machine is not working,” adds Mr. Ranga, while he waits for a local train to Rewari at the railway station after deboarding the city bus.

Call for all-women buses

“They should also introduce air-conditioned buses as well as all-women buses, especially on route 221-D. At least 80 women employees of the court travel by the bus daily. The administration should think about running an all-women bus on this route, especially in the morning and evening hours,” says Mr. Ranga.

Rohit, a bus conductor on route 116-B, admits that there are issues with their hand-held devices. “My machine was not working today. So, I asked the passenger to take the next bus,” says Rohit, while complaining that there is no facility for drinking water for the staff on the bus or at the stops.

As the 116-B bus travels from New Gurgaon to enter the congested Old City passing through the Signature Tower underpass, Poonam Shrivastava, a teacher, recalls how she came to know about the service only recently through an autorickshaw driver, and now prefers to travel by it.

“I need to stay back on Tuesdays and Saturdays for extra classes and take the city bus back home in Bhim Nagar. Earlier, I hired an autorickshaw or a cab. The bus service is economical, comfortable and also safe,” says Dr. Shrivastava, suggesting the need for a bus route close to her school.

Though the passengers speaking to the The Hindu gave thumps up to the service for comfort and frequency, not many were aware of the ‘Gurugaman’ app, and only a few were using the travel cards. Also, a few women passengers complained that seats were not reserved for them.

Chief Executive Officer of the Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited, Sonal Goel, says that travel cards are given out for free and efforts are on to provide online recharge facility in the next couple of months. “The GMCBL is in talks with a couple of banks in this regard,” she adds.

There is no scope for reducing the fare as it is reasonable, but a proposal is under consideration to introduce around 50 electric buses... it may take at least one more year, says the 2008-batch IAS officer.

‘No new routes’

“There is no immediate plan to introduce new routes as there are no buses available. The new routes can be introduced only after new buses are added to the fleet. There is no proposal to add new buses except the 50 electric buses. These buses, when added, would be air-conditioned,” adds Ms. Goel, who has travelled on the city buses with her team a couple of times for a first-hand experience since she took over a month ago.

“There were not many complaints, but we felt the need for more cleanliness and behavioural change for the staff,” says Ms. Goel, an awardee of NITI Aayog’s Women Transforming India-2016.

She says the GMCBL has introduced all-women buses on route no. 116-E at Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s directions and the app that earlier had issues with GPS has been improved leading to increase in downloads. “But the office-goers in the city are not in the habit of using the bus. We need to bring a change in their attitude and plan to hold promotional activities around International Women’s Day to promote the use of buses. Travelling by public transport not just helps fight pollution and reduces traffic, but also brings down accidents,” says Ms. Goel, as she hurriedly leaves for another trip on a city bus with her staff.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/9k017k/article24850735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03KHATTARBUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/on-road-to-becoming-millennium-citys-lifeline/article30966923.ece
302,2020/03/03,Woman awaits DNA report of leg found near father’s house,"The daughter has not found the man or his body since violence broke out last week

Gulshan (27) sat next to her husband, an acid accident survivor, at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital mortuary awaiting a DNA report of a leg which she believes is of her father. Ms. Gulshan, Mohammed Anwar’s daughter, has been at the mortuary since February 26 after she was told by her uncle and the police that the leg had been found from near her father’s burnt, rented accommodation in Shiv Vihar’s Prem Vihar near Ramlila Ground.

“I think the leg is my father’s because we have been told by the police that it was found from the place where my father lived. We have not been able to find him or his body,” she said.

Mr. Anwar used to rear sheep and also gave street carts on rent for a living. Ms. Gulshan’s husband Mohammed Naseeruddin’s face was burnt and he lost his eyesight four years ago when his face got acid accidentally splashed onto it. The couple reside in Pilakhwa near Hapur with their two minor sons.

“My father was taking care of the four of us financially as my husband could not work any more,” she said.

Recalling the violence that broke out on February 25, she said she was speaking to his father around 11 a.m. over the phone when she heard people shouting. “I asked him what had happened. He said there was a fight. Eventually, the phone got disconnected and I could not contact him again. I called my paternal uncle and he told me what had happened,” she said.

The uncle, she said, told her that he saw a mob firing at him and then burning his house after before pushing him in the fire.

The uncle did not go to save him because he was scared for his own life, she said.

Ms. Gulshan has been coming to the hospital every day and spending the day there only in the hope to get some closure. She mostly leaves the hospital late in the evening for her relative’s house in Seemapuri. “There is a relief camp, but we prefer to stay at our relative’s house. It’s close and we also feel secure there,” she said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gnhy1i/article30966893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03DNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/woman-awaits-dna-report-of-leg-found-near-fathers-house/article30966894.ece
303,2020/03/03,Unarmed policemen kept distance from mob,"‘Why were we deployed during the riots with just a cane and body protection?’

As mobs ran riot in north-east Delhi on February 23, Head Constable with the Armed Police Deepak Dhaiya confronted the armed men with just a cane in hand.

Facing an onslaught of rioters, Mr. Dhaiya appealed to his colleagues to control the miscreants, but instead of helping the constable, the policemen stopped Mr. Dhaiya from taking further action as they were unarmed.

As mobs vandalised and damaged property, most of the policemen remained on the backfoot even as several shops were set alight right in front of them.

With just a cane for defence, the policemen were apprehensive of taking on men that were carrying stones and weapons.

Low morale

Most of the lower-rank policemen that The Hindu talked to said the force was already suffering from low morale after several incidents saw policemen get severe punishment while the perpetrators walked away “scot-free”.

A policeman, who wished not to be named, said that in June 2019, a video had gone viral of two constables beating up a Sikh tempo driver in Mukherjee Nagar after “he attacked them with a sword”.

The policemen were dismissed from service, but the tempo driver was never arrested, he added.

Another policeman, who was deployed in Maujpur during the violence, said he and his colleagues do not take any action unless they get specific orders from senior officers, “because in the end us lower ranks suffer”. “Why were we deployed during the riots with just a cane and body protection? We also have families... no one wants to get killed. I was issued no long-range weapon. You cannot stop a mob with teargas and a cane,” he added.

An Inspector-rank officer said that in the November 2019 Tis Hazari incident, when police and lawyers clashed, a special commissioner-rank officer was removed from his post and a policeman was thrashed by lawyers at Saket Courts, but the accused were never arrested. “The riots could have been prevented if the police had opened fire on Day One. A policeman was killed and a DCP was brutally thrashed by the mob but still we waited for direction from seniors,” added the officer.

Several policemen said that the Delhi Police was also in a leadership crisis when the violence broke out.

A senior police officer added that the incident revealed the complete failure of the police’s intelligence network, which failed to assess the preparation of the rioters.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/unarmed-policemen-kept-distance-from-mob/article30966851.ece
304,2020/03/03,A brother’s search ends at the mortuary,"Aftab was tortured and burnt alive before being thrown into the Karawal Nagar drain, alleges Qadir

Six days after he went missing, Mohammad Qadir’s search for his younger brother Aftab ended at RML Hospital mortuary here on Monday.

Fearing how his family will react, Mr. Qadir said he has decided not to inform them about Aftab’s death for the time being.

The 20-year-old is understood to be the only one — out of five bodies that were recovered from separate drains in north-east Delhi between Sunday and early Monday — to be identified by next of kin.

Not only were the fingers on both his hands “hanging by shreds of skin”, the hair on Aftab’s head was also missing, Mr. Qadir said, adding that this leads him to believe that his brother, a Class 11 student who had come to Delhi just a week ago from Bijnor, was tonsured, tortured and burnt alive before being thrown into a drain in Karawal Nagar.

‘Wanted to be a doctor’

“See his hair? He liked this kind of fashion... I told him [Aftab] there was no need for him to come here [Delhi] and he should concentrate on his studies... The family didn’t need him to earn. He wanted to be a doctor,” Mr. Qadir said as he held up Aftab’s picture.

“Naali mein girne se baal bhi chale jaate hain kya? Nahin jaate. Mere bhai ko peetne ke baad jalaya gaya hai phir naali mein phenk diya [Does one lose one’s hair after being thrown into a drain? They don’t. My brother was beaten up and burnt alive before his body was thrown in a drain],” he alleged.

According to Qadir, Aftab wanted to learn welding so he could start a small workshop which he would manage along with his studies. Mr. Qadir said that Aftab’s friends in Delhi had offered to help him get initial training because of at which Aftab arrived in Delhi on February 23.

Aftab went incommunicado a little over a day later prompting his family to get in touch with his friends.

“His phone was unreachable, so we got in touch with his friends on Tuesday [February 25]. They told us that they had seen Aftab being assaulted by a mob on Monday evening when he was at a supplies store in Shiv Vihar,” Mr. Qadir said.

“We came to Delhi on Wednesday and began looking for him. While in Loni area, my family and I asked a few Uttar Pradesh policemen about the situation in Delhi and they told us to go to GTB Hospital,” he said. Over the next five days, Mr. Qadir and his father Mohammad Umar would make rounds of GTB, Lok Nayak and Jag Parvesh hospitals during the day. They would spend their nights at a shelter at Kashmere Gate.

On Monday morning, one of the ambulance drivers at the GTB Hospital whom Mr. Qadir had befriended suggested that he visit RML Hospital where five bodies had arrived. These bodies were taken out of drains, including one from the drain in Karawal Nagar where Aftab had been with his friends.

“I sent my father and brother to RML mortuary who identified Aftab’s body by the yellow jacket he was wearing when he left home a little less than a fortnight ago. They called me to the hospital to make sure it was him,” Mr. Qadir said.

“His stomach was badly decomposed and bloated,” said Mr. Qadir, adding that he identified Aftab by a mole on the left side of his chin.. “We will not tell our family tonight. We will just take his body home for burial after the paperwork,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qf56vp/article30966845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29AFTAB1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/a-brothers-search-ends-at-the-mortuary/article30966846.ece

Stating that the firm, which serves more than 15,000 clients across 50 countries, is committed to making additional investment to grow the operations in Hyderabad, Chairman and CEO G. Brint Ryan said the plan is to go for a larger, synchronised location here.

On the timeline, Mr.Ryan, who spoke to media here, said with the current facility expected to be full in the next 18 months, the company would plan accordingly. Over the last few years it has invested around $3 million to expand its operations in the city. He, however, did not share details on the size of the proposed campus and the proposed investment.

Global support

Ryan’s India business operations provide global support with data processing, market research, asset recovery, software development, human resource analytics, competitive intelligence, robotic process automation, and business process management. Overtime, the company was keen on looking at India as a market for its services.

To queries on the headcount in Hyderabad, he said that Ryan, which started its India operations in 2013, has around 400 people at the existing and about 120 at the new facility.

306,2020/03/03,Advanced test for cervical cancer detection launched,"India alone accounts for almost one quarter of the burden of cervical cancers in the world

Yashoda Hospitals has launched a ‘new and unique test of revolutionary technology’ for detection of Cancer of Cervix ( lower part of uterus).

About 250 women delegates who are leaders in their own fields attended the event organised here on Tuesday for the launch and to generate awareness about the high risk HPV DNA test. Cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer and cancer-related deaths in women worldwide, with India alone accounting to almost one quarter of the burden of cervical cancers. It is estimated that cervical cancer occurs approximately in one in 53 Indian women during their lifetime compared to one in 100 women in the more developed regions of the world.

Dr. Pavan Gorukanti, Director, Yashoda Hospitals said one of the most important risk factors for developing cancer of cervix was infection by high-risk strains of a virus called HPV (Human Papilloma Virus). The presence of HPV has been implicated in greater than 90% of cervical cancers worldwide.

Dr. Shanta Kumari, senior gynaecologist and president, GOGSI said PAP smear had been routinely used till now for screening of cancer cervix.

This new US FDA approved test-high risk HPV DNA was more sensitive than PAP smear test in risk stratifying and detecting cancer cervix. Dr. Lalitha Reddy, vice-president of Yashoda Group said the hospital introduced the expensive equipment with a great sense of responsibility for the first time in the Telugu States as a preventive and curative health.

Though the equipment would be available at Yashoda Hospital, the kits necessary for taking the sample and storing it would be made available to doctors all across the State even in remote areas so that patients need not travel far to give samples. The samples collected from various parts of the State would be processed centrally at the Laboratory of Yashoda Hospitals and the reports would be made available to the patients and doctors locally, she said.

Abhilasha Bisht, Additional Director General of Police, urged women to take their health more seriously and keep healthy and fit.

Six nurses and a CT Scan technician are among the 42 staff members of Apollo Hospital, Secunderabad, who came in close contact with the 24-year-old COVID-19 hit techie from Hyderabad, are under close watch of the Telangana Health department.

All these 42 that include two night duty doctors, nurses, technicians and housekeeping staff of the hospital would be isolated at Gandhi Hospital in the next few days, according to highly placed sources in the Telangana government.

A senior official wishing anonymity said on Tuesday night that six nurses residing in hospital-run hostels have been kept under quarantine and given separate rooms. “The six nurses, two night duty doctors, the CT Scan technician who carried out scan besides the housekeeping staff will have to come to Gandhi Hospital to give their samples for tests,” sources said.

Now, more information is coming about what the techie did soon after arriving in Bengaluru from Dubai on February 20. He is said to have attended office for a day and did not venture out of office on February 21 and 22.

On February 22 night he took a bus for Hyderabad to be with his parents for Sivaratri. On February 23, he complained of fever and visited Apollo Hospital, Secunderabad and consulted duty doctor. He was put in observation and asked to undergo a barrage of tests including CT scan.

308,2020/03/03,GHMC Commissioner Lokesh Kumar summoned,"PIL plea over some industries causing pollution

The Telangana High Court on Tuesday directed GHMC Commissioner Lokesh Kumar and Deputy Commissioner D. Pradeep Kumar to appear before it on March 11 in a PIL plea over some industrial units causing pollution in Shastripuram.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy passed the direction, after seeking to know why the authorities were failing to rein in industrial units disturbing the environment. The bench observed that the affidavits filed by the Deputy Commissioner on February 6 and 12 were vague.

The bench said the affidavits gave conflicting information, pointing out that on one hand the officials say there are only three industrial units in Shastripuram and on the other they maintain that notices were issued to a large number of such units for evacuation. The bench said the GHMC was playing hide-and-seek with regard to details on the issue.

In another case, Justice Abhinand Kumar Shavili of the HC dismissed a writ petition filed by Karvy Stock Broking Limited challenging the Central government’s order for a probe into its affairs by SFIO.

The company in its petition stated that officials of the HC summons GHMC Commissioner, a wing of Corporate Affairs Ministry, did not give it an opportunity to hear its version despite an earlier order from the High Couort. The judge, however, did not agree with the contentions of the company. Assistant Solicitor General Namavarapu Rajeshwar Rao told the court that the Registrar of Companies had already conducted a probe into the matter and furnished a report seeking further investigation into the company’s matters.

310,2020/03/03,"Utility shifting, a hurdle to SRDP works","During this surprise visit, MA&UD Minister tries to expedite the project

Shifting of various utility lines is going to be a herculean task on the way towards finish line for the ongoing components of the Strategic Road Development Project (SRDP).

Several utilities pertaining to water supply and power transmission need to be shifted for resumption of work related to flyovers and underpasses at various junctions as part of SRDP, officials say.

At Balanagar, where HMDA is taking up the work for a flyover, the engineers unearthed a huge LPG pipeline and an underground power transmission line due to which works have been stalled abruptly.

The work cannot go on till the lines are cleared, HMDA was said to have made clear at the recent city convergence meeting.

On Road No. 45, which forms an important link for hassle-free traffic flow from Jubilee Hills towards Madhapur and Financial District once the cable-stayed bridge on Durgam Cheruvu is launched, a flyover work is stalled pending clearance of a high-tension power transmission line.

Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T.Rama Rao, during his surprise visit on Monday, tried to make a headway for the project, by asking TSTransco officials to shift the tower as soon as possible.

Though GHMC has already paid over ₹14 crore towards shifting the 132 kV overhead tower and lines, the work has been pending for close to two years, due to insistence by TSTransco officials on payment of 25% supervision charges and 2.5% engineering charges.

After intervention of the Minister, the TSTransco officials agreed to carry the shifting within the coming two weeks. The overhead lines would be shifted underground, for which designs were ready, officials said.

Two more transmission lines, of 132 kV and 220 kV carrying capacities, are in the process of being shifted near Botanical Gardens junction at Kothaguda to facilitate ongoing SRDP works. They too have been delayed for two years owing to the cost dispute.

City’s drinking water supply lines pose a bigger challenge at the Nagole and L. B. Nagar junctions, and would take a minimum of three months for shifting, say officials.

A 1000 mm diameter pipeline needs shifting to facilitate the flyover at Nagole, and a 1600 mm diameter pipeline, for the vehicle underpass at L.B.Nagar junction.

“The shifting will have to be taken up post acquisition of the remaining properties, which is expected to be completed in the coming fortnight to a month,” said an official.

Also in need of shifting at Nagole are 33 kV high tension power lines, from overhead to underground.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/utility-shifting-a-hurdle-to-srdp-works/article30974929.ece
311,2020/03/03,"COVID-19 | Mad rush for protective masks, gloves and sanitisers in Hyderabad","Prices of masks shoot up as shops run out of stocks; as threat instils fear among the citizens more pragmatic steps sought from the government

On a day when Hyderabad woke up to the fact of one person testing positive for the COVID-19, there was a run on the stocks of protective masks, gloves and hand sanitisers. “The N95 mask prices have doubled. The new price is ₹ 80. Nationally, the demand has jumped seven-fold from 10 crore masks to 70 crore masks,” said the representative of a Mumbai-based company manufacturing surgical products including masks.

In the city, the availability of masks was patchy with many medical stores having run out of N95 stocks and the price of surgical masks varying according to the area. In the pharmacies near Gandhi Hospital it was ₹ 10, near Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences it was ₹ 5, and in Madhapur area it was ₹ 20. Incidentally, Telangana government distributed seven lakh masks during the four-day Medaram Jatara, according to a State official who coordinated the distribution.

While some citizens appeared nonchalant about the threat from the virus that has instilled fear among millions, others wanted more pragmatic steps from the government. “I am sure the officials concerned may have already begun to take appropriate actions, as evidenced by proactive screenings at the airports etc., and also attempts to trace out those who were in physical proximity of those testing positive. It would be good if the government engages in extensive confidence-building measures regarding precautions that citizens can take as well as measures being undertaken by the governments themselves,” said Pramod Reddy, a lawyer.

On Tuesday, the State government has pushed a matter-of-fact poster about the virus and the symptoms of the disease on multiple social media platforms. This adds to the corpus of information released by the World Health Organisation other organisations about how to slow down the spread of the disease.

On the ground, there were pockets of awareness amidst a sea of indifference. In the area around Gandhi Hospital, almost everyone from police officials to Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation civic workers to the staff at the pharmacies could be seen wearing the masks. In contrast, in the surrounding areas of NIMS which has two arterial roads on either side, very few patients, visitors or staffers could be seen wearing masks. “Yesterday we bought a stock of 30 bottles of hand-sanitiser, now we are left with only five. We never sold so many in such short time,” said Ravi, a pharmacist near NIMS.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/474yjx/article30975688.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04CORONAVIRUSCOVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/mad-rush-for-masks-sanitisers/article30974243.ece

The Government of Telangana has decided to designate a hospital exclusively to treat COVID-19 patients. Currently, the 24-year-old techie from Hyderabad who has tested positive for the dreaded virus is admitted in an ICU located in Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad.

Sources stressed that there is an urgent need to shift the ICU facility from the government tertiary care hospital as thousands of patients and their attendants come for treatment and admission. “It is a wrong place to isolate COVID-19 positive patients in the hospital where thousands of people visit,” sources said.

Isolation Wards in other hospitals

Apart from Gandhi Hospital - which also has a facility to test samples collected from COVID-19 suspects - Isolation Wards have been established at Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases (Fever Hospital), Nallakunta, and Government General and Chest Hospital, Erragadda.

The decision to designate a hospital exclusively for COVID-19 patients was taken on Tuesday morning after the State Health Minister Etela Rajender held a review meeting with Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MAUD) Department, Panchayat Raj and Rural Development (PR&RD) Department.

Private hospitals alerted

“The required number of Pulmonologists and nurses will be deployed,” Mr. Rajender said. Besides, private hospitals were alerted about measures to be taken. They were directed to refer COVID-19 suspects to government hospitals for treatment.

Further, the Health Department will work in coordination with nine other departments. A nodal officer will be appointed for each department.

Track and quarantine

Moreover, the process of tracking people who came in contact with the young COVID patient is underway. In fact, a few among them visited Gandhi Hospital to give their swab samples for testing.

Nagar has even installed an air-conditioner in the permit room for which he charges a nominal amount of ₹50 per head.

The city has 240 shops selling Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL), most of them having permit rooms. The exceptions are shops selling premium brands, old outlets which want to retain their ‘no-nuisance’ identity and the ones located in prime areas where additional accommodation space is not available to rent.

Hand in glove

Excise authorities are often accused of turning a blind eye to the menace of liquor shops and permit rooms. As a leader of shop managements explains, running the outlets with permit rooms on vast open spaces as on Santoshnagar-Gurramguda road is not possible without the connivance of authorities. He added that having a permit room comes with the risk of dealing with unnecessary problems.

An official, however, said they carry out checks wherever they receive complaints of nuisance.

Liquor outlets in the city are open from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. and bars from 11 a.m. till midnight from Monday to Thursday and till 1 a.m. from Friday to Sunday.

Earlier, the closing time was 10 p.m. There are about 110 bars in GHMC limits but liquor shops with permit rooms have eaten into their revenues as customers purchase their stocks at a lesser price.

Open spaces

The permit rooms started in 2016 with the government stipulating a fee of ₹1 lakh per annum apart from the license fee. The shops were supposed to provide a space of 100 square metres for permit rooms, but at several places on the outskirts, huge open spaces are rented and covered with temporary shelters. Large stones are propped up like seats and benches to give customers the comfort of a bar. And all this is for free.

A strict rule that was given the go-by was that the liquor shops and permit rooms should come up under a single roof. But, at places like Gurramguda and Karmanghat, the permit rooms are open spaces, right behind the shops. Such facilities also exist in Kukatpally, Kondapur, Madhapur, Ramanthapur, Uppal, L.B.

316,2020/03/03,"Not in ‘spirit’ of law, but tipplers booze and cruise anyway","‘Don’t blame the police for drunk driving deaths’

The need for stringent measures to curb drunk driving has come into sharp focus following the death of three youngsters in Karmanghat 10 days ago.

Despite routine drunk driving checks by the traffic police of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda Commissionerates, instances of tipplers involved in accidents are reported every other day in the State capital. “Don’t blame the police for drunk driving deaths. We are doing our best to curb the menace. People have to understand that they should not drive under the influence of alcohol,” said Rachakonda Traffic DCP N. Divyacharan Rao.

‘Human error to blame’

The police cannot conduct the drives across the commissionerates due to various reasons, he said, adding, “More than 70% of road accidents are taking place due to overspeeding or self-skidding. A majority of accidents are occurring only due to human error.”

On February 23, three youngsters, two of them software engineers, were killed while one of their friends escaped with minor injuries when their car crashed at Karmanghat.

Madupati Vinayaka Mallikarjun (29) from New Saidabad was driving the car under the influence of alcohol, which they consumed till late in the night at a bar in Gurramguda.

Another such accident was reported on February 18 when a 35-year-old drunk businessman lost control of his vehicle and knocked down a group of people at Hafeezpet, Miyapur. The accident claimed the life of Mohammed Afsar (40), a private school correspondent from BHEL, and left two others injured.

Several accidents involving drunk drivers are taking place on weekdays, while the number of accidents during weekends have declined drastically. “We are also planning to conduct late-night drives on weekdays,” a senior police officer said, adding that many accidents with no casualties are not even recorded.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/s4qrg5/article30966700.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY02-CARCRASH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/not-in-spirit-of-law-but-tipplers-booze-and-cruise-anyway/article30966677.ece

318,2020/03/03,"Come clean on 2-BHK project, BJP tells govt.","‘TRS govt. diverting funds from Prime Minister Awas Yojana to other sectors’

BJP city president and MLC N. Ramchander Rao on Monday demanded that the State government to come clean on the number of two-bedroom houses constructed in the twin cities and explain how many have been handed over and how many more are proposed to be constructed over the next few years.

“Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has duped people promising them two-bedroom houses during the last GHMC elections. But save for about 500-600 persons, there has been no progress. The TRS party is now again trying to deceive the people by making various promises with the next polls on the horizon,” he said at a press conference.

Mr. Rao alleged that the TRS government has been ‘diverting’ funds from the Prime Minister Awas Yojana (PMAY) meant for the subsidised housing to other sectors. In this context, he referred to the death of three children in a house collapse in Mangalbasti under Nampally Assembly constituency and said there were about 2,000 people living in the locality with the hope of getting new two-bedroom houses.

“They do not want to leave the area and continue to live in the crumbling houses expecting the government to take up two-bedroom houses. However, there has been no relief from the government even after the tragedy, save for providing ex-gratia amount,” he added.

The MLC also demanded that the government immediately hand over the completed housing complexes to the identified beneficiaries rather than keep them as “show pieces”.

The BJP leader took strong objection to the word “genocide” used by MIM leader and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi in connection with riots in Delhi. “Mr. Owaisi is provoking and misleading innocent Muslims for his own selfish design,” he said.

319,2020/03/03,File counter in PIL over Municipalities Act: HC,"Demolition of illegal structures without prior notice challenged

Telangana High Court on Monday directed the State government to file counter affidavit in a PIL petition that had challenged a provision of new Telangana Municipalities Act empowering government to demolish illegally built structures without prior notice.

Hearing contentions of the petitioner, a division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy said sub-section 2 of section 178 of the Act gave unbridled power to Municipal Commissioners to pull down buildings deviating from sanctioned plans. The bench asked the government counsel if it was fair to take a unilateral decision to demolish a building without giving an opportunity of hearing to the other person.

Even persons awarded death sentence were being given an opportunity to explain their version or stand. The government counsel observed that no individual had suffered due to the provisions of the new Telangana Municipalities Act and hence the petition challenging the Act need not be treated as Public Interest Litigation.

But the bench noted that more than the legal technicalities, people had right to challenge a law if it caused inconvenience to citizens. Advocate General B.S. Prasad submitted to the bench that the latter had recently expressed dissatisfaction over authorities failing to check illegal construction activities in different parts of the State.

Chance to be heard

The bench responded saying that it was aware of the matter but that cannot be a justification of empowering officials to bring down buildings without paying heed to the explanation of the owners. Noting that powers accorded to officials should have a mechanism of regulation, the bench said the new Act should also have a system to ensure such powers were not misused.

The government counsel said why should a person indulging in deviation of building plan presented to municipality be given prior notice for demolition of the structure. The bench said irrespective of the gravity of an offence committed by a person, he or she would be given a chance to be heard. Not providing such opportunity is against principles of natural justice, the bench said.

It recalled that the Supreme Court had earlier made it clear that notices should be given to hut dwellers before removing the huts on pavements. The plea was posted to March 11 for next hearing.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/file-counter-in-pil-over-municipalities-act-hc/article30966663.ece
320,2020/03/03,‘Centre diluting Forest Rights Act’,"Nearly 53 lakh adivasi families have not yet received land rights, says tribal leader

The Adivasi Adhikar Rashtriya Manch (AARM) national convener Jiten Chowdhury charged the BJP-led Central government with infringing on the hard won rights of tribal communities by attempting to dilute the landmark Forest Rights Act (FRA) enacted in 2006.

Mr Chowdhury was addressing a public meeting held here on Monday evening to mark the beginning of the two-day State conference of the Telangana Girijana Sangham. Of an estimated over 70 lakh Adivasi and forest dwelling families across the country, only a meagre 17 lakh families secured rights under the provisions of the FRA in the last 17 years, he said, pointing out that nearly 53 lakh families (around 5 crore Adivasis and forest dwellers) have not yet received forest land rights.

The BJP regime at the Centre is pursuing anti-tribal, anti-Dalit anti-farmer and anti-poor policies by resorting to subsidy cuts hitting poorest of the poor the hardest, he charged. It is serving the interests of big corporate entities taking a toll on the livelihoods of lakhs of poor people and depriving Adivasis of their centuries old rights over forest resources, he alleged.

The TRS MPs should raise their voice in the ongoing Parliament session seeking concrete measures to safeguard the reservations of SCs and STs in jobs and promotions, he said.

321,2020/03/03,Sooraj Santhosh: I love that Vivek Sagar stays away from clichés,"Having recently performed in Hyderabad, Sooraj Santhosh talks about his admiration for Telugu film musicians, as well as his in-progress debut solo album

Sooraj Santhosh claims that juggling the demands of being a playback singer as well as a travelling musician is “not a superhuman activity!” He is also one who packs only the utilitarian items for his sets, and does not believe in carrying gizmos which connote good luck.

Kerala-born Sooraj was in Hyderabad, and ahead of his gig last night, he implies his live sets are pretty standard. “The line-up has a couple of folk songs, some popular film songs as well as nine film songs in various languages, including Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam. There won’t be much original stuff from my side,” he admits. But he reveals, “Yes, I am working on my first album!”

The yet-to-be-named album is multilingual, of course, and narrates a lot of the 32-year-old’s personal experiences in the form of six original songs. “I’ll release the title by the end of this month or early next month, hopefully,” he starts, “Working on the album has been a wonderful journey and I have learned so much about working from scratch — from early conversations to jamming sessions to recording in multiple studios. We also shot across India to shoot this album. I’m looking forward to the release!”

Through hard work, Sooraj has placed himself as one of the National film industry’s most versatile playback singers. The past decade-plus has taught him that “one artiste won’t get every audience.” When one becomes part of a movie as a playback singer, they expect the song would reach a minimum crowd, but the audience gradually grows.

That said, live concerts are a great offline way for people to connect with artistes and languages they otherwise would not have known.

Culture tap

Coming to Hyderabad is always special for Sooraj as it brings back memories of working on Telugu films such as Pellichoopulu (2016) and last year’s Brochevarevarura. “I actually started my playback singing career in 2010 with the Telugu film industry,” he responds, “and it was a song [‘Inka Edho’ from Darling] I sang for GV Prakash. I happened to first work with Vivek Sagar about four years ago for Pellichoopulu. I love his music and his work ethic; he naturally stays away from clichés and always comes up with new sounds and concepts. His sound is interesting and alternative. Whenever I get a call from him, I know it’s going to be for something interesting. It’s fun and good to work with such people.” Sooraj has also worked with Vivek on Ee Nagaraniki Emaindi (2019).

“Working in the different regional industries has also taught me about diversity of the world, I guess,” he comments, “and I don’t find any discrimination in music. I love listening to fresh music, and am not hooked onto any particular genre or dialect. And these different influences reflect in new music I create. To sum it up, music is the language here. Language is not a hurdle if you love music enough.”

He also encourages people to step out of their comfort zones and to listen to as much diverse music as possible to further emotional connections with this immersive medium. “But I would love to tap into alternate pop or even jazz, in the near future,” he tacks on.

Clearly, there is no end to how much Sooraj wants to diversify. He has also started a series called ‘The Other Side’ on his YouTube channel. “I will be releasing poetry, some interview sessions and my own spoken thoughts — so a mixed bag.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/isv6m7/article30970212.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy28-sooraj,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/sooraj-santhosh-on-debut-album-and-diverse-languages-in-music/article30970213.ece
322,2020/03/03,Excise nabs ganja peddler,"The Excise on Tuesday arrested a person allegedly with over 1.25 kilograms of ganja from near Edathala.

The arrested was identified as Jentu Shiekh aka Manik Bhai, 24, of Murshidabad in West Bengal. An Excise team in disguise wrestled him into submission near a college at Edathala.

The arrest of one of his alleged migrant aides with ganja a few days ago led to his capture. The aide told officials that the accused was on his way back from West Bengal with ganja. On being informed that he used to come by train up to either Palakkad or Thrissur from where he generally travelled by bus to Perumbavoor before coming to his lodging at Edathala, Excise officials in disguise positioned themselves near a college at Edathala and took him into custody by force.

According to the Excise, he bought ganja for negligible price from his State and then sold it among youngsters, including students, in areas like Aluva, Choondy, Chunagamveli and Edathala through his migrant friends. He used to distribute ganja in small lots worth ₹300 and ₹500 among his friends on a commission basis.

323,2020/03/03,Pepper House wakes up to art ahead of KMB-20,"The works will be on display at the Residency show held as part of the Kochi Muziris Biennale getting under way on December 12

Making herself comfortable on the apron of Pepper House’s window overlooking the Kochi shipping channel, artist Jane Skeer says she was fearful of making the trip to India.

“I had heard terrible stories about what India was going to be, but my experience has been just the opposite. Kerala isn’t India and the people are wonderful,” says Ms. Skeer on her month-long residency offered by the Kochi Biennale Foundation at the Pepper House, a 16th century dockside warehouse that has retained its character.

On the top floor of this sea-facing building is a site-specific installation made by Ms. Skeer using a mix of photos taken on the phone and material, mostly discarded, collected by her from the heritage town.

“Australia has got no history,” she says, marvelling at the quaint town’s historical past. Her routine in Kochi comprised setting out on walks before daybreak when she would record the morning choruses on the streets. With an eye for detail, she would stop by a rundown house to capture its worn-out dual-tone wall, a cheap handbag hung on nail defining it; a batch of gas cylinders kept in the street in a certain formation for distribution; a man in an orange shirt carrying on his head a stack of used blue cement bags; step ladders of varying heights with old pieces of furniture stacked against them and the like.

As the day grew hot, she would perch on her favourite window by the sea to watch ships laden with cargo move by. The similarities and differences in freight handling, not just the marine cargo, in India and Australia is one of her areas of interest. In fact, Ms. Skeer had done a project earlier drawing on goods handling and transport back at her place. “The way bundles are tied is different here,” she says.

Tiny moments and minute details are what draw her attention, using which she re-presents the daily life of a place. Be it the regular gas cylinder (not because she’s from a place that’s grown past the gas barrel era), the colourful cement bag that’s used even as a container for growing plants, the fish basket or the oil drums (she clicked over 500 pictures of them in Kochi) she is drawn to all of them. “I wish I could put a strap around them, pick them as they are and hang them on the wall,” she laughs, pointing to a picture of an orderly batch of gas cylinders.

Her art is reversible too, as material used in her works can be pulled out for daily use. At Pepper House, with its orange walls, blue cement bags with their rims rolled out to resemble flexible containers are arranged in one room against the wall while in an adjacent hall, bags in saffron, white and green frump a picture of Indian nationalism amidst myriad images of Kochi’s living environs.

Having turned into art in her early 50s after taking a university course in sculpture, Ms. Skeer, 55, calls it a ‘life-giver’ and her sojourn to Kochi, she wrote in her diary, helped her explore the relationship between “us humans and our environment”. The project, begun in Kochi, will be completed back in Adelaide.

Artists exchange

Artist Sabyasachi Bhattacharjee, resident artist at Pepper House, and Kerala-based visual artist K.R. Sunil are also flying to Adelaide as part of the artists exchange.

Mr. Bhattacharjee’s work at Pepper House is a collage done on a 100-ft-long cloth with a height of 10 ft. Diverse images projected on to the cloth in segments of 10 ft are traced out by him layer upon layer to create a composite work which captures the chaos of the day.

“The concept is that there’s a sub language every 10 km apart – a dialectical variation. As one who works with animations, he will have an animated video projected on a blank portion of the cloth. The marking cloth he uses was also used to create banners for the anti-CAA protests, adding another dimension to the work, says Mr. Bhattacharjee, who works between Baroda and Agartala.

The third of the Pepper House residents, Jasmine Nilani Joseph, a Sri Lankan Tamil artist born in Jaffna but grew up at a refugee camp in Vavunia, worked on ‘house and home’ as a sign of ‘property’. Sketches made by her of abandoned houses in Kochi and the strife-torn Jaffna will be scrolled for display on bangle holders in special jewel boxes as ‘show pieces’ rather than items for use.

In just over a fortnight since its launch, Yodhav, a mobile app launched by the Kochi city police to rein in the drug menace by enabling the public to share information anonymously, has accounted for 180 arrests in 170 cases, seizure of 24.14 kilograms ganja, 18.27 grams of MDMA and 700 packets of prohibited tobacco products.

The operations were conducted by members of the District Anti-Narcotic Special Action Force (DANSAF) and Special Operation Group (SOG) based on the alerts received over Yodhav.

Over 500 alerts were received in a short period of time over Yodhav and those related to the distribution, sale and consumption of drugs in other districts were forwarded to the district police chiefs concerned.

The alerts pertaining to city limits received over the mobile app are initially vetted by officials at the cyber cell and narcotics cell and the relevant ones are then forwarded to G. Poonguzhali, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order and Traffic), and Biji George, Assistant Commissioner, Narcotics Cell. They in turn directs members of DANSAF and SOP.

The mobile app was launched by the Chief Minister on February 15 as part of the ‘Drug Free Kochi’ campaign of the city police. The campaign is focussed on cracking down the spread of drugs among school and college students and young techies.

The app offers a common platform for people to share information by remaining completely anonymous. In fact, the app is so designed that even the police who receive information cannot trace the identity of informants.

The beauty of the app is that there is no need to download it from google play or AppStore. The back end of the app is integrated with WhatsApp and will run in the background. Users have to use WhatsApp in the normal manner for using the app. Information can be shared in the form of audio, video, image, or text just like sending any other WhatsApp message to a designated number.

326,2020/03/03,Learning lessons the ‘Maradu way’,"World Engineering Day lecture focuses on demolition episode

The demolition of the four apartment complexes at Maradu in which 360 families were rendered homeless was the result of the silence maintained by officials responsible for the enforcement of the provisions under the Coastal Regulation Zone Act, said Anil Joseph, structural engineer and member of the technical committee appointed by the government for the assessment of the demolition work.

The authorities were silent for almost 10 years when the entire apartment construction work progressed and the buildings came into being, Mr. Joseph said at the lecture on Maradu demolition held as part of the World Engineering Day for Sustainable Development organised by the Kochi centre of the Institution of Engineers India here on Tuesday.

It took years to construct these demolished apartments but only a few seconds to demolish them. The people who purchased and occupied these apartments were unaware of the zonal regulations and the related issues that were happening in the back stage, he said.

Mr. Joseph said the families who were living in these apartments for the last eight years were forcefully driven out of their houses. Everyone involved, including governmental officials, contractors, builders, residents and law enforcing agencies, had their own justification and blamed others for what happened. Several crores of rupees, time and effort of thousands of people were wasted simply because of inefficiency of a few, he said.

Mr. Joseph said that all need to learn from their mistakes and make policies to create awareness among the public about the whole incident. All the zonal regulations need to be strictly enforced, finalised and made transparent. We also need to think about sustainable alternatives for these violated construction that had already happened rather than demolishing it, he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/learning-lessons-the-maradu-way/article30974459.ece
327,2020/03/03,Key accused in flood relief scam remanded,"Hard disk of official computer used by first accused, his laptop seized

The District Crime Branch team probing the alleged diversion of flood relief fund to accounts of ineligible persons on Tuesday seized the hard disk of the official computer used by first accused Vishnu Prasad, and his personal laptop.

The hard disk of the computer allegedly used by the first accused for committing the irregularities in his official capacity was seized from the Disaster Management Cell on the first floor of the District Collectorate while the personal laptop was taken into custody from his residence at Mavelipuram at Kakkanad.

Mr. Prasad, who served as a clerk at the Chief Minister’s Disaster Relief Fund section at the collectorate, was arrested on Monday, and was present during the seizures.

Later in the day, he was produced before the Muvattupuzha Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Court, which remanded him to judicial custody in Muvattupuzha sub jail till March 17. His bail petition would be considered on March 7.

The remand report submitted by Biji George, Assistant Commissioner, District Crime Branch, arraigned Mahesh B of Civil Lane Road, and Anwar M.M of Nilampathinjimugal near Kakkand, as the second and third accused. Both were absconding.

Mr. Prasad was arrested after he surrendered at the office of the District Crime Branch after Additional District Magistrate Chandrasekharan Nair lodged a petition with the Thrikkakara police on February 25. He was accused of committing irregularities inflicting a loss of ₹10.54 lakh on the government exchequer in favour of illegal beneficiaries. He was subsequently charged with IPC Sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant, or by banker, merchant or agent) 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and Section 13 (1) (a) (if a public servant habitually accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain from any person for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration as a motive or reward) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Later, the case was transferred to the Crime Branch considering the gravity of the offence.

Mr. Nair said that departmental inquiry by the collectorate Finance Officer and Inspection Superintendent was progressing against Mr. Prasad who had already been placed under suspension. He ruled out involvement of more revenue officials in the scam for the time being.

Remand report

As per the remand report, the first accused shared with the second accused the account numbers to which the transfer of flood relief from the District Collector’s disaster management relief fund had failed. These account numbers were then tampered with based on which ₹2.50 lakh each was transferred in two different transactions to an account of the Ayyanad Service Cooperative Bank opened at the Kakkanad branch of the Federal Bank.

The third accused, who was an account holder at the Ayyanad Service Cooperative Bank, then got this amount transferred to his account by producing the Unique Transaction Reference number. He then withdrew ₹2 lakh each over two days and transferred the remaining amount in transactions of ₹49,999 each to accounts held by him and wife at HDFC Bank.

Later, the first accused transferred ₹2.5 lakh and ₹1.50 lakh to an account in the Kakkanad branch of Dena Bank, which the second accused had shared with the first accused, on January 21. This was followed by another transfer of ₹1.79 lakh to the account of the Ayyanad Service Cooperative Bank on January 24.

As per the Crime Branch probe up until now, the total amount diverted may have exceeded the initial estimates and stood at around ₹12.94 lakh.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/key-accused-in-flood-relief-scam-remanded/article30973826.ece

329,2020/03/03,Call for radical changes in waste management system,"The waste management system in the State, including in Kochi city, requires a radical change, according to a report prepared by the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

“What is required is a holistic, integrated and co-ordinated effort to implement the various provisions of environmental legislation from the grassroots level. The stakeholders should consider reduction as the primary object of waste management,” it said.

The ban imposed by the State government on single-use plastics recently is a welcome change. However, it is the responsibility of the local bodies to see that the same is implemented in letter and spirit.

The committee said awareness programmes for the benefit of waste generators can be undertaken with the assistance of bodies such as District Legal Service Authority, Suchitwa Mission as well as Haritha Kerala Mission.

It might help reduce waste generation in the long run, the committee said.

The treatment of biodegradable waste at source can be promoted under the supervision and guidance of the bodies aforesaid. There should be proper records regarding the quantity of waste treated at source and its final disposal.

Unauthorised disposal methods, under the pretext of treating wastes at source, have to be prohibited.

Door-to-door collection of waste which cannot be treated at source has to be improved to avoid unacceptable disposal methods. Proper segregation of waste should happen at source and the waste reaching the treatment yard should be segregated.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/call-for-radical-changes-in-waste-management-system/article30967124.ece
330,2020/03/03,Leachate from Brahmapuram polluting Kadambrayar: SLMC,"PCB inspections find windrow composting yards at site in a dilapidated state

The State-Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management has informed the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that the leachate from the dumping site of Kochi Corporation at Brahmapuram remains a major source of pollution of the Kadambrayar.

“The site is a wetland by the side of River Kadambrayar, which is identified by the Central Pollution Control Board as one of the polluted river stretches in India. The river is overgrown with aquatic weeds as a result of pollutants entering the stream. Leachate from the decaying food waste at Brahmapuram is a major source of pollution of river Kadambrayar,” said a report submitted by the SLMC before the Principal Bench of the tribunal in New Delhi.

In an annexure to the main report, the committee said the leachate percolating into the Kadambrayar was likely to aggravate in the rainy season. As the entire waste was dumped on an open ground, it might cause serious environmental issues, it said.

Inspections by the State Pollution Control Board held on February 18 had found that all windrow composting yards were in a dilapidated state at the site. The condition was worse than it was during earlier visits. No sufficient compost heaps were seen and the waste masses stocked there were of legacy nature. It was noticed that they were using three trommels only for biomining activities and the manure thus produced was of no fertilizer quality, according to a report filed by the board before the SLMC.

The corporation authorities were not able to provide closed drains as per the directives issued by the board. The drains were not constructed scientifically and chances of percolation of leachate were high.

Several drain segments through which leachate cannot be properly diverted were also found by the board officials.

Collection pits

The report said the direction to provide scientific leachate collection pits of impervious nature was not complied with by the corporation officials. Leachate in huge quantities was flowing through a small canal. It was noted that they were constructing a new collection pit in an unscientific manner beside the existing pit. This was not intimated to the board in advance. It was also noted that the oozed leachate was being pumped out to nearby land using suction pumps and hose, according to the report.

The leachate treatment plant was seen not operational and the officers responsible informed the board that it would not be viable and they were planning to introduce another facility. But no proper time-bound proposals were submitted till date, it said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/jfi7nu/article30967116.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02KIBRAHMAPURAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/leachate-from-brahmapuram-polluting-kadambrayar-slmc/article30967117.ece
331,2020/03/03,Questions over viability of waste-to-energy plant,"SLMC slams use of biodegradable, recyclable refuse

The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management has said that the use of biodegradable and recyclable non-biodegradable waste at the proposed waste-to-energy plant at Brahmapuram may not be viable.

An analysis of the type of waste reaching the dumping site of the Kochi Corporation and its possible impact on the viability of the energy plant has found place in the detailed report filed by the committee before the Principal Bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in New Delhi.

“If non-segregated waste, including biodegradable waste, is used in the waste-to-energy plant, the captive energy required to dehydrate the biodegradable waste will make the project highly unviable due to the huge expenditure involved and the local bodies would be driven to the risk of bridging the viability gap,” said the report filed by SLMC chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai.

Quantity of waste

The report said the quantity of waste generated in Kochi city was estimated at 350 tonnes to 400 tonnes per day, while the quantity received at Brahmapuram was 120 tonnes a day. Some of the uncollected waste was seen treated at source but there was no data regarding the waste treated at source and its final disposal.

It was apt to note that the major portion of solid waste coming to Brahmapuram was biodegradable waste. The moisture content of biodegradable waste was nearly 80% of its total weight. If it was assumed that 100 metric tonnes of waste was coming to the plant per day, approximately 60% (60 metric tonnes) of it would be biodegradable waste. Approximately, 80% (48 metric tonnes) of the same would be moisture. That meant nearly half of the waste reaching the plant was water, said the report

Of the non-degradable waste, only plastic, the maximum of which might be 20% (20 metric tonnes). had the calorific value that provided energy to create steam. If proper segregation happened at source, approximately half of this (10 metric tonnes) could be sent for recycling. Thus, only 10 metric tonnes of incinerable waste would be remaining to be used in the energy plant, according to the report.

The SLMC observed that the energy plant was an effective solution in the field of waste management. But such plant should not incinerate biodegradable waste or recyclable non-biodegradable waste. The incineration in waste-to-energy plants should be confined to soiled non-biodegradable waste, sanitary waste and hospital waste. The use of biodegradable waste and recyclable non-biodegradable waste in such plants had to be discouraged, it said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kijur7/article30967106.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01KIBRAHMAPURAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/questions-over-viability-of-waste-to-energy-plant/article30967107.ece
332,2020/03/03,"Caught in red tape, Chinese nets facing ruin","KITCO expected to procure teak logs from Forest Department

Fishermen who man the eight iconic Chinese fishing nets that dot the Fort Kochi beach front are a dejected lot, with the long-pending ₹2.44-crore project to renovate the nets using lengthy teak logs caught in red tape yet again.

Kerala Tourism had entrusted Kerala Industrial and Technology Consultancy Organisation (KITCO) with the task of implementing the project, following a fall in the number of nets from 14 over a decade ago to the present eight. Back in December, KITCO officials were expected to ink an agreement “within a week” with the Forest Department to procure teak logs from the forest.

It is still unclear what is hampering delivery of the teak logs to renovate the nets, said Sebastian Kurishinkal, vice president of the Chinese Net Owners’ Association.

“It is very painful that Kerala Tourism and KITCO are not pursuing the project in right earnest, despite innumerable media reports about the plight of these nets. Little has happened, except that a dozen wooden logs (not teak) that are part of the nets were unloaded nearby. Termites will destroy them if there is any further delay in using them for the renovation,” he said.

Apart from their tourism value, over 10 families are dependent on income from each net. The fish catch is dwindling and the cost of maintaining the nets is increasing. The setting up of a Water Metro terminal in between the nets will further threaten the nets, Mr. Kurishinkal said.

The government’s delay in reaching out help to the net operators resulted in many of them replacing worn-out teak wood logs with steel poles which do not have the aesthetic value of wood.

The nets need lengthy teak logs with no curves, that can be assembled as the frame of the cantilever nets.

Net operators and other tourism stakeholders have also been demanding removal of encroachers and vendors who hamper view of the nets.

They also demanded steps to tidy the beachfront and open sewage drains near the nets that are an eyesore, cause stink and pose threat to safety of tourists.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/oxom51/article30966763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03KICHINESENETS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/caught-in-red-tape-chinese-nets-facing-ruin/article30966764.ece
333,2020/03/03,Temple employees demand wage revision,"‘No steps taken two years after report’

The Malabar Devaswom Staff Union, affiliated to the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), has demanded that the State government should implement the recommendations of the Advocate Gopalakrishnan Commission Report for revising wages of temple employees in the Malabar region.

Union president and general secretary Sajeevan Kanathil said the commission had submitted the report to the government two years ago.

However, no steps had been taken to revise the meagre wage of temple employees. Those retiring were given a gratuity of ₹20,000 and monthly pension of ₹3,000, while they had remitted ₹300 per month while in service, the union said.

Pooling of funds

Although the Malabar Devaswom Board had come into being long time ago, the temple administration was still based on the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act of 1952. At present, there were no common pooling of funds and common schemes for temple managements in Malabar, said the union.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/temple-employees-demand-wage-revision/article30975959.ece
334,2020/03/03,Kammath Lane makes a clean sweep,"Merchants join hands with police, fire force personnel in drive as part of image makeover

Kammath Lane in Kozhikode, once notorious for its illegal gold business, wore a new look by Tuesday evening as merchants joined hands with the police and the Fire and Rescue Services to remove over 100 tonnes of waste from the area.

More than 600 people took part in the massive clean-up drive launched by the Town Janamaitri police as part of an elaborate project to lift the image of the lane and its shops. Around 40 employees of the Kozhikode Corporation, a group of Fire and Rescue Services personnel from the Beach fire station, and merchants and employees of Mele Palayam and Kammath Lane took part in the drive in four groups.

“Kammath lane looks very tidy to those who pass by the road. But even the Corporation employees were wonderstruck at the amount of waste removed from the interiors,” said A. Umesh, Inspector of the Town Police Circle, who spearheaded the drive.

“There were many cables hanging dangerously low from the posts. The fire personnel tied them up neatly,” said Mr. Umesh. Besides, the shops that had CCTV cameras that had no visibility outside the shop were asked to correct their positions.

“Once notorious for the sale of stolen gold, the shops on Kammath Lane have changed a lot now. But there are still many who need awareness and guidance,” said the inspector.

The police have set a few guidelines for the shops, such as fixed time for opening and closing, buying gold and so on. “It is a good sign that the merchants and employees here actively took part in the drive. It shows that we are in the same boat,” added Mr. Umesh.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/77kv8o/article30975946.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03KIKAMMATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kammath-lane-makes-a-clean-sweep/article30975947.ece
335,2020/03/03,Probe sought into student’s death,"Body of Jaspreet Singh was found in his apartment in the city on Sunday

Activists of the Students Federation of India (SFI) and Kerala Students Union (KSU) took out a march to the Malabar Christian College on Monday, demanding a probe into the death of a final year degree student of the college.

The body of Jaspreet Singh, 22, from Uttar Pradesh was found hanging in his apartment in the city on Sunday. He had been denied permission to appear for the final year examination owing to shortage of attendance.

The protesters, mostly students of the college, said the circumstances that led to the student’s death should be exposed.

They alleged that Jaspreet Singh had taken up the attendance issue with the authorities for a favourable solution, but the latter had ignored it.

Expecting a possibility of clash on the campus, the police had made elaborate security arrangements. Students who attempted to break police barricade were removed from the spot. Water canon too was used to disperse agitators.

It was around 2.30 p.m. on Sunday that Singh’s body was found in his apartment near Convent Road. According to university rules, 75% attendance is required to appear for the final year examination, and Singh had only 68%, the police said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/9ua5cv/article30967101.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03-KI-SFIMARCH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/probe-sought-into-students-death/article30967102.ece
336,2020/03/03,Route clear for sewage plant at Karimpanapalam,"Corporation to seek KIIFB help to execute project

With the Wetland Authority of Kerala declaring that the land for the proposed sewage treatment plant (STP) at Karimpanapalam (near Sarovaram Biopark) in the city was indeed not wetland, the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation has revived hopes to complete the much-awaited project.

Work on the STP, which was a key part of the citywide sewerage network, was put off following an injunction from the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2016. However, after a protracted legal battle, the tribunal had asked the Wetland Authority last year to decide if the land in question was part of the Kottooli wetland.

The authority had recently declared that the land, which was part of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) compound at Karimpanapalam, was 145 metres away from the Kottooli wetland and hence could not be considered part of the wetland and, therefore, not under the authority’s jurisdiction. This clears the last hurdle before the corporation to complete the project.

The construction of the plant that began in 2015 met a dead end after the Eranhipalam-Palat Residents’ Association and the Kottooly Wetland Protection Committee came up against it on the grounds that the project would pollute the nearby Conolly Canal. They also alleged that the KWA land in which the project was proposed to come up, was an illegal landfill which was actually part of the Kottooli wetland, one of the five notified wetlands in the State.

The organisations had then approached the NGT and procured an injunction in 2016, restraining the corporation or the Kerala State Urban Development Programme (KSUDP), which was the nodal agency for the construction of the STP then, from carrying out any construction activities or other operations in the 2.6-acre land.

By the time, KSUDP, an Asian Development Bank-funded project, had spent around ₹17 crore for the STP project in the form of pipelines and manholes, besides carrying out foundation work for the plant. The project, however, lay abandoned after the injunction, raising questions of what would happen to the money spent.

With the clearance from the Wetland Authority, the corporation is now trying to find funds for the project from the Kerala Infrastructure and Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). The estimated cost has escalated to more than ₹200 crore in the meantime.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/route-clear-for-sewage-plant-at-karimpanapalam/article30967063.ece
337,2020/03/03,"‘Women need mental, financial strength’","Time for women to explore new areas of entrepreneurship, says Mayor

Women empowerment is not about gaining physical strength but mental and financial strength, Mayor Thottathil Raveendran has said.

“What is more important than women coming into positions of power is their being capable enough to execute that power. Else, they will earn a bad name,” Mr. Raveendran said. He was opening Sadhairyam Munnottu, a seminar organised by the Kerala State Women’s Development Corporation (KSWDC) on the occasion of International Women’s Day in Kozhikode on Monday.

The Mayor commented that the age-old notion that kitchens were the sole responsibility of women was slowly changing, at least in urban areas, but there was no letup in atrocities against women.

The government has constraints, and, therefore, other organisations should step in to prevent atrocities, he said, appreciating residents’ associations for setting up cameras that not only gave women a sense of security but also helped the police in investigating cases.

Mr. Raveendran said pointed out that several women were caught up in their comfort zone and are reluctant to come out of it. “Women should explore new areas of entrepreneurship and exploit the services of the KSWDC well,” he added.

KSWDC Director K.P. Sumathi presided over the seminar. As many as 10 women were granted the corporation’s self-employment loans on the occasion. KSWDC Director Madhavi Amma urged those who received loans to spend them judiciously and responsibly.

Pennoruthi, a short film jointly produced by the Legal Services Authority and the KSWDC and Vimochanathinte Pattukar, a docu-fiction directed by Vidhu Vincent were screened on the occasion.

338,2020/03/03,Kozhikode in final phase of Mission Indradhanush,"The scheme will be in operation till March 9

The final phase of Mission Indradhanush, the Central scheme to ensure full immunisation coverage for unvaccinated or partially vaccinated children aged up to two and pregnant women against vaccine-preventable diseases by this year, will be held in Kozhikode district from March 2 to 9.

V. Jayasree, District Medical Officer, told the media on Monday that the project was launched in December 2019 here in view of the low vaccination coverage. There were 121 children who had not taken any vaccination and 4,246 who were partially vaccinated in Kozhikode when the scheme was launched. Within three months, 17 unvaccinated children and 1,302 partially vaccinated children were given immunisation coverage.

Dr. Jayasree pointed out that residents of areas such as Kuttiyadi, Velam, Thiruvallur, Chekkiad, Thunery, Valayam, Vanimel, Chengaroth, Mangad, Chaliyam, Cheruvannur, and Koduvally were reluctant towards vaccination. Because of this, the vaccination coverage of the district was below 90%. To overcome this, an action panel had been formed under the District Collector, and regular meetings were held.

The help of religious and social organisations were sought at the local level to create awareness. Vaccination camps were held from the third Monday of every month till the seventh working day. Elected representatives and health workers visited houses. Doctors from Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, and staff from Arogya Keralam were also involved in awareness creation initiatives.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kozhikode-in-final-phase-of-mission-indradhanush/article30966913.ece

“The efforts taken by Mr. Manilal then are unimaginable now. Learning Latin, an alien language, and translate that book into English. Later, translating it into Malayalam.

“It is too late a recognition for him. He should have got this award long ago and he deserves even bigger awards,” the Mayor said. Mr. Raveendran spoke about the mental trauma that Mr. Manilal had to endure when a publisher promised to bring out the translation, but did not give him the credit after doing it.

341,2020/03/03,Chambers in talks for more overseas liners connecting Beypore Port,"Request to be submitted to government, international vessel operators

Responding to the demand of major importers in Kerala, the Federation of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) are likely to approach prominent multi-national cargo vessel operators to seek their support in improving the cargo movement through the Beypore Port.

A national council member for ports and infrastructure under the two prominent business chambers said a concept note on the Beypore Port highlighting the possibilities in exploring its facilities for low-cost cargo movement would be prepared soon for the consideration of such international liners.

Some of the overseas vessel operators connecting Khor Fakhan and Kalba Ports in Sharjah and the Sharjah Free Zone authorities have already expressed their interest in checking out the possibilities and the concept note would be submitted soon for their consideration, he said.

The chamber leadership is likely to place a request before the operators to start services connecting the international ports in Dubai, China and Indonesia with Beypore.

Giving fresh energy to the demand, one of the prominent liners has come up with an agreement in principle to take goods from China and deliver them at the Beypore Port. Demand is also rife to ensure better connectivity between various prominent ports in Gujarat and Kerala.

Chamber functionaries said the request would also be submitted to top officials under the Ministry of Shipping to ensure better cooperation of the overseas liner operators.

Similarly, the cooperation of the Kerala Maritime Board (KMB) would be sought to take forward the demand and clear the ground for an easy operation, they said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/chambers-in-talks-for-more-overseas-liners-connecting-beypore-port/article30966848.ece

343,2020/03/03,No action yet to curb plastic burning,"Coastal roads and space along highways most vulnerable spots

Thoughtless burning of non-biodegradable waste and plastic materials has come back to the city thanks to declining surveillance and spot legal action by the authorities against violators.

Coastal roads and space along State and national highways are the most vulnerable spots for the illegal act, which instantly attracts a fine of ₹5,000.

Violators apparently cash in on declining spot protests by residents’ fora and environmental bodies to repeat the offence and skip options to scientifically treat waste. Moreover, in the absence of complaints and spot protests, the police too stay away from taking voluntary action.

An executive directive issued by the State Police Chief subsequent to a High Court verdict makes it clear that those who burn waste in public can be booked under Sections 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection or disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code and 120 (e) of the Kerala Police Act. The order also says that Sections 340 (A), 340 (B), 341, and 342 of the Kerala Municipalities Act and Sections 219 (N), 219 (O), 219 (P), and 250 of the Kerala Panchayati Raj Act too are applicable to such violations.

The Station House officers who were asked to map the black spots in their limit and conduct proper awareness programmes under the Community Policing schemes along with intensifying legal action are yet to be serious about the flawless enforcement. An earlier order issued to appoint patrolling squads to identify such polluting attempts too remains unimplemented.

According to residents’ association office-bearers, wayside burning of plastic waste and rubber materials takes place mostly in late night hours, and some suspected traders misuse the services of their security guards for the unlawful job. Though many of them handle only small quantities of waste, the number of such persons resorting to wayside burning is steadily on the rise, they say.

Meanwhile, attempts to make migrant labourers burn plastic waste on the beach side have come to the notice of a few residents’ collectives. A resident near the Butt Road Beach says huge bundles of non-degradable waste, including single-use plastics, are being burnt on a regular basis near the beach.

344,2020/03/03,"Mapping mythology, history and art with Wendell Rodricks","Devdutt Pattanaik recalls connecting the dots with the designer whose heart and soul was firmly embedded in Goa

I find it hard to believe that Wendell is gone. The news was a shock. But then, Wendell has always surprised me. From his habit of waking up very early in the morning, to living his life confidently and openly with his husband Jerome, giving courage and direction to young gay men like me, to having a business without compromising on his art, to being a generous host to my sister and my nephew when we visited Goa, to being a curious student of mythology, taking down notes meticulously in long hand. That is how we met, ten years ago. He had seen my work and wanted to know more about Goan mythology. He was convinced it contained ideas that would help us understand the evolution of Goa.

Geography and fractals

As we explored things together, I realised something magical – how geography in India is like a fractal. Every area in India tells the same story, but uniquely. We know that Goa was ruled by Portuguese for 450 years. Before that it was part of the Bijapur and Bahamani Sultanate. Before that were the Vijaynagar and Kadamba kings. Before that, the Shatavahanas and Mauryans.

Also Read Wendell in the Bardo

Before that we have rock engravings indicating the earliest human settlements. The Goan tryst with Christianity, Islam, Hinduism Buddhism, and hunter-gathering prehistoric communities is known. But what about mythology, asked Wendell? We walked around his village, and saw the art that he had collected, and at maps of temples of Goa and what emerged was amazing – the mythology of Goa reflected the mythology of India. Goa was a Hindu fractal, a mini-India, showing all influences seen elsewhere in almost the same sequence.

The earliest layer of gods belong to hunter-gatherers and has nothing to do with land-holding and agriculture. These included the worship of anthills, which indicated a connection with a subterranean world. Today, this anthill is worshipped as a goddess, a form of mother-earth, even Durga. There are gods who protect from tiger attacks like Vaghoba, and others who protect from diseases. In the Dev-rais, or orchards of the mother-goddesses, known as ‘ai’ or mother, we noticed the shift to agricultural societies. Farmers and herdsmen were not allowed to enter or cultivate the sacred woods where the gods played. This was an ancient way to protect biodiversity, we now realised.

Documenting myths

I told Wendell how Sama Veda distinguishes between songs for the settlement and songs for the forest, perhaps reflecting this period of human history. The villages had farms that were owned by a community represented by a grama-deva or grama-devi. These were male and female deities, linked to fertility and power. Across Goa one finds images of goddesses with exaggerated genitals, and fierce expressions. Wendell captured many of these deities in his book Moda Goa.

The Brahmin influence does follow. The wild gods become the more gentle Mangeshi. Peculiar to Goa are the metal facemasks, where the formless Shiva-linga is given a face. The wild goddess becomes Shanta Durga, the mild one, who does not have the rage of the battle-ready Chandi. The Konkan coast, including Goa, is linked to Bhrigu, hence to Vamana, and to Parashurama. Vamana claimed the earth from the Asura-king Bali, who was shoved back to Patala. Parashurama threw his axe strained with the blood of unrighteous kings into the sea. The sea recoiled in horror and revealed the coast.

There are spots associated with Ram’s journey south. And with Krishna too who is liked to the West coast of India. Goa has the unique Devaki Krishna temple where Devaki (or is it Yashoda) holds Krishna much like Mother Mary holds Jesus. And during Diwali people burn effigies of Narakasura, much as people burn images of Ravana in Gangetic plains during Dassera.

Wendell felt this practice of burning Narakasura may have travelled to Portugal and may have come back to India as the practice of burning the old man on New Year’s Night.

Partners until the end

It was conversations like these connecting mythology to history to anthropology to sociology to fashion and art, that made Wendell the most wonderful of friends. He opened new avenues of thought for me. I miss him. And am glad that while he was on earth, with us, he had Jerome by his side.

347,2020/03/03,Left parties condemn Central govt. for Delhi clashes,"Madurai

Several Left parties staged a demonstration at Munichalai here on Tuesday, condemning the ruling BJP Government at the Centre for instigating violence during the recent clashes in Delhi against the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters, which has claimed more than 40 lives. They also demanded immediate action against those who attacked the protesters.

Madurai urban district secretary of Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) R. Vijayarajan said that the BJP government had planned and supported the attack during the clashes in Delhi.

“It is important to note that more than 30 protesters succumbed to gunshot wounds. Also, more than 80 protesters were injured because of gunshots and admitted to the hospital. This shows the fall of democracy in the country,” he said.

Members of Communist Party of India and Socialist Unity Centre of India (Communist) also took part in the protest. The protesters raised slogans against the government and demanded compensation for the families of the victims.

District Secretary of SUCI (Communist) M.J. Voltaire said that the BJP government adopted a divide and rule policy to break the secular fabric of the country. “The BJP government has supported the attack on students of Jawaharlal Nehru University and the recent Delhi clashes. Hence, the Left movements and parties must work in solidarity against these injustices,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/nzg40v/article30974295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA04CITY-CAA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/left-parties-condemn-central-govt-for-delhi-clashes/article30974296.ece

Condemning the ruling BJP government for not intervening in the recent clashes in Delhi between anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters and pro-CAA protesters, the general secretary of Samajwadi Samagam Sunilam demanded a judicial enquiry into the clashes.

Addressing a group of construction workers, domestic workers and farmers here on Tuesday, Mr. Sunilam said that riots are witnessed throughout the country.

“If Prime Minister Narendra Modi has time to meet U.S. President Donald Trump, why does he not have time to talk to women who are protesting at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi?” he asked.

A group of members of the National Alliance of People’s Movement(NAPM), along with Samajwadi Samagam, who are on a nation-wide tour against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), reached here on Monday night. They started their tour from Delhi on January 30 and will conclude it in Hyderabad on March 23.

349,2020/03/03,Differently-abled members complain about petition writers fleecing them,"'The petitions usually are about setting up petty shops for differently abled, getting hearing aids, wheelchairs and walking sticks as well as monthly aid'

When S. Dhanam entered the Collectorate on Monday hoping to submit a petition requesting a wheelchair for her son who has cerebral palsy during the grievance redressal meeting, she says she was shocked to have been approached by a number of men who promised her benefits under a number of schemes for differently abled.

“Two people promised to help me get the monthly stipend due for differently abled persons. One of them offered to write a strong-worded petition and another said that he would represent me in front of the officials,” she said.

Since Ms. Dhanam knew contacts in the differently abled welfare department, she said that she had not fallen for a scam that the two men were trying to pull.

“Usually, a small set of people sit under the shed area reserved for the differently-abled. They are petition writers who aim to make quick money by scamming poor people who cannot seek help from officials directly. They charge a minimum of ₹80 and a maximum of ₹150 for each petition,” said an official at the Collector's office.

The source said that the petitions usually are about setting up petty shops for differently abled, getting hearing aids, wheelchairs and walking sticks as well as monthly aid.

“Since the people who come there are naive and the Collectorate seems like a maze to them, some petition writers pose as helpers and choose to exploit them,” the source added.

S. Raja, general secretary of Tamil Nadu Crawling Differently Abled Persons Federation, said that he had predominantly seen the fleecing outside the Collectorate.

“Some people also wear the traditional veshti and act like they are from political parties. They also seem to demand cuts from us when we are sanctioned a certain amount. This has been happening for years but no one has stopped them,” he said.

He added that there was a need to improve amenities at the section for differently abled as well. “There is no proper fan facility and all elderly people who wait for old age pension also wait here. The Collector finishes all his works and comes last to us. We have to wait for four hours for our pleas to be addressed,” he said.

Collector T. G. Vinay said, “Usually, petition writers are not allowed inside campus. We have had volunteers from Nehru Yuva Kendra to help petitioners write their grievances. We will look into the matter. The installation of fans will be done immediately,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/differently-abled-members-complain-about-petition-writers-fleecing-them/article30974232.ece
350,2020/03/03,Flyover being built near MKU to reduce accidents,"Existing median for a eight-km stretch is also being replaced

Madurai

As a measure to reduce accidents near Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) on Madurai – Kochi Road (National Highways 49 extended), which is identified as an accident-prone zone, the National Highways Department is constructing a flyover there.

Another component of the project, which includes replacement of existing median for a eight-km stretch from Nagamalai Pudukottai to Chekkanoorani is also under way. In addition, four minor culverts are being reconstructed. The officials say that the project is under way at this place, which is identified as a black spot where accidents are reported frequently.

This project, with an estimated cost of ₹53.68 crore, will be completed within a year, officials say.

According to the officials, the flyover will run for around a kilometre with MKU at the centre. The four-lane flyover will be 21.5 metres wide and will allow for a two-way traffic. Also, seven-metre- long service road will be provided on either side of the flyover.

There will also be a two-way vehicular underpass near the Tirunagar-Palkalai Nagar Road, opposite the MKU.

“So, vehicles coming from Madurai city can pass through the underpass and take a right towards the MKU. Meanwhile, buses and other vehicles that are bound towards Theni can use the flyover. This will definitely help in reducing the accidents at this spot,” says a senior highways official.

This is a crucial highway which connects Madurai with Kochi through Usilampatti, Andipatti, Theni and Bodinayakanur. A large number of vehicles ply on this highway as it also leads to important tourists destinations, including the Vaigai dam, Thekkadi and Munnar.

According to a traffic census in December 2013, around 30,000 passenger car units (PCU) ply at this spot.

“The traffic flow peaks between November and June as a large number of buses ply on this highway during the Sabarimala season. After the completion of construction of AIIMS at Thoppur, the traffic flow is only expected to increase,” the official says.

The official adds that this location was identified as a black spot where accidents occur frequently. “According to the data, a total of nine fatal accidents have been recorded at this spot from 2016 to 2019. However, it is important to note that many of the accidents often go unreported,” the official says.

M. Sivan Kalai, an autorickshaw driver near MKU, recalls an accident in front of MKU a couple of years back, which claimed the lives of a father and daughter. “The duo, who were travelling on a two-wheeler, were hit by a speeding bus and they died on spot. A year back, a woman who tried to cross the road, also succumbed to injuries after she was hit by a speeding bus,” he says.

Accidents are a common sight here, says S. Rajkumar, a resident of Vadapalanji village. “It is usually the pedestrians and two-wheelers which get hit by speeding vehicles. For many years, the residents of around 10 villages near Vadapalanji come to the highway everyday to catch a bus. It is frightening to see hundreds of school children crossing the highway everyday to catch a bus,” he says.

There have also been instances where cattle heads have been thumped, he adds.

The main problem is because of the high speed at which vehicles ply on this highway,” says Mr. Sivan Kalai. “Many private buses ply towards Kerala travel at a very high speed, beyond acceptable limits, especially during night time,” he says.

Hence, the construction of the flyover, a long-time demand of the MKU administration, will help in easing the situation to a great extent, says the Vice-Chancellor M. Krishnan. “Around 2,000 students are studying at MKU and the administration has been demanding for the construction of a flyover here for the past five years. With the presence of State Bank of India and a co-operative store opposite to MKU, a hundreds of students cross this dangerous stretch every day. A large number of students are expected to use the railway station opposite to MKU after the commissioning of trains between Madurai and Usilampatti. Hence, this flyover is a welcome step,” he says.

The highways official says that the height of the median is being increased to three feet to ensure that pedestrians do not cross the stretch and avoid encountering speeding vehicles.

Although speedbreakers have been placed in front of the MKU, a considerable number of accidents occurs due to lack of reflectors and white markings, says a shopkeeper near MKU.

“Many vehicles, especially during night time, hit the speed breakers at a high speed, leading to accidents. A speed breaker which was laid recently, opposite MKU near Tirunagar- Palkalai Nagar Road, also has the same problem. This issues have to be addressed at the earliest,” he says.

Mr. Rajkumar adds that many accidents have been occurring recently after one lane opposite MKU was closed for traffic. “With a single lane of road used for two-way traffic, a lot of accidents have happened in the past one month. Hence, work has to be completed at a faster pace,” he adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/urk0n6/article30974113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA04CITY-MKU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/flyover-being-built-near-mku-to-reduce-accidents/article30974114.ece

355,2020/03/03,Security infrastructure at Thoothukudi airport enhanced,"Two modern equipment for rescue operation commissioned

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has introduced in Thoothukudi airport two imported equipment to be used during rescue operations and demonstrated its efficacy during the fire-fighting and rescue operations drill as part of the Aerodrome Committee Meeting held recently.

With the objective of ensuring adequate preparedness and instantaneous response to encounter the unlawful interferences in civil aviation and enhancement of security aspects, AAI conducted the drill during the meeting.

Fire-fighting and rescue operations were showcased in the presence of Airport Director N. Subramanian by AFS Team, Thoothukudi, where two most advanced equipment being used in search and rescue operations namely hand-held Human Life Detector Equipment and Victim Identification And Breaching System grabbed the attention of the participants.

Imported from Austria, the ₹32 lakh-worth Human Life Detector Equipment is a passive electronic sensor that detects the electric field created by a beating human heart, even through barriers. A patented filter eliminates all but the unique ultra-low frequency (ULF), human electric field. Since it detects only living humans, this equipment is immune to false alarms caused by animals, heat, vibration or noise.

This most advanced equipment is capable of detecting and tracking a standing adult from 500 meters in the open air and at shorter distances through concrete walls, steel bulkheads, brick, earthworks, plastics, heavy foliage, underwater, and most other barriers.

“It is an advanced instrument that requires some training to operate. It utilises no hazardous materials, has no known practical countermeasures and emits no radiation, with the exception of an optional, low-energy, eye-safe laser pointer,” said the officials.

Fabricated in Japan, the second equipment is Victim Identification And Breaching System, costing about ₹7.50 lakh, which allows rescue personnel to locate victims trapped in confined spaces and collapsed structures with integrated small camera head and audio sensor system. The entire video and audio components are integrated in this system in order to make search and rescue operation simple and effective.

This system is an all-in-one unit which requires one or two operators. The camera head, display and audio system can be separated and assembled even under most demanding conditions.

The newly procured two portable shelter with the size 10 ft X 20 ft X 7 ft at a cost of ₹9 lakh, which can be used for collecting causality and provide first-aid at a disaster-hit area was also displayed.

359,2020/03/03,New technology used to fill up potholes in Virudhunagar,"Rotary Club of Virudhunagar has come forward to fill potholes on a small stretch of the Old Aruppukottai Road using a new technology.

“We have taken up this as an experiment on some 200 metres using quick setting binder,” said club president R. Rengasamy. The work that started on Monday would be completed shortly.

Mr. Rengasamy said that usually concrete mixture, including cement, is used for filling potholes. “It takes lot of time to set and hence requires traffic block on those stretches for at least two days,” he added. However, under the new technology, no water is required to mix the binder. Besides, even heavy vehicles can be operated on those stretches within an hour, he pointed out.

Explaining the technology, a mechanical engineer, R.V. Ramani, of Chennai, said that the binder had no cement or water in it. “It is made of flyash and waste from various industrial units,” he said. Stating that this technology was first tried in Chennai after the 2016 floods to fill up potholes, he said the technology was very popular in the US.

Mr. Rengasamy said that the club would be spending around ₹50,000 on the pilot work. “If this proves successful, we will try to fill up the potholes in other roads in the town also,” he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/new-technology-used-to-fill-up-potholes-in-virudhunagar/article30973876.ece

Assistant Solicitor General V. Kathirvelu informed that court that he will get instructions from the Centre with regard to the release of funds to the school and sought time.

The court was hearing a public interest litigation petition filed by M. Muthuselvam of Madurai, a law student. He said that the schools might closed down if the Centre did not release the funds. The petitioner pointed out that the Harijan Sevak Sangh was founded by Mahatma Gandhi in 1932 with the main objective of eradicating untouchability and working for the uplift of the Scheduled Caste community and the downtrodden.

However, no funds had been released to N.M.R. Subbaraman Memorial Residential Primary School in Madurai and a similar residential middle school in Kallakurichi district.

Right to Education was a fundamental right guaranteed under the Constitution and the Centre was duty bound to release the funds for effective functioning of the schools, he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/non-release-of-funds-for-harijan-sevak-sangh-schools-court-seeks-centres-response/article30971242.ece

Unable to cope with the death of his wife, a 42- year- old man, R. Sundar, died by suicide after killing his two sons near Alanganallur on Monday night. Police said Sundar had consumed food laced with pesticide, which he had fed his sons Sunil, 13 and Vimal, 9.

Sundar’s wife Indumathi had died due to ill health, a few months ago. Since then, Sundar had been dejected and also struggled to look after his children.

364,2020/03/03,CBSE class 12 students find physics paper lengthy and tough,"Like students from Thiruvananthapuram, CBSE class 12 students from Mangaluru and other parts of Karnataka too found the physics paper on Monday lengthy and tough.

A majority of them had the grouse mainly on the lengthy type 20 “multiple choice questions” (MCQ) for one mark each. “These were of high order thinking type questions where answers had to be derived after following a few steps. Slow learners found this tough,” said principal of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Mudipu, V. Srinivasan, who teaches physics.

Not just the MCQ questions, Mr. Srinivasan said questions for the three and five marks were also lengthy. “The CBSE has laid down the blue print for question paper that has a combination of easy, average and difficult questions. This pattern is missing in the question paper as there are more number of difficult questions,” he said.

This year, the pattern of the question paper was changed to include MCQs. Manohar, physics teacher from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Mysuru, said they set question papers based on the CBSE’s model question papers to prepare for the new pattern. “The questions that we saw yesterday were not as per the pattern followed in model question paper,” he said.

Ashok Pujar, physics teacher from Javahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, Bengaluru, said the MCQ questions given were of the standard that is seen in NEET and JEE examinations. “Only those who had deeper understanding of the subject could solve it,” he said.

Physics teacher from JNV, Madikeri, J. Suresh, said several students were in tears after the examination. Vinayak, Vice-Principal from Sharada Vidyaniketan, Mangaluru, said his students found the paper “average”.

Mr. Pujar said the difficulty level of the physics paper given in the southern States is at a higher level compared the ones in North India. “We are giving our feedback to the CBSE for it to take considerate view during the evaluation in the interest of students,” he said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/cbse-class-12-students-find-physics-paper-lengthy-and-tough/article30975776.ece

367,2020/03/03,Work on Abbakka Bhavan expected to begin this year,"Foundation stone was laid nearly six years ago

Nearly six years after laying the foundation stone, work on the construction of Abbakka Bhavan is expected to start near Thokkottu this year. The construction of the bhavan was among the projects related to Rani Abbakka which are pending to be taken up in Dakshina Kannada.

The bhavan is estimated to cost ₹8 crore. According to Kota Srinivasa Poojary, Minister in charge of Dakshina Kannada, the work will start shortly.

The demand for the bhavan was made by the Veerarani Abbakka Utsava Samiti, which started organising the Abbakka Utsava in Ullal from 1997 by collecting funds from people. The samiti held the utsava by collecting donations till 2010 and the State government started allotting funds for the annual event later.

Then Chief Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda initially released ₹2 crore for the bhavan and ₹5 crore was released at the time of laying the foundation stone for it in June 2014. In addition, the government gave ₹1 crore later.

The three-storey bhavan will come up on about 0.4 acres of land, which includes the 20 cents of land originally earmarked for the construction of Gadi Bhavan for cultural activities in border areas.

The bhavan will have an auditorium to accommodate about 1,000 persons on the upper ground floor, while parking for vehicles will be in the basement. The lower ground floor will have a dining hall. A small auditorium and Abbakka Museum have been proposed on the first floor.

Following administrative approval by the State government, the Karnataka Housing Board (KHB) has now been asked by the government to submit a plan of the project.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/work-on-abbakka-bhavan-expected-to-begin-this-year/article30966547.ece

Both the Union and the State governments should take it seriously to protect the interests of arecanut growers and to provide stability in the market,” the association resolved in its meeting on Sunday.

President of the association Ashok Kinila and general secretary Mahesh Puchchappady led the meeting.

Mr. Puchchappady said in a release that such rumours would destabilise the market and bring down the prices of the commodity significantly.

He said that small and marginal arecanut farmers mainly depended on the produce for their livelihood. The rumours would directly hit them when prices crashed. Earlier on some occasions the prices crashed by ₹30 a kg. The general secretary said that value-added products of arecanut have good potential for marketing. For example, areca tea manufactured by an entrepreneur from Shivamogga district has a market abroad.

If arecanut would have been bad for health it would not have made foray into the markets abroad in the form of its value added products, he said. Mr. Puchchappady said that the meeting also decided to conduct an awareness programme on the quality standards for the commodity and the steps to follow to achieve that.

The general secretary said that the meeting urged the grower members to be transparent in their transactions with arecanut traders, and asked them not to avoid tax at any cost.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/quell-rumours-on-health-hazards-say-areca-growers/article30966536.ece

370,2020/03/03,"‘Siddi children will be affected if others are given admissions in their schools, hostels’","Interests of children from the Siddi community will be compromised if children from other Scheduled Castes and other Scheduled Tribes communities are admitted in schools and hostels meant exclusively for children from the Siddi community in Uttara Kannada, according to Diego Bastav Siddi, convenor of All Karnataka Siddi Vikasa Sangha.

Talking to The Hindu on the sidelines of a State-level environment conference at the Tree Park in Tannirbhavi here on Sunday, Mr. Siddi said that the then Social Welfare Minister H. Anjaneya, after staying in a Siddi colony, announced in January 2016 the setting up of five hostels for Siddi community students in Haliyal in Uttara Kannada. A grant of ₹ 20 crore was released.

“These buildings are now getting ready. Now, there is a move to admit other students in these hostels. This is unfair and we are opposed to this,” Mr. Siddi said and added that this will defeat the purpose of opening exclusive hostels as Siddi community students are being denied admission in other hostels. “We are not given the respect that we deserve,” he said.

Similarly, Morarji Desai Residential School in Banagiri in Haliyal, which was declared as an exclusive school for Siddis, was now admitting students from other Scheduled Tribes communities. “Out of a total 50 students in this hostel, only six are from our community,” he said and explained the difficulty being faced by Siddi community members living in remote areas in filing applications online for admission to these hostels and the residential school.

Mr. Siddi, who has been in the forefront in the fight for Siddi rights, welcomed the recent move of the Union government to include their community members from Dharwad and Belagavi districts in the Scheduled Tribes list. Siddis in Uttara Kannada were included in the Scheduled Tribes list in 2003. “We are eagerly waiting for Presidential assent,” he said.

There are 47,000 Siddis in Uttara Kannada, while 15,000 Siddis live in Khanapur of Belagavi district and in Kalghatgi of Dharwad district. “A good number of our children are now going to schools.

371,2020/03/03,"Many benefits, including nil maintenance cost, encourages driver to buy e-auto","Robert D’Souza says his running cost could come to ₹ 1,500 a month

A range of benefits, including the absence of noise and pollution, almost nil maintenance cost and cheaper fuel, has encouraged 54-year-old Robert D’Souza to opt for an electric autorickshaw thereby becoming the city’s first owner-cum-driver to drive an e-auto.

Eking a livelihood by driving an autorickshaw since 1992, Ullal resident D’Souza was attracted by an e-auto on a visit to Bengaluru last year. When he wanted to have one in Mangaluru, it was not available then. As soon as the vehicle landed at Karnataka Agency’s (authorised dealers of Mahindra & Mahindra) showroom in Mangaluru, he got a call a month ago.

As against ₹ 2.13 lakh for a conventional autorickshaw, Mr. D’Souza paid ₹ 2.9 lakh for the e-auto. “But I can recover the excess amount soon,” he said and added that the vehicle does not have many moving parts except the wheels. As such, there is no expenditure on oil and grease, etc. The battery has a three-year guarantee and another year’s of warranty.

Listing out the other benefits, Mr. D’Souza said that every charge that offers a 120-km ride, could consume six to eight units of power a day. His daily trips come to around 90 km. While he is yet to get power bills for the month, his counterpart in Udupi had told him that the bill was up by about ₹ 1,500 a month. This is quite encouraging when compared to the ₹ 10,000 a month — ₹ 9,000 for LPG and ₹ 1,000 for oil and grease — he spends on an LPG-driven autorickshaw, he said.

Passengers happy

He runs the service on the regular fares as authorised by the Regional Transport Authority. As the vehicle cruises through the lanes and by-lanes of the city noiselessly, passengers were happy and they never bargain on the fares. Many ask him to retain the change also, Mr. D’Souza said.

372,2020/03/03,Cut in Budgetary allocation will jeopardise tourism: House panel,"‘147.42 cr. shortfall due to broad cuts by Finance Ministry’

The Finance Ministry’s move to cut down the budgetary allocation for the Tourism Ministry in the upcoming financial year will ‘seriously jeopardise’ the targeted tourism outcomes during 2020-21, a Parliamentary panel has said in its report.

In the Union Budget 2020-21, the Tourism Ministry has witnessed a reduction in allocation of funds due to “broad budgetary cuts imposed by the Ministry of Finance”, and has been allocated ₹2,499.83 crore as against its projected demand of ₹2,647.25 crore, leading to a shortfall of ₹147.42 crore.

Noting that less allocation as compared to the projected demand was not unique to FY2020-21, the panel pointed out that against the projected demands of ₹4,320.42 crore and ₹4,612.18 crore for FY2018-19 and 2019-20, respectively, the Ministry of Finance provided ₹2,150.00 crore and ₹2,189.22 crore in budget estimates (BE) 2018-19 and BE 2019-20, which was further reduced to ₹2,113.48 crore and ₹1,416.00 crore as revised estimates (RE) 2018-19 and RE 2019-20 stages, respectively.

“The committee notes with dismay the huge mismatch between the projected demand for funds and actual allocations made for the Ministry of Tourism for the years 2018-19 and 2019-20 as well,” the report said.

The Parliamentary Panel also hit out at the ministry, stating that the pattern of shortfall in allocation of funds indicated that budgetary requirements were being projected by the ministry more on the basis of theoretical anticipation rather than on actual trend of requirement.

In its analyses of the Budget, the panel added that since development of tourism infrastructure was capital intensive, the budgetary allocation of ₹2,499.83 crore for the upcoming fiscal “was low” and it would be difficult for the Ministry to take up significant activities related to on-going infrastructure development with this budget.

The Ministry in its submission to the Committee has pointed out that the difference in the projection made by it and the allocation given is not high, and if additional funds are required, it would move the Ministry of Finance for additional allocation at the RE 2020-21 stage.

Stating that availability of adequate resources to the tourism sector is sine qua non for achieving the tourism growth as well as inclusive growth, the committee asked the Ministry of Tourism to bring the above recommendation to the notice of Ministry of Finance and also intimate the committee its response.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/6kz61f/article30975505.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THBUTOURISM,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/cut-in-budgetary-allocation-will-jeopardise-tourism-house-panel/article30975507.ece
373,2020/03/03,"Rural ATMs under recalibration for ₹200, ₹500 notes","Lower denomination notes more sought after than ₹2,000 note in these areas, says NCR’s MD

Automated teller machines (ATMs), mostly in rural areas, are being recalibrated to replace the cassettes for ₹2,000 bank notes with either those for ₹500 or ₹200.

This is because in such areas the demand for ₹2,000 bank note is not high while lower denomination notes are more sought after.

“It is more in the rural areas. There, people do not want ₹2,000 notes. Because it becomes difficult to change those notes. They generally prefer ₹100 and ₹200,” said Navroze Dastur, MD, NCR Corporation. NCR manages close to 1.1 lakh ATMs in the country.

There are a total 2.1 lakh bank-deployed ATMs in the country apart from about 30,000 white label ATMs.

“Not all the ATMs are replacing the ₹2,000-note cassette. It is being done strategically, depending on the requirement and the need of the location,” he said.

The average ticket size of ATM withdrawals is ₹4,000 to ₹4,500, slightly up from the ₹3,500 earlier.

According to Mr. Dastur, in the urban and metro locations, ATMs typically carry ₹2,000 notes. Bank branches in the urban areas also prefer putting ₹2,000 notes in their ATMs.

Mr. Dastur emphasised that it was a business decision that responded to the demand.

“In some urban areas also, if you do not see offtake of ₹2,000 notes as a business decision, you will replace the ₹2,000 with ₹500 or ₹200,” he added.

The ₹2,000 notes came into calculation after the demonetisation exercise of 2016 when ₹500 and ₹1,000 currency notes were withdrawn from the system.

According to RBI data, 3,291 million pieces of ₹2,000 notes were in circulation as at March 2019, which was roughly the same figure for the previous two years.

A recent report by RBI has showed that the country continues to have a strong bias for cash payments.

Cash withdrawals from ATMs have increased over the past five years and India is next only to China in terms of cash withdrawals from ATMs. However, the percentage of cash withdrawals to GDP has been constant in India at about 17%.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/article23601291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CASHCRUNCH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/rural-atms-under-recalibration-for-200-500-notes/article30975131.ece

The U.S Federal Reserve implemented on March 3 an emergency rate cut, responding to the growing economic risk caused by the coronavirus epidemic and giving President Donald Trump the stimulus he has called for.

Also read | Coronavirus infects global markets, investors exit equities | Coronavirus: Full coverage

In a unanimous decision, the Fed’s policy-setting committee cut its key interest rate by a half point to a range of 1.0-1.25.

The large, highly unusual cut, taken just 15 days before the next scheduled policy meeting, reflected growing concerns that the spreading virus will take a bite out of the U.S. and global economies, as supply chains linked to China, the epicentre of the outbreak, are shut down.

While U.S. economic fundamentals “remain strong”, the “coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity”, the Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement.

The central bank “is closely monitoring developments and their implications for the economic outlook and will use its tools and act as appropriate to support the economy”.

The Fed has not made an inter-meeting rate cut since late 2008, during the global financial crisis.

After the announcement, Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said the emergency interest rate cut will provide a “meaningful boost to the economy” in the face of the coronavirus epidemic.

But Mr. Powell said it is unclear how long the outbreak will last, acknowledging “a rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection, it won't fix a broken supply chain”.

“We get that. We don't think we have all the answers. But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy,” Mr. Powell told a press conference.

Stocks sell-off

Wall Street stocks tumbled in late-morning trading on March 3 after the Fed announcement.

Near 4.30 p.m. GMT (10 p.m. IST), the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 26,159.67, down nearly 550 points or 2%.

The broad-based S&P 500 slid 1.8% to 3,034.00, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index shed 1.6% to 8,805.92.

The adoption of electric cars will spread out only increase only when customer concerns around battery charging are fully removed, according to Martin Schwenk, MD, Managing Director & CEO, Mercedes-Benz India.

“People always have this fear of their cellphones running out of charge, they don’t want to do that with their cars as well,” he said. says Martin Schwenk, Managing Director & CEO, Mercedes-Benz India.

In an exclusive interaction, with The Hindu, he said, “The EV adoption will increase when cars of decent range are made available and also when the charging infrastructure is provided within 15 minutes of driving distance and not when they are 10 hours away.’’

“Electric cars are more expensive to produce and more expensive to sell, that’s on the production side. On the customer front, you can’t walk around with your cars like you do with your cellphones, he said.

Strong future for EVs

“However, for sure, I see a strong future for electric cars. There’s already a government push, but it will take time for customer demand to pick up. Until such time, the strongest option is diesel, which is more reliable, fuel efficient by 25% than petrol and it also leaves less carbon footprint compared with petrol engines,’’ he added.

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday approved the proposal of state-owned NBCC to acquire debt-ridden Jaypee Infratech through an insolvency process.

The Principal bench of NCLT headed by Acting President B.S.V. Prakash Kumar gave a go-ahead to the resolution plan of NBCC, which was already approved by the lenders of Jaypee Infratech in December last year.

The tribunal also modified the resolution plan and said ₹750 crore deposited by Jaiprakash Associates would be part of the plan.

The successful resolution will provide a big relief to over 20,000 homebuyers across various housing projects launched by Jaypee Infratech in Noida and Greater Noida (Uttar Pradesh).

NBCC has proposed to complete over 20,000 pending flats in the next three-and-a-half years.

Homebuyers’ claim amounting to ₹13,364 crore and lenders’ claim worth ₹9,783 crore have been admitted.

In its latest bid, NBCC offered 1,526 acres of land to lenders under a land-debt swap deal.

On Yamuna Expressway, NBCC has proposed to transfer the road asset to lenders but before that it would take a loan of around ₹2,500 crore against toll revenue to fund construction spend.

Tata Teleservices Ltd. and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd. said in a statement they had made the payment “in good faith and as a matter of abundant caution towards licence fee, spectrum usage charges and applicable interest, penalty and interest on penalty.”

The on-account payment is subject to reconciliation after the conclusion of the process of computation and verification being conducted by the DoT spanning a period beginning FY07 and spread across 20 circles. As per the DoT’s estimates, the Tata group’s statutory dues are about ₹14,000 crore.

Vodafone Idea is struggling to pay its estimated AGR-related dues of ₹53,000 crore and has, till now, paid about ₹3,500 crore.

The company has already cautioned that its ability to continue as a going concern would depend on a favourable outcome of its modification plea in the Supreme Court.

385,2020/03/03,Fishy claims about cows,"The S&T Ministry’s claims must be subject to scrutiny

Recently, the Science and Technology Ministry called for R&D proposals under the inter-ministerial programme SUTRA-PIC India (Scientific Utilization through Research Augmentation-Prime Products from Indigenous Cows). The programme calls for research proposals under five themes. Opening with the statement, “Indian cows are believed to process unique qualities and characteristics,” the document invites “systematic scientific investigation of uniqueness of pure indigenous Indian cows”.

Are indigenous cows unique?

Evolutionary biology tells us that multiple species can co-evolve and become highly suitable for each other. For instance, some humans are lactose intolerant. Lactose intolerance is a digestive disorder caused by the inability to digest lactose, a primary component of milk and dairy products. Studies have shown that people living in northern and western India are more tolerant to lactose compared to south Indians. As northern and western Indians have lived with cows for hundreds of years, breeding them and feeding on their products, they are able to digest milk better. This reasoning would hold for other domesticated animals too. The co-evolution argument holds good for all breeds of cow and their local human populations across the world.

Can cow urine and panchgavya (cow dung, urine, milk, curd, ghee) help treat cancer and other diseases?

The call invites applications for research on cowpathy — treatment based on products obtained from indigenous cow as used in ayurveda. It lists many illnesses for which it claims that ancient ayurvedic texts suggested pharmacological applications of products from indigenous cows. The listed diseases are those associated with exclusive symptoms such as psoriasis, eczema and diarrhoea as well as those without particular symptoms such as blood pressure (primary hypertension) and asymptomatic diabetes mellitus.

This at the outset strikes a jarring note. For one, many symptoms of high blood pressure such as giddiness may be attributed to other diseases. Hypertension cannot really be measured without a BP apparatus which came into being later. Experts in ayurveda acknowledge this.

“Ayurveda does not have a clear approach for the management of diseases that do not manifest symptoms. While it does deal with eczema or psoriasis, which have symptoms, it does not have a clear protocol for the management of primary hypertension and diabetes when it is asymptomatic,” says G.L. Krishna, a practising ayurvedic doctor from Bengaluru, who is interested in Vedanta and Vedic literature. “Further, cancer is a generic term used to describe a spectrum of diseases that result from abnormal cells that are rapidly proliferating. It is not a single disease. The concept of cell in Vedic times was still nascent. Therefore, it would be wrong to presume that ancient ayurvedic texts could have discussed a generic disease entity that results from abnormal cell proliferation,” he says.

Why is cow urine not exclusive?

Cow urine was used in ayurveda, but so was goat, camel and elephant urine. Ayurveda practioners use beers, wines and meat, even that of cows, for different medical preparations and conditions. (The Legacy of Vagbhata, M.S. Valiathan). While cow milk was generally preferred over goat’s milk, the latter was used to treat tuberculosis.

Rather than glorify cow excreta and urine, a more scientifically valid enterprise would be to have the Ministry of Ayush undertake a serious review of ayurvedic texts and subject them to a scientific scrutiny. Many concepts may get falsified, but a true science should not be afraid of falsification. And, as Dr. Krishna says, “A strict scientific attitude and a sympathy with traditional systems are both required in approaching our ancient medical classics. An approach bereft of the former leads to pseudoscience masquerading as traditional wisdom while that bereft of the latter leads to a hasty undermining of valuable medical experience.”",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/k8at0f/article30966570.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IndianCows,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/fishy-claims-about-cows/article30966555.ece
386,2020/03/03,Return to chaos in Afghanistan?,"An intra-Afghan dialogue should have preceded the Doha deal

The U.S.-Taliban deal in Doha will probably lead to another civil war in Afghanistan, instead of a lasting peace. The deal should have followed an intra-Afghan dialogue between President Ashraf Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. Instead, it expects that an intra-Afghan dialogue will follow, leading to peace and stability. An intra-Afghan dialogue has been elusive since the establishment of the Afghan High Peace Council in 2010 by then President Hamid Karzai.

Also listen: Breaking down the U.S-Taliban peace deal | The Hindu In Focus Podcast

At the most, the Doha deal is likely to provide a face-saving exit for the U.S. and an electoral trump card for U.S. President Donald Trump. It will also legitimise the Taliban as a political actor in Afghanistan.

The beneficiaries

President Trump desperately wanted to seal this deal. His primary objective is not to ensure stability in Afghanistan by making the Taliban a stakeholder in any future political framework; instead, it is domestic. Mr. Trump wants to be seen as the deal-maker who brought American troops back home and ended the longest U.S. war. And he wants this before the U.S. presidential election.

The second objective of the U.S. is a face-saving exit from Afghanistan. The focus of the deal is on the Taliban severing its links with other international terror groups such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS). Mr. Trump can sell the deal to his domestic audience by stating that American troops can return home as the Taliban will not support any other international terrorist groups in Afghanistan. After all, the U.S. troops entered Afghanistan to neutralise al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden after 9/11.

Undoubtedly, the biggest beneficiary of the Doha deal is the Taliban. First, the deal legitimises the Taliban as the primary actor in deciding the future of Afghanistan. The Taliban has been waiting for this moment, waiting for this deal. It was fully aware that the U.S. troops would not stay on indefinitely in Afghanistan. Perhaps, the Taliban’s advisers also knew how desperate Mr. Trump would become and therefore decided to play the strategy of ‘hit and wait’. The Taliban increased the intensity of violence in the last few years, without breaking off negotiations with the U.S. It never agreed to a ceasefire; even when the proposed deal in 2019 was cancelled in the last minute by President Trump, it continued with this strategy.

The Taliban also did not yield to the intra-Afghan dialogue proposal by the U.S. It consistently stated that it does not recognise the elected government in Kabul led by Mr. Ghani. It continued targeting the Afghan security forces making 2018-19 one of the most violent years in recent Afghan history. The Taliban has also been consistent with another position — that any dialogue within Afghanistan will take place only after the foreign troops leave.

The Taliban leadership will be smiling now as they have not yielded to any of the American demands. True, they have agreed not to support al-Qaeda and the IS, but there is no al-Qaeda today in Afghanistan. Moreover, the Taliban is fighting the IS internally. Hence, yielding to this American demand will not affect its position in Afghanistan.

The Taliban will wait and watch the American troops draw down further in the next three months. It may not target them but it will continue fighting the Afghan security forces. The U.S. will watch this drama and perhaps use it as a strategy to retain a residue force. It could do this to watch Iran. This would be acceptable to the Taliban.

An intra-Afghan dialogue

The deal may talk about an intra-Afghan dialogue, but is the Taliban interested in it? The Taliban’s objective would be to capture Kabul, and not share power there with anyone. An intra-Afghan dialogue should have preceded the Doha deal. The Taliban never wanted to negotiate with Kabul. Had it wanted to, such a negotiation would have taken place earlier. After all, the Afghan High Peace Council was established with the same purpose. The Taliban targeted many of the Afghan High Peace Council members, including the chairman of the Council, Burhanuddin Rabbani, in 2011. The Taliban will probably scuttle any attempt towards an intra-Afghan dialogue. Even if it agrees to a dialogue, it may use some pretext or the other to walk away from it — for example, the prisoner swap clause in the Doha deal (which would see the government release 5,000 Taliban prisoners and the Taliban release 1,000 captives), which President Ghani says his government never agreed to. Hence, a principal objective of the deal would be a non-starter.

Finally, the deal came at the wrong time. Kabul remains deeply divided. Instead of ushering in political stability, the 2019 elections situated Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah in opposite camps. Both have declared victory and both have announced formation of their own governments. The U.S. should have brought both the leaders on a common platform and negotiated a deal, as it did after the presidential election in 2014. As a result, a national unity government was formed with Mr. Ghani as the President and Mr. Abdullah as the Chief Executive.

However, this time, neither did Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, pursue a serious strategy nor did President Trump have the patience to negotiate with two regional satraps, far away from Washington. Instead, they decided to deal with the Taliban and leave Kabul to its own fate.

To be fair to Mr. Trump and Mr. Khalilzad, Mr. Abdullah and Mr. Ghani should have realised the futility of their internal divide. Perhaps, both saw it as part of their final push to have their authority stamped on Kabul. That move backfired. Now they have to face the onslaught of the Taliban either individually or together.

The question now is not whether there will be another civil war in Afghanistan, but when. With the divide between Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah in Kabul, any announcement on government formation is likely to increase the fault lines in the bureaucracy and the Afghan security forces. This is what the Taliban is probably expecting. Instead of engaging in any internal dialogue, the Taliban will attempt to impose itself on Kabul and the rest of Afghanistan.

The Afghan security forces may not collapse in the immediate withdrawal; they will fight back. The Taliban will want to capture the cities one after another, as it did in the 1990s. The Afghan security forces will try to prevent this from happening. All this will probably lead to what the majority of the Afghans want to avoid — a return to chaos.

387,2020/03/03,A tragic pattern of inaction,"The police, the government and the courts have been found wanting amidst another outbreak of communal violence

While the chemistry between U.S. President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi was making waves, Delhi was burning. The choreographed celebration in welcoming the President also witnessed an equally choreographed “celebration of violence”. Though the whys and wherefores of this violence are not far to seek, one fact stands out. The vicious polarisation which led to this violence happened in five of the eight seats the BJP won in the Delhi Assembly election, in north-east Delhi, where thugs ran riot. For such an event to happen under the watchful eye of a no-nonsense Home Minister speaks volumes of the complicit behaviour of several stakeholders. The Home Minister was absent while the troubleshooters were on the rampage. The Chief Minister was offering prayers and chose not to meet people who sought action. As for the Prime Minister, his swift response after 69 hours of silence was an appeal to “our brothers and sisters” to “keep calm”.

The images that were seen on social media networks will be etched in our memory for a long time to come. That policemen were seen breaking CCTV cameras to ensure that there would be no footage to rely upon while acts of violence were committed under their gaze speaks volumes of the communal virus that has crept into some elements of our police force. The image of the police goading the injured belonging to a particular community to sing the national anthem is a sign of not just police excess, but also of institutional bias. There are also recordings of calls made by scared residents to police stations and getting rebuffed.

Complicity of police

One must ask whether the complicity of certain elements of the police force represented individual responses or there were ‘instructions from above’ that resulted in wanton dereliction of duty. The fact that in the course of this violence, the police were hardly seen protecting lives and property demonstrates that the police as bystanders watched nonchalantly the decimation of our social fabric. I dare say that this is not the first time we have witnessed the police collaborating with perpetrators of violence. It has happened earlier and, in more recent times, we have seen it happening in Uttar Pradesh.

The response of the government was no less disappointing. When Ministers of the ruling establishment and those belonging to the party in power brazenly stoke communal sentiments, the outcome is not surprising. While the Election Commission chose to place an embargo on some of those who spoke to polarise, it also chose not to register FIRs. The words uttered in the course of such speeches are actionable. Section 153A of the Indian Penal Code makes it an offence if by words, spoken or otherwise, attempts are made to promote, on grounds of religion, disharmony, feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religions, or acts are committed which are prejudicial to maintenance of harmony between different religions — such activity can be met with imprisonment up to three years. The motivation and intent of those utterances could not be doubted. Yet, the Home Minister, the Commissioner of Police and the entire police force chose to turn a blind eye.

Are we then to believe that the government and the police force were acting in tandem? If true — and the pattern seems to be replicated from time to time in various parts of the country — the seriousness of the situation cannot just be brushed aside.

Judiciary did not act

The judiciary has also not responded with alacrity and the kind of sensitivity expected of it. There was a time when it would have suo motu taken up the issue and ensured that engineered violence of this kind was dealt with expeditiously. In an age when the social media is replete with images that act as evidence, the courts could easily have taken up the matter, asked for a response overnight and ensured that possible acts of violence were nipped in the bud. Nothing prevented the judiciary from suo motu taking action for the kind of speeches that were made with the intent to incite.

When the executive is aware that the judiciary is ready to protect our citizens, it will hesitate to let things slide. But if judges who seek accountability are transferred in the midst of a hearing, the executive will be emboldened. The arrogance of the executive must never be allowed to come in the way of protecting the lives of our people.

One silver lining in this saga of despair is the fact that there are stories of communities protecting each other. This only shows that the common man wants peace and the social fabric of this country has not yet fallen apart. The scars and wounds perpetrated by violence need a healing touch. Those who have fallen from grace must pause and reflect.

388,2020/03/03,Pushing the wrong energy buttons,"The idea of India importing nuclear reactors is a zombie one with serious concerns about their cost and safety

For more than a decade, no major meeting between an Indian Prime Minister and a U.S. President has passed without a ritual reference to India’s promise made in 2008 to purchase American nuclear reactors. This was the case in the latest joint statement issued during U.S. President Donald Trump’s first official two-day visit to India (February 24-25), which stated that “Prime Minister Modi and President Trump encouraged the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited and Westinghouse Electric Company to finalize the techno-commercial offer for the construction of six nuclear reactors in India at the earliest date”.

Red flags in the U.S. deal

Because of serious concerns about cost and safety, the two organisations should have been told to abandon, not finalise, the proposal.

Indeed, it has been clear for years that electricity from American reactors would be more expensive than competing sources of energy. Moreover, nuclear reactors can undergo serious accidents, as shown by the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Westinghouse has insisted on a prior assurance that India would not hold it responsible for the consequences of a nuclear disaster, which is effectively an admission that it is unable to guarantee the safety of its reactors.

The main beneficiaries from India’s import of reactors would be Westinghouse and India’s atomic energy establishment that is struggling to retain its relevance given the rapid growth of renewables. But Mr. Trump has reasons to press for the sale too. His re-election campaign for the U.S. presidential election in November, centrally involves the revival of U.S. manufacturing and he has been lobbied by several nuclear reactor vendors, including Westinghouse, reportedly to “highlight the role U.S. nuclear developers can play in providing power to other countries”. Finally, he also has a conflict-of-interest, thanks to his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, who accompanied him during the India visit.

In 2018, the Kushner family’s real-estate business was bailed out by a Canadian company that invested at least $1.1-billion in a highly unprofitable building in New York. Earlier that year, Brookfield Business Partners, a subsidiary of that Canadian company, acquired Westinghouse Electric Company. It violates all norms of propriety for Mr. Kushner to be anywhere near a multi-billion dollar sale that would profit Brookfield enormously.

What renewables can offer

Analysts estimate that each of the two AP1000 units being constructed in the U.S. state of Georgia may cost about $13.8 billion. At these rates, the six reactors being offered to India by Westinghouse would cost almost ₹6 lakh crore. If India purchases these reactors, the economic burden will fall upon consumers and taxpayers. In 2013, we estimated that even after reducing these prices by 30%, to account for lower construction costs in India, the first year tariff for electricity would be about ₹25 per unit. On the other hand, recent solar energy bids in India are around ₹3 per unit. Lazard, the Wall Street firm, estimates that wind and solar energy costs have declined by around 70% to 90% in just the last 10 years and may decline further in the future.

How safe?

Nuclear power can also impose long-term costs. Large areas continue to be contaminated with radioactive materials from the 1986 Chernobyl accident and thousands of square kilometres remain closed off for human inhabitation. Nearly a decade after the 2011 disaster, the Fukushima prefecture retains radioactive hotspots and the cost of clean-up has been variously estimated to range from $200-billion to over $600-billion.

The Fukushima accident was partly caused by weaknesses in the General Electric company’s Mark I nuclear reactor design. But that company paid nothing towards clean-up costs, or as compensation to the victims, due to an indemnity clause in Japanese law. Westinghouse wants a similar arrangement with India. Although the Indian liability law is heavily skewed towards manufacturers, it still does not completely indemnify them. So nuclear vendors have tried to chip away at the law. Instead of resisting foreign suppliers, the Indian government has tacitly supported this process.

Starting with the Tarapur 1 and 2 reactors, in Maharashtra, India’s experiences with imported reactors have been poor. The Kudankulam 1 and 2 reactors, in Tamil Nadu, the only ones to have been imported and commissioned in the last decade, have been repeatedly shut down. In 2018-19, these reactors produced just 32% and 38%, respectively, of the electricity they were designed to produce. These difficulties are illustrative of the dismal history of India’s nuclear establishment. In spite of its tall claims, the fraction of electricity generated by nuclear power in India has remained stagnant at about 3% for decades.

The idea of importing nuclear reactors is a “zombie idea” that, from a rational viewpoint, should have been dead long ago. In fact an earlier plan to install AP1000s in Mithi Virdi, Gujarat was cancelled because of strong local opposition. In 2018, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani declared that the reactors “will never come up” in Gujarat. The Prime Minister should take a cue from his own State and make a similar announcement for the rest of the country.

389,2020/03/03,Safeguard undermined: sedition charges on Kanhaiya Kumar,"Delhi govt.’s policy decision to grant sanction to prosecute in all cases is questionable

The law on granting sanction for prosecution imposes a duty on the government concerned to apply its mind to the facts of each case and render a decision based on its assessment whether, prime facie, a case has been made out. The process cannot be based on a uniform policy. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) regime’s justification that it cleared the prosecution of former JNU students’ union leader Kanhaiya Kumar and others on charges of sedition and conspiracy because it adopts a policy of non-interference in judicial matters is completely unacceptable. Superior courts have repeatedly stressed that giving sanction is not a mechanical process, but requires application of mind. The government is required to decide whether there is enough material to conclude that the speech or slogans had a tendency to create public disorder or contained incitement to violence. The prior sanction norm is a vital procedural safeguard against frivolous prosecution. The sanction requirement has seen criticism only in corruption cases, as the power could be used to shield corrupt public servants. However, the sanction contemplated by Section 196 of the CrPC, for “offences against the state” in the Indian Penal Code, as well as “conspiracy” to commit them, is different. Such sanction is also needed for Section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups) and Section 295A (malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings). The reason is that a police officer’s understanding of the offence should be subject to the government’s scrutiny so that these provisions are not unlawfully used against free speech.

Also Read: Kanhaiya will come out unscathed: CPI

In reducing its role to a policy that only the judiciary can decide the case on merits, the Delhi government has done a disservice to those charged with the serious offence under Section 124A. Mr. Kumar and nine others were booked for allegedly supporting “seditious” slogans raised during an event at JNU on February 9, 2016. The Delhi police filed a charge sheet in January 2019. There was criticism from the ruling BJP that the AAP government was delaying the grant of sanction. There was a court deadline for the regime to give its decision. However, this did not mean that it was asked to accord sanction mechanically. After video footage purportedly showing the students raising “anti-India” slogans was found to be doctored, one would have thought the NCT government would be wary of endorsing the police claim. Moreover, the decision goes against the emerging body of opinion that the sedition provision needs to be revisited, if not scrapped altogether. The political narrative behind the belated grant of sanction may be that Mr. Kejriwal and his party might not want to concede the nationalistic space entirely to the BJP. What is of greater concern is that its action may end up legitimising the imaginary construct that these students and their supporters constitute a ‘tukde tukde’ gang bent on breaking up the country.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/safeguard-undermined-sedition-charges-on-kanhaiya-kumar/article30965449.ece
390,2020/03/03,Bottom or mirage?: On NSO estimates of GDP growth,"While data revisions have lifted first-half growth, actual numbers reveal a softening

Official estimates of gross domestic product for the fiscal third quarter have pegged growth in the festival demand-filled October-December period at 4.7%, a distinct slowdown from the revised year-earlier and preceding quarters’ 5.6% and 5.1% paces respectively. Manufacturing, which contributes just under a fifth to gross value added (GVA), was the biggest drag posting a 0.2% decline and extending the sector’s contraction into a second straight quarter. Output at electricity and allied utility services also shrank 0.7%, reflecting lack of demand from becalmed factories. And activity in construction, a generator of orders for goods from cement to steel, softened worryingly to a 0.3% expansion, prolonging the industry’s slowdown for a third consecutive quarter. However, agriculture and the three largest services sectors, including public administration and defence, shored up overall GVA, with farm output expanding by 3.5% and the government-centred services growing by 9.7%, according to NSO estimates. The Centre was quick to assert that the economy appeared to have “bottomed out”, with the Economic Affairs Secretary citing an improvement in output at the eight core industries as an uptick in momentum. To be sure, overall growth at the eight industries that include coal, refinery products, steel, cement and electricity averaged 2.2% in January, propelled by an 8% increase in coal production. And the survey-based IHS Markit India Manufacturing PMI for February pointed to an improvement in manufacturing, clearly a positive augury.

Still, a closer look at the actual numbers for private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) and gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) — key components of GDP — across the three quarters belies hope that the economy is out of the woods. While a downward revision of data for 2018-19 have lent a statistical boost of 0.6 percentage point to the first and second quarter GDP growth estimates, disconcertingly the second-quarter PFCE and GFCF figures have been revised downward from what was projected earlier. And of concern is the second successive contraction in capital formation. GFCF shrank 5.2% in the third quarter, after declining 4.1% over July-September, signalling that investment activity is just not recovering, the government’s corporate tax cuts notwithstanding. Consumption spending too remains palpably soft with the pace of growth for all three quarters lagging the year-earlier levels even after the revision. With automobile sales still floundering, the RBI’s consumer confidence survey pointing to a fall in non-essential consumption and the coronavirus outbreak’s impact on global demand yet to be factored in, the bottom may still be some distance away.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bottom-or-mirage-on-nso-estimates-of-gdp-growth/article30965450.ece
391,2020/03/03,Fire drill demonstration by KIA’s women firefighters,"Of the 279 firefighters in the Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting team, 14 are women

A squad of 14 women firefighters carried out a live drill at Kempegowda International Airport on Tuesday ahead of International Women's Day on March 8. The women members have completed one year in the Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) team.

Members hail from various parts of Karnataka. Many, like Priyadarshini from Jevargi taluk in Kalaburgi district, come from a family of farmers.

“I have a diploma in aeronautical engineering. Last year, through WhatsApp, I got to know about the vacancy in the ARFF department. I did not have any idea about the job. So I did an online search for more details. After I applied, I underwent a physical and a written test in Mysuru,” she said.

She cleared several rounds of interviews and underwent training at the Airports Authority of India Fire Service Training Centre in Kolkata for four months. “I feel very happy to work as a firefighter. This is a big opportunity for me in a male dominated field. At first, my family had some inhibitions about me joining ARFF, as it also involves risk but later, they encouraged me a lot,” she added.

Another firefighter, Suma from Devanahalli, admitted that the training course was so rigorous that she thought of quitting. “But all of us decided to stay firm. Now, everyone praises us for our achievement. They say we are role models for other women.”

They have good reason to be proud. Of the 279 firefighters in the ARFF team, only 14 are women.

According to Selvaraj Arumugam, head of ARFF, as per the parameters, the firefighters can reach the end of the runway within two minutes to attend to emergencies, and three minutes to reach any other area where an aircraft is taxiing. “The ARFF team has undergone training in hazard mitigation, evacuation and rescue of passengers during emergencies.”

As the women get more experience, they will move on to the next level where they will be handling other responsibilities that include driving fire tender trucks.

When asked whether more women would be recruited, he said. “As of now, we have sufficient number of firefighters to handle the parallel runways. When these firefighters go to the next level, designation or any vacancy arises, we may go for further recruitment.”

Tankers

BIAL has inducted eight Austrian-made Rosenbauer Panther tankers to attend to emergencies. A release states that these tankers can touch a maximum speed of 120 kmph. Weighing nearly 40 tonnes, the trucks can go from 0 to 80 kmph in 25 seconds. The pumps have a discharge rate of 7000 lpm, with a water tank capacity of 12,500 litres and foam tank capacity of 1,500 litres, read the release.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/q46ae6/article30975711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGFIREDRILLATKIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/fire-drill-demonstration-by-kias-women-firefighters/article30975715.ece
392,2020/03/03,Gazette notification on delimitation of wards issued,"Though number of wards remain 198, Assembly segments in outer zones have more wards than those in core city

The State government has issued a gazette notification on the delimitation of wards coming under the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

While the number of wards will remain 198, some Assembly segments in the core city stand to lose some wards. The number of wards in a few segments in the outer zones has increased along the lines of the population growth.

This development has not gone down well with certain councillors. Former mayor Gangambike Mallikarjun, who represents Jayanagar ward coming under Chikpete constituency, pointed out that in the draft gazette notification, her ward does not exist. “Areas that used to come under my ward have been distributed to three neighbouring wards,” she said.

Opposition Leader Abdul Wajid claimed that the area of some wards in the core areas had been extended, including Manorayanapalya ward under Hebbal Assembly segment, which he represents.

Several councillors, who spoke to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, said that the delimitation exercise was faulty and claimed that the same would be challenged in the High Court. “This is just a tactic to delay elections to the urban local body,” one of the councillors alleged.

Sources in the BBMP said that the draft gazette notification was issued just days ahead of the hearing of the petition filed in the High Court about the delimitation exercise and announcement of ward reservations. The petition, filed by the State Election Commission, is likely to come up for hearing this week.

BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar had earlier clarified that the delimitation was done on the basis of the 2011 census. As per the 2011 census, the average population in the city was around 84.43 lakh, as opposed to 54.40 lakh during the 2001 census. “This population was divided by 198 and the average population per ward came up to 42,650 (plus or minus). The population growth in the outer areas has been exponential, compared to that in the core areas,” the source explained.

Filing objections

Citizens may submit their objections to the draft notification by March 17. After hearing and scrutiny of all objections, the government will issue a final gazette notification, following which the ward reservations will be announced.

Objections have to be submitted in writing along with supporting documents. The objections may be submitted to the office of the Deputy Commissioner (Urban), behind Kandaya Bhavan, K.G. Road, Bengaluru 560009.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/gazette-notification-on-delimitation-of-wards-issued/article30975637.ece
393,2020/03/03,Citizens’ groups urge government to scrap elevated corridors proposal,"Concentrate on improving public transport, they say

A coalition of as many as 40 citizens’ groups have threatened to take to the streets if the State government goes ahead with the proposed network of elevated corridors, first mooted by the previous Congress-JDS government. They urged the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which had previously opposed the project but is now reportedly pushing for it after coming to power, to instead concentrate on improving public transport.

In an open letter to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, citizens’ groups have demanded cancellation of the proposed project and urged the government to provide better pavements, cycling lanes, signalled pedestrian crossings, and speeding up of the suburban rail project.

Vinay Srinivasa of the Bengaluru Bus Prayanikara Vedike (BBPV) urged the government to halve the fares of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) and procure 6,000 new buses. “For the BMTC to reduce fares, the government should release grants to cover operational and capital expenses. We urge the government to do so in the upcoming budget,” he said.

Tara Krishnaswamy of Citizens for Bengaluru (CfB) recalled the past protest against the elevated corridor, #TenderCancelMaadi, which saw the participation of more than 1,000 citizens. “All the plans and proposals for the elevated corridors project should immediately be cancelled, be it under private, public or public-private partnership model,” she said, while highlighting the need for a robust suburban rail network.

A representative from the Bangalore Environment Trust said that the proposal of elevated corridors is a problem and not a solution. “Such projects are party agnostic. It is surprising how, like a phoenix, they suddenly rise every now and then,” he said.

Commenting on the fact that people are already bearing the brunt of construction across the city, Zibi Jamal of Whitefield Rising said that by opting for elevated corridors, the government is incentivising private players and converting the city into a dust bowl.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/5ss7pe/article30975440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGMarchCitizencol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/citizens-groups-urge-government-to-scrap-elevated-corridors-proposal/article30975441.ece
394,2020/03/03,I was influenced by English cinema and absurd plays: Anant Nag,"Says they had a deep impact on his acting style

Multilingual actor Anant Nag, whose retrospective has been playing at the 12th edition of Bengaluru International Film festival (BIFFes), said that English cinema and modern absurd plays of the 1970s had a deep impact on his acting style.

“In my initial days in Mumbai, I started with three-act Konkani plays and did a lot of comedy, and slowly joined Satyadev Dubey, Girish Karnad and others who were doing modern, absurd plays. I was also seeing a lot of cinema, both Indian and English, which offered a contrast of acting styles. I consciously chose a realistic, subtle style for myself,” he said during a conversation with senior journalist and film critic Muralidhara Khajane on Tuesday.

“Many of the directors did not get that style and taught me something else during rehearsals, but once I took to stage, I performed only in my style, to which the directors were initially resistant. But as the audience responded well to my performance, I carved out a niche,” he said. “In the initial days of my film career in Kannada, after a short stint in Hindi cinema, directors used to ask me not to do ‘Bengali acting’,” he recounted.

Like so many of his contemporaries, including Naseeruddin Shah, Amol Palekar and Pankaj Kapur, would he consider returning to the stage?

“Girish Karnad recently asked me if I would play the role of Aliya Ramaraya in the production of his last play Rakshasa Tangadi. But I find theatre physically too tiring today. I don’t like to look back. I have adapted well to cinema, and am comfortable acting in cinema. An actor is the same either on stage or before the camera,” he said.

Talking of his stint in politics, he said he was disillusioned by the system which “does not allow you to do what you want to.”

He feels that he failed to make an impact in politics. “As a minister in the 1990s, I stopped acting for three-and-a-half years. But I realised that I was an actor and politics was not my cup of tea,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/4s2b1k/article30975398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGANANTNAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/i-was-influenced-by-english-cinema-and-absurd-plays-anant-nag/article30975399.ece

Days after the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) council passed a resolution prohibiting protests in front of Town Hall, councillors of the opposition Congress and Janata Dal (Secular) demanded the resolution be revoked. Unconvinced by Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar's response on the legality of the suo motu decision, they walked out of the council meeting on Tuesday.

Before the meeting, Congress party workers had staged a protest against the resolution at the BBMP head office, claiming that the civic body is curtailing citizens’ right to speech and right to assembly. A few party workers even gheraoed the Commissioner who was on his way to the council building.

During the council meeting, many councillors from the ruling BJP took objection to placards against the resolution placed in front of them. Mayor M. Goutham Kumar directed BBMP staff to remove the placards.

Councillors also demanded a response from the head of Legal Cell on the legality of the suo motu resolution. Several councillors from the ruling BJP, including Ruling Party Leader K.A. Muneendra Kumar, Kacharakanahalli councillor Padmanabha Reddy, Basavanagudi councillor B.S. Sathyanarayana claimed that revenue to the BBMP from Town Hall had reduced drastically, as no one is coming forward to book the space for events.

Padarayanapura councillor Imran Pasha from JD(S) alleged that the claims were untrue and pointed out that ₹45 lakh had been collected from Town Hall last year.

Opposition councillors later stormed the well and staged a sit-in. The protesting councillors remained in the well even after the meeting was adjourned briefly by the Mayor.

Mr. Anil Kumar stated that the suo motu resolution was taken up at his behest, following his discussions with Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao. “Apart from reduction in revenue, the protests in front of the historical landmark was impacting vehicular movement, especially of ambulances. Citizens can stage protests in front of the Gandhi statue at Maurya Circle and in Freedom Park,” he said.

400,2020/03/03,Metro to KIA: BMRCL gets major chunk of land on Ballari Road,"NHAI hands over 93,000 square metres from Hebbal to trumpet interchange

Namma Metro link to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) received a fillip as the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has finally taken possession of land from National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on Ballari Road.

The BMRCL has paid ₹340 crore to the NHAI to acquire 93,000 square metres from Hebbal to trumpet interchange (24 km) for an elevated metro line.

Chennappa Goudar, general manager for land acquisition and rehabilitation, BMRCL told The Hindu that land was handed over to the corporation last week. Under Phase II A and B, the BMRCL is building a 55-km line from Central Silk Board to KIA. The alignment goes via K.R. Puram, Nagawara and Hebbal.

Mr. Goudar said, “The NHAI had acquired the land a decade ago after paying compensation to the property owners. These properties are located on the right side of the highway from Hebbal. The BMRCL has paid ₹340 crore to the NHAI as compensation that includes interest for all these years. The land was acquired after a joint survey. However, we need additional land to build stations at various points on the National Highway. The land acquisition process is under way.”

The NHAI had initially acquired land along the National Highway as per a request of the State government to build a high speed rail network from M.G. Road to KIA via Hebbal. In 2010-11, the NHAI had acquired land identified while widening and building an expressway. Later, the government took a decision to shelve the high speed rail link project and asked the BMRCL to come out with a plan to build a metro line to the airport. After years of planning, the BMRCL decided to extend the ORR line from K.R. Puram to the airport. In January 2019, the State Cabinet approved the plan with an estimated cost of ₹10,584 crore.

More land required

The BMRCL requires over ₹2,000 crore to acquire land from K.R. Puram to trumpet interchange. Total land identified on the stretch is 3,17,565 square metres.

“The process to pay compensation to land owners between K.R. Puram and Hebbal is under way, and compensation package has already been sent to KIADB, which is the agency acquiring land for the metro project,” a BMRCL official said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/98ssz1/article30969371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGMETROLINE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/metro-to-kia-bmrcl-gets-major-chunk-of-land-on-ballari-road/article30969372.ece

An unusual guest was spotted in the city on Monday. An injured blackbuck was found near M.S. Palya near Singapura Layout. The residents, who spotted the blackbuck, immediately alerted the police who called the wildlife rescue team of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

The rescuers shifted the injured blackbuck to the Wildlife Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre (WRRC) at the Bannerghatta National Park. Once treatment is over, officials will take necessary action to put the animal back in its habitat.

Rajesh Kumar M., BBMP wildlife rescuer, said that the female, sub adult blackbuck, had entered a construction site. “Black buck are a critically endangered species due to habitat degradation and hunting. Hunting them is prohibited under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act 1972,” he said. Mr. Kumar also said that spotting black bucks in cities like Bengaluru is rare though there were black bucks in the outskirts of Hosakote and Devanahalli. “They usually move in herds and live in grasslands.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/g9m23e/article30969369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGBLACKBUCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/injured-blackbuck-found-in-city-taken-to-bannerghatta-park/article30969370.ece

403,2020/03/03,Chennai has a new player in its co-working space segment,"A market study reveals that Chennai’s co-working space is set to double over the next two years

Another new player, Workeasy Space Solutions, has entered the co-working spaces market in Chennai. The Chennai head-quartered firm, has leased 1 lakh sq. ft. each on Rajiv Gandhi Salai (Old Mahabalipuram Road) and Anna Salai (Mount Road). Additional space of 73,000 sq. ft. has also been taken in Guindy, thereby covering all the micro markets in the city.

According to the founders of Workeasy Space Solution (known by its acronym WorkEZ), Anil Reddy and Sunil Reddy, the company already has three closures amounting to 500 plus seats so far, from IT start-up firms. “We are seeing good traction for all the locations so far. We have noticed mostly IT companies are interested in the IT corridor, OMR. Various other sectors like healthcare,shipping, finance and e-publishing are interested in the central business district and Guindy,” they said and added that clients are acknowledging the value of being in a co-working space compared to a traditional space.

The firm is considering opening facilities in tier-2 cities as well. Plans are also on the anvil for expansion in Bengaluru and Hyderabad.

Real estate players in Chennai point out that over the next two years, Chennai will see its number of co-working spaces double. A market study by by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL) shows that the cumulative space take-up by the co working segment from 2017 to the first quarter of 2019 is approximately over 9 million sq.ft. Chennai has been leading the pack in terms of absorption when compared to other cities. Co-working space absorption has contributed close to 22% of the city’s absorption which is pegged at 6.2 million sq.ft. in 2019.

Research by ANAROCK (a real estate services company), reveals that office space absorption in the top seven cities stood at over 40 million sq. ft. in 2019, of which Chennai accounted for nearly 2.6 million sq. ft.

409,2020/03/03,Doctors treat 10-year-old girl with pyomyositis,"Seven surgeries later, the aspiring dancer is fine

A team of doctors of Kauvery Hospital treated a 10-year-old girl, who suffered from pyomyositis, a bacterial infection, and had complications including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury and sepsis.

Lakshmi Prashanth, consultant paediatrician, said the girl, an aspiring dancer, was treated in her native town for an ankle sprain with an above knee plaster cast. “However, five to seven days later, she had excruciating pain, swelling in the right lower limb and high grade fever. When she came to us, her presentation suggested deep vein thrombosis - a clot in the leg. She developed difficulty in breathing and normal urine output stopped. Her heart rate was high and blood pressure low,” she told reporters on Monday.

The girl’s total blood count was 49,000 to 50,000 signalling severe sepsis, she said, adding: “She needed critical care support. She had acute kidney failure. We provided respiratory support and put her on antibiotics.” The girl had certain skin changes suggesting infection in her right leg that was both limb and life threatening, the doctors said.

Plastic surgeons took her up for exploratory studies and found she suffered from severe pyomyositis. Tissues in the muscle around the bones were necrosed. For this, she underwent seven radical surgical procedures to remove the tissues. There was pus in the deep compartment of the leg, she said.

“We do see cases of pyomyositis but not as life threatening and limb threatening as this one. Usually, it occurs in immune-compromised patients such as elderly, HIV positive persons and those under chemotherapy for cancer. This was an otherwise healthy child,” she said.

V. B. Narayanamurthy, senior consultant-plastic surgeon, said that it was important to seek help early in such circumstances. “We have removed dead tissues and have preserved normal ones. She is able to walk now, and we are hoping that the muscles recover.”

Birth and death certificate data and bank account-related information of residents are sensitive and crucial for delivery of civic services online.

The Corporation has floated tenders and the work order is expected to be issued in a few days. According to a senior official, the firewall will be in place 15 days after the issuance of work order.

Starting April, the data of residents will get advanced protection. At present, the Corporation offers various online related services. The existing birth and death database, Greater Chennai Corporation web portal (www.chennai corporation.gov.in), application server of various online services of GCC are all hosted at the existing GCC server room.

“The data is becoming more critical and important in nature. In order to safeguard it, a dedicated firewall was installed 10 years ago. Now we are getting an advanced version of the firewall,” said an official.

“It gives complete protection. Data will be secure. Analyser will check traffic also. We will be proactive in identifying threat to the data,” said an official.

The Corporation Council has recommended a web application firewall so that the traffic is protected from external attacks. The Electrical Department will upgrade to the next generation firewall with web application firewall and analyser, officials said.

411,2020/03/03,Where the streets have no name,"Civic projects hit in added areas

More than 1.3 lakh houses and commercial establishments in added areas of the city do not have correct door numbers and street names.

The absence of street names has affected the implementation of civic projects in many areas that were merged with the city 10 years ago, officials said.

For instance, the World Bank-funded project on ‘Base map, property and utility mapping and door-to-door survey using geospatial techniques’ has been affected owing to the absence of street names in many added areas of the city.

The project aims to facilitate better coordination between agencies for implementation of civic projects. Mismatch of data generated by the civic body and the condition at the field level has led to the deployment of more personnel for the project and a delay in its implementation.

“We were not able to carry out the survey in the added areas based on street and door numbers. The street names and door numbers do not exist and do not match the field conditions during sample survey,” according to an official.

No signboards

In the industrial belt of Tiruvottiyur, during field verification, workers took more time to move from one property to another because of the absence of street names and signboards. “Streets are yet to be marked with street names. Signboards have not been fixed. In the field, it was difficult to identify the property based on the property tax information,” said an official.

In Manali and Madhavaram, the civic agency was unable to access the owner information of vacant plots in the zone. Many plots are vacant in the area. Owners of adjacent properties did not give neighbours’ information. Original tax assessment bill numbers and addresses in MIS did not match the actual location of the property.

In areas such as Ambattur, many buildings do not have access roads, and so approaching those properties is quite difficult for civic officials. Irregular plot numbers were noticed in Perungudi and Sholinganallur as well.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/zdakl8/article30967093.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THNAMESANDNUMBERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/where-the-streets-have-no-name/article30967094.ece
412,2020/03/03,Sinking feeling: water table dips in Feb.,"The level has dropped by nearly a metre in Ambattur, Anna Nagar, Valasaravakkam

Summer has just begun. And, already the water table in the city is witnessing a marginal dip by an average of half a metre.

According to a study by Chennai Metrowater, conducted in 15 zones across the city, there has been a slight drop in the water table in all the zones in February compared to the previous month.

This indicates the need to conserve water this summer to avert a crisis.

The water level has dropped to a maximum depth of nearly one metre in Ambattur, Anna Nagar and Valasaravakkam.

The water table in Valasaravakkam has declined to a maximum depth of 6.74m in February compared to 5.76m in January.

According to sources, the variations in groundwater levels occurred depending on the level of extraction and soil condition.

Tiruvottiyur, Manali and Sholinganallur were among the zones that witnessed the least dip in groundwater levels.

Water level in Sholinganallur, which was at a depth of 2.92m in January, has dropped to 3.27m last month.

Chennai Metrowater is supplying 650 million litres daily through pipeline and tankers and most residents depend on groundwater to bridge the gap.

Marginal dip

The dip was marginal because of better rainwater harvesting in many parts of the city, sources said.

Metrowater monitors the waterlevel and quality across the city through 145 shallow observation wells every month.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/sinking-feeling-water-table-dips-in-feb/article30967064.ece
413,2020/03/03,City limps along with just 30% of its supply of bottled water,"Strike enters fifth day; 103 units operating sans NOC sealed in Tiruvallur

With the indefinite strike by packaged drinking water units entering the fifth day on Monday, the city is receiving just 20-30% of its normal supply. Residents of many areas are already feeling the pinch, with 20-litre bubbletops fast running out at traders.

Members of the Greater Tamil Nadu Packaged Drinking Water Manufacturers Association said the strike was more intense in districts outside Chennai.

The city is being supplied with a limited quantity of bubbletops as the urban and peri urban areas are largely dependent on packaged water.

‘No retreat’

The association plans to continue the indefinite strike, seeking solutions to the issues raised by it.

In the past two days, Tiruvallur Collectorate officials have sealed 103 packaged drinking water units that did not have a no-objection certificate from the Water Resources Department.

A team of officials sealed the companies operating without NOC, based on a Madras High Court directive.

Officials of the Tiruvallur Collectorate said several units, including many in Avadi, Poonamallee, Ponneri and Gummidipoondi, were sealed till Monday.

However, no unit in Kancheepuram district was closed. Of the 1,600 water units across the State, about 420 are based in the city’s neighbouring districts. Normally, the city is supplied with 2.5 crore litres of packaged drinking water daily.

‘Brands costly’

As there was a delay or dearth in supply of small brands, some residents had to switch over to known brands that are priced higher.

“I borrowed one bubbletop from a neighbour for now. I am thinking of purchasing a water purifier to manage needs,” said K. Devi, a resident of Mylapore.

Retailers too noted that the number of bubbletops supplied was dipping.

“We are getting only a limited number of bubbletops. People are buying major brands priced up to ₹80 as there is a shortage,” said S.

The number of polling booths for the Chennai Corporation Council elections is expected to increase from 5,211 in 2011 to 5,759 this year. The previous election for the Corporation Council was held in 2011.

A meeting of political parties was called at Ripon Buildings on Monday by additional district electoral officer P.Kumaravel Pandian to get objections and suggestions relating to the new polling booths.

While men and women voters will get 135 polling booths each, 5,489 booths have been identified for all voters.

The list of polling booths was displayed on the notice boards of all the 200 ward offices in the city.

When the list was released last year, the number of polling booths for the local body elections for the Chennai Corporation Council was 5,720.

Last year 86 new buildings, including private schools and govt. offices, were identified for setting up new polling booths in many wards. Most of the wards have registered a rise in number of voters in the past nine years, leading to identification of new polling booths.

Former Chennai Corporation councillor P.V.Tamil Selvan said that the number of voters in his ward have increased from 28,000 in 2011 to 33,000 this year.

“Five schools have been identified in ward 91 for setting up 21 polling booths,” he also said.

“We had 19 polling booths in ward 91 of Ambattur zone in 2011. Many people have shifted their residence from other districts to our ward after the area was merged with the city. Many of them are young voters,” said Mr. Tamil Selvam.

“Many schools are located in the area. Koyambedu market also attracts residents,” he said.

416,2020/03/03,Plan afoot to host night safari at Vandalur Zoo,"Chief Minister chairs meeting to discuss the proposal, first mooted back in 2007

If all goes well, Arignar Anna Zoological Park or Vandalur Zoo, as it is known widely, will probably be the only zoo in the country to host a night safari, wherein wildlife enthusiasts and visitors will be able watch the animals at night.

The zoo already has a noctural animals section.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami chaired a meeting of Ministers and officials in the Secretariat on Monday to discuss the proposal. “There is no night safari anywhere in the country presently. We discussed the proposal to have a night safari at Vandalur Zoo,” Forest Minister Dindigul C. Sreenivasan told The Hindu.

The idea for a night safari at Vandalur Zoo was mooted in January 2007 and it was formally announced in the Assembly a year later. Though some concrete steps were taken from 2010 towards realising the project by laying some roads and going ahead with some construction on the campus, the project was eventually deferred in 2011 for want of funds.

Big draw

Sources pointed out that the night safaris in Singapore, China and Thailand attracted footfalls from across the world and had become international tourist destinations.

While the proposal is in its initial stages, if it materialises, Vandalur Zoo could become another destination for tourists to visit in Chennai.

The zoo, spread over 1,490 acres, houses several animal and bird species and has the potential to develop into a bigger facility offering a variety of services. The zoo already has required approvals from the Central Zoo Authority for its lion and deer safaris and hence it will not require fresh approvals for the night safari.

As of March 2019, the zoo housed a total of 475 mammals across 46 species, 1,754 birds across 90 species and 415 reptiles across 35 species. In all, the zoo houses 2,644 animals, birds and reptiles across 171 species.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nirguk/article30967016.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THVANDALURTIGER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/plan-afoot-to-host-night-safari-at-vandalur-zoo/article30967017.ece
417,2020/03/03,The message from Delhi,"More than mere ‘communal violence’, the recent events mark a disturbing turning point in contemporary Indian politics

Despite surface similarities, what happened in Delhi last week was not a “riot”, at least not what we used to mean by that term. Nor is it accurately described by other old-fashioned terms such as “communal violence” or “pogrom”. The truth is that we do not have a single word or phrase yet that can name this phenomenon, because it is really the newest stage of an ongoing project rather than a stand-alone event. Before discussing this project, it may be helpful to note some of the reasons why older descriptions do not fit.

Graphic depictions

If the 2002 riots of Gujarat were our first in the age of the mobile phone, the rampaging mobs of Delhi have scripted India’s first encounter with public violence in the era of the smart phone. Despite the inevitable risk of fakery, this is undoubtedly the first time that copious audio-visual documentation of wholesale violence has emerged almost immediately. Video clips of horrific acts of wanton cruelty are criss-crossing social media, speaking eloquently of the unspeakable. Deeply shocking as these images are, their effect is even more stunning. Graphic depictions of inhumanity have not elicited remorse or changed minds; rather, they have deepened biases and hardened stances. At least this is how it seems a week later.

One explanation for this is the media, particularly television and digital platforms. Our society has never been as media saturated, nor have our media been as blatantly one-sided as they are now. The bulk of the electronic media are strongly and blindly supportive of the ruling party and the government, and they fawn on the Prime Minister, who can do no wrong in their eyes. Even when confronted with damning evidence, the so called ‘godi’ (or lapdog) media finds ways to defend the indefensible, the more aggressive elements even going on the offensive with “alternative facts”.

But the major part of the explanation lies elsewhere, and is far more important. The Delhi violence and its aftermath point to the truth that, today, a large mass of people have been injected with hate and inoculated against all antidotes. Such people are convinced that they already have all the facts they need. They are programmed to regard arguments against their worldview as proof of a conspiracy against it. Their staunch beliefs are not random perversions, or a legacy from the past. They are the fruit of long and painstaking ideological work at the grass roots. How to counter this work and undo its effects is the central question of our time.

The Shaheen Bagh model

Another striking difference from the major riots of the past is the absence of a clear and commensurable provocation; 1984 had the assassination of a Prime Minister by her Sikh bodyguards as the trigger, while 2002 had the Godhra train deaths attributed to Muslims. The year 2020 has nothing comparable, except the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or the CAA, and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) iconised by Shaheen Bagh. More an inspiring model than a place, Shaheen Bagh is quite exceptional as a provocation for unrestrained brutality and killings. It is a peaceful protest led by women of all ages including the elderly; it constantly invokes nationalist symbols, speaks a non-sectarian language, and adopts the Preamble to the Constitution as its manifesto. Spreading quickly (albeit unevenly) across much of the country, the Shaheen Bagh model of protest is the first significant political challenge faced by the Modi-Shah duo since their rise to power in 2014.

No matter how annoying these protests were to daily commuters, and regardless of the local conflicts between rival groups of activists, there was nothing here to justify the organised looting, arson and murder that ensued. The argument that this was Delhi’s “punishment” for rejecting the ruling party in the recent Delhi Assembly election is an inadequate explanation because the loss did not matter a great deal in the larger scheme of things. The acts of omission and commission of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) both before and specially after the violence point to another major truth about contemporary politics. It is one of the most significant achievements of the Modi-Shah project that no major party is willing to take even the slightest risk of appearing to be pro-Muslim today.

Game-changing point

This argument can be taken further. The Delhi violence may mark a decisive turning point in the post-2019 phase of the Modi-Shah project when the nationalist-cum-anti-Muslim agenda has generated enough momentum to break free of electoral compulsions. If true, this is a momentous event. It implies that the Hindu-majoritarian agenda has won the political battle so decisively that it can even afford to lose elections. In other words, elections will be won or lost on “lesser” local or current issues, but both winners and losers will support Hindu-majoritarianism. Seen from the reverse angle, this means that challenges to Hindu-majoritarianism can only be staged outside of electoral politics.

But the Modi-Shah project is more than and different from a Hindu-majoritarian agenda. This distinction is vital because it is the only ray of hope for those who oppose both.

Put simply, the Modi-Shah project is a deeply authoritarian two-man bid for capturing and retaining power that is riding two horses simultaneously, namely crony corporatism and Hindu-majoritarianism. Only after its second consecutive landslide win in 2019 has the Modi-Shah duo acquired enough leverage to become the dominant partner vis-à-vis its allies, but it still needs both. Sites of probable friction between the dynamic duo and each of their two allies, or between the allies themselves, are the most productive sites for mounting a challenge to the Modi-Shah project itself.

The daunting but urgent task is to begin mapping these sites in concrete political terms. Frankly, this is uncharted territory, and the success of the Modi-Shah project has transformed the landscape. Challengers must contend with the almost complete subversion of all the institutions that are constitutionally designed to protect and nurture precisely this kind of democratic contestation, including the judiciary, the police, the bureaucracy, the media, universities, and even data-gathering organisations.

Looking inwards

In the last analysis, Delhi 2020 is different from earlier instances of “communal violence” for two main reasons. First because it marks the launching of a sophisticated campaign to “Dalitise” Muslims, a story that cannot be told here. Second, because it identifies a turning point in contemporary Indian politics. The clearest signs that we may arrived at this point came not during but after the violence. A message was hidden in the decided lack of regret and in the shocking continuity of the same voices shouting the same slogans (including “goli maaro”), now calling it a “peace march”. In the language of map apps, this message said that the mindset called “Hindu Rashtra” may no longer be our destination — it may have become our current location.

There is a crucial question that we Indians should be asking ourselves before it is too late, particularly the vast majority who identify, or are identified by others, as Hindus. Is this really what we want?

Apropos the report “No minority in Bengal will lose citizenship due to CAA: Shah” (March 2), it is unbelievable that pro-CAA BJP workers, carrying party flags, had the gall to shout the goli maro (shoot them) slogan en route to Shaheed Minar grounds in Kolkata, where Home Minister Amit Shah addressed a gathering. Significantly, top officials of the Kolkata Police, who were present at the scene, stood as spectators and the vociferous State Chief Minister, who also holds the home portfolio, went incommunicado. Mr. Shah’s assurance is misleading since a heavily biased Act that grants refuge on the basis of religion adds to an ominous trend to further the BJP’s own political ideology of Hindutva.

S.S. Paul,

Chakdaha, Nadia, West Bengal

Slogans emerging from a political party’s meetings can foretell a thing or two about its ideological trajectory. The recent slogans emanating from the BJP’s rallies do not leave anything to imagination as regards its proximate priorities. If the actions of the regime in Delhi is any indication, it is futile to expect that law enforcement agencies will bring the slogan-mongers to book.

A.Venkatasubramanian,

Tiruchi, Tamil Nadu

It is becoming emphatically clear that India is becoming an increasingly intolerant nation. The BJP does not condemn its rank and file for incendiary speeches and, occasionally, it also felicitates perpetrators — as was the case with the cow vigilantes. In its world view, protests, however peaceful, have no place in India. Though the Home Minister and the Prime Minister are emphatic in their rhetoric that the minorities need not worry about the implementation of the CAA/NRC/NPR, it is common knowledge that the whole exercise is aimed at polarisation, the proof of which is the Delhi riots.

G.B. Sivanandam,

Coimbatore

To put it in journalistic parlance, Union Home Minister Amit Shah sounded the poll bugle in West Bengal. It was clear from his speech that the BJP would use the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) for whatever it is worth to try and wrest power from the Trinamool Congress. It is no surprise as for the BJP, playing the religious card to polarise voters is the name of the game.

It was ominous that the incendiary “goli maaro s***** ko” (shoot the traitors) slogan was raised by frenzied BJP supporters in a mammoth march in Kolkata. The loss of life in Delhi has not stopped them from chanting the slogan. It was jarring to hear “goli maaro” and “Bharat mata ki jai” in the same breath. It is frightening to think how many cities and regions will be converted into theatres of communal violence.

It is India’s misfortune that in Amit Shah, it has a Home Minister who speaks the language of bigotry and hate. It was, however, a climb-down by Mr. Shah that he did not link CAA to NRC or repeat his favourite terminology ‘termites’. In a rally in Kolkata, Amit Shah assured that “no minority will have to leave” the country owing to the CAA. While we must be beholden to him for his ‘generosity’, things are not as easy or simple as made out to be by him.

The true import of the CAA blows away the argument that it does not affect Indian Muslims. The sole question is: why should ‘non-Muslim identity’ be made a criterion for acquisition of citizenship. The CAA determines who refugees are and who illegal immigrants are on the basis of religion, a fact that makes it discriminatory and unconstitutional. If you are of the ‘right religions’ you are granted citizenship, and if you are of the ‘wrong religion’ you are denied citizenship. If this is not religious discrimination, what is it?

“Why only three neighbouring countries?”, “Why only six religious communities?” and “Why only religious persecution?” are legitimate questions that cannot be left unasked. Sri Lankan Tamils, Rohingya, Tibetan refugees, Ahmadiyyas and Shia Hazaras too are humans like those privileged in the CAA. Mr. Shah should read the Constitution to see if anywhere it prescribes religion as a criterion for citizenship before trying to justify the CAA. Let us not do anything that depletes India’s moral strength and compassion.

A deal with the devil

When I was in Kabul as the representative of an international rehabilitation agency some years ago, the guest house I was staying in was right in front of a girls school. After learning about all that the Taliban had denied to the women in Afghanistan, it was wonderful to see girls of all ages flocking to the school chatting and laughing. I shudder to think what will become of that school now that the U.S. has inked an agreement with the Taliban (Editorial “A big, bad deal,” March 2). It is dreadful to think that an organisation which was driven to the fringes of Afghan life for the past two decades has managed to get the gates opened for a fierce re-entry into mainstream Afghan society. Leaving behind the days of periodically launching rockets from the mountains surrounding Kabul and causing havoc on the roads by diabolically planting IEDs, the Taliban can now march into the city unchecked and unopposed. By keeping the elected Afghan government out of the deal, the U.S. has paved the way for the Taliban to quickly overthrow Ashraf Ghani’s regime and reinstall its own brand of medieval administration. It appears that the blood of 3,500 U.S. and ISAF soldiers and that of countless Afghans and others has been shed in vain, now that the Donald Trump administration has struck a deal with the devil himself.

Judah S.G. Vincent,

Chennai

The deal between the U.S. and the Taliban has done more harm than good to the hapless country of Afghanistan. It has legitimised the Taliban and weakened the duly elected Afghan government. The extent to which the U.S. has capitulated is revealed by the title of the agreement, which says that it is between the ‘Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan’ (IEA), which is not recognised by the U.S., and the U.S. If the ‘IEA’ is not recognised, what legitimacy is there for the agreement? How can a country say to another entity that we don’t recognise you and yet enter into a deal with that entity. The deal is nothing but a fig leaf for the U.S. to hide its ignominious exit from Afghanistan and its betrayal of Afghans.

Now, the Taliban, which has extracted the best of terms in the deal with the superpower, can easily dictate terms to the Afghan government, if and when the talks are held. The world expected more meaningful and concrete terms in the deal than mere assurances telling that Taliban would severe ties with other terrorist groups. Where is the mechanism to ensure that the Taliban does not renege on its assurances? When a superpower with all its might couldn’t extract a fair deal with the Taliban, nothing great can be expected from the talks to be held, if at all, between a weak Afghan government and a resurgent and now legitimised Taliban. The Afghans would have been better off if the U.S. had just exited without making any deal with the insurgents.

The deal also brings in a new element in international relations as a precedent has been created where a sovereign nation arrived at an agreement with an insurgent group of another nation, thus undermining the sovereignty of the nation to which the insurgents belong. This does not augur well for the future of the countries that are facing such insurgencies/rebellions.

Kosaraju Chandramouli,

Hyderabad

The much-awaited agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban was finally sealed in Doha. But a spectre of instability and prolonged violence now looms larger on the horizon. It may have been billed as a peace deal and would pave the way for a phased withdrawal of 12,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in Afghanistan, but the fears it triggered in its wake about the return of Taliban are genuine and cannot be shrugged off as baseless. Whether or not the present agreement ushers in the promised peace and stability in Afghanistan, it would certainly bolster the re-election chances of U.S. President Donald Trump. With the Taliban taking the centre stage in Afghan landscape, India has every reason to worry about a negative fallout.

M. Jeyaram,

Sholavandan, Tamil Nadu

The Taliban is not a name to conjure peace. It is a dreaded terror outfit that has held both Afghanistan and the U.S. to ransom for over 18 years. It is doubtful if any peace treaty between it and the U.S. would be worth the paper it is written on. After American troops pull out of Afghanistan, the Taliban will be free to take over the Afghan government. It is ironic that the U.S., which invaded Afghanistan to quell terrorism, has simply succumbed to blackmail by the Taliban by signing an ignominious peace treaty. India must see that a resurgent Taliban does not join forces with Pakistan terror networks to foment terror across India’s borders and in Kashmir.

The first Prime Minister

Mahesh Rangarajan’s article (“A plural legacy more vital than ever,” March 2) makes the point that Jawaharlal Nehru was seen by Mahatma Gandhi as the man with the ability to scan wider horizons and carry forward his message of unity in diversity. In the mind of Gandhi, Nehru was the quintessential democrat, accommodative of dissent, free from racial prejudices and religious bigotry and completely committed to secular principles. Besides, he was an undisputed man of the masses in 1947 and therefore a natural choice to be the first Prime Minister. Therefore, the vicious misconception doing the rounds that Nehru, in his ambition to become Prime Minister, divided India is a grotesque misrepresentation and travesty of fact. No Prime Minister after Nehru has enjoyed the international stature and acceptability Nehru did in the 1950s; so it is illusory to think that respect for India in the rest of the world has gone up only under Narendra Modi. On the contrary, a spate of questionable actions taken by the government has led to India forfeiting its claims to being a plural, inclusive and secular nation.

R. Ravichandran,

Chennai

A secular democratic India couldn’t have been possible without Nehru’s legacy. That is why Khwaja Ahmad Abbas wrote in his autobiography I Am Not An Island: An Experiment in Autobiography: “When Nehru died, we died — for Nehru was us, the soul and spirit of India. If it was Gandhiji who raised us out of dust, it was Jawaharlal Nehru who gave us life, who gave us courage and the will to struggle for a better tomorrow. And when Nehru died, we died.” But the legacy of Nehru was sullied when his own daughter dragged the nation into Emergency in 1975. The gruesome Turkman Gate massacre during the Emergency and the subsequent destruction of the Shah Commission report were indelible stabs on the democratic legacy of Nehru. The Babri Masjid demolition in 1992, the Gujarat carnage in 2002, the street lynchings India has witnessed since 2014 and the latest communal riot in Delhi are all indicators of India drifting away from the secular democratic legacy of India’s first Prime Minister. And the survival of India depends upon the retrieval of the Nehruvian legacy by the people of the country as no political party is committed to retrieve it.

Dominated by the Kiwis

India’s overall performance in the Tests series against the just concluded New Zealand tour hardly justifies its ‘No. 1’ Test ranking. In the four innings India batted, it did not cross 200 runs in three innings, which sums up its weakness against some incisive and accurate pace bowling in seaming conditions. The batsmen looked clueless and amateurish, to say the least. That the second Test ended in two-and-a-half days is a sad commentary on our performance. Virat Kohli looked tentative while Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane just hung around. The newcomers were simply overawed by the occasion. Only in the first innings of the second Test, Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah looked impressive. In the second, they were just a shadow of their original self with the New Zealand’s opening pair knocking off the required runs with utmost ease. Bumrah does not look like a wicket-taking bowler any longer. Ishant Sharma, our spearhead in Tests, is injury-prone. Shami is showing signs of rusting. Our pacers were not even half as effective as those of the home team.

420,2020/03/03,A taste of retro China,"Restaurateur Zorawar Kalra’s ShangHigh takes patrons back to a time when recipes were sacrosanct and untouched

In the last year alone, restaurateur Zorawar Kalra has revamped a substantial number of his existing properties. There was River to Oceans which became Tygr; Farzi in Kamala transformed into Younion; Kode turned into another Asian establishment named Hotel ShangHigh. The new gastronomical entrant to the city sits prominently as you enter Kamala Mills in Lower Parel.

For long now now, Kalra’s Massive Restaurants stable is known for introducing the contemporary Indian to new modern food and cocktails. So it’s noteworthy that ShangHigh goes back in time and with a serving of retro Chinese. “I am a big lover of modern food,” says Kalra who is a huge fan of Chinese food. “There are a lot of modern Asian restaurants out there already; including PaPaYa [also by Kalra]. This time, I had a clear concept in mind — that of retro, unapologetically authentic food. It was a conscious decision to invent a brand that focused on really heart-warming, comforting food.”

With the new restaurant, Kalra wants to focus entirely on the food with just six signature cocktails that will keep changing every month. The menu has been designed by chef Pankaj Jha (an oft Kalra collaborator), who tells us that in addition to travelling, he has had a chance to work with authentic Chinese chefs abroad. The two experiences have of course helped shape the direction of ShangHigh’s menu. “Retro Chinese is something that one would get to eat in Chinese homes and original Chinese restaurants, where the recipes are untouched and presented just as they should be,” says Jha adding that the recipes at ShangHigh have not been modified in the least to placate an Indian or modern palate. “This means importing special ingredients that aren’t commonly found here such as the banana chilli or tisen tsin pepper,” says the chef.

To create a retro vibe, ShangHigh sports a giant dragon and typical Chinese paper lanterns (with colour changing lights though) and umbrellas suspended from the ceiling. Tones of red dominate the room, reminding patrons of the typecast sets of Chinese hotels in Hollywood films.

The island bar stands as a memory of Kode, it’s covered with what look like Christmas tree decorations though. While Kalra plans to open properties in two more countries this year in addition to focusing on tier-two cities, he’s not lost love for Kamala Mills. “The business was definitely very heavily affected after the fire and never really recovered until the end,” Kalra lets on about the future. “But I think something new and a good quality product will always have its own draw. Younion’s our biggest hit today, and we are hoping the same will hold true for Hotel ShangHigh.”

Take a bite

As the conversation ends, suddenly the lights go dim and a short Samba dance begins, something that recurs every 45 minutes or so. It’s revealed there will be a mix of performances every day. Everything else fades when a cocktail glass arrives (Kalra has custom-designed glasses at all properties). The Age of Invention (₹495), uses milk washing to present a refreshing hibiscus tea and litchi concoction. Another drink, The Great Emigration (₹495) is a baiju and lemongrass cocktail with egg whites shaken in perfectly. The mood changes with a spoonful of Crab Rou and Enoki (₹285) a clear soup that instantly warms the heart. An eternal love affair with crystal dumplings is more than satisfied with the Pok Choy and Shiitake dumplings (₹285). Chef Jha is indulgent with another plate of crystal prawn dumplings and aromatic coriander (₹325). The Smoked Duck Breast salad (₹295) with a Hoisin mango vinaigrette is a must-have. In addition to baos and pot stickers, Cheung Fun is another crowd favourite on the menu, like the Crispy Cheung Fun with Prawn and Chive (₹295). As for the tien tsin pepper, if you love some heat on your palate, the pork ribs (cheekily named At Your Own Risk, ₹455) use the hottest chilli from China balanced with a mix of other spices and herbs. There’s a good balance of meats, with sections in the mains dedicated to duck, chicken, seafood and pork, and there is a Jain menu too. And if you have any space left for dessert, Matcha Delight (₹425), a mousse with crisps might just manage to tempt you.

421,2020/03/03,Chef Daniel Chin talks about the challenges of preserving the authentic taste of Singapore,"Singapore on my plate

The world is a global village and this island state could very well be where citizens go for a bite. While Singapore is touted as a tourist destination for die-hard shoppers, art aficionados and animal lovers, it is also a foodie’s paradise.

Hailing from Singapore, Chef Daniel Chin is currently based out of Mumbai, heading the Nasi and Mee restaurant there as well as the other branches of this South East Asian restaurant in India. During a recent visit to Bengaluru, he talked with obvious pride about his country and the style of cooking prevalent there.

With a background in French and Italian cuisine, Daniel has experienced flavours and tastes from around the world and now, that includes Mumbai’s street food too. “Indian food uses a lot of masala which masks the natural taste of the meat or vegetable,” says Daniel who has now been in India for two years.

He has attempted to introduce subtle flavours to the local palate as well as showcase the authentic cuisine of Singapore. To this end, he is keen on stirring up sauces crafted from local ingredients that appeal to Indians.

He talks about the addition of a butter creamy crab dish to the menu seasoned with black pepper and the challenge of procuring fresh seafood. “So right now, this dish is only available in our Mumbai outlet,” he smiles.

Similarly, his version of the otak-otak, a grilled fish cake, is different in Mumbai with the addition of prawn and squid and served in a coconut shell. “I see to it the original flavour of this dish is maintained. The response has been fantastic as everyone is happy to try something new.” He pairs Sambal, a chilli paste or sauce typical to Singapore, and coconut milk with dishes here in his bid to innovate with taste and textures.

When it comes to Indian food, Daniel admits to a fondness for tandoori chicken, pakoras and vada pav. Since Singapore hosts diverse races, cultures and ethnicities, he says it didn’t take too long to adapt to authentic Indian food. “The bigger challenge was to find new flavours to incorporate into my dishes,” he says.

Popular dishes at Nasi and Mee outlets like chicken rice, Cantonese steamed fish, nasi goreng, kueh pie tee (a vegetarian cross between a taco and a cup cake) and char kway teow (flat rice noodles in soy sauce), could soon sport interesting variations along with the too-good-to-change satays, kaya toast (made with coconut jam — a popular breakfast spread in Singapore) and Milo shakes.

423,2020/03/03,This is how it was: A peep into history for the Kohli generation,"The generations that followed believe the reverse — that no mountain is too high to climb, no match lost on the first day itself.

If you are above a certain age and a fan of Indian cricket, you are probably familiar with the feeling. Where hope and despair are nicely mixed, where intense faith in one or two players is matched by the feeling that everything is about to go wrong.

Also read: It is just lack of form, Sehwag on Kohli’s failures

My mother exhibits this pessimism every time. She has been following the fortunes of the Indian team since the mid-1960s at least. I remember her keeping scores in a notebook, or if that couldn’t be immediately found, on the margins of the daily newspaper while listening to the radio commentary.

Those were the days when a draw was cause for celebration, and an individual century or a five-wicket haul restored some national pride. We didn’t expect to win anything, and when the great spinners, or later, Sunil Gavaskar, were praised in England or Australia we took it personally.

Those were the days when the middle order was shaky. The spinners prayed, “Give us 250 runs to bowl at,” but the batsmen often struggled.

Interesting read: ICC Test ranking: India retains top spot, Kohli remains second in batsmen's list

Those were the days of unsettled opening batsmanship (till Gavaskar came along), unreliable middle orders and a dearth of bowlers who could take wickets abroad. Those were the days when the opponents’ lower order batsmen often held up the Indian bowling. Wes Hall, Tom Veivers, John Snow, Peter Lever, Geoff Miller, Michael Holding, all bowlers, all got half-centuries while Tony Mann, who had batted at number eight in the first innings came in as night watchman for Australia in the second and made 105.

The only certainty about India’s performance was its uncertainty. I realize now it must have been traumatic. My mother, an otherwise optimistic woman with a cheery worldview, continues to be less than sanguine about the cricket team. Forget the World Cup triumphs, forget the victories abroad, forget the fact that India are the No. 1 team in the world. Ignore the fact that they have done it often, but my mother still believes India will struggle to make 150 to win, or claim twenty wickets.

The generations that followed believe the reverse — that no mountain is too high to climb, no match lost on the first day itself.

Generations overlap

And then comes a tour of New Zealand, and the two generations overlap. The old fears return. Suddenly it feels as if nothing has changed.

Also read: Virat Kohli indicates ‘mini transition’ of pace unit in near future

India struggled with the opening batting, found a hole in the middle order, allowed the lower order to add crucial runs, and didn’t look like the No. 1 team they are. It has been confusing for those who love to apportion blame, for there has been no silver lining. No “take aways” as defeated captains are fond of saying at the end of a series.

Amazingly, the result has been received with great equanimity by a nation obsessed by victories on the cricket field. This may be a sign that Test cricket is losing its sheen. Perhaps the events on the streets of Delhi and elsewhere have put sport and fandom in perspective. The call for heads and banning of players from commercial activities or raising the standards of domestic cricket, which followed defeats in England and Australia at the start of the decade have not been articulated.

To beat New Zealand in New Zealand is as difficult as it is to beat India in India. India have won five matches out of 25 in New Zealand (three of them in the first series there half a century ago), while New Zealand have won just two in India (34 matches). Till Glenn Turner and especially Richard Hadlee appeared, the New Zealanders were great favourites in India because they were seen as the one team India were expected to beat. That was then, this series loss is now.

Strange series

This was a strange series from India’s point of view. Their finest batsman and best bowler were both out of form, and here was evidence — if it were needed — that Virat Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah made up half the team. Their in-form batsman, K L Rahul was not picked for the Tests which wasn’t smart. Picking the batsman in form is hardly rocket science, even if the choice might be an admission of an earlier error.

Did India pick the right men for the final Test which they had to win? Four bowlers meant they were one short. In hindsight — and despite the poor batting — they could have played a fast bowler in place of a batsman. The BCCI’s tweet before the Test: “Spot the pitch” suggested a green top, and India, in reflex action, played the extra batsman.

424,2020/03/03,Grandma goes to school: Life in a village,"Soon, grandma was married. No more classes, lessons or swimming in the river.

The story so far:A visiting missionary from Calcutta was impressed with the work done by the girls. Prizes were distributed.

Grandma’s teacher had a lovely needle-case of red velvet with needles, silk yarns in all colours of the rainbow and a silver thimble. Grandma asked her grandma for one. But grandma looked at her with twinkling eyes and said, “What’s the use? You are not going to school from next week!”

“Not going to school?” asked grandma, a lump in her throat.

“No, my dear. You are getting married. Just think, you will have so many lovely new things!”

Disappointed

Grandma cried all the way to school the next day. Before long, everyone heard that grandma was getting married and would not come to school any more. As she was one of the brightest students, her teacher gifted her a needle-case just like her own. But grandma merely clutched it and cried. She knew that a joyful part of her life was over.

Grandma married grandpa and within a month she left for her new home in a village in Jessore.

My 17-year-old grandpa rushed back to his college in Calcutta as soon as the rituals were over. Apart from missing her mother from whom she had never been parted, grandma found life in a village different. Everything seemed new and strange. Even the people spoke differently. And she hated the custom of having to keep her face covered with her pallu because she was now married. But she was determined not to cry in the presence of others however upset she felt.

There were no schools for girls in the village and few among the womenfolk knew how to read. Grandma felt miserable when she realised that there would be no learning from now on. Possibly no embroidery or sewing either! Life was just going to be one big round of helping in the kitchen and housework once she stopped being a “new bride”. But at least, she had been allowed to bring her dolls and play with her sisters-in-law who were around the same age and younger.

425,2020/03/03,Law to legalise politics in campuses soon,"State government to appeal against a recent High Court order that banned campus politics

The State government will enact legislation to legalise the right of students to associate politically on campuses of educational institutions.

Minister for Higher Education K. T. Jaleel told the Assembly on Tuesday that the government would appeal against the recent High Court order banning political activity in educational institutions.

He said there isolated incidents of student violence were an aberration and not the norm. “The solution to a headache is not decapitation,” Mr Jaleel said.

The Minister was responding to two calling attention motions on the topic moved by Congress legislator V.T. Balaram and CPI(M) legislator M. Suraj separately. Mr Jaleel promised the new law would ensure that students had a say in academics and campus affairs.

The MLAs said they feared that banning politics on campuses would create a generation of apolitical citizens blind to the larger issues that affect the nation. They would have no clear stance or opinion on issues that matter to the people.

A vibrant and politically aware student community was crucial to the furtherance of parliamentary democracy.

They said a subculture of drug-fuelled violence and machismo and money and influence would dominate campuses if student politics took a back seat. Such a situation could not be allowed.

They also said student politics was essential to act as a democratic check on excesses of private managements that seek to profit from education.

Banning student politics meant chipping away at the right of students and depriving them the right to protest against arbitrary action on the part of management.

The MLAs said student unrest in campuses had sparked off most of the popular agitations in the country, including the freedom struggle.

Campus politics also reflected the aspirations of the youth and the idea of the polity they wanted to inherit.

Mr Jaleel sought bipartisan support for the proposed Bill, which he said the government hoped to circulate soon to seek public opinion. Organisations, leaders, opinion-makers, writers and intellectuals had stressed the need for a law to institutionalise political freedom on campuses.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/law-to-legalise-politics-in-campuses-soon/article30974474.ece
426,2020/03/03,Labourer ends life over alleged delay in receiving flood relief,"His house was partially damaged in 2018 floods and totally in the 2019 one

Distressed over the alleged delay in receiving flood relief from the government, a 42-year-old labourer committed suicide in Wayanad district.

Sanal Kumar of Munhanalil at Thurayankunnu, near Thrikkaipetta in Meppadi grama panchayat, was found hanging inside a temporary shed built by his friends on Monday night.

Though Mr. Kumar’s house, built on a three-cent plot, had been damaged partially in 2018 floods and destroyed completely in the 2019 deluge, he was yet to get even the sum of ₹10,000, an emergency relief announced by the government for the victims of the deluge, his relatives said.

They alleged that undue delay on the part of the authorities in allocating funds for reconstructing his house drove Mr. Kumar to take the extreme step. He had submitted a lot of applications to the Revenue and grama panchayat officials for financial assistance in the past two years, but, it was denied to him, they added.

The labourer was hoping to get a house under the Life Mission project, but it was also yet to be granted, they added.

But K.K. Sahid, president, Meppadi grama panchayat, told The Hindu that the civic body had recommended the State government to provide a financial assistance of ₹4 lakh to Mr. Kumar after a field survey and his name was included in the list published by the government. The amount was allocated but, it was yet to be transferred to his account owing to some technical issues, Mr. Sahid said.

Moreover, according to the grama sabha list, Mr. Kumar’s name was included as the first beneficiary in ward no 3 of the grama panchayat for allotting house under the Prime Ministers’ Awas Yojana project, Mr. Sahid said.

When a team of police officials reached the spot to take the body for post mortem, the villagers detained them. Later Vythiri Tahsildar, Abdul Hameed, assured the villagers that steps would be expedited to release the compensation to Mr. Kumar, who is survived by wife Sajini and two children.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/labourer-ends-life-over-alleged-delay-in-receiving-flood-relief/article30974416.ece
427,2020/03/03,Devananda’s death: CM says police looking into any foul play,"CM, Assembly condoles death of the six-year-old

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Tuesday told the Assembly that the police were probing whether there was any foul play in the death of six-year-old Devananda in Kollam last week.

Local people had found the child’s body floating in the Ithikara lake, nearly half a kilometre away from her house.

Devananda’s father, Pradeep Kumar, a non-resident Keralite employed in the Gulf, and mother, Dhanya; a housewife, had said they had suspicions about their child’s demise and averred she was too young to stray so far from her house on her own.

Dhanya said she found her daughter missing when she returned home after rinsing her clothes. The child’s disappearance had triggered a massive search involving a posse of local volunteers, expert divers, sniffer dogs, fire and rescue department officials, and law enforcers.

A team of doctors had conducted the post-mortem examination. “The findings are consistent with death due to drowning. An additional report will follow on receipt of laboratory investigations,” Mr Vijayan said. The Chief Chemical Examiner’s Laboratory and State Forensic Sciences Laboratory experts were on the case, he said.

The police, people and emergency services had responded overwhelmingly to trace the child. They did an extensive search. The government was fully updated about the developments. However, the hopes of the people were dashed when few responders noticed the body in the lagoon.

Mr Vijayan said the Assembly and the government empathised with the parents. They had the support of the State. The CM was responding to a submission moved by the Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala.

Mr Chennithala said the people need a sense of closure in the case and the government should conduct a foolproof investigation. The police should answer the doubts aired by Devananda’s parents and neighbours.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/devanandas-death-cm-says-police-looking-into-any-foul-play/article30974304.ece

While replying to questions in the Assembly on Tuesday, Dr. Isaac assessed that the impact which the pandemic could have on the State would be determined by how the spread of the virus would be contained over the next three months. He raised the possible scenario of a significant dip in foreign tourist inflow as well as remittances from non-resident Keralities (NRKs), both of which were among the major drivers of the local economy.

He elaborated on the glum situation that had unfolded in the Middle East which accounted for a bulk of NRKs. Iran, where 66 deaths have been reported due to the coronavirus spread, has witnessed the highest death toll outside China, the epicentre of the outbreak. Besides, Saudi Arabia has imposed travel bans which was reported to have affected several pilgrims who were set to fly to Jeddah.

The Minister added that the various industrial sectors in the country had begun to feel the impact of the viral outbreak.

The city Corporation handed over the keys to a new flat to a woman and her six children from Kaithamukku, whose acute poverty and starvation had shocked the State last December.

Sreedevi and her children have been provided a flat that was was yet to be allocated in the civic body’s complex at Kalladimukham.

Employment

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran handed over the keys to the flat, at a function held at the Corporation office on Monday. Corporation Mayor K. Sreekumar presided over the function.

The Corporation had also provided her employment as a sanitation worker, when her plight came to light. However, she had informed the civic body that she was not in a position to take up the job immediately as she had a baby to take care of.

The Mayor had told her that the offer would be open and she can join work whenever she was ready.

The plight of the family had come to light in December last year after local people dialled 1517 and alerted the Thanal project under the Kerala State Council for Child Welfare, which extends assistance to children in trouble.

For foster care

The mother had handed over four of her six children to the care of the council.

431,2020/03/03,CBSE Class 12 Physics paper leaves students in tears,"They feel the question paper was tough, seek remedy

The CBSE Class 12 question paper for the Thiruvananthapuram region left students sweating on Monday.

Students from across the State complained that the question paper was tough so much so that some of them were left in tears. Students, teachers, and parents alleged that the questions were tricky and indirect, requiring a lot of application that left the children pressed for time.

Some students said they found it difficult to understand the questions even. Teachers alleged that the question paper did not adhere to the specified blueprint, which would include questions ranging from easy to average to difficult. However, the difficulty level was such that the students struggled even with the one-mark questions.

With even high-scoring students dejected, the plight of other students was not difficult to imagine, they said. Students alleged that the Physics question paper in the other regions was easier as compared to that in Thiruvananthapuram. This, they alleged, amounted to injustice.

Entrance exam

Teachers said Monday’s question paper was of the standard of an entrance examination. However, not all students prepared to appear for the entrance examination. The efforts put in by the other students and their teachers all the year round had gone in vain. Students said they had prepared for the examinations by going through the previous year question papers, sample question papers, and had appeared for the pre-boards too. However, the CBSE had thrown them a curveball, leaving a big question on their future.

In a press meet that was conducted by the CBSE ahead of the board examinations, students had been told to expect question for 10 marks that would be aimed at enabling creative thinking. However, almost 80% of the paper was application-oriented, students and teachers complained.

Children said they were so shaken that they were unable to focus on preparing for the next examination – Chemistry.

A teacher said the CBSE should ensure that those who set the sample questions prepare the question paper for the board examinations too. The board, students hoped, would take into account their grievance and show leniency during valuation or hold a retest as their futures were at stake.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/cbse-class-12-physics-paper-leaves-students-in-tears/article30966943.ece

Technical experts of the Kerala Irrigation Infrastructure Development Corporation (KIIDC) carried out an inspection of the bottled water plant of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) at Aruvikkara on Monday.

The Water Resources Department had issued orders on Friday okaying a takeover of the facility by the KIIDC on a seven-year lease.

‘Preliminary inspection’

KIIDC officials termed Monday’s inspection a “preliminary one”.

It was conducted to examine the equipment, determine the measures required to correct certain defects, and obtain certification from the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), a KIIDC official said.

A State government undertaking under the Irrigation Department, KIIDC markets the ‘Hilly Aqua’ bottled water brand.

Competent

In its order, the Water Resources Department had contended that the KIIDC was competent enough to correct defects, obtain the necessary clearances, and operate the facility.

The February 28 order issued by the Water Resources Department transferring the bottled water project has drawn strong protests from KWA employees’ unions.

Protest

On Monday, the CITU-backed KWA Employees’ Union burned a copy of the order protesting what it termed a “unilateral decision” by the department. Union general secretary P. Sasidharan Nair inaugurated the protest.

433,2020/03/03,SLAC move illegal: former KSHEC member,"Order that makes PG in Biotechnology eligibility criterion for teaching posts in Zoology and Botany

Former member of the Kerala State Higher Education Council (KSHEC) executive council R. Jayaprakash has questioned the propriety of the State Level Academic Committee (SLAC) deciding on matters pertaining to the equivalency of courses.

Weighing in on the raging debate regarding the recent government order that included postgraduation in biotechnology as an eligibility qualification for teaching posts in Zoology and Botany, Dr. Jayaprakash said that the SLAC, constituted on the basis of a government order after being mooted by the current KSHEC dispensation, cannot overrule the powers conferred by Academic Councils by University Acts.

‘Incompetent’

The former Syndicate member of the Kerala University and Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit claimed that the SLAC, which comprised Vice Chancellor, was incompetent in taking such a decision.

“It is not an expert body on all subjects. It has limitations on specialised subjects of which the committee members are not experts. Only a specialised body like the Academic Council is empowered to take a call on such matters. The decision of the SLAC is illegal, unscientific and against the spirit of the UGC regulations of 2018. It went against the interests of the academic community,” Dr. Jayaprakash said.

According to him, the Academic Councils were empowered to decide which courses of other universities could be accepted as equivalent to those conducted by their university.

Senior professors

The body consisted of senior professors and student representatives.

Decisions on equivalency are taken on the basis of a thorough scrutiny of the syllabus of the subject concerned.

Teachers’ demand

Meanwhile, the Kerala University Teachers’ Organisation has submitted a representation to the Governor, seeking his intervention to withdraw the order.

It amounted to a negation of the academic autonomy of universities, they stated.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/slac-move-illegal-former-kshec-member/article30966931.ece

435,2020/03/03,"BHELSIA has its eye on orders from railways, defence sectors","MSME units to host an exhibition in Tiruchi to showcase their capabailities

The BHEL Small and Medium Industries Association (BHELSIA) has planned to host an exhibition in Tiruchi next month to showcase the capabilities of steel fabrication units of the city so as to attract orders in the railways and the defence sectors.

Although the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) units were once famed for their combined capabilities and earned the city the reputation of being the fabrication hub, many of the units turned sick over the past few years, owing to a variety of factors, including over-dependence on the public sector major, BHEL, for orders.

The association has already sought a rehabilitation package from the Centre for the units which are under financial strain and those which have turned non performing assets due to the general recession over the past four years.

“Even as we are working to getting government support for revival of the sick units, we are also trying to get orders for the units. The expo is an attempt to showcase our capabilities and try and win orders from the Railways and the Defence sectors,” said Rajappa Rajkumar, president, BHELSIA, told The Hindu.

Mr. Rajkumar said the MSME’s can make products such as base frames for goods wagons and passenger bogies and even do total body building for bogies. “There is also good scope for manufacturing and supplying products such as armoured vehicles, fire fighting equipment, sprinklers and other products for the Defence sector too,” Mr. Rajkumar observed.

The BHELSIA has already started meeting elected representatives and officials in New Delhi seeking their support. Auditor S. Gurumurthy has agreed to be the patron of the expo.

A BHELSIA delegation met Railway Minister Piyush Goyal recently requesting him to depute officials to study the capability of Tiruchi units and help them in identifying the products which can be supplied to Railways and also arrange for vendor registrations. “We are also interested in signing a long term contract with Railways for developing new products by investing on any special purpose machine as may be required,” Mr. Rajkumar said in a representation to the Minister. Providing an overview of the critical situation faced by the MSME units in Tiruchi, Mr. Rajkumar pointed out there were about 450 units in and around Tiurchi, mainly serving BHEL-Tiruchi. “Because of the expertise developed by these units, Tiruchi is known as one of the best fabrication hubs of South Asia. The units give direct employment to about 20,000 persons and nearly 1.20 lakh people are dependent on the MSME units,” he said.

Till 2012, the total manufacturing capacity of these units was around 3.20 lakh tonnes per annum.

Anticipating huge orders, all these units went for expansion and the manufacturing capacity was increased to seven lakhs tonnes per annum.

But subsequently, drop in order from BHEL has badly affected the MSMEs and many of them were fighting for survival now, he said.

Mr. Rajkumar said that a delegation of BHELSIA has also planned to meet the Defence Minister seeking his support for the expo.

“We are also exploring the feasibility of a floating machining cluster during the expo,” Mr. Rajkumar added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/mqeq68/article30972790.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY03FABRICATIONTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/bhelsia-has-its-eye-on-orders-from-railways-defence-sectors/article30972791.ece
436,2020/03/03,Data | How strong is India’s squad compared to its rivals’ in the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup?,"Going into the tournament, Harmanpreet Kaur and Shafali Verma were India’s best batters and Rajeshwari Gayakwad was India’s best bowler

India swept Group A of the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup after beating Sri Lanka by seven wickets on February 29. This was India's fourth successive win, with the team already having entered the semi-final of the competition following a narrow four-run win against New Zealand on February 27. Earlier India had defeated Bangladesh and stunned hosts Australia in the tournament opener.

Going into the competition, India was ranked fourth behind Australia, England and New Zealand in the ICC rankings. Among the batters, Smriti Mandhana was the highest-ranked Indian player at the fourth position followed by Jemimah Rodriques (seventh) and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (ninth). Among the bowlers, Radha Yadav and Deepti Sharma were both ranked fourth.

Also read: Jemimah Rodrigues: ‘It warms my heart to see young girls take up sports’

Occupying the top-spot among the batters and the bowlers were Suzie Bates of New Zealand and Megan Schutt of Australia respectively. Both the batters and bowlers rankings featured two New Zealanders and three Australians in the top-10.

With a bunch of players in the top-10, Australia and New Zealand were strong favourites to reach the semi-final.

India and other contenders in 2019

To compare India’s squad with its rivals’, we used player records from the end of the 2018 T20 World Cup to the last T20I before the start of the 2020 edition. As metrics in this period, we used batting averages (runs per innings) and strike-rates (runs per 100 balls) for batters, and strike-rate (balls per wicket) and average (runs conceded per wicket) for bowlers.

The scatter-charts have four sections. The section with the darkest shade in both charts features the elite players at this World Cup. The section which is not highlighted has players whose form has been below-average in this period.

Who were the best batters going into the competition?

Only two Indians, Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Varma, are in the elite section. The section is dominated by the Australians and the English with four players from each team among the elites. Three New Zealand players too are in this section.

Australia wicket-keeper batter Alyssa Healy has the best strike-rate while New Zealand skipper Sophie Devine has the best average.

Who were the best bowlers going into the competition?

Four Indians - Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Harleen Deol, Radha Yadav and Deepti Sharma - feature among the bowling elite in the tournament, the highest for any squad. Three bowlers each from Australia, England, New Zealand and Bangladesh are among the elite as well.

Nahida Akter of Bangladesh has the best strike-rate and the best average. However, it must be noted that between the end of the 2018 world cup and start of this event, Bangladesh has played over half of its matches against teams such as Papua New Guinea, U.S., Maldives among others, which are ranked lower than itself.

Which teams performed the best between the two world cups?

To assess the performance of teams at a broad level, we used win percentage (wins per matches) for games each team played between the end of the 2018 world cup and the start of this event.

The best win records

While New Zealand had a near perfect record coming into the competition (losing just one match out of the seven it played), it had played the least number of matches among all teams. Australia had a win percentage of 79%, the second-best. India had a 50% win record and shared the fifth position with South Africa.

Last word

It is evident from the numbers that Australia and New Zealand were the two best sides ahead of the tournament. While India has one of the best bowling units in the competition, its batting is not as strong as Australia’s or New Zealand’s. India’s strong bowling has been instrumental in the team’s victories against better teams, in the group stage.

Having beat New Zealand by four runs on March 2, Australia joined India, South Africa and England to seal the last semi-final spot. New Zealand's exit is significant, considering it started the tournament as one of the two favourites.

On the other hand, while India has remained unbeaten in the competition, its ride hasn’t been smooth. Chinks in the batting, particularly the middle order, have been exposed. The team wouldn’t want a repeat of the 2018 tournament, when it had topped its group undefeated, but was beaten by England in the semi-final.

Note: Thailand was not considered for the analysis since it did not play any match against teams which feature in the competition other than Bangladesh in the considered period.",data,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/td3wpu/article30950822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29-PREVIEW-ING5P769AP33jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/data/data-how-strong-is-indias-squad-compared-to-its-rivals-in-the-icc-womens-t20-world-cup/article30950845.ece
437,2020/03/03,Data | Is poor performance in exams still the major factor behind rising student suicides?,"While the main reason behind student suicides in the early 2000s was examination failure, other reasons such as family issues and illness have become major factors in recent years.

Compared to the early 2000s, the number of students who committed suicide has nearly doubled in the late 2010s in India. Back then, while the main reason for student suicides was poor performance in examinations, lately other reasons such as family issues, illness and love affairs have become major factors. Between 2014 and 2018, most student suicides occurred in Maharashtra.

Worrying rise

An increasing number of students are committing suicide in India, with their share among all such deaths steadily going up over the years. The chart plots the number of student suicides (bar, left axis) and its % share among all suicides (line, right axis). Since 2016, less than 7% of all suicides were by students.

Exam pressure

The number of suicides due to poor performance in exams has remained stagnant over the years, with their share among student suicides* steadily going down. In 1998, suicides due to failure in exams formed about 41% of all student suicides, while in 2018, the share came down to 26%.

In the last week, the novel coronavirus has spread at a faster rate outside mainland China than within the country. Some nations in Western Europe, Western and Eastern Asia have emerged as the new epicenters of SARS-CoV-2. The rate at which people succumbed to the virus in nations outside mainland China increased sharply in the past week.

Not confined to China

Until February 18, a relatively small proportion of new COVID-19 cases were reported outside mainland China. Since then, the share has increased exponentially. On February 29, 75% new cases were recorded in other nations.

439,2020/03/03,Sahitya Akademi Award winner Cho Dharman talks about the root-cause of environmental problems,"Stories by the pond: In 'Sool', the Sahitya Akademi Award-winning novel, Tamil writer Cho Dharman talks about the root-cause of environmental problems: the neglect of the man-made water-bodies of our past

Seated on electrical cables in small groups, they went ‘ki ki ki’ all morning. “The karichan (drongo) were having a serious conversation about something,” says Tamil writer Cho Dharman. He noticed the birds on his usual stroll in Kovilpatti where he lives, and they flutter about in the pages of Sool (Adayalam Publications), the novel that won him the Sahitya Akademi Award for 2019. The novel, in fact, features a lot of birdlife Dharman has been documenting, as well as beliefs people associate with birds. But at its core, are man-made water bodies in villages that were chiefly used for irrigation.

“Commissioned by kings, and protected in their later years by zamindars, and then by the British, these water-bodies are now in the control of government departments such as Public Works, Forest, and Mineral Resources,” says the author, who was recently in the city for an event organised by The Hindu and Kovai Nanneri Kazhagam. “Sool talks about how we have failed to protect these water bodies, whose numbers stood at 39,640 as of 1947 when the Britishers handed them over to us.”

There were several kinds, meant for several purposes. “Neeraavi were used to store drinking water and men were designated to watch over them at night,” says the 67-year-old. Then there were oorani that people used for bathing their cattle; and kanmai were used for irrigation. These systems ensured that water was stored and used optimally, which was extremely important in Southern Tamil Nadu, where “there was no life without rains.” Dharman says that farmers used traditional wisdom to survive even in the toughest of times. “But somehow, we have failed to utilise this in its entirety,” he feels.

If our kanmai were in working condition, farmers today would have been in a much better position. “They would never have been forced to let their lands fallow and move to bigger cities for a livelihood. I myself gave up farming on my 10 acres of land due to lack of water,” he says. “Our kanmai are all covered by thorn bushes now,” he rues. The word ‘sool’, he says, is from ‘sooli’, that denotes a pregnant woman. “The novel’s title stands for life water nurtures,” he points out.

Woven along the storyline, are myths and stories from the farming community of the Southern districts. “For instance, something as crucial as which monsoon will reward them that year, was predicted based on the direction of the exit window of a weaver bird’s nest,” says Dharman. “And they always got it right.”

The work of fiction took him 10 years of on-field research. “But I wrote it in a year,” he says, adding, “I needed information directly from the farmers themselves,” he explains. “I also studied birds and have documented those that were once seen, but have gradually disappeared due to changes in the landscape they frequented.” His neighbourhood, for instance, is now full of sunflower and corn fields. “What can birds feed on? Farmers have stopped cultivating millets, a major food source for birds.”

Dharman is drawn to the natural world and enjoys talking about it, especially to college students. “I travel through the year for lectures since my works are part of the curriculum of Tamil Literature students,” he says. “I would call my times with students ‘Zen moments’. I cherish them, for I didn’t get the chance to go to college myself. I discontinued my studies after Class X.”

The author, who has written four novels, two anthologies of short stories, novellas, and essays, has been writing for 35 years now. He gave up a comfortable job in a textile mill to take to writing full-time. “I was 43 years old then. My wife and I had a discussion as to what I should give up on: my writing or work at the mill,” he says. His wife is no more now, and Dharman lives alone in an old house, and spends most part of his days writing with his fountain pen.

“My day starts at 4.45 am,” he says. “I usually don’t have breakfast and write for five hours in the morning on an empty stomach.” He then walks to A1 Hotel down the road, and has a simple vegetarian meal. Dharman spends his evenings chatting with his writer friends at their usual hangout on a playground behind the Shenbaga Valli Amman temple. But his most precious hours of the day are when he does a spot of fishing by a kanmai nearby. “This is when I meditate over my stories,” he says. “I may appear to be sitting all by myself, but in fact, I will be surrounded by my characters.”",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/society/h0r75q/article30971587.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MPCHODHARMAN1,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/stories-by-the-pond/article30971589.ece
440,2020/03/03,Paro Anand and Sarah Rose collaborate for 'A Very Naughty Dragon',"Author Paro Anand and nine-year-old Sarah Rose talk about working together for their latest book

This is not one of those scary mean dragons. Draco, the protagonist of A Very Naughty Dragon (Scholastic), only wants to be big like his father and go on hunts. But before that he has to negotiate a bunch of bullies and build self confidence.

The book is a collaboration between well-known author Paro Anand and nine-year-old Sarah Rose. When Paro’s publisher told her that her earlier book, A Very Naughty Bear, was doing well, she thought of A Very Naughty… series.

‘“I turned to Sarah, my friend, Jaya's daughter and a voracious reader, and asked her to suggest an animal. Without a moment's hesitation, she said, ‘Komodo Dragons’. I said, ‘That’s a great idea, but I don’t know enough about them.’ Confidently she said, ‘I know quite a bit and I could do the research for you’.” Sarah has been “fascinated by Komodo dragons” since she was in Class 2. “I know a lot about them,” she says happily.

The collaboration was not token, Paro is very clear. “It was a 50-50 partnership. Through my travels, working on another novel and Sarah's long school hours and multiple extracurricular activities, we had Face Time discussions and e-mail conversations. It was actually much smoother and easier than I thought. Certainly easier than a collaboration I did with a gentleman who is a professional writer,” she adds wryly.

However she is a bit disappointed at having to edit out one input from Sarah; “that Draco eats his parents because he is rather fed up with them! You know how it is; some parents feel that children will do exactly what they read in a story and then, heaven knows, the book may have been banned!”

Sarah explains that Paro “would guide me when I got something wrong, correct me and invite me to parties. She would also help me whenever I got stuck. It was a great experience working with her.”

Of course, both their takeaways from their collaboration differ. Sarah has learnt that “it takes a lot of time, effort and planning to write a book. And when you think that you can now relax, you have to still do some work.” Paro says she “relinquished all ego. I wasn't a senior writer giving a chance to a little kid; we were equal partners with great respect for each other. Second, what made it so perfect was how well-read Sarah was and how her school/parents had taught her the art of research. She knew how to engage with story and also had the wonderful ability to take a fact and, as she says, ‘turn it upside down’. It added a fun and unexpected element to our work that I have never got writing on my own.”

I wonder why they call Draco naughty, when he’s actually very determined. Sarah agrees but argues that “he snuck out of his home to practice and went a little too far. He left his home against his parents’ permission.” Paro, on the contrary, says this never occurred to her.

While Sarah says she would like to write more, “individually and in collaboration”, Paro has a lot happening. “I have finally finished a novel on displacement: being driven out of one's homeland and finding one’s roots again,” she says. “Told from the point of view of two very different young girls: a Kashmiri Pandit girl and a child from a made-up tribe of the highlands. I have been working on it for over two years but it's more relevant today than when I started it.”

She’s also very excited about “a fellowship from the Takshila Foundation that will publish my new writings in Hindi. My books have been translated into foreign languages, but not those of my country.” She is also working on a book that “examines the ideas of freedom and how it means different things to different people.”",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/mj91jg/article30971543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Paro-Sarah,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/paro-anand-and-sarah-rose-collaborate-for-a-very-naughty-dragon/article30971547.ece
441,2020/03/03,This family adopted a turtle in another continent,"This Chennai family’s love for conservation pans three generations and two continents

1987, 2012, 2020. These are key years in this decades-long love story which is still going strong. At the centre of it is a red-crowned roof turtle at Madras Crocodile Bank Trust.

This particular species is a critically endangered one, the crucial reason being years of human interference creating habitat loss due to sand mining, illegal fishing, and poaching of eggs and meat. The one at Croc Bank was brought in for captive breeding in 2012. It is just one of numerous endangered crocodiles, turtles, tortoises and other reptiles that have been in the care of the conservation organisation since its founding in 1976 by Romulus and Zai Whitaker. The bank’s efforts at conservation and awareness have been both spirited and creative, including everything from field research to the making of animated short films. Among the latter, an intriguing one that is relevant to our story is called Mudalai (Dost Magarmachh) — My friend The Crocodile. Released in 1987, the animated film received multiple awards over the years, and starred the voices of many big and small actors from the Tamil film industry. Needless to say, the film left an impact not only on children who saw it, but also adults who were a part of it, including an actor called Amarasigamani, the father of our protagonist Parthiban.

Factfile The Madras Crocodile Bank has seen only two adopters over 2018 and 2019

The website has a list of animals up for adoption, and an adoption form

The cost varies, and covers the animal’s feed, maintenance, vet care, and signage

“He was one of the voice actors for the film, and was deeply moved by it. He has kept in touch with the Crocodile Bank since, and made sure I did, too,” says Parthiban over a short overseas phone call. For Parthiban, raised in Chennai, a curiosity about the environment and an attachment to the Crocodile Bank has sustained despite rlocating to Ericson, Finland, years ago. “I still follow the bank’s social media handles and keep tabs on what is happening. I also visit it without fail on my annual trips back home,” he says.

Much needed dialogue

This mindset is something he couldn’t have let go of even if he had wanted to, he adds, because the school that his daughter Aadhya (who, incidentally, was born in 2012) attends in Finland, places environmental education on high priority. “The children learn all about sustainability. They go on walks, explore Nature around them, build a sense of curiosity...” Parthiban wanted to contribute to this aspect of his daughter’s upbringing, and also expand it towards his homeland. “I wanted her to know about the Nature and wildlife of India, and also to forge the same connection that I have with Chennai. But I wasn’t sure how,” he says.

And then one day, he saw an announcement online: a notice for adoption, posted by his childhood haunt. “I saw the campaign on their Facebook page; there were a number of animals and their details, and we could choose to contribute to the upkeep of one or more of them.” For Parthiban, this was his chance to create a bond between his daughter and the Croc Bank. For Aadhya, it was a one-of-a-kind gift for her seventh birthday — a red-crowned roof turtle adopted in her name, this February.

Says the father, “I didn’t know much about the species till we read up on it, only that it is critically endangered.” The freshwater turtle, one of 24 species endemic to India, is characterised by the bright colours of courtship — red, yellow, white and blue — on the faces and necks of the males. They mainly inhabit the Chambal river, and Aadhya has only seen them in photographs. But she does know that a plaque carrying her name hangs by an enclosure housing the one at the Crocodile Bank, “and that we will be visiting it soon,” says Parthiban.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/xa06q/article30972321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4MPRedroofCrownedTurtlejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/this-world-wildlife-day-we-look-at-a-family-that-adopted-a-turtle-in-another-continent/article30972323.ece
442,2020/03/03,Guruvayur Padmanabhan: The elephant who posed like a film star,"Elephant lovers recall moments with Kerala’s celebrity elephant, who passed away recently. He is remembered for his gentle personality and majestic bearing

When elephant lovers speak of Guruvayur Padmanabhan, their voices soften. The affection for the animal is hard to miss. They speak in unison of the revered jumbo’s calmness. More so today after the proverbial gentle giant, passed away on February 27.

The 80-year-old, nine footer was born in the Nilambur forests, from where he was brought to Alathur (Palakkad) before being taken to Ottappalam. He was offered to the Guruvayur temple in 1954, as a 14-year-old.

Mural artist KU Krishnakumar, Principal, Institute of Mural Art in Guruvayur painted the legendary tusker three years ago. “He enjoyed the company of people. He was silent and majestic. Being in the temple for more than 70 years he knew the temple routine—pooja timings, time for panchavadyam. He knew all the tantris and the people who visited the temple regularly, almost like friends,” he says. Krishnakumar says he chose to paint the animal, a 3x2 ft work, as he had “gaja lakshanam, all the features of an ideal elephant.”

Palakkad-based elephant photographer Aneesh Sankarankutty who has seen Padmanabhan since the mid-1990s says, “he was calm and nothing would unnerve him. He wouldn’t move when the thidambu (a miniature image of the presiding deity) was placed on his head. Usually elephants tend to shake or move their heads, but not Padmanabhan.”

He was considered second only to the legendary Guruvayur Kesavan and took his place in popular imagination after Kesavan’s death in 1976. “There might be larger or taller elephants, but not one matches him when it comes to his aura,” says Aneesh AA, a melam artist from Thrissur.

Supreme court advocate, Renjith Marar who is also a chenda player saw Padmanabhan for the first time in 2000-01, at a temple festival in Tripunithura. “Those were the days when there was a revival of temple festivals and elephants were becoming stars of such shows. There were almost no restrictions with regard to the ezhunnallippu (processions) as well. Padmanabhan had thus become a star in my mind as well,” he says.

One of the oldest captive elephants in the country, Padmanabhan has been part of several temple festivals and processions across Kerala, from Thiruvananthapuram to Palakkad.

“In areas around Palakkad, he was the first choice. The question of another elephant arose only if he was unavailable,” says Aneesh Sankarankutty. He was awarded the ‘Gajaratnam’ title for his physical attributes — a trunk, which touches the ground, and shape. He created history, in 2004, when he was given a procession fee of ₹2,22,222, one of the highest at the time, for the Vellangi-Nenmara Vela (temple festival).

“The loss of Padmanabhan is a loss both for the Guruvayur Devaswom and also elephant lovers,” says Sanjeev Shenoy, a Kochi-based elephant owner. He remembers how at the anakotta (elephant sanctuary in Guruvayur) he offered the elephant a few plantains. “I wanted a photograph with him. The mahout suggested giving him fruit. I did and how he posed: like a film star.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/yi1iu8/article30971523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPGURUVAYOORPADMANABHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/elephant-lovers-recall-moments-with-keralas-celebrity-elephant-guruvayoor-padmanabhan-who-passed-away-recently/article30971524.ece
