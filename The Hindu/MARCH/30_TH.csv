0,2020/03/30,International Table Tennis Federation rankings as of March 2020 stays,"Paddlers await decision on points earned this month

The International Table Tennis Federation’s (ITTF) decision on Sunday to freeze the rankings as of March 2020 (only points awarded for events held until February will be taken into consideration) due to COVID-19 has many paddlers questioning the fate of tournaments that took place this month.

The ITTF decided, among other things, on the “suspension of all currently planned events and activities that involve international travel until June 30 and freezing of ITTF rankings lists as of March 2020 and further evaluations of all implications related to the postponement of events, travel restrictions and other complications with scope for further decisions on potentially necessary adjustments.”

Sharath Kamal, who won his first title in a decade at the Oman Open ITTF Challenge Plus (March 11 to 15), is keeping his fingers crossed. The 37-year-old said he is hopeful that his 1100 points will be added when the rankings list is released.

Speaking to The Hindu here on Monday, Sharath said: “Will the ITTF add my Oman Open ranking points? [Indian paddler] G. Sathiyan believes they will. If the ITTF includes my points in the rankings [which were supposed to be released in April], I will be in the top 30.” He is now ranked 38.

No clarity

With the Hong Kong Open and China Open in May being cancelled/postponed and the Korea Open and Australia Open not happening in June, Sharath said there was no clarity on when the rankings will be released.

“I hope I don’t lose the points I got by winning the Oman Open,” he said.

Harmeet Desai, the reigning Commonwealth champion who reached the semifinals at Oman, is hoping against hope that he will get his 715 ranking points. “I hope we don’t lose our points,” he said.

In response to Harmeet’s query about the points, ITTF World ranking manager Javier Angulo Luceron said: “the executive committee’s decision was to freeze the ranking as it is due to complications we had in March events [some nations couldn’t participate due to the pandemic, and the Polish Open Challenge Plus was suspended midway on March 13]. Nonetheless, the points achieved will be added and count[ed] once a decision is made about what to do with the problematic events,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/international-table-tennis-federation-rankings-as-of-march-2020-stays/article31211742.ece
1,2020/03/30,Chess | Gukesh has been forced to slow down,"The 13-year-old was just hitting good form when the pandemic struck

Last year, at the Delhi International Open GMs chess tournament, D. Gukesh became the world’s second youngest Grandmaster at 12 years, seven months and 17 days.

The youngster reached the summit, but the rest of 2019 wasn’t great for him. He had to wait until February 2020 to get his first tournament win — the Hillerod Chess Club open in Denmark — and followed it up with another win at the Cannes Open.

Just when he was hitting good form, the coronavirus pandemic scuppered his plans.

Speaking to The Hindu, Gukesh said, “After last year, I did not play well for a year, and my rating even went down. I needed to work on a few areas like openings and dealing with time pressure.”

“Winning these two tournaments has really helped my confidence. I felt I played well after a long time.”

Help from camp

One reason for the change in fortunes was the camp in January for young chess players in Chennai, organised by Microsense with chess legends Vladimir Kramnik and Boris Gelfand.

Speaking about the experience, Gukesh said, “It was a different camp. For 10 days, through the day, I focused on openings.

“It came at the right time as well since I was trying a different approach. So, it was very useful.”

Another area that Gukesh said he improved was in dealing with time pressure.

He worked extensively on the time taken for his opening with his coach Vishnu Prasanna.

Crucial wins

The wins in the last two events helped him pocket 20 points and take his Elo rating to 2563, and the 13-year-old targeted going past 2600 this year.

COVID-19, however, has forced the cancellation of tournaments in Germany and Iceland with no events likely to be held till the end of April.

Gukesh, who plays a lot of matches in a year, is not happy about this forced break.

“I would have loved to play more tournaments. I was doing well. I prefer playing a lot of tournaments, and we had planned quite a few as well. But for now, I am just playing some online tournaments conducted by Chessbase India and Chess.com.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ual2u7/article31211655.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31GUKESH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/chess-gukesh-has-been-forced-to-slow-down/article31211656.ece
2,2020/03/30,"Rescheduled Olympic Games to begin on July 23, 2021","No qualification events to be scheduled until further notice; World athletics championships moved to 2022.

The Tokyo Olympics will be held from July 23 to August 8, 2021, almost exactly a year after the Games were to commence this year.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Monday confirmed the new dates for the 32nd edition of the Games with details on handling the logistics necessitated by the decision. The Paralympics was also confirmed from August 24-September 5 next year.

The decision came after extensive discussions with all NOCs, International Federations (IFs) and the Tokyo Organising Committee. “This decision is in line with the many comments and requests we received. I hope you will appreciate that, given the many constraints, we had to take this decision without consulting you directly again,” IOC president Thomas Bach said in a communique.

Tokyo 2020 president Yoshiro Mori confirmed the decision in Tokyo. “A certain amount of time is required for the selection and qualification of athletes and for their training and preparation, and the consensus was that staging the rescheduled Games during the summer vacation in Japan would be preferable,” Mori said.

Good news

The IOC also reiterated the revised qualification systems and timelines, confirming that athletes/NOCs already qualified would retain their places while the remaining qualifiers and qualification spots would be finalised soon.

“We will continue to work closely with each IF on the necessary revisions of Tokyo 2020 qualification systems. To facilitate these adaptations, and reflecting the postponement of the Games, we are making necessary modifications to the qualification system principles to include, for example, the relaxation of the maximum two-year period and amendments to the qualification deadlines,” IOC said.

The IOC also confirmed that no further qualification events would be scheduled until further notice and announced the formation of a Task Force to look into the operational and logistical changes required, including securing sports venues, Olympic Village and hotels. Deadlines for ticketing and accreditations have also been pushed back with already purchased tickets likely to remain valid.

The decision, however, has forced several IFs to reschedule their calendar with World Athletics confirming the 2021 World Championships would now be held in 2022.

“Everyone needs to be flexible and compromise, and to that end we are now working with organisers in Oregon on new dates in 2022 for our World athletics championships. We are also in discussions with the Commonwealth Games Federation and the European Championships,” World Athletics said in a statement.

3,2020/03/30,Pakistani squash great Azam Khan dies of coronavirus in London,"He won the British Open title successively between 1959 and 1961

Pakistani squash great Azam Khan has died of coronavirus in London, his family said.

Azam, who won the British Open title successively between 1959 and 1961, had tested positive for COVID-19 last week and died at London’s Ealing Hospital on Saturday. He was 95.

Younger brother of the legendary Hashim Khan, Azam is widely regarded as one the best squash players in the world. He left playing due to an Achilles tendon injury and the tragic death of his 14-year old son in 1962.

Even though he recovered from his injury two years later, Azam said he could not get over the death of his son.

Born at Nawakille, a small village outside Peshawar, which is known for producing squash world champions like brothers Jahangir and Jansher Khan. Azam had settled in the U.K. in 1956.

He had also won the most important hardball tournament, the U.S. Open, for the first time in 1962.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/hc84pv/article31203592.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30AZAM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/pakistani-squash-great-azam-khan-dies-of-coronavirus-in-london/article31203593.ece
4,2020/03/30,Radjabov wants his place back in Candidates,"Azerbaijan’s World No. 9 considers legal options

The coronavirus seems to have caught up with the Candidates chess tournament, too.

Until it was stopped mid-way at Yekaterinburg on Thursday, it was the world's only major sporting event that went ahead as planned. But, the Russian government's ban of international flights forced the world chess governing body, FIDE, to adjourn the tournament.

That decision, however, has thrown up a new problem for FIDE. And it could go all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (when normalcy returns, of course).

Teimour Radjabov, who had pulled out after FIDE turned down his request to postpone the tournament in view of the virus outbreak, is considering legal options. The World No. 9 feels he should be allowed to compete in the Candidates now that FIDE has adjourned the event because of the pandemic.

There are top players who feel Radjabov has been denied justice. Among them are Russia's Sergey Karjakin and India's P. Harkrishna, ranked 17th and 27th respectively in the world.

“I hope at least now FIDE will accept responsibility and apologise,” Harikrishna tweeted.

Radjabov wants more than an apology, of course. “Once you are considering starting the event in these circumstances you, first of all, have to make some kind of analysis in the General Assembly of FIDE. There are people who have to talk to each other and decide on the situation,” the World No. 9 from Azerbaijan told chess.com.

He added: “I think FIDE should take some action to include me back in the tournament. I think I have did everything possible - asked them, warned them. I also warned the chess community.”

But, allowing Radjabov back into the tournament may not be easy. After he withdrew, FIDE invited Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France.

“If Radjabov were to be included in the field, he would have to play all eight participants and only after that the second half of this round-robin tournament could be conducted,” Mumbai-based Grandmaster Pravin Thipsay told The Hindu.

“I don't think FIDE could be blamed entirely for the situation.

“Things weren't this bad when the tournament started. Nevertheless, I feel FIDE should compensate Radjabov financially.”

The Azerbaijan national team, comprising five GMs, has also come out in support of Radjabov, through an open letter to FIDE, demanding his re-instation in the World championship qualifying cycle.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/p0ke0b/article31200224.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30RADJABOV,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/radjabov-wants-his-place-back-in-candidates/article31200225.ece
5,2020/03/30,"Wimbledon will be cancelled, says tennis official","Wimbledon organisers will announce the cancellation of the grasscourt Grand Slam this week due to the coronavirus pandemic, German Tennis Federation (DTB) vice-president Dirk Hordorff has told Sky Sports.

All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) officials earlier said the June 29-July 12 event would not be played behind closed doors and postponement was not without significant risk and difficulty.

“Wimbledon has stated that they will have a board meeting next Wednesday and will make the final decision there,” Hordorff told Sky Sports Germany.

“I am also involved in the bodies of the ATP and WTA. The necessary decisions have already been made there and Wimbledon will decide to cancel next Wednesday. There is no doubt about it. This is necessary in the current situation,” he said.

“It is completely unrealistic to imagine that with the travel restrictions that we currently have an international tennis tournament where hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world would travel. That is unthinkable,” he added.

The AELTC did not respond to a request for comment.

The postponement of the Tokyo Olympics opened up a two-week window in the tennis calendar in July/August but it is less likely that it will be feasible for Wimbledon, which has only two covered courts and cannot be held past late summer.

French Open organisers stunned the tennis world by unilaterally postponing the claycourt Grand Slam at Roland Garros from May until late September because of the pandemic.

The French Tennis Federation (FFT) came under heavy fire from tennis players around the world at the lack of communication as the new dates clashed with several other events already featuring on the calendar.

The men's ATP Tour and the WTA, which runs women's tournaments, require their players to participate at the four Grand Slams, but the new French Open dates are yet to feature on the calendars of either association.

“The unilateral behaviour of the organizers has been criticized by everyone and I can simply predict that the French Open will not be relocated as it was intended,” Hordorff said.

He said either the FFT would go ahead with the new dates and feel the wrath of the entire tennis world or they have the option to start working with others to draw up a plan that makes sense for everyone.

“They will be deprived of the points and they will degenerate into a chaos event,” he said. “Even those there have understood that and they are slowly crawling back. Solidarity is the order of the day, it is a matter of being together and not going it alone, as the president of the French Tennis Association did.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/fmjiaz/article31204207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1214887183THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/wimbledon-will-be-cancelled-says-tennis-official/article31204208.ece
6,2020/03/30,Today’s cache | The spread of misinformation and more,"Today's cache is your daily download of the top 5 updates from the world of technology.

The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed our day-to-day lives. It has shut more than a billion people in their homes and sickened over three-quarter million globally. While we access news and information on various online and social media platforms, it helps in de-cluttering mis- and dis-information.

We are tracking misinformation in the age of COVID-19 starting with Google’s banning InfoWars app on its Play Store. Then, Hungary’s controversial new law that allows the government to jail people for spreading misinformation.

Followed by, interviews of Facebook’s Nick Clegg, and Johns Hopkins University’s computer scientist on how they are managing misinformation. And lastly, how you can combat the menace of misinformation.

Google Bans InfoWars’ Android app

Search giant Google removed the infamous conspiracy theorist Alex Jones’s Android app from its Play Store on Friday.

The removal follows a video posted on the app that disputed the need for staying at home, social distancing, and quarantine efforts meant to slow the spread of COVID-19.

According to Google Play’s metric, Infowars app had more than 100,000 downloads, and could be accessed by users over the age of 10. Google confirmed to WIRED that it removed the app on Friday.

The takedown by Google’s Play Store removes one of the last mainstream outlets for InfoWars’ content.

Earlier, Apple pulled several podcasts linked to Alex Jones from its iTunes in August 2018. Hours later, Facebook unpublished four pages associated with Mr. Jones on reports that videos posted on the social media giant’s site violated policies on hate speech.

YouTube suspended Mr. Jones’ channel that had more than 2.4 million subscribers on the same day.

Mr. Jones and his supporters maintain that mainstream bans such as these will only further the spread and popularise his content.

However, research shows actions taken by Big Tech firms will effectively cut misinformation and reduce hate speech.

Hungary set to pass law on spreading misinformation

Hungary is set to pass a new law on coronavirus. The proposed law includes imprisonment for spreading misinformation.

The bill will also introduce jail terms of up to five years for spreading misinformation, Guardian reported.

The proposed legislation does not have a time limit or sunset clause. That may be used to censor criticism of the government response indefinitely.

“This bill would create an indefinite and uncontrolled state of emergency and give Viktor Orbán and his government carte blanche to restrict human rights,” said David Vig, Amnesty International’s Hungary director.

“This is not the way to address the very real crisis that has been caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.”

While the opposition supports the bill based on the current emergency situation, it still seeks a time limit on the legislation. But the incumbents are clear to pass the bill without the sunset clause, claimed an opposition MP.

How is Facebook mitigating misinformation during COVID-19 outbreak

As the COVID-19 pandemic shuts more people indoors, netizens are gleaning more information that flows through their social media accounts.

Users are constantly bombarded with misinformation on conspiracy theories about coronavirus’ origin and phony cures to try at home

Facebook’s Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs and communications, said in an interview with NPR’s All Things Considered that the company will remove coronavirus-related information that has the potential to cause physical harm.

""So, if people say drinking bleach is going to help you vaccinate yourself against coronavirus — that is dangerous,” he said.

“We will not allow that to happen. We won't even allow folks to say social distancing makes no difference in dealing with this pandemic.""

Through educational pop-ups and a new COVID-19 information center, the social media giant has directed more than a billion people on Facebook and Instagram to resources from the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and regional health authorities.

On WhatsApp, users are given an option to sign up to receive health alerts from WHO. That also provides tips on preventing the spread of coronavirus.

Facebook has also donated $1 million to International Fact-Checking Network to expand the presence of fact-checking organisations on WhatsApp so that people can submit rumours they find directly to fact-checkers for verification.

Tracking information flow on public health in social media

An associate professor and his team of researchers at the Johns Hopkins University recently launched a social media for public health website.

Dr. Mark Dredze and his team aim to combat misinformation, support messaging from public health organisation and track information about the COVID-19 pandemic.

“It's critical to use social media to understand what kind of information is being shared and what people believe in order to ensure effective policy,” Dr. Dredze said in an interview to the Hub, the University’s news center.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) adapts its messaging based on the information people share on their social media, he added.

For instance, the CDC saw a surge in the number of people discussing a drug that can help cure COVID-19.

The CDC team crafted a message that warned the public of the dangers in using unapproved drugs.

Dr. Dredze sees social media evolving with this pandemic as the platform is becoming a tool reinforce collective action. For example, social distancing and self-quarantine messages sent around social media are generating good information.

On the pitfalls of the social platforms, Dr. Dredze sees sharing rumours and misinformation have a negative impact on messaging.

He cited an example of receiving a forwarded picture of tanks in San Diego. The post claimed that the U.S. Army and the National Guard are deployed to enforce quarantine. The message was false as there aren’t any tanks in San Deigo.

As a rule of thumb, he recommends users to first check the source of information on the messages they receive.

“Be sceptical and consult a trusted authority,” he said.

How to combat COVID-19 misinformation

None of us are immune to misinformation on COVID-19 that is spreading as the coronavirus itself. From that suggestion to holding your breath for 10 seconds to a hot water bath that can kill the virus, we are pounded by unsubstantiated information.

Most recently, the claim that the antimalarial chloroquine is a miracle drug made U.S. President Donald Trump call it “a tremendous breakthrough.” A man from Arizona drank it on the advise of the President, and later died.

The jury is still out on the efficacy of the “so-called” miracle drug.

So, here are some suggestion from The Atlantic on what you can do when a friend or family member sends you information about the coronavirus:

Consider the source: Examine the message before passing it on or accepting it as fact. Check it against trusted authorities such as WHO or CDC.

Check your own biases: Our minds tend to look for information that confirms what we already believe. This is called a filter bubble, which leads to inaccurate conclusions. So, try switching to an information flow that is opposite to your world view. This will provide an alternative perspective

Be empathetic: When confronting the message, the messenger may get more convinced of the truth of their belief. So, it helps to be helpful than being right. So, respond gently and allow for people to discover the facts for themselves.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/5621ck/article31211029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THTODAYSCACHE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/todays-cache-the-spread-of-misinformation-and-more/article31211030.ece
7,2020/03/30,Wings Powerpods review: A budget-friendly break into the truly wireless,"The earbuds have a display for battery power on its charging case

Few people would have heard of Wings Lifestyle; they are not exactly a brand readily available in your big name tech retailer. But when brands do the most to offer something a little different to a fast-changing market, it is always worth diving in to see how they score. Enter the PowerPods by Wings Lifestyle.

The PowerPods are the strongest in Wings’ true wireless earbuds line, being a 2000mAh bump-up from their predecessor, the Touch. Unlike most true wireless devices, the PowerPods charge horizontally in the cocoon-like charging case, which is obviously a little weighted due to the 2500mAh battery in the charging case. It has a comfortable feel in the palm with its matte finish on the case and glossy finish on the display (we will get to the latter in a bit).

The charging display is a welcome feature, especially with my knack for waiting till the last minute to charge something — in fact, this is what lured me into reviewing the product in the first place. However, I will not find myself tempted to use the charging case as it has become habitual to carry an independent power bank.

For a broader picture, the charging case offers 10 complete charges to the earbuds. Plus, the case has two interesting features: it has a numeric display to show the exact charging left in the battery, and it also has a power bank function, which explains the USB-B port and the micro-USB port at the rear.

The magnetic lock for the earbuds keeps the devices neatly secure and the demarcation of left and right earbuds is clear yet not overzealous. Once they are removed from the case, they automatically turn on and immediately pair with each other. The turquoise ring light on each PowerPod is not too bright and glaring, and a pleasant break from the cheesy bright blue or purple we see in such devices. Bluetooth pairing with your smartphone or smartwatch is easy, and I actually found the pairing for the PowerPods to be the easiest of the earbuds I have reviewed so far.

So how do these little guys do their job? First, they sit lightly in the ear but not loosely, so they are quite good for a dynamic workout such as aerobics or pilates stretches. The PowerPods are able to handle maximum volume with practically no scratches and uncomfortable bass. The overall sound profile is quite warm for something that is in the budget-friendly market, but do not expect to be blown away by zesty layers in even the most well-recorded tracks. They do not entirely cancel environmental noise, helping maintain some spatial awareness.

Overall, though, the PowerPods offer an excellent value for money experience for a brand that is fairly incognito on the continental gadget radar.

Wings PowerPods are exclusively available on Amazon India for ₹4,499.

As India is under lockdown for nearly a week now, the government has said the 21-day period will not be extended. The country is seeing a spurt in the number of coronavirus cases, with Gujarat, Punjab and West Bengal reporting deaths. The Hindu has brought out a multi-language e-book on essential COVID-19 information, in addition to covering the developments related to the coronavirus pandemic as it unfolded.

The government on Monday said there was no plan to extend the 21-day lockdown which came intro force on Tuesday midnight.

Migrant labourers returning to their homes from cities were forced by the administration in Bareilly to take an open bath in groups with disinfectant before they were allowed entry into the district.

Britain’s Prince Charles came out of self-isolation on Monday, seven days after it was confirmed that he had tested positive for coronavirus, a royal spokesperson said. The 71-year-old heir to the British throne had been self-isolating on the Queen’s Balmoral estate in Scotland after he had been tested by the National Health Service (NHS) in Aberdeenshire last week.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the subsequent work-from-home imperatives and lockdowns have led to significant economic disruptions around the world. As several millions of workers across diverse sectors are asked to self-quarantine, an understanding of the impact of this shift and mitigation strategies becomes critical. The insights from prior studies on the impact of work from home arrangements do not extend to the current context since these arrangements were mostly limited to a select group of workers and/or organizations and were often self-selected.

The Tokyo Olympics will open next year in the same time slot scheduled for this year’s games. Tokyo organizers said on Monday the opening ceremony will take place on July 23, 2021 — almost exactly one year after the games were due to start this year.

The Supreme Court on Monday sought a report from the government on steps taken about the largescale inter-State movement of migrant workers during the 21-day national lockdown on account of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Around 200 people were taken from Nizamuddin area in New Delhi to various hospitals by district authorities after they developed coronavirus symptoms, said a police officer on Monday.

The Congress on Monday asked the Union government to pay 70% of the wage bill of the micro, small and medium (MSME) enterprises for the next three months and make it mandatory for the employers not to retrench their employees for the next six months.

Iran had 117 new COVID-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, bringing the total to 2,757, a health ministry spokesman said on Monday, prompting the Middle East's worst-hit country to consider tougher curbs on movement.

Spain confirmed another 812 deaths in 24 hours from COVID-19 on Monday, bringing the total number of deaths to 7,340, according to health ministry figures.

India on Sunday reported more than 100 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the overall case load to 979. “There have been six deaths in the past 24 hours,” said Joint Secretary in the Union Health Ministry Lav Agrawal at a briefing. “We have identified certain emerging hotspots and [will] investigate, on a war footing, what action can be taken there,” he added. However, none of the officials at the briefing specified the hotspots or the number of cases at these locations.

The battle against COVID-19 gets women ‘warriors’ in Kashmir. Fashion designers, small-time tailors and students volunteer to tide over the shortage of masks, body-bags and personal protective equipment vital for the front-line health workers. Sadia Mufti, 28, is a popular fashion designer and owner of Hangers, a boutique in Srinagar. This time, it’s not kurtis or khaftan she has innovated upon, but personal protective equipment.

The hearings before a nine-judge Supreme Court Bench on the ambit and scope of religious freedom practised by multiple faiths across the country lie in limbo due to the COVID-19 scare. The Bench led by Chief Justice of India S.A. Bobde is hearing this reference on the question of religious freedom in connection with the Sabarimala case.

Health authorities in Tamil Nadu are worried about the health status of about 1,500 people from Tamil Nadu, who reportedly attended a Thowheed Jamaath conference in Nizamuddin, Delhi. They are equally concerned about the possibility of cases spreading from these people. Sources said there is just cause for alarm as a high percentage of those who were tested turned out to be coronavirus positive in the group.

There are a lot of scientific terms being bandied about during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s a short primer on the key aspects everyone should be aware of.

In India, the growth of COVID-19 cases has neither been exponential nor has it flattened out. The curve lies somewhere in the middle. But this picture is misleading as India has a poor testing rate. Despite the fact that India has among the lowest % of positive cases of those tested, the 21-day lockdown, which began on March 25, may not be enough. This is borne out in countries which imposed lockdowns but saw a surge in cases later.

President Donald Trump is extending the voluntary national shutdown for a month as sickness and death from the coronavirus pandemic rises in the U.S. The initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government expires Monday and Mr. Trump earlier expressed interest in relaxing the national guidelines at least in parts of the country less afflicted by the pandemic. But instead he decided to extend them through April 30, a tacit acknowledgement he’d been too optimistic.

New York State’s coronavirus death toll is nearing 1,000, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. The State accounts for more than 40% of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. The number of disease-related deaths in the State jumped Sunday to 965 from 728 the day before, he said. The vast majority have been in New York City. Figures released Sunday morning showed 678 coronavirus deaths in the city, which continues to be the epicentre of the pandemic in the U.S.

Germany and the U.K. have approached the Indian government expressing their interest to charter Air India’s flights to facilitate the return of their nationals stranded in India following travel restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19, according to several officials. Between March 31 and April 3, the Air India will operate nine flights to Frankfurt with its 256-seater Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft.

Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday ordered the “cessation of all movements” for two weeks in the largest city Lagos and capital Abuja to stop the spread of coronavirus. “All citizens in these areas are to stay in their homes starting Monday,” Mr. Buhari announced in a televised address to the nation. “Travel to or from other States should be postponed. All businesses and offices within these locations should be fully closed during this period,” he said.

The 21-day lockdown in India due to the Coronavirus pandemic may not be as tough as the thought of not playing the Indian Premier League. The teenager had a splendid ICC U-19 World Cup in South Africa and he had started preparing for his maiden IPL for Rajasthan Royals but the Covid-19 outbreak stands in front of his dreams.

Speaking to The Hindu from his home in Mumbai, India cricket coach Ravi Shastri said, “there is total gloom at the moment. The thing (virus) is flying everywhere. It would be foolish to talk about cricket in these times. It should be the last thing on your mind at the moment. Safety of the people is most important. Whatever precautions have to be taken should get priority. As said in no uncertain terms by the Prime Minister. We need to understand the gravity of the situation.”

10,2020/03/30,Coronavirus | Opposition urges Sri Lankan govt. to reconvene Parliament,"‘President can’t approve funds to fight COVID-19 after April 30’

Nearly a month after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved Parliament and called for elections, the Opposition’s calls for reconvening the legislature have grown louder in Sri Lanka.

A day after the Parliament completed 4.5 years of its term — constitutionally mandated for dissolution — President Rajapaksa dissolved the 225-member legislature and called snap general elections for April 25. However, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has also affected the island nation, the Election Commission postponed the polls indefinitely.

Health authorities on Monday confirmed the country’s second COVID-19 death, of its 122 confirmed cases. Fourteen persons have recovered, according to the Health Promotion Bureau. Sri Lanka has been on curfew for over a week, as authorities try to contain the spread of the deadly virus.

However, several former MPs from Sri Lanka’s political opposition have urged the government to reconvene Parliament.

Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has noted that the President cannot approve any expenses towards COVID-19 after April 30. “Funds have been allocated for the government through the Vote on Account until the 30th of April. From that day onwards until the new Parliament is convened again, the President does not have powers to approve additional expenses. We cannot predict as to when the new Parliament would be convened. This is a crisis,” he said in a recent statement.

Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Rauff Hakeem had made the point at the all-party leaders’ meeting convened by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa on March 24. “I had to point out the need to re-summon Parliament to show the nation that we are united in this hour of national emergency,” Mr. Hakeem said.

Former Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera pointed to Section 70 (7) of the Constitution, which empowers the President to convene Parliament in an emergency and said it existed “precisely for such an eventuality.”

“In challenging times, it is also constitutionally proper to have the people’s representatives meet to steer the country through these perilous waters,” he said in a recent statement.

Tamil National Alliance spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran on Sunday tweeted: Calling President @GotabayaR to invoke Art70(7) and re-convene Parliament to deal with the emergency. We can follow Maldives,” he said, referring to Male’s initiative to convene parliament online.

However, government spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said the necessity to reconvene Parliament “hasn’t arisen yet.” “Whether there is parliament or not, everything is moving…things can’t be smoother,” he told The Hindu, adding that the government was using “provisions available in the Constitution”.

“Democracy is very important, no question, but in a situation like this the executive is better positioned to take and implement swift decisions. Parliamentary debates and discussions tend to be time-consuming,” Mr. Rambukwella said.

The use of executive powers, however, concerns some. Observing that people were in “no mood to think of elections during this unprecedented turmoil” Mr. Hakeem said in a statement: “But, in this milieu, are we to sanction unconstitutional executive convenience to gradually move towards authoritarianism?”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kndv31/article31212329.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31-SRILANKA-BATTLINGTHEVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/opposition-urges-sri-lankan-govt-to-reconvene-parliament/article31212330.ece
11,2020/03/30,Greek resistance hero Glezos passes away,"He remained an activist even in old age

Manolis Glezos, who died Monday at the age of 97, was a Greek resistance hero who tore down the Nazi swastika flag from the Acropolis during the Second World War, survived two death sentences and remained an activist even in old age.

State TV ERT said he had died in an Athens hospital. Mr. Glezos was a loud voice on the Greek left throughout a life that saw him participate in a Communist plot that almost killed Winston Churchill and also saw him become the European Parliament’s oldest deputy at the age of 91.

He opposed his government’s austerity measures in the wake of the financial crisis and campaigned for Germany to repay money it had forced Greece to loan it during the war.

Even as he approached 90, Mr. Glezos, with his bushy moustache and shock of white hair, was often on the front line of protests.

In 2012, he was tear-gassed by riot police during an anti-austerity demonstration outside Parliament and had to receive medical treatment.

Mr. Glezos, who was elected a number of times with left-wing, Communist and socialist parties between 1951 and 2012, joined the assembly again the same year, this time under the banner of left-wing party Syriza in an honorific position reserved for people who have made a significant contribution to the country.

In 2014, he was elected to the European Parliament, becoming its oldest deputy.

Mr. Glezos was just 18 when, on May 30, 1941, he and friend Apostolos Santas, a 19-year-old law student, climbed onto the Acropolis in the middle of the night and tore down the swastika flag.

They were immediately sentenced to death in absentia by the Nazis.

Occupation forces managed to arrest the pair in March 1942, but released them a month later, unaware of their identity.

“Hitler had said in a speech that ‘Europe is free’. We wanted to show him that the fight was just beginning,” Mr. Glezos told AFP in a 2011 interview, recalling how he and Santas managed to steal the flag.

After the war, “Greece conquered its freedom, but not its independence,” he said.

“On the dependency scale, we are now running close to 100 percent, with foreigners deciding everything,” he added, referring to the conditions imposed on Athens by the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank in exchange for a bailout.

Mr. Glezos was also one of the leading campaigners for the return of loans forced on Greece by Nazi Germany during the war -- an issue which Berlin says was addressed in postwar settlements.

He estimated that Germany still owed Greece 162 billion euros ($181 billion).

In November 2014, Mr. Glezos revealed that he had been part of a Communist guerrilla plot to blow up the British army headquarters in Athens, shortly before the start of the Greek civil war.

He told the Observer weekly that he helped lay explosives under the Grande Bretagne Hotel, where the British military mission was headquartered.

But the plan was called off at the last minute when the guerrillas learned that British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was inside the building.

After the war, Mr. Glezos turned his attention to the military junta which ruled Greece from 1967 to 1974.

He was twice sentenced to death and ended up serving 12 years “in nearly all of the country's prisons,” he said.

“Lots of people went mad there,” he recalled.

His exploits had also made him something of a hero in the Soviet Union, which in 1959 issued a special stamp -- picturing him against a background of the Acropolis -- in his honour.

He had in more recent years turned his criticism toward the global economic heavyweights who he felt wielded too much power over other nations.

“The enemy is the G20, the union of imperialists,” he said, speaking of the 20 richest countries which regularly meet to discuss economic and financial strategy.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fs0tru/article31212199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31-GREECE-GLEZOS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/greek-resistance-hero-glezos-passes-away/article31212200.ece
12,2020/03/30,"COVID-19: Maldives Parliament meets online, discusses strategies","Govt. to support sectors like fishing that can ‘bounce back’

Determined to keep Parliament functional during the COVID-19 outbreak, Maldivian legislators on Monday convened online for a crucial session to discuss strategies to combat the pandemic.

As many as 71 of the 87-member House logged in on Monday using a web conferencing facility, appreciating the need for physical distancing. “Even though we are confined to our homes, our democracy is not under house arrest. The work of the Flag of Maldives People’s Majlis continues unimpeded, online,” Speaker and former President Mohamed Nasheed said in a tweet.

To help members get used to the software and iron out any technical issues, “a rehearsal of the online Parliament” was held on Saturday, according to officials in Male.

A notice on the session of Parliament — or People’s Majlis — with the agenda was sent to the MPs via text message in advance. The virtual session would “assist the Parliament of Maldives in conducting sessions remotely and continuing their workings swiftly until such time the state of emergency order is lifted,” a statement from the People’s Majlis Secretariat said.

Monday’s discussion centred on the Indian Ocean island nation’s response to COVID-19, according to the Speaker. Members’ interventions underlined the need for the Maldivian government to back only those businesses which will “bounce back”, like fishing and not the otherwise vital tourism sector that has taken a big hit due to the global pandemic.

“The sentiment was that the government must focus on a way out, into prosperity again,” Mr. Nasheed told The Hindu from Male via phone. “The MPs took to the online session like fish to water.”

The Maldives currently has two COVID-19 positive patients, who returned from the U.K., undergoing treatment. The 13 cases detected earlier this month have been cured, says government spokesman Mabrook Azeez.

However, 870 Maldivians, and foreigners working in the island, who returned after foreign travels have been quarantined for observation. “Ten resorts have been converted to quarantine centres,” Mr. Azeez said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qipulo/article31212077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Nasheed,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/covid-19-maldives-parliament-meets-online-discusses-strategies/article31212078.ece
13,2020/03/30,Interview | Doctor from Wuhan explains how China battled COVID-19,"Testing and mass quarantines helped defeat virus,says Dr. Gong Zuojiong

Wuhan, the epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, is slowly rebounding after two months in lockdown. On Sunday, Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province reported no infections for the sixth straight day, unthinkable a month ago when the city was reporting daily infections in the thousands. Dr. Gong Zuojiong, Director of the Department of Infectious Diseases at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, has been on the frontlines of the COVID-19 fight in the city. In an interview with The Hindu, he says a key lesson from Wuhan’s battle was breaking the chain of transmission through widespread testing and isolating all patients, even those with mild symptoms, away from their homes in central quarantine. Edited excerpts:

What is the present situation in terms of new infections and the current patients you are treating?

At present, COVID-19 has been brought under control through two months of prevention and management in Wuhan and Hubei province. No new patient has been diagnosed right now. However, we are still continuing strict monitoring.

What was your experience during the peak of the crisis?

At the beginning, there were too many patients that needed to be confirmed. The hospital did not have so many beds for the patients’ hospitalisation. We had a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Our hospital dedicated a separate campus, our east campus, as a designated hospital to receive severe and critical patients.

When was the ‘turning point’ achieved?

We reached the ‘turning point’ at the end of February, when the numbers of new confirmed and suspected cases dramatically decreased. Now, we are reporting zero cases.

Besides lockdown, what do you see as the most important measures in tackling the spread? What are the steps do you think should have been done differently?

For prevention and control of a high contagion, the important measures are to manage and control those infected, and break down the transmission. For those cases that were mild and moderate, we found that transferring them to the ark hospital [makeshift hospitals of which 16 were built] is a good method that we would recommend. Also, avoid people gathering. Wearing masks and hand hygiene are also important. In addition, doctors should pay more attention for finding severe cases early in order to diagnose and treat critical cases to reduce the risk of mortality.

Can you explain why centralised quarantine and isolation was followed on such a large scale, as opposed to just home isolation for mild cases?

Quarantine and home isolation depends on different countries’ conditions. In China and India, because we have such a large population, one family may have several members. Cross-infection occurs commonly. For mild and moderate type confirmed cases, the ark hospital is a good quarantine and isolation place, and this helps avoid cross-infection and breaks down the transmission.

What was the scale of testing done in Wuhan? Was it limited or widespread?

I don’t know exactly the scale of testing in the whole of Wuhan city. By the middle of January, when PCR reagents (nucleic acid testing) became available, our hospital alone tested around 1,000 samples daily. Right now, all samples can be examined because the supply of testing materials is enough. Testing for COVID-19 plays an important, even central role, because we want to find new cases and suspected cases as quickly as possible. Only then we can isolate patients and break down the transmission.

In a large population with limited resources, do you see alternatives to widespread testing?

For testing, scientists have different techniques. For example, antibodies detection and different (modified PCR) methods for nucleic acid detection could also be used. And an experienced radiologist could diagnose the suspected cases based on the CT scans.

Britain’s Prince Charles came out of self-isolation on Monday, seven days after it was confirmed that he had tested positive for coronavirus, a royal spokesperson said.

The 71-year-old heir to the British throne had been self-isolating on the Queen’s Balmoral estate in Scotland after he had been tested by the National Health Service (NHS) in Aberdeenshire last week.

“Clarence House has confirmed today (Monday) that, having consulted with his doctor, The Prince of Wales is now out of self-isolation,” his spokesperson said.

His Clarence House royal office said the prince was in “good health” and was following the government’s restrictions as he carries on working from home.

His wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, had tested negative for the deadly virus at the same time, but the 72-year-old had also been self-isolating separately in Balmoral.

The royal couple were tested last Monday after they had flown out to Scotland in a jet and have remained there since then.

“It is not possible to ascertain from whom the Prince caught the virus owing to the high number of engagements he carried out in his public role during recent weeks,” Clarence House had said at the time.

Prince Charles, who made international headlines as he switched to the non-contact ‘namaste’ as a form of greeting just as the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic, spent seven days of quarantine at his Birkhall home on the royal Balmoral estate.

The Buckingham Palace previously said 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth II last saw her son on March 12, and was “in good health” as she remains in Windsor Castle with husband Prince Philip, 98.

A governor in Somalia's Puntland has been killed in a suicide bombing claimed by the al-Shabaab jihadist group, police and hospital sources said on Monday.

Abdisalan Hassan Hersi, governor of Nugaal region, succumbed to his injuries after being rushed to hospital in Garowe, the capital of Puntland where the blast occurred Sunday.

""The doctors tried to save the governor's life but unfortunately he died from his injuries,"" Mohamed Weli, a police officer in Puntland, told AFP by phone.

""He was in a critical condition when he was admitted to hospital.""

A source at the hospital, who did not wish to be identified, said the governor died less than an hour after being admitted to the intensive care ward.

""He was badly wounded in the blast and he had little chance of surviving such serious injuries,"" the source told AFP.

A former police commander and a civilian also wounded in the blast were being treated at hospital, officials said Monday.

Several witnesses described the attacker running at the governor's vehicle before detonating a suicide vest, triggering an explosion.

21,2020/03/30,"New York State passes grim milestone of 1,000 deaths due to COVID-19","The number of coronavirus deaths in New York city increased by 161 from Saturday night to Sunday morning, pushing the Statewide total to over 1,000 fatalities, The New York Times said.

The number of deaths in New York State due to the coronavirus outbreak has crossed the 1,000 mark, with Governor Andrew Cuomo warning that thousands of people will pass away before the crisis ends in America’s current COVID-19 epicentre.

Mr. Cuomo, addressing his daily press conference on the pandemic on Sunday, said the deaths due to the massive virus outbreak in the State sharply rose from 728 to 965 in just one day. At 237, this was the largest one-day increase in number of deaths since the coronavirus outbreak began. By the end of the day, the death toll in the State crossed the 1,000-mark.

The number of coronavirus deaths in New York city increased by 161 from Saturday night to Sunday morning, pushing the Statewide total to over 1,000 fatalities, The New York Times said.

“I don’t see how you look at those numbers and conclude anything less than thousands of people will pass away. Because remember who it’s attacking, it’s attacking the vulnerable, (with) underlying illness among other. And I don’t see how you get past that curve without seeing thousands of people pass away. I hope it’s wrong.

“And we will continue to see the number of deaths increase. In terms of most impacted States, again, New York is still number one,” he said.

The grim figure of over a 1,000 deaths comes less than a month after the first known coronavirus infection was identified in the State on March 1.

A healthcare worker, who had recently returned from Iran, was the first confirmed coronavirus case in the State.

Just days later, a lawyer in the New York suburb of New Rochelle tested positive for the virus and was at the centre of one of the earliest US coronavirus clusters. Mr. Cuomo announced that the lawyer recovered sufficiently and has now gone home from the hospital.

The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the US stood at 143,025 and 2,509 people have died in the country, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Over 7,000 additional coronavirus cases in New York State were recorded, bringing the Statewide total to 59,513, Mr. Cuomo said.

New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the number of coronavirus cases in the city alone were 32,308, “a stunning number. And we have lost, and this is so painful, 678 of our fellow New Yorkers. That means in the last 24 hours from this morning to Saturday morning, we lost 161 more people in this city. People of all walks of life, every kind of New Yorker”.

The mayor said New York City remains the epicenter of the crisis nationally.

“A day will come when I will be able to no longer use that word and we all look forward to that word. But right now, we are the epicenter and the numbers are staggering,” he said.

Patients discharged

A total of about 8,000 people are currently hospitalised in New York State, including 2,000 ICU patients.

Mr. Cuomo also pointed out that 3,500 patients have been discharged.

“We know - nobody really points to these numbers but this is good news. 846 people came out of hospitals yesterday, discharged after being treated for COVID-19,” he said.

He told reporters that initially the hospitalisation rate in the State was doubling every two days, then it doubled every three days, then every four days.

“Now it’s doubling every six days. So you have almost a dichotomy: The doubling rate is slowing, and that is good news but the number of cases are still going up. So you’re still going up towards an apex, but the rate of the doubling is slowing, which is good news.”

New York on PAUSE

Earlier in the day, the Governor said in an e-mail that “tragically we have now lost almost a thousand New Yorkers to this vicious virus. We mourn them deeply. Every life lost is one too many. We are fighting to save every life we can. You can help us by staying home and slowing the spread“.

Cuomo said he is extending the “New York on PAUSE” policy until April 15, which means non-essential businesses and schools will continue to stay closed.

Gatherings of any size for any reason remain cancelled and all New Yorkers continue to be directed to practice social distancing -- by staying home and keeping six feet of space from others when in public. The State will re-evaluate after this additional two-week period.

He said “the increase on the trajectory of cases continues to climb”.

Mr. Cuomo notes as the State tries to reduce the spread of the virus, it is also preparing for the worst.

He said a 1,000 bed temporary hospital is opening at the sprawling Javits convention center on Monday, and other temporary hospitals are being built.

Three COVID-only facilities are also planned. The USNS Comfort, a Navy hospital ship, will arrive in New York Harbor on Monday, staffed with 1,200 medical professionals.

On the travel advisory issued by President Donald Trump and the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention for people of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, Mr. Cuomo said the advisory was not for a lockdown.

“It is a travel advisory to be implemented by the States. In essence, it’s nothing that we haven’t been doing. Non-essential people should stay at home. So it’s totally consistent with everything we’re doing and I support what the President did because it affirms what we’ve been doing. It also affirms what New Jersey and Connecticut have been doing,” he added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dj7r8j/article31203856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NYCKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-york-state-passes-grim-milestone-of-1000-deaths-due-to-covid-19/article31203857.ece
22,2020/03/30,Japanese comedian Ken Shimura dies of coronavirus at 70,"A household name in Japan since the 1970s, Shimura was the first prominent entertainment world figure in Japan to test positive for the virus.

Veteran Japanese comic Ken Shimura, who tested positive for the novel coronavirus last week, has died at the age of 70.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the actor was hospitalised in Tokyo on March 20 after developing a fever and being diagnosed with severe pneumonia. Shimura tested positive for COVID-19 on March 23.

Watch | Coronavirus: Can masks protect you?

The condition of Shimura, best known for Japanese variety show “Shimura Ken no Bakatono-sama”, was said not to be critical.

A household name in Japan since the 1970s, Shimura was the first prominent entertainment world figure in Japan to test positive for the virus.

The actor was set to star in his first feature film “God of Cinema”, directed by Yoji Yamada.

The film, which marks the 100th year anniversary of studio Shochiku, has been put on hold indefinitely.

Shimura grew up in the west Tokyo neighbourhood of Higashimurayama and he started his career in showbiz when he joined the Japanese rock band and comedy group The Drifters, famous for opening for The Beatles during their early tours of Japan.

He shot to fame with the group’s prime time comedy show “Hachijidayo Zeninshugo!” (“It’s 8 o’clock, assemble everyone!“), where he developed his signature brand of slapstick caricature, wacky bits and deadpan delivery.

American comedian Jerry Lewis was an initial influence on him, Shimura wrote in a late-career memoir.

On hit variety shows of the 1980s, he would go on to become a bigger name recognised for satirical characters like “Baka Tonosama” (foolish lord) and “Henna Ojisan” (weirdo uncle).",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k8cotz/article31203723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDSHIMURA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/japanese-comedian-ken-shimura-dies-of-coronavirus-at-70/article31203724.ece

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said it has reached the congressionally-mandated 65,000 H-1B cap for the fiscal year 2021 as it received enough requests from corporations and businesses.

The USCIS, the federal agency which screens and allocates H-1B applications, said it reached the cap and randomly selected among the registrations properly selected.

The fiscal year begins from October 1, 2020.

USCIS will notify the successful applicants and their companies before March 31, that they are eligible to file an H-1B cap-subject petition.

The deadline for submitting the H-1B applications by successful registrants is June 30.

Under the new H-1B Electronic Registration Process implemented this year, before the start of the application filing season on April 1, all the companies were mandatorily asked to register with the USCIS and March 20 was the last date for the registration.

USCIS said that it has received enough registration for the Congressionally-mandated cap for 65,000 H-1B visas.

In addition, USCIS also issues another 20,000 H-1B visas for those who have earned masters and higher degrees from a U.S. institution.

A man who was among the five people stabbed during a Hanukkah celebration north of New York City has died three months after the attack, according to an Orthodox Jewish organization and community liaison with a local police department.

Josef Neumann, 72, died Sunday night, the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council said in a tweet. The funeral for Neumann, a father of seven and great-grandfather, will be held Monday. No additional details were provided.

On Dec. 28, an attacker with a machete rushed into a rabbi’s home in an Orthodox Jewish community in Monsey, New York, an ambush Gov. Andrew Cuomo called an act of domestic terrorism fueled by intolerance and a “cancer” of growing hatred in America.

Rabbi Yisroel Kahan, who is the community liaison for the Ramapo Police Department that serves Monsey and executive director of Oizrim Jewish Council, shared the news of Neumann’s passing on his Twitter account as well.

“We were hoping when he started to open his eyes,” Rabbi Yisroel Kahan told The Journal News on Sunday night. “We were hoping and praying he would then pull through. This is so very sad he was killed celebrating Hanukkah with friends just because he was a Jew.”

In the days following the attack, Neumann’s family said in a statement that the knife penetrated his skull and went directly into his brain, which could have caused permanent brain damage and could leave him partially paralyzed. He also suffered other cuts to the head and neck, and his arm was shattered.

The Hanukkah attack came amid a string of violence that has alarmed Jews in the region.

Federal prosecutors said the man charged in the attack, Grafton Thomas, had handwritten journals containing anti-Semitic comments and a swastika and had researched Adolf Hitler’s hatred of Jews online. Thomas’ lawyer and relatives said he has struggled for years with mental illness; they said he was raised in a tolerant home and hadn’t previously shown any animosity toward Jewish people.

Thomas was indicted on federal hate crime charges as well as state charges, including attempted murder. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ktpe9z/article31203651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ATTACKEDDURINGHANUKKAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/man-72-wounded-in-hanukkah-stabbings-dies-from-injuries/article31203652.ece

SEWA International, a leading Indian-American non-profit organisation, has so far raised more than USD 250,000 for its COVID-19 relief efforts.

It is using the money to buy personal protective equipment’s, in particular facial masks and surgical masks, to donate free to the local law enforcement officials and hospitals in some of the hot spot areas like New York, who have run out of these essential items.

It has built a team of 500 volunteers, who have bene manning its helpline to address the concerns and questions of Americans in distress due to coronavirus.

‘Sewa Sankalp’ campaign

Its volunteers are helping more than 300 families, many of whom are elderly or those of the doctors engaged in treatment of the COVID-19 patients, with their daily groceries and masks, said Sree N Sreenath, president of the SEWA International.

Taking it to the next level, Sreenath, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Case Western Reserve University, said that the non-profit body is organising a Sewa Sankalp campaign starting Monday to bring together on one platform over 1,000 service organisations in the US to pool ideas, collaborate and build confidence in the community.

Mr.Sreenath said that a Sewa team is working with volunteers in many of its 43 chapters to produce handmade masks.

The team consists of a retired Professor of Design at Fashion Institute of Technology, medical technologist to ensure quality control and acceptability mask designs acceptable to major hospitals across the US have been procured and a procurement specialist as right material is being procured from India as material is in short supply in the US. The team is ramping up its production from 2500 ramping to up to 10,000 masks a week, he said.

Joining the call of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, New York-based hotelier couple K.K. and Chandra Mehta on Sunday announced to donate ₹ 1 crore to the PM’s Citizenship Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARE).

The couple has also donated another Rs 11 lakh towards distribution of masks and food packets for local police officials and newspaper hawkers in their home state of Rajasthan.

Based out of Tampa in Florida, Chandrakant Patel said that he is distributing food packets to 300 families in his home State of Chhattisgarh.

I will be doing this for next three months, he said.

IT entrepreneur Amit Banerjee from Boston said that he is sponsoring 20 labourers for three months in Bangalore. New York-based, Jagdish Sewhani, said that he is working with other Indian Americans to provide relief to labourers in big cities like New Delhi and Mumbai, who have lost their jobs due to the nationwide lockdown.

It’s inhumane to see the scenes that we have been witnessing on television screens for the past two days in New Delhi. It’s time that we all pitch in our resources for them, he said.

Officials of Patel Brothers — which has a chain of popular Indian grocery stores across the US — said that they are working with local authorities to distribute free perishable items and other grocery items to the people in need. Out of abundance of caution, Patel Brothers have announced to close its grocery stores for the next 10 days.

26,2020/03/30,Oil prices at 17-year lows as virus ravages world,"The falls came after the Covid-19 death toll surged past 30,000 at the weekend as cases in hard-hit Europe and the U.S. showed no sign of letting up.

Oil prices extended losses in Asian trade Monday and languished at 17-year lows, with the Coronavirus crisis escalating around the world and no end in sight to a vicious price war.

US benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell 5.3 percent to trade at $20 a barrel, while international benchmark Brent crude was off 6.5 percent at $23.

The falls came after the death toll from the pandemic surged past 30,000 at the weekend as cases in hard-hit Europe and the United States showed no sign of letting up.

Senior U.S. scientist Anthony Fauci estimated the virus could possibly result in 100,000 to 200,000 deaths in the United States, while President Donald Trump extended “social distancing” guidelines until April 30.

The president also said he expected the country to “be well on our way to recovery” by June 1 -- dropping his previous target of mid-April.

The virus has infected more than 140,000 in the world's top economy and left more than 2,400 dead.

Oil markets have been plunging for weeks as lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed by governments worldwide to fight the virus strangle demand.

Saudi-Russia price war

Even as demand falls, supply has increased dramatically after top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia engage in a price war following a row about whether to cut output to support prices.

At the end of last week, Riyadh said it had not been in touch with Moscow about potential output cuts while Russia's deputy energy minister said oil at $25 a barrel was not a catastrophe for the country's producers -- signalling the two sides are still far apart.

“Demand concerns are critical but well known, what really took the market down were the signals we got from Saudi Arabia and Russia that they intend to continue their current path,” Vivek Dhar, a commodities analyst at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, told Bloomberg News.

“Market hopes of a deal have come undone.”

There are fears the commodity could fall further as storage tanks around the globe approach full capacity.

“When the storage capacity is filled, we should probably expect a response from Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other essential oil producers,” AxiCorp's Stephen Innes said, though he warned “the longer their response takes, the higher the risk of another steep decline in oil prices”.

It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!”

U.S. President Donald Trump has offered his opinion on the future of Prince Harry and his wife Meghan, insisting the United States government won’t pay for the couple’s security if they live in the United States.

Responding to reports that the couple has moved to California, Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday- “I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen & the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!”

But the couple later said they found scrutiny by the British media - which they said tipped into harassment - intolerable.

In January they announced they planned to quit as senior royals, seek financial independence and move to North America. The split becomes official at the end of March.

Since late last year, Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan have since been based on Canada’s Vancouver Island.

Last month, Canadian authorities said they would stop paying for the couple’s security once they ceased to be working royals.

Mary-Liz Power, a spokeswoman for Canada’s public safety minister, said in February that “the assistance will cease in the coming weeks, in keeping with their change in status.”

Power said that as duke and duchess of Sussex, they have been considered “internationally protected persons” who warranted security measures under international treaty.

Unconfirmed reports say the couple and their 10-month-old son Archie recently flew to Los Angeles, where Ms. Meghan was raised.

A new domestic case was reported in Gansu province, it said.

The four deaths were reported from the virus epicentre Hubei province, it said.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland has reached 81,470 by the end of Sunday. This included 3,304 people died of the disease, 2,396 patients still being treated and 75,770 patients discharged after recovery, the NHC said.

A total of 118 patients in Hong Kong, 10 in Macao and 39 in Taiwan have been discharged from the hospital after recovery.

China on Sunday resumed domestic flights in the coronavirus epicentre Hubei province, except for its capital Wuhan, as part of a plan to ease the lockdown in the region following a steep decline in the number of confirmed cases.

Hubei’s capital Wuhan, which bore the brunt of the vicious virus for over two months, would begin its air services from April 8.

China began to ease its lockdown of Hubei province, home for over 56 million people, from March 25 by resuming local transport services followed by relaxation of travel for people tested negative for coronavirus.

29,2020/03/30,North Korea says it test-fired ‘super-large multiple rocket launchers’,"With the world focused on the coronavirus pandemic and North Korea insisting it has not had a single COVID-19 case, the isolated state has carried out four such firings this month

Nuclear-armed North Korea successfully tested “super-large multiple rocket launchers”, state media said on Monday, but leader Kim Jong Un was not described as commanding the drill as analysts say Pyongyang seeks to normalise its launches.

With the world focused on the coronavirus pandemic and North Korea insisting it has not had a single COVID-19 case, the isolated state has carried out four such firings this month.

Unusually, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) did not say in its report that Kim had directed Sunday's test.

The leader is almost always shown overseeing the North's launches but on this occasion KCNA said it was led by ruling party vice chairman Ri Pyong Chol and conducted by the Academy of National Defence Science.

South Korea had said two projectiles — presumed to be ballistic missiles — were fired on Sunday from the North Korean port city of Wonsan into the Sea of Japan, also known as the East Sea.

Images carried by the North's official Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed rockets blasting out of a launcher with six firing tubes, striking what appeared to be an island target. Kim was not seen in the photos.

“By Kim's absence, North Korea is trying to reduce the significance of the launch and stressing that the missile test is just a part of normal drills,” said Go Myong-hyun, an analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies.

The last time Kim was not seen at such an event was when the North test-fired a new submarine-launched ballistic missile in October, just days before officials from Pyongyang and Washington were due to meet in Stockholm to rekindle stalled diplomacy.

However some analysts believe he was actually present, as some items he habitually uses were visible.

Virus warnings

The string of weapons drills come during a prolonged hiatus in disarmament talks with the United States and despite recent overtures from Washington offering help to contain the pandemic.

North Korea has closed its borders to try to protect itself from the novel coronavirus and is one of the few remaining countries yet to report a case of the disease that has killed almost 34,000 people worldwide.

But the virus is likely to have reached the secretive nation, it is widely believed, with health experts warning it could devastate the country given its weak medical infrastructure and widespread malnutrition.

The day after another firing earlier this month, North Korean state media said Kim had received a letter from US President Donald Trump detailing a plan to develop ties — a move later confirmed by a White House official.

The report cited Kim's powerful sister Kim Yo Jong, who warned that the apparently good personal relationship between the two leaders would not be enough to foster broader relations.

Trump also “expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work”, she said in a statement published by KCNA.

Analysts say the North has been continuing to refine its weapons capabilities more than a year after a summit between Kim and Trump broke down in Hanoi.

Negotiations have since been deadlocked over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.

Vietnam's prime minister on Monday asked major cities to prepare for possible lockdowns to stop the spread of coronavirus as the number of confirmed cases in the Southeast Asian country reached nearly 200.

President Donald Trump said on Sunday the peak death rate in the U.S. from the novel coronavirus is likely to hit in two weeks as he extended the coronavirus guidelines, including social distancing, until April 30.

Assuring his countrymen that he expects the United States to be on its way to recovery by June 1, Trump told reporters at a televised White House news conference that he had to extend the social distancing measures till April 30, based on the advice from his two top public health advisors and members of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus: Dr. Deborah Bix and Dr. Anthony Fauci.

By Sunday night, the number of people infected with COVID-19 climbed to over 140,000 and the death toll reached 2,475. On Sunday alone more than 18,000 people reported positive for the deadly disease and 255 Americans lost their lives.

New York City alone accounted for nearly 60,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and around 960 deaths.

Fast spreading

The coronavirus pandemic is expanding fast in neighbouring New Jersey, where so far more than 13,000 cases have been reported, with 161 deaths. More than 20 of the 50 American states have recorded over 1,000 coronavirus cases - the number from where the deadly disease starts skyrocketing.

Major disaster declaration has been notified in nearly two dozen states, in addition to Trump declaring a national emergency a week ago.

The state governments and local city officials have started taking tough measures against those found in the public or not abiding by social distancing measures. For example, in Silicon Valley and New York, the local police have started imposing hefty fine ranging from $200 to $400 for those not adhering to social distancing measures in public places.

The modelling put together by Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci estimates that the peak and death rate is likely to hit in two weeks, he added.

Over a million fatalities?

“All of the flu models predicted anywhere between 1.6 and 2.2 million fatalities if we didn’t mitigate. Some of them predicted half of the United States would get infected and have that level of mortality,” Dr. Brix said.

Based on this and the figures coming from the ground, Dr Brix said the White House Coronavirus Task Force has worked very hard together to really look at all of the impacts of the different mitigations that have been utilized around the world.

The Task Force, which is headed by Vice President Mike Pence, has used that evidence base to bring that data and evidence to the President to consider for extending, which is not a simple situation when you ask people to stay at home for another 30 days, she explained.

“There are people who have to go out to work and we know the compromises that they’re making. But, it’s all to protect not only Americans, but the healthcare providers, the healthcare providers that are on the front lines,” she added.

In the absence of such a step, Trump said, various models have predicted around 2.2 million deaths in the US.

With the mitigation like the one announced on Sunday, Dr. Brix said the model predicts anywhere between 80,000 and 160,000 maybe even potentially 200,000 people succumbing to this.

“That’s with mitigation. In that model they make full assumption that we continue doing exactly what we’re doing but even better in every metro area with a level of intensity because we’re hoping that the models are not completely right. That we can do better than what the predictions are,” she said.

“The reason the President made the announcement today about going to the end of April is because we want to make sure that we don’t prematurely think we are doing so great. We may be but we want to push it to the extreme. So take that with you and maybe you will be less anxious,” Dr. Fauci said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k7ykif/article31202942.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MARVIRUSOUTBREAKTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-donald-trump-extends-distancing-guidelines-by-30-days/article31202943.ece
32,2020/03/30,Coronavirus | U.S. cancels Red Flag air exercise,"The Indian Air Force (IAF) was to take part in the exercise with its Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets, defence sources said.

The U.S. Air Force has cancelled Phase-I of its flagship multilateral air exercise, Red Flag, scheduled in Alaska from April 30.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) was to take part in the exercise with its Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets, defence sources said.

“We got communication that Red Flag Alaska 20-1, scheduled from April 30 to May 15, has been cancelled due to COVID-19,” a defence source said. The U.S. Pacific Air Fleet said on its website that the exercise was cancelled owing to the travel restrictions imposed by the U.S. Department of Defence.

In the past, the IAF deployed Su-30MKI and Jaguar strike aircraft, the Il-78 tankers and the C-17 strategic airlift aircraft. The IAF joined Red Flag for the first time in 2008 in Nevada. However, it had said it would not take part in every edition of the biennial exercise because of the high cost involved.

33,2020/03/30,"Coronavirus | Germany, U.K. seek Air India flights to evacuate citizens","Don’t pay attention to rumours of flights from London for Indians, says High Commission.

Germany and the U.K. have approached the Indian government expressing their interest to charter Air India’s flights to facilitate the return of their nationals stranded in India following travel restrictions to curb the spread of the COVID-19, according to several officials.

Between March 31 and April 3, the Air India will operate nine flights to Frankfurt with its 256-seater Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner aircraft. These special flights come at a time when India has banned all commercial flights, i.e. domestic and international, until April 14.

The Air India will operate five flights on March 31 to Frankfurt, of which four will be from Mumbai and one from New Delhi. Over the next three days, there will be four flights from Mumbai. It will first bring Germans from various parts including Goa, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram and to Delhi or Mumbai before undertaking the long-haul flight.

The Canadian High Commission, too, is exploring ways to help Canadians in India return to their country.

""The High Commission of Canada is aware that there are Canadians currently located in many parts of India seeking to return home. The High Commission is actively working to identify possible solutions for Canadians wishing to return from India to Canada. Updates regarding departure options are shared with our Canadian consular clients as they become available,"" the High Commission said in response to a specific query.

Officials also said there was a request to operate charters to London to enable the U.K. citizens to return to their homes and it was under consideration.

A British High Commission spokesperson said, “The Foreign Secretary has spoken with the Indian External Affairs Minister and we are working urgently on a plan to get our people back home. This is an absolute priority for us and we hope to be able to share news very soon.”

So far, the Air India has operated a special flight on the request of Israel helping nearly 300 of its citizens to return to Tel Aviv.

The Indian High Commission in the U.K. wouldn’t confirm reports that there were Air India flights planned to bring back Indians from London. In response to messages circulating about Air India flights scheduled to fly from London to New Delhi and Mumbai in early April, the High Commission in London posted on Twitter, “Indian High Commission notes with dismay that some rumours are being spread even in such trying times. We request all not to pay attention to rumours.”

A senior official here told The Hindu that there were “no plans to evacuate Indians at present” and that much would depend on quarantine facilities available for all.

34,2020/03/30,Mali goes to polls despite coronavirus and security fears,"Despite the numerous difficulties, experts nonetheless hope this Parliamentary election will lead to reforms that might drag Mali out of its cycle of violence.

Malians voted in a long-delayed Parliamentary election on Sunday, barely a day after the country recorded its first coronavirus death and with the leading opposition figure kidnapped and believed to be in the hands of jihadists.

There were security fears about the vote to elect new MPs to the 147-seat National Assembly even before the war-torn West African country recorded its first coronavirus infection on Wednesday.

No official turnout figures were released after the polls closed in the evening but it was clear to observers that fears of the virus and the threat posed by jihadists had kept the numbers down. At midday, observers from a group of civil society associations had put it at 7.5%.

Prime Minister Boubou Cissé admitted earlier that the turnout had not been very high. “I appeal to the voters: remember to respect the barrier gestures and use the sanitary measures,” he said as he voted, adding that the numbers voting were “sufficiently satisfactory.”

Just hours before polls opened on Sunday came the news of the country’s first coronavirus death — a 71-year-old man recently returned from France. Mali’s number of confirmed infections has risen to 20. There are fears that the impoverished State of some 19 million people — where large swathes of territory lie outside State control — is particularly exposed to a COVID-19 outbreak.

“I came to vote, but I’m afraid,” said Souleymane Diallo, a 34-year-old teacher voting in the capital Bamako. “As you can see there’s nobody here. Maybe because it’s the morning, but it’s also not surprising because of the situation,” he said.

The first elections results are not expected for several days. A second round is scheduled for April 19.

First elections since 2013

It is the country’s first parliamentary poll since 2013, when President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s Rally for Mali party won a substantial majority.

Parliamentary elections were meant to take place again in late 2018 following Mr. Keita’s re-election, but the poll was postponed several times, largely due to security concerns. Some 200,000 people displaced by the near-daily violence in Mali’s centre and north were not able to vote, a government official said.

The Security Ministry said out of close to 12,500 polling stations, 274 were not able to open. The army said it had been caught in one “ambush” in Madoro, near the Burkina Faso border, which has been a flashpoint for jihadist violence for months. This time no military casualties were recorded while “five terrorists were neutralised.”

Meanwhile 19 people were arrested in possession of 10 voting boxes in the northern town of Timbuktu. An AFP reporter said while the distance between people in queues was too close in Timbuktu, voters did wash their hands before entering polling stations.

Kidnapped opposition leader

Casting a shadow over the vote is the fate of veteran opposition leader Soumaïla Cissé, who was kidnapped on Wednesday while campaigning in the centre of the country. Mr. Cissé, 70, who has been runner-up in three presidential elections, and six members of his team were abducted in an attack in which his bodyguard was killed.

It is “likely” he was being held by jihadists loyal to Fulani preacher Amadou Koufa, who leads a branch of the al-Qaeda-aligned GSIM active in the Sahel, according to a security source and a local official. President Keita expressed indignation over the incident and vowed that “no effort will be spared in securing (Cissé’s) release”.

Mr. Cissé’s Union for the Republic and Democracy (URD) on Saturday urged its supporters to turn out in even greater numbers in response to the leader’s ordeal. However, several other opposition parties had called for the vote to be postponed due to coronavirus fears.

Hopes for peace

The country has been plagued by conflict since 2012, when rebels captured much of the country’s arid north. Jihadists overtook the rebels in the north and swept into the country’s centre, accelerating a conflict which has killed thousands of soldiers and civilians. Despite the numerous difficulties, experts nonetheless hope Sunday’s election will lead to reforms that might drag Mali out of its cycle of violence.

In particular, the hope is that the new Parliament will implement reforms from a peace agreement brokered between the Bamako government and several armed groups, in Algiers in 2015. Implementation has been painfully slow, although this year saw the Malian army deploy units made up of both former rebels and regulars, one the provisions of the Algiers Agreement.

The pact also provides for the decentralisation of governance in Mali, a demand of some of the rebel groups.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/scq31t/article31202004.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001Q937D,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mali-goes-to-polls-despite-coronavirus-and-security-fears/article31202005.ece
35,2020/03/30,"Coronavirus | New York State nears 1,000 deaths","The number of disease-related deaths in the State jumped Sunday to 965 from 728 the day before, the vast majority of which have been in New York City.

New York State’s coronavirus death toll is nearing 1,000, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. The State accounts for more than 40% of coronavirus deaths in the U.S.

Also read: How does soap use help in tackling COVID-19?

The number of disease-related deaths in the State jumped Sunday to 965 from 728 the day before, he said. The vast majority have been in New York City. Figures released Sunday morning showed 678 coronavirus deaths in the city, which continues to be the epicentre of the pandemic in the U.S.

Meanwhile, new data is showing which parts of the city are being hit the hardest by disease and that nearly a quarter of the people who have died of coronavirus in the State were nursing home residents.

Poor neighbourhoods hit hard

Coronavirus is overwhelming some of New York City’s poorest neighbourhoods, according to new data released by the city. Queens accounts for 32% of the city’s more than 30,000 confirmed cases as of Saturday — more than any other borough.

Neighbourhoods such as Jackson Heights, Elmhurst and Corona, which are generally poor, densely packed and have large non-English speaking populations, have been among the hardest hit, according to a city map showing percent ranges of people testing positive for the disease, also known as COVID-19. In those areas, between 69% and 86% of the tests done have come back positive.

A hospital in Elmhurst has been overrun with coronavirus cases. One day last week, 13 hospital patients with the virus died. Statistics on coronavirus cases do not reflect everyone who may have the virus, because many people have been told to manage their illness at home and are not getting tested.

Early patients goes home

The number of patients being discharged at the State’s hospitals after they’ve been treated for coronavirus has increased daily to a high of 845 on Saturday, Mr. Cuomo said. In all, more than 3,500 people have been discharged.

They include a lawyer from the New York City suburbs connected to one of the earliest U.S. coronavirus clusters. Lawrence Garbuz’s family and neighbour were infected, as well as members of his synagogue.

“The ‘patient zero’ — what we call patient zero in Westchester, New Rochelle — who was very sick for a very long time, has actually gone home,” the Governor said on Sunday, “He’s out of the hospital.”

As of Sunday, more than 8,500 people remain hospitalized across the State because of the disease, including more than 2,000 in intensive care. In New York City, about 20% of coronavirus cases have led to hospitalizations.

Those totals are continuing to spike, but Mr. Cuomo said they’re not multiplying nearly as quickly as they were last week. From March 16-19, the number of hospitalizations in the state doubled every two days. Now it’s taking about six days for the number to double.

Travel advisory concerns

On Saturday, after saying he was weighing the idea of a mandatory quarantine for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, President Donald Trump tweeted that instead he’d issue advisory urging people in those States to avoid any non-essential travel for two weeks.

New York City Mayor Bill de De Blasio said he worried about the advisory’s impact on families with members in New York and other places who were looking to reunite. “We’ve got to respect, in the middle of a crisis, families have a right to be together,” Mr. de Blasio said.

All 50 U.S. States have reported some cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, but New York State has the most, with over 52,000 positive tests for the illness and more than 700 deaths. About 7,300 people were in New York hospitals Saturday, including about 1,800 in intensive care.

Dwindling supplies, manpower

Mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday reiterated his fears that without reinforcements the city will run out of masks, gowns and other hospital supplies in a week and ventilators sooner.

With the expected peak of cases in the city still two to three weeks away, Mr. de Blasio told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday that the city also needs new waves of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel.

“We need to get them relief,” Mr. de Blasio said. “They can’t keep up at this pace for weeks and weeks and weeks ahead and expect to save lives the way we need them to.”

Mr. Cuomo said Sunday that more than 76,000 doctors, nurses and other health professionals, including many who’ve recently retired from the field, have volunteered to help in the coronavirus fight.

Nursing home deaths

Through Friday, 24% of coronavirus deaths in New York State were among nursing home residents, according to the state Department of Health figures released.

The State said there were more than 740 confirmed COVID-19 positive cases in licensed nursing homes at 129 of the state’s 613 nursing homes, which serve more than 100,000 residents. As of Friday, 122 nursing home residents in the State have died of the disease. In less than two weeks, the virus has claimed seven lives at one Long Island retirement community, with the latest death coming Saturday.

With schools and many day care centres closed, States, local governments and philanthropists are scrambling to provide childcare for parents who are needed on the front lines of the virus fight. College students, who were sent home because of the coronavirus, are taking advantage of their last days on campus to forge a few more memories.

36,2020/03/30,"Coronavirus | Nigeria orders lockdown in Lagos, Abuja","State revenues, which are reliant on oil, have plunged and officials have said they will have to cut the budget for this year.

Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday ordered the “cessation of all movements” for two weeks in the largest city Lagos and capital Abuja to stop the spread of coronavirus.

“All citizens in these areas are to stay in their homes starting Monday,” Mr. Buhari announced in a televised address to the nation.

“Travel to or from other States should be postponed. All businesses and offices within these locations should be fully closed during this period,” he said. The President said the restrictions, which also cover the Ogun State, neighbouring Lagos, do not apply to hospitals, food shops or petrol stations.

“Although these establishments are exempted, access will be restricted and monitored,” he added.

97 confirmed cases, 1 death

Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation with some 190 million people, has so far registered just 97 confirmed infections and one death from COVID-19, but testing has been limited. Officials have warned that the country risks seeing an “exponential” rise in cases unless contacts of suspected carriers are tracked down faster.

Authorities in Lagos, a sprawling megacity of 20 million people, had already closed schools, shut non-food shops and restricted gatherings to limit movement. Enforcing a total lockdown will be a mammoth challenge for authorities in a country where tens of millions live in dire poverty and rely on their daily earnings to survive.

“We are fully aware that such measures will cause much hardship and inconvenience to many citizens. But this is a matter of life and death,” Mr. Buhari said and added that the authorities would “deploy relief materials” to assist people in towns around Lagos and Abuja whose livelihoods were hit.

Welfare payments

Two-months worth of welfare payments “for the most vulnerable in our society” would be transferred immediately, the leader said.

The Lagos State Governor on Friday announced a programme to supply two weeks of basic foodstuff to an initial 200,000 households in the city. The Central government in Africa’s largest oil producer is already facing severe economic strain after the global pandemic sparked a collapse in crude prices.

Facebook-owned WhatsApp has reduced the Status video limit from 30 seconds to 15 seconds in India to cut strain on Internet networks during the coronavirus lockdown in the country as millions of people have started sharing videos in Status.

A tweet by WABetaInfo has revealed WhatsApp has put a bar on time limit for videos posted under the ‘Status’ section of the Facebook-owned instant messaging app.

“You can no longer send videos to WhatsApp Status if they are longer than 16 seconds: only videos having a duration of 15 seconds will be allowed. This is happening in India and it’s probably an initiative to reduce the traffic on the server infrastructures,” WABetaInfo tweeted on Sunday.

Microsoft has seen a huge 775% increase in its Cloud services in regions that have enforced social distancing or ‘shelter-in-place’ orders.

Microsoft Teams now has more than 44 million daily users and they generated over 900 million meeting and calling minutes, according to Jared Spataro, Corporate VP for Microsoft 365.

“Windows Virtual Desktop usage has grown more than 3 times. Government use of public ‘Power BI’ to share COVID-19 dashboards with citizens has surged by 42 per cent in a week,” Spataro said in a statement late Sunday.

Despite the significant increase in demand, said Microsoft, it has not had any significant service disruptions.

“As a result of the surge in use over the last week, we have experienced significant demand in some regions (Europe North, Europe West, U.K. South, France Central, Asia East, India South, Brazil South) and are observing deployments for some compute resource types in these regions drop below our typical 99.99% success rates,” said the company.

Microsoft has implemented a few temporary restrictions designed to balance the best possible experience for its customers.

“We have placed limits on free offers to prioritise capacity for existing customers. We also have limits on certain resources for new subscriptions. These are ‘soft’ quota limits, and customers can raise support requests to increase these limits,” informed Spataro.

Impacted customers and partners are notified through the Service Health experience in the Azure portal and/or in the Microsoft 365 admin centre.

On Xbox Live usage, Microsoft said it is actively monitoring performance and usage trends.

“At the same time, we’re taking proactive steps to plan for high-usage periods, which includes taking prudent measures with our publishing partners to deliver higher-bandwidth activities like game updates during off-peak hours,” the tech giant noted.

41,2020/03/30,‘Resident Evil 3 Remake’ review: the return of Nemesis in all its gory glory,"The 2020 reboot of a classic elevates a monstrous pandemic — RE3 Remake by Capcom is the ideal video game for the ongoing lockdown... and Jill is ready to kill!

“This pandemic is spreading faster than any disease in modern history...” are the first lines uttered in the opening cutscene of Resident Evil 3 Remake — words that sound like they are straight out of today’s headlines.

Resident Evil 3 Remake Developer: Capcom

Publisher: Capcom

Price: ₹3499 for Playstation 4, Xbox One and PC

However, the pandemic in question in Resident Evil 3 turns those infected into zombies or worse. Hot on the heels of the success of the remake of Resident Evil 2, Capcom revives another classic in all its gory glory.

Endless highs and lows

Resident Evil 3 Remake puts you in the shoes of a hunted Jill Valentine, a S.T.A.R.S officer in the virus-ravaged Raccoon City, who is targeted by a bio-organic weapon known as Nemesis. If you thought the Tyrant (a humanoid monster from the previous game, also known as Mr X) was a waking nightmare, this hulking creature of violent mutation will make him look like a kitten.

Where the Resident Evil formula works best is when creatures like Nemesis are placed into the equation. Just look at Mr X and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard’s Baker family — the survival horror just amplifies the gameplay of RE3 Remake with several injections of urgency and the constant feeling that something is following you, thanks to tell-tale growls, thudding footsteps, and whooshes of wind. RE3 Remake constantly has you on the edge of your seat in the best ways.

Well-portrayed here, Jill Valentine makes for a strong female protagonist, while also resembling Milla Jovovich (who portrays Alice in the Resident Evil movies). As we would expect, Jill stands strong and often revs up to take on monsters.

RE3 Remake stumbles, well, in the stumbles. There is not much in the way of mobility apart from a dodge, but both playable characters, Jill and mercenary Carlos Oliveira, move at frustratingly sluggish paces. I found myself yelling at the screen most of the time, run faster. For a game with this level of urgency, more dynamism in the mobility would have been appreciated. Couple this movement with enemies that sometimes appear off camera and attack with far reach, and there are times I felt that the experience meant fighting the camera and controls more.

Resident Evil: Resistance Along with Resident Evil 3, you also get a multi-player game bundle called Resident Evil: Resistance, which pits one mastermind against four other players, all for whom the former has laid out traps. As one of those four players, you have to fight through those odds to defeat the mastermind as the final boss.

In true survival-horror fashion, you are constantly starved of health items and ammunition, leaving you to scrounge everywhere. Resident Evil 3 is light on the puzzle-solving, which the previous game had in abundance. The few puzzles are mostly environmental, leaving you more focused on exploration to find certain items or keys that open certain doors. Since the timeline sort of runs in parallel to the previous game; if you have played that, then it occasionally gives you slight context.

Elevated in tech

Resident Evil 3, in its original avatar in 1999, marked the franchise going more cinematic and it translates well with the new graphics engine. No graphics engine renders flesh and gore better than Capcom’s RE (Reach for the Moon) Engine. Zombies get chunks blown off them realistically, revealing layers of flesh, muscle then bone, which looks incredible from a technical standpoint — but also real enough to lose your lunch over.

43,2020/03/30,"National lockdown | Salman Khan to help 25,000 workers in film industry","Daily wage earners to be beneficiaries

Actor Salman Khan has pledged to financially support 25,000 daily wage workers from the film industry in the wake of the national lockdown, according to Federation of Western Indian Cine Employees (FWICE).

The daily wage workers across different avenues are badly hit by the 21-day lockdown.

According to FWICE president B N Tiwari, Salman via his Being Human Foundation reached out to their organisation. “Salman’s Being Human Foundation has come forward to help daily wage workers. They called us three days ago. We have about 5 lakh workers, out of which 25,000 are in dire need of financial help. Being Human Foundation said they will take care of these workers on their own. They have asked for account details of these 25,000 workers,” Mr. Tiwari said.

“The remaining 4,75,000 workers can survive for about a month. We already have huge ration packets for all the workers but unfortunately due to lockdown they are not able to come here to collect it. We are thinking of ways how to reach out to them,” he added.

Mr. Tiwari said FWICE has reached out to several actors and filmmakers to make a contribution.

“We have written letters and also sent messages to various people in the film industry to come forward and help the workers but we haven’t received any response from them. Producer Mahaveer Jain has offered to provide help in terms of food and essential items,” he added.

Earlier in the week, filmmakers and actors, including Karan Johar, Taapsee Pannu, Ayushmann Khurrana, Kiara Advani, Rakul Preet Singh, Sidharth Malhotra, and Nitesh Tiwari pledged their support to a new initiative aimed at supporting the daily wage earners.

The initiative, I Stand With Humanity, started by organisations -- the International Association for Human Values, the Art of Living Foundation and the Indian Film and TV Industry, will provide families of daily wage workers with 10 days of essential food supplies.

On March 18, the Producers Guild of India announced that they have set up a relief fund for daily wage earners impacted by the shutdown of film, television and web productions amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Their decision came after many filmmakers, including Sudhir Mishra, Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap, raised concerns over the impact of shutdown on the daily wage workers.

According to the Health Ministry, the total number of COVID-19 cases rose to 979 on Sunday, with death toll climbing to 25.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/p8twfx/article31201586.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Salman,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/salmanv-khan-to-help-25000-workers-in-film-industry/article31201587.ece
44,2020/03/30,Here’s why a couple named their first child after a student from Jamia,"Nayla Khwaja, a student from Jamia Millia Islamia, helped Noor Bi and her husband, in the period after the Delhi riots

A few weeks ago, Nayla Khwaja, 24, a post-graduate student who is studying development communication at Jamia Millia Islamia University, came across a WhatsApp message about Noor Bi, 19, a riot-affected pregnant woman. Bi was in urgent need of a woman volunteer for assistance at Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital, Shahadara.

After their house was torched in the communal riots that took place in February in North East Delhi, Bi and her husband Ghulam Waris, 23, residents of Seelampur, were in dire need of help.

Khwaja, along with Mohammad Humam, 21, a fellow student, went to the hospital and Khwaja stayed with Bi through seven hours of the nine to 10 hours of labour. “She held my hand tightly the whole time as she delivered her first baby,” said Khwaja, who was also seeing the process of delivery for the first time.

After the delivery, Noor Bi says that in the evening Khwaja brought her tea, hot water, and a towel for her baby. “Nayla Ma’am gave us courage when we have lost everything,” says Waris, a carpenter, who is yet to return home, and is staying with his wife and daughter at a friend’s house.

“The name of our daughter is proof of how grateful we are for everything Nayla did for us,” says Noor Bi.

Delighted by the experience, Khwaja and Humam distributed sweets in the hospital. The next day, when she called Waris to ask after the mother and child, he told her that Chhoti Nayla was doing well.

“It’s like the most respectful thing anyone has ever done for me,” says Khwaja, who has, in the past, seen tough times, with a friend receiving a bullet in his hand during the riots.

45,2020/03/30,What happens in an old-age home during India’s Coronavirus lockdown?,"How Davo, an old age home in Delhi’s Dwarka, is struggling, during the Coronavirus pandemic

For the senior citizens who live on the premises of the not-for-profit home for seniors, Davo, in Dwarka, Delhi, social distancing is not new. They have been abandoned by their families and do not have the means to afford their own spaces. Of the 60 inmates, who live in a 1,800 square foot area, 20 are mentally challenged, and eight are differently-abled. There are four women too.

Dev Goswami, a former truck driver who started operating the NGO in 2016, is trying to keep them occupied and fed. The restriction on movement though, has kept away the 20-30 volunteers who used to come in daily

When Goswami was on the road, working as a truck driver from 1978 to 2007, his heart would often go out to the elderly. “While driving, I would come across old people on highways like National Highway 24, the Grand Trunk Road. I would feel bad, so I would make extra rotis, share my meals with them, give them a shave, and occasionally bathe them.”

Today, at a time when physical distancing has become a part of our reality, life is difficult. Earlier, the inmates were given a bath in batches of four or five. Now, they have to be bathed individually. The bathing area lies outside the gate, so each one has to be escorted there one at a time. “We cannot let them be outside even for a minute,"" says Goswami, referring to the lockdown in India, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Luckily, Harish Sharma, formerly a Blue Line bus driver, chips in by giving them bath. Life has been tough for him -- his son deserted him when he got sick, but he is not giving up. “I believe in overcoming hindrances, and we'll get through COVID- 19 too,” says Sharma, who came to Davo in 2017, directly from Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, where he was getting treated for chikungunya.

Sharma believes in seva, but says there just isn't enough to around. “In the morning, we serve tea and rusk. For lunch we serve chawal, dal, and rotis. Dinner is light and kichree is made. But our donors have stopped giving us food. Earlier, we would tell them what we needed. Now, they are afraid to come to the ashram,"" he says, adding that they fear the police and the transmission of the coronavirus. Goswami adds that earlier, tea was made twice a day for the inmates. Now it is made only once, and each batch gets less milky.

He talks of how the elderly could sit in the morning sun before the lockdown, but that has come to a stop. They still try to keep spirits up though. “We play bhajan, kirtan and they start singing.”

To ensure that the inmates are healthy, they are given a vitamin C supplement -- Goswami understands that the elderly are the most vulnerable. Protein supplements were to arrive, but the lack of movement due to the lockdown across the country have prevented it. “Let us hope it arrives soon,” says Kamal, his son, who works in the health department in the Delhi government, and helps his father out. He adds that the situation is made more difficult by shops increasing prices of basics: ""Sugar has risen from ₹1,600 for a packet of 50 kg to ₹1,800. Similarly, the price of atta has galloped from ₹20 to 30 per kilo.""

Tara, Goswami's wife is also involved, helping the women inmates and supervising cooking and other activities.

How long will he be able to keep this up? “I am a person with a positive frame of mind. I have never given up on anything,” he says.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/472wnk/article31207494.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dev-Goswami-carrying-an-inmate,https://www.thehindu.com/society/home-for-the-elderly-ngo-davo-faces-troubles-in-the-coronavirus-lockdown-with-no-volunteers-and-limited-food-supply/article31207498.ece
46,2020/03/30,This 26-year-old Mumbai boy is in Delhi to help lockdown-hit tourists,"Foreign and domestic travellers across India, who cannot return home and are shunned by hotels, are turning to Shubham Dharmsktu for help

Shubham Dharmsktu’s phone beeps relentlessly, even as we speak. The 26-year-old’s number has become a sort of helpline to the many travellers — primarily foreigners — stuck in India due to the COVID-19 lockdown. There are calls coming in from Gaya, Dharamshala, Visakhapatnam, Goa...

A notice outside an accommodation in Jaisalmer | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

It all started just before the first day-long curfew was announced on March 22. Shubham, a resident of Mumbai, was in Jaisalmer, shooting a documentary on the lives of different tribes. “I met a few friends from France and we realised things were crazy. Everything was shut around the fort area. Hotels, hostels, and houses were asking foreign guests to leave immediately,” recalls Shubham. They feared the guests might be carriers of COVID-19. He met a 25-year-old from South Africa who had gone on a three-day desert safari, only to return to Jaisalmer and find her belongings lying outside the hotel. “She told me foreigners were being harassed,” he says. A few people were even stopping to scream “Corona” at their faces before driving away.

So, Shubham gathered all the foreign nationals he met and took them to the hospital to get them tested. Once they tested negative and were cleared, he decided it was best for them to be in Delhi so that they could find a way to get back to their respective countries. “I found the last train leaving at 4.30 pm on Saturday. There were 12 of us. We boarded the train and found more people from Spain, Czech Republic, France...,” he says.

Another challenge loomed ahead. The train reached Delhi on Sunday at 10 am, during the Janta Curfew hours. Getting transport was a hassle. It cost ₹600 for a five-kilometre auto ride. Shubham started calling a number of hotels: while many were shut, some were apprehensive of foreigners. “Finally, Dhruvin Shah of Datstop Hostel in Vasant Kunj was welcoming of us. They needed to see the health certificate, which we provided,” he says. Since then, Shubham and his ragtag group of 15 travellers have made the hostel their base, till they can be evacuated back to their countries.

“I shared my number on Instagram (his page is Shubyatra), so anyone who is stranded, Indian or foreigner, can call me for help. I have been getting 50-plus calls every day,” says Shubham, who has also helped travellers find accommodation in other cities. For example, a group of Filipinos are stuck in Mumbai. Shubham helped them find space at Nap on Map, in Santacruz. “They didn’t

have enough money left, so I am sponsoring their stay and food for now. I spent from what I had saved for my project and then also received help from my friends and a few donors on Instagram,” he says.

Part of his daily routine also involves picking up groceries and other essentials. “Some of the ATMs are not working in Delhi and a lot of shops insist on Paytm or Google Pay, which the foreigners don’t have. So it is better that I go out and run these errands.”

Works both ways

Recently, he received messages from Indian students in Ukraine and a few in Cebu, Philippines. “I am using what I like to call reverse connections. I ask the foreigners I have helped here to connect Indians stranded in their countries with their friends and other people who can help,” he says, adding that is how the ones in the Philippines found a place. “Social media connections also help,” he adds.

Shubham is currently busy with evacuations. He is helping French nationals reach the airport for an evacuation to France today. “A bus just came from Dharamshala, filled with French travellers who were holidaying there. Germany did an evacuation a couple of days ago and Israel before that,” he says.

Shubham understands that these are testing times. His new-found friends, who are still here, are traumatised by the experience. To keep them occupied during this phase of lockdown, he along with Dhruvin organises movie nights, yoga sessions, quizzes, cooking nights, so that everyone feels comforted and at home.

47,2020/03/30,Chennai’s photographers are keeping the community buzzing during lockdown,"Chennai-based photography group, The Chennai Photowalk, organises virtual events every Sunday in an attempt to reconnect with the city and its frames

Be it a golden stream of sunlight that passes through the cracks in a door, rendered in monochrome, or a rolled-up stack of old newspapers that is oddly satisfying to look at — there are latent frames that often go unnoticed in our own homes.

The Chennai Photowalk, a city-based community of photography enthusiasts, seem to be missing its Sunday photowalks now more than ever. So, for the past two weeks, members have been getting together virtually in an effort to keep at their hobby, even during the time of lockdown. And one such Sunday event was to discover the hidden frames within the four walls of their homes, which gave birth to some of the ones described above.

It was on March 22 that the group decided to go digital with its events: “The participants were asked to click pictures and post them on our Facebook and Instagram handles, that pertain to each theme, within two hours. We changed the themes every two hours,” Naveen Kumar, one of the organisers at The Chennai Photowalk, says.

The first topic was ‘patterns at home’ followed by ‘fun with family’, ‘creativity in kitchen’ and ‘storytelling’. Each of the topics saw some interesting compositions — for instance, under the theme storytelling, one of the participants had set up a light, in front of which was a toy depicting a boy and a girl, holding hands. Through this simple frame, the photographer intended to recreate a moonlit night awash with love. “Like this, we had close to 150-plus registrations. By April, we’ll have a jury that will look at the pictures and announce the winner,” continues Naveen.

Yesterday, in its second run, The Chennai Photowalk, announced a virtual bus ride for its participants. And for this, it had chosen route number 1, that travels from Thiruvanmiyur to Ennore from 9 am to 7 pm. The virtual bus stopped at specific locations every hour: this was also when the participants sprung into action. They were expected to post images of that specific area, which were clicked in the past, within the one-hour window. The winners for each stop would be announced later.

“For our second activity, we wanted to do something around the city. Every time you look at an image clicked by you, you are transported back to that location and the memories you had there. This is precisely the objective behind this exercise,” says Naveen. The bus ride saw more than 80 passengers, and received 1,100 pictures in 10 hours, all shared digitally.

Naveen confirms that they plan to do such activities every Sunday. Amid the bout of creatives that have appeared online now, The Chennai Photowalk promises to find its own way to keep its community of photographers occupied, he concludes.

51,2020/03/30,Bricks fall apart for construction sector,"COVID-19 lockdown brings all site activities to a grinding halt; new housing launches fall 42% in Q1

The construction industry, which generally gets busy in the January to March quarter, has been severely impacted by the spread of COVID-19 and the subsequent lockdown, industry executives said.

From the time the WHO and Government of India declared the outbreak a pandemic, the construction industry experienced work disruptions and gradual lockdowns of its operations, said a spokesman for the Shapoorji Pallonji Group, one of India’s largest construction companies.

“After the lockdowns were declared, all site activities in Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra have come to a grinding halt. This includes government as well as private projects,” the spokesperson said.

“Material supplies have stopped, and key subcontractors were unable to arrange resources for construction activities. All mobilised resources and plant and machinery are idling. Construction programmes have also been impacted due to these work stoppages,” he added.

Work involving imported items and foreign construction crews have also been impacted.

The COVID-19 crisis will seriously impact revenues of construction companies and almost all of them will face huge financial losses in the months to come, company officials said.

“The financial stress upon the construction sector is expected to worsen over the coming year. It is too early to estimate the full financial impact of the COVID-19 crisis,” they added.

“Even after the crisis is contained and work resumes, hopefully by end of April 2020, it would take another 7-8 months for things to return to normal,” the Shapoorji Pallonji company spokesperson said. “Moreover, the upcoming monsoon will additionally and severely obstruct construction works June 2020 onwards,” the spokesperson added.

‘Unprecedented crisis’

Srini Srinivasan, MD, India, Project Management Institute (PMI) said, “As the COVID-19 spread escalated in China in early January, it became evident that we are facing an unprecedented crisis.” “We do expect a slowdown in the April-June quarter. However, if COVID-19 is controlled by the end of the second quarter, we will see a rebound in the third and fourth quarters for PMI,” he said.

Housing slump

The pandemic has already had a considerable impact on the Indian housing sector.

Residential sales saw a 42% drop in the first quarter of 2020, compared to a year earlier, latest data from Anarock Property Consultants showed.

“In the first quarter of 2020, residential sales in the top 7 cities stood at 45,200 units, against 78,510 units a year ago. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, housing sales fell 24%,” Anarock chairman Anju Puri said.

“Meanwhile, new launches too fell by 42% annually from 70,480 units in Q1 2019 to approximately 41,200 in Q1 2020. Quarter-on-quarter supply also declined by approximately 21%,” he added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cc45j8/article31221974.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01THBYCONSTRUCTION,https://www.thehindu.com/business/covid-19-spells-doom-for-construction-industry/article31211507.ece

“Eligible investors can invest in specified government securities without being subject to any investment ceilings. This scheme shall operate along with the two existing routes, viz., the Medium Term Framework (MTF) and the Voluntary Retention Route (VRR),” the RBI said.

While BSNL and MTNL have extended the validity of prepaid packs till April 20, Bharti Airtel has done so till April 17. This means that incoming facility will not be stopped on the number even after validity of their plan is exhausted.

For Bharti Airtel, the move will benefit 80 million or 8 crore customers “effectively covering all under-privileged households on the Bharti Airtel network. These special measures will particularly benefit migrant workers and daily wage earners who may have been impacted due to the nationwide lockdown to combat COVID-19. All other customers on Bharti Airtel’s network are already recharging their accounts using online platforms.”

BSNL, in a statement said, “In view of hardships faced by the mobile subscribers whose validity has expired during the lockdown period… and are not able to recharge for extension of validity, BSNL… is extending the validity of all such subscribers up to 20th April 2020, free of cost, so that the subscribers continue to receive incoming calls.” In addition, BSNL will credit free talk time of ₹10 to all such subscribers who reach zero balance during the lock down period.

Bharti Airtel said the programme has been kicked off, and these benefits will be available to users in the next 48 hours.

“With these initiatives, all Bharti Airtel customers will have unrestricted access to vital information from local authorities as also be able to connect with whoever they choose to,” it added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bsnl-airtel-extend-prepaid-validity-to-credit-10-extra-talk-time/article31211202.ece

“This is not merely a product launch, but a service that we are launching for the safety of every citizen across urban and rural areas of our country.” said C.K. Ranganathan, chairman and managing director, CavinKare Pvt. Ltd.

“While it generally takes six to 18 months for developing a new product, it is because of our R&D team, who had already researched about sanitisers and kept the formulation ready, we were able to make this quality sanitiser available in the market in just two weeks’ time from its initiation,” he added.

To make it affordable like its shampoo products, the hand sanitiser is made available from ₹1 for 2 ML pack across FMCG kirana stores and in different SKUs (stock keeping units) such as 10 ML, 50 ML, 90 ML, 400 ML, 800 ML and 5 litre pack. While the 5 litre pack has already been introduced nationwide, the other SKUs will be launched soon.

“Considering most people don’t have access to quality hand sanitisers during this time, it is our responsibility to make the essential product accessible and affordable to every individual with utmost quality. The concept of launching the sanitiser in a sachet as well and making them available in a typical FMCG kirana outlet is an ideal step to ensure the safety of the masses at this crucial time,” he said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/768hq4/article31211152.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th31-BUCAVINKARE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cavinkare-launches-hand-sanitisers-in-1-sachets/article31211154.ece

60,2020/03/30,Don’t consider lockdown-related loan repayment delays as default: SEBI to credit rating agencies,"The move follows a three-month moratorium on payment permitted by the Reserve Bank of India.

Markets regulator SEBI on Monday asked credit rating agencies not to consider as default any delay in payment of interest or principal loan amount arisen solely due to the nationwide lockdown conditions.

The move follows a three-month moratorium on payment permitted by the Reserve Bank of India to mitigate the burden of debt servicing due to disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic and to ensure continuity of viable businesses.

In a circular, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI said a differentiation in treatment of default, on a case to case basis, needs to be made as to whether such default occurred solely due to the lockdown or loan moratorium.

“Based on its assessment, if the credit rating agency (CRA) is of the view that the delay in payment of interest or principal has arisen solely due to the lockdown conditions creating temporary operational challenges in servicing debt, including due to procedural delays in approval of moratorium on loans by the lending institutions, CRA may not consider the same as a default event,” SEBI said.

This will also be applicable on any rescheduling in payment of debt obligation done by the issuer, prior to the due date, with the approval of investors or lenders, it added.

The relaxation has been extended till the period of moratorium given by the RBI.

In addition, the regulator has also given relaxations to rating agencies from certain disclosures requirements.

Considering that the CRAs are dependent on issuers and third parties for information collection which may be impaired due to current lockdown, SEBI has given relaxation from timelines for rating action or issue of press release by rating agencies.

However, CRAs should endeavour to finish the exercise on a best effort basis. Such cases will be put up for ratification by the rating sub-committee of the board of CRAs.

Further, an extension of 30 days has been granted for making annual and semi-annual disclosures by CRAs on their websites for the periods ending March 31, 2020.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/dont-consider-lockdown-related-loan-repayment-delays-as-default-sebi-to-credit-rating-agencies/article31206073.ece
61,2020/03/30,"Coronavirus | Moderate humidity may deter virus, studies say","Monsoon could slow down spread

Coronaviruses are sensitive to humidity and are less likely to thrive at moderate levels of humidity, a series of experimental studies over the years have shown.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Earlier this month, a study by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States said that regions experiencing a monsoon might see a slowing — but not a stop — to the transmission of the virus and, therefore, could help mitigation strategies in tropical countries such as India.

The maximum number of cases were reported in regions with an average humidity range of 3-9 g/cubic metre, which comprised the United States and several European countries that are inundated by COVID-19 infections.

Tests or temperature?

However, while warmer and humid countries such as Singapore, Australia, Taiwan and Qatar had comparatively fewer infections — attributable to higher testing — it was possible that warmer temperatures retarded the spread of the virus, the authors — Qasim Bukhari and Yusuf Jameel — contend.

The study isn’t yet peer-reviewed and is available at the open access repository Social Science Research Network.

A 2018 study in the peer-reviewed Applied and Environment Microbiology concluded that influenza and coronaviruses thrived when the relative humidity (RH) exceeded 85% or dipped below 60%. RH is the proportion of water vapour in the air compared to what’s the maximum possible. There is a “significant decrease in infectivity at mid-range RHs (60 to 85%),” the paper notes.

It is important to note that these studies didn’t study actual coronaviruses but a bacteriophage Phi6, which is considered a safer surrogate.

A similar experiment reported in the same journal in 2010, that tested the ability of viruses to survive on stainless steel surfaces, found that at 4°C, infectious viruses persisted for as long as 28 days, and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20% RH.

Inactivation was quicker at 20°C than at 4°C at all humidity levels; the viruses persisted for 5 to 28 days, and the “slowest inactivation” occurred at low levels of RH.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4ujw0c/article31211864.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HUMIDITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/moderate-humidity-may-deter-coronavirus/article31211798.ece

Addressing 130 Indian envoys, Mr. Modi urged them to help in containing the economic fallout of the viral pandemic by ensuring continuity of trade and commercial channels between India and the rest of the world.

“He called on Heads of Indian Missions to help boost the morale of such compatriots abroad, and to help them address issues arising from their unplanned stay abroad with their host Governments, and also to address other problems Indians might face abroad, including arranging shelter, where necessary and feasible,” stated a press release issued by the Ministry of External Affairs summing up the video conference.

Indian envoys in several of the worst affected countries, like China, Iran, Italy, United States and South Korea, were selected to brief the Prime Minister on the steps they had taken to deal with the needs of Indians in those countries.

Mr. Modi briefed the Indian envoys about the lockdown and quarantine measures currently under way in various countries, including India. “Extraordinary times require extraordinary solutions,” he told them. He asked the envoys to focus on the countries of their posting and identify “best practices, innovations, scientific breakthroughs and sources to procure medical equipment” to help India fight the pandemic at home and abroad.

The envoys reported to Mr. Modi about the steps they have taken to help Indian workers and students who were assisted by the Indian diplomats in recent past. Sources informed that Mr. Modi was briefed about the steps being taken to look after the condition of the stranded Indians in Iran which has been hit hard by the pandemic. The German and South Korean conditions also received special attention during the briefing especially since the Prime Minister wanted to know about the steps these two countries took to reduce mortality among the coronavirus-affected patients. Necessary items for export from the west to help India fight the crisis were also discussed.

“The exodus of migrant workers triggered an alarm. Some 10,000 to 15,000 people had gathered at Anand Vihar in Delhi and at Kaushambi and Lal Quan in Ghaziabad. In the past two days, we provided masks and other essentials to them. Sanitisers were also given to the bus drivers,” an NDRF official said. Through the public address systems, the NDRF officials informed the large number of stranded persons about the precautions, such as physical distancing, to be taken to prevent coronavirus (COVID-19). “Wherever possible, we are also arranging food for the needy,” the official said.

Joint Secretary in the Ministry Lav Agrawal told the press that the growth graph of COVID-19 cases shows that India had taken 12 days to go from 100 to 1,000 cases.

“This graph in developed countries with less population and better facilities had risen anywhere between 3,000 to 8,000 cases starting from the same line and in this 12-day initial period. India is seeing this result because of early measures of isolation and lockdown. The take away from this is that we are on the right path and that we should stay on this. But this is a daily battle and non-compliance by even a single individual can put us back,” he said.

Creation of Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM CARES) Fund when the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund already exists is “undemocratic, unfederal and in poor taste,” noted historian Ramachandra Guha said on Monday.

Also read | Pitch in, PM Modi tells social welfare organisations

He slammed the new initiative as one that would only pave the way for “sycophancy” and “chamchagiri” of the rich towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“When something [Prime Minister’s Relief Fund] already exists, why create a new vehicle and why give this misleading name? It could have been PM COVID Fund, PM Health Fund or PM Crisis Fund,” he told The Hindu on Monday after taking to Twitter to criticise the fund. “It seems to me exploiting a national crisis for building Prime Minister’s brand. I do not know who is behind this... whether it is the Prime Minister’s brand management team or the Prime Minister himself,” he said.

The new fund was created on Saturday, and donations to it will be considered by the Corporate Affairs Ministry as fulfilment of the mandatory obligation of corporates under corporate social responsibility.

He said there were several aesthetic, legal and pragmatic issues. Legal questions relating to how or whether at all it was registered and how the trust was constituted have also been raised. “Why should Uday Kotak or Akshay Kumar living in Mumbai donate to the Prime Minister? People are suffering in the next street. They can donate directly to Jaslok Hospital. The relief is primarily at the State level. It is an unhealthy precedent and must be challenged.

Lok Sabha member Shashi Tharoor on Twitter, commenting on another tweet about PM CARES, asked: “Why not simply rename PMNRF as PM-CARES, given the PM’s penchant for catchy acronyms, instead of creating a separate Public Charitable Trust whose rules & expenditure are totally opaque?”

“@PMOIndia you owe the country an explanation for this highly unusual step,” Mr. Tharoor added.

68,2020/03/30,Coronavirus | Rabi harvest to be affected for want of farm workers,"Farmers also worry about govt. procurement and the ability to sell crops as mandis are still closed

The lakhs of migrant workers streaming to their home villages due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have left many farmers across the country bereft of agricultural labour just before the crucial harvesting season of the rabi or winter crop. Farmers also worry about government procurement and their ability to sell their crops, given that many mandis or agricultural markets are still closed, despite fresh Home Ministry orders to exempt all such farming activities from the shutdown.

Also read: Coronavirus | Cases surge; ICMR denies community transmission

Wheat, mustard, rabi paddy, maize, chickpeas and soyabean are amongst the major crops harvested during this season.

“Most of the agricultural workers in Haryana and Punjab come from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and will not be there for this harvesting season. For the wheat harvest, farmers may be able to use mechanical combine harvesters. But Punjab’s mandis alone employ 3.5 lakh agricultural workers during this season, to load, weigh, clean and bag the produce. How is procurement going to be possible without them?” asked Ramandeep Singh Mann, a Haryana-based farmer activist.

He noted that many of the mechanical combine harvesters owned by Punjab and Haryana farmers are also stuck in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat, which harvest their wheat earlier than the northern States.

“They have been caught by the lockdown, usually with four or five workers accompanying them. Now they have to cross multiple State lines to return, so it is unclear how many will make it on time, leading to shortages,” he added. “At the end of the day, harvesting cannot be postponed beyond 7 or 8 days, or the grain will shatter.”

Both northern States have delayed wheat procurement to April 15, in the hopes that the lockdown will be over by then. Haryana has also written to the Central Food Ministry, asking for incentives to farmers in a bid to stagger the procurement process and prevent congestion at mandis in late April. It wants to offer an additional ₹50 per quintal for those able to store their own crops and wait to sell until May 5, and ₹125 for those willing to hold on till June.

A senior Punjab agriculture official said the State government was struggling to deal with the health crisis and did not plan to address the agricultural concerns till the end of the month. “The response has been slow, and the State does not have the budget to spend on incentives,” he admitted.

“We have received the Haryana proposal, but are yet to take a decision,” Food Secretary Ravi Kant told The Hindu. He said Madhya Pradesh would begin wheat procurement on April 1 itself, as they have local labourers, but acknowledged that the process would be difficult in States that depend on migrant workers, especially if the lockdown is extended further. It is up to States to facilitate procurement, he added.

Air Vice-Marshal (AVM) Chandan Singh (retired), 95, who played a pivotal role in transport operations during the 1962 war between India and China, and who was instrumental in helicopter operations during the 1971 Liberation War of Bangladesh passed away on Sunday. He was decorated with a Maha Vir Chakra and a Vir Chakra.

“The man who flew us across the Meghna river in 1971 passed away at 12:00 hrs on Sunday at Jodhpur.

AVM Singh was awarded the Vir Chakra for dropping vital supplies in the Chip Chap area in Ladakh during the 1962 war despite his aircraft being hit 19 times by enemy ground fire.

He also dropped AMX-13 tanks at Chushul in eastern Ladakh despite they being heavier than the carrying capacity of the AN-12 aircraft which slowed the advance of Chinese troops. He was awarded Maha Vir Chakra for his role in the 1971 war when he was a Group Captain commanding an Air Force Station in the East. He played a key role in helicopter operations to ferry men and material, including over the pivotal Meghna river crossing which allowed the Indian Army to move swiftly to Dhaka.

“The officer who was the brains behind all the helicopter and transport operations in the 1971 war in Bangladesh, including setting up the fledgling Bangladesh Air Force with one armed Chetak and an Otter. And the heli-lifts! Most important was jointmanship with Lt. Gen. Sagat Singh. Rest in Peace,” AVM Manmohan Bahadur (retired), Additional Director, Centre for Air Power Studies, said on Twitter.

During the 1965 war, AVM Singh flew several missions over Pakistan where the AN-12 a transport aircraft was used in an offensive role, a task for which it was not designed. These missions still remain classified, Maj. Singh said.

“After the 1962 war, AVM Singh helped raise the Aviation Research Centre (ARC) at Charbatia in Odisha from where secret missions were flown to Tibet,” he stated.

AVM Singh was born on December 3, 1925 in Bagawas near Jodhpur and was commissioned as 2nd Lieutenant in the Jodhpur Lancers at the age of 16.

He fought in the Second World War with his regiment in Iraq, Persia, Egypt and Palestine and towards the end of the war, on the advice of Maharaja Umed Singh, he moved to the Royal Indian Air Force.

He began flying the Spitfire fighters but after an accident in 1949 was shifted to the transport stream. “He pioneered the procedures for transport aircraft to fly into the Himalayan valleys on supply missions to remote army posts. The operating procedures that he introduced are now followed by air forces the world over when operating in similar conditions,” Maj. Singh stated. AVM Singh was awarded an Ati Vishisht Seva Medal (AVSM) as a Squadron Leader, normally given to officers of two star rank and above.

70,2020/03/30,Coronavirus lockdown | PSU banks tell branches to work full hours at ministry’s urging,"Full staffing advised to help banks cope with pay day rush, DBT withdrawals in rural areas

After being prodded by the finance ministry, state-owned banks have directed their branches to ensure both that the staff are present in full strength from Tuesday and that the branches remain open for regular business hours in anticipation of the higher footfalls this week, especially in rural and semi urban branches where digital banking facilities are not being availed extensively.

Bankers are anticipating a rush in their branches in rural and semi urban areas as more customers are expected to queue up to withdraw cash after the government transfers ₹500 to Jan Dhan account holders as part of the COVID-19 economic relief package announced by the Centre. In addition, there would be the usual increase in banking activity that typically happens at the beginning of a month due to salary disbursements and pension payments. Bankers said this week could prove to be challenging for the branch staff, especially to ensure compliance with social distancing norms.

Some of the lenders have already withdrawn earlier instructions for rotation of duty on alternate days, effective from March 31. All staff members have been asked to report for duty.

Following the nationwide lockdown to fight the spread of COVID-19, public sector banks were operating on the basis of truncated working hours with limited staffing and had been providing basic banking services. In addition, a number of branches had been shut for operations following the lockdown as the staff were unable to reach their workplaces due to the absence of public transport facilities.

However, this had irked the finance ministry which had reportedly sought an explanation from the banks as to why many branches were closed.

In a video conference with bank chiefs on Saturday, Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had reviewed banks’ functioning during the lockdown, even while maintaining social distancing.

“All banks are ensuring their branches are kept open, ATMs filled up and are working. Banking correspondents are active. Social distancing is respected and sanitizers are provided where necessary,” Ms. Sitharaman tweeted on Monday.

“There is a big risk for the bank staff as well as for the customers who are inside the bank premises in large numbers and this would go totally against the objective of social distancing and increase the risk of infection,” C. H. Venkatachalam, general secretary, All India Bank Employees’ Association, wrote in a letter to the finance ministry.

75,2020/03/30,"Coronavirus lockdown | Dairy, vegetable farmers count losses in Assam","Closure of all hotels, restaurants and sweetmeat shops besides transportation hit them hard

The inability to transport their produce because of the coronavirus lockdown has forced small dairy farmers in Assam throw away hundreds of litres of milk while vegetable growers are letting their crop rot or dumping nearby for animals.

Also read | Centre tells States to set up camps for migrant workers

Some 1,500 members of the Sitajakhala Dugdha Utpadak Samabai Samiti Ltd in the Morigaon district dumped about 10,000 litres of milk in rivers and streams during the first two days of the lockdown. This was because the milk could not be consumed locally after efforts to transport them to the urban centres had failed.

The milk processing plant of the 58-year-old cooperative society is situated about 65 km east of Guwahati.

“Our farmers face a combined average loss of ₹12 lakh per day with production dropping from the daily mark of 20,000 litres before the lockdown. But the main problem is availability of cattle feed, which is procured primarily from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal,” said society chairman Ranjib Sharma.

Smaller cooperative societies at Jorabat and Rangiya near Guwahati have been facing similar problems. A major reason, said milk trader Dilip Chhetri of Jorabat, is the closure of all hotels, restaurants and sweetmeat shops that were the bulk buyers.

District authorities claimed they had streamlined the supply after the initial hiccups as dairy and milk products and shops selling animal fodder fall under essential services according to the Union Home Ministry’s guidelines.

But small dairy farmers said this had benefited major firms and a State government-run dairy unit which have massive refrigeration units to store milk not offloaded for two-three days. More than 90% of the dairy industry in Assam is in the unorganised sector, an animal husbandry report said.

At Singimari in the Kamrup district, Mukalmua in the Nalberi district and Kharupetia in the Darrang district, most vegetable farmers have not been able to find transporters to market their produce. These places are considered the vegetable bowls of Assam.

“Officials are saying the government has relaxed restrictions on farming activities, but I lost more than 50 kg of tomatoes and other vegetables because of this bandh [lockdown]. I hope the government compensates some of my loss,” said Ramzan Ali, a farmer of Bechimari area near Kharupetia.

Agriculture Minister Atul Bora said district officials had been told to assist farmers in marketing their produce while ensuring social distancing.

76,2020/03/30,"Socialising in the time of coronavirus lockdown: online tea, office parties","While conducting business online is not a new concept, socialising certainly is and seems to be catching on.

More and more people are escaping to the virtual world as they realise that life must go on and that 21 days of lockdown is too long to put it on hold. If everything — from ordering essentials to business meetings to conducting classes — can happen online, why not socialising?

On Sunday evening, Mumbai-based regression therapist Sabari Chakraborty did what she would on a Sunday evening: have tea with friends. Only that each one stayed in their respective homes and connected via the app Zoom.

“Men and women are social animals, women more so,” Ms. Chakraborty told The Hindu. “I dressed up in a bright sunshine yellow dress, glad to be out of my kaftans and night dresses, which were my staple wear in home quarantine. I put on some lipstick, a dash of kohl, some Chanel No. 5 of course, so what if it’s virtual, and sat all excited in front of my laptop, eager to meet my friends on the screen,” she added.

“The adda had an edge of adventure and newness, like a hidden love affair, and we chatted, drank our respective teas and coffees in our respective homes and wondered why the heck didn’t we do this before? Coming Friday is a friend’s birthday. We shall meet again, for a virtual birthday party. So what if I can’t eat the cake, I can dress up and sing ‘Happy Birthday’ at least,” she said.

Ms. Chakraborty’s husband Indranil has already made himself at home in the virtual world. “I work with leaders to help them harness the power of stories to make their conversation, speeches and presentation more inspirational. My mode of working has always been face to face. However, the COVID-19 situation changed all that. My clients are all working from home and I am under lockdown myself. So I pivoted and first converted all my training programs into an online course, Virtual Instructor-Led Delivery. I then started to reach out to my clients and the response has been positive,” Mr. Chakraborty said.

“While in the area of health it is the survival of the fittest, in the area of business it is the survival of the flexible and the agile,” he added.

While conducting business online is not a new concept, socialising certainly is and seems to be catching on. Also on Sunday, while the Chakrabortys were ‘attending’ the tea party in Mumbai, about half-a-dozen employees of a multinational bank were having an office party — online — in Bengaluru. Their party was facilitated by Google Duo.

“At first I thought my boss was in one of his nonsensical moods when he suggested the party,” said Sunanda Shukla, a senior manager with the bank who lives alone in an apartment in Bengaluru. “It turned out his wife had just had an office party over video where everybody decided to dress up and it had turned out to be a raging success,” Ms. Shukla added, by way of explanation.

“I have avoided video calls with friends for as long as I can remember, and I reluctantly agreed to do it on Sunday evening. We all got dressed for the event and as usual, it started off with my boss taking my case on something stupid I had done. Soon the women were discussing the new Korean romcoms on Netflix and the men were bragging about their culinary skills,” Ms. Shukla said.

“My connection snapped somewhere in the middle and I suddenly realised how full the lonely house seemed. I reconnected and then two hours went by without us even realising it. We now plan to do this every weekend,” she said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mkcgwc/article31208975.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-CORONAVIRUS-ZOOM-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/socialising-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-lockdown-online-tea-office-parties/article31208976.ece

78,2020/03/30,Coronavirus | Fear factor combined with fake news creates new ‘infodemic’ on social media,"The Indian Army also had to debunk fake news about an impending emergency declaration in April.

As India battles the deadly coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a fake news ‘infodemic’ is also spreading on WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms with numerous false claims, including about an impending emergency declaration and an extension of the lockdown period.

While official agencies and several private fact-checkers kept on promptly debunking the fake news, the full-hoaxes and half-truths continued unabated, including by some fraudsters trying to mint some easy money by circulating fake bank account details for contributions to the government relief funds.

A lot many also fell prey to an ‘early April Fool’ prank on Monday wherein a document was circulated on social media, disguising itself as a government announcement about an extension of lockdown beyond the 21-day period.

The Indian Army also had to debunk fake news about an impending emergency declaration in April.

“Fake and malicious messages are circulating on social media about likely declaration of emergency in mid April and employment of Indian Army, Veterans, NCC and NSS to assist the civil administration. It is clarified that this is absolutely fake,” the Army’s Additional Directorate General of Public Information tweeted.

The government also debunked rumours about plans for extending the ongoing 21-day lockdown period, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 to fight the coronavirus crisis.

The clarification by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba came after hundreds of thousands of migrant labourers undertook long journeys from major urban centres on foot to their homes in the last five days, reflecting their struggle for survival due to job losses following the lockdown.

In a tweet, the government’s Press Information Bureau said: “There are rumours & media reports, claiming that the government will extend the #Lockdown21 when it expires. The Cabinet Secretary has denied these reports, and stated that they are baseless.”

PIB’s Fact Check Twitter handle also asked people to “be cautious of fake account details circulating on the pretext of PM CARES Fund”.

Delhi police’s cybercrime unit had on Sunday detected a fake Unified Payments Interface (UPI) ID created with a motive to cheat donors of the newly launched PM CARES Fund to fight the coronavirus outbreak.

Anyesh Roy, DCP (cybercrime) said in a tweet that the fake UPI was created with the ID pmcare@sbi, which is similar to the correct ID pmcares@sbi.

The State Bank of India has also been briefed about the fake ID and the bank has blocked it, a police official said.

The matter is under investigation and efforts are being made to identify the accused, he said.

Another ‘fake news’ debunked by the authorities included a message doing the rounds that the Home Ministry has decided to make it a punishable offence if anyone posts anything related to the coronavirus on social media.

There are also a number of other such misinformation being circulated including about the COVID-19 treatment and on ways to avoid getting infected from the deadly coronavirus.

“There is no scientific evidence to prove that inhaling hot water steam kills #Coronavirus. Remember: Respiratory hygiene, social distancing and washing hands are effective measures to prevent #Covid19 Let’s spread facts, not fear and contribute to #IndiaFightsCoronavirus,” PIB Fact Check tweeted.

Among private fact-checkers, Boom FactCheck tweeted that a “misleading” infographic has been shared thousands of times in multiple Facebook posts with a nine-day timeline of the symptoms of the novel coronavirus.

It also debunked another “fake” message claiming several areas in Mumbai, including Mohammed Ali Road, having been blacklisted and put under control of the Army.

Another misleading message claimed that a State government in India has recommended that the juice of bitter gourd, a vegetable often used in traditional medicine, is an effective treatment for the novel coronavirus. This one has also been found to be false.

On social media, several people including some senior journalists, fell prey to an old prank video from Jakarata, which went viral after being presented this time as being from Goa and as an “innovative way to make people stay indoors”.

Fact-checker SM Hoax Slayer said, “A Prank video is viral, tweeted by few media houses and journalists claimed to be recent and from Goa. It shows a man wearing a ghost looking suit jumping suddenly in front to a motorcycle on a bridge because of which the rider gets afraid, turns around and leave and the pillion rider climbs the bridge whom the prankster follow.”

The fact-checking website found that the prank video was neither from Goa, nor related to the lockdown or the coronavirus outbreak at all.

The video was found to be almost a year old from May 2019 and it originated from Jakarta, Indonesia. After being corrected by SMHoaxSlayer, some people and organisations tweeted a correction in reply to their wrong tweet, while few others deleted the original tweet.

Fact-cheking website AltNews debunked a viral audio clip, presented as a conversation between two persons, with one of them claiming that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has asked India to extend the lockdown from April 15 to June 15. AltNews said its investigation found the claim to be totally fake.

Interestingly, the WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had said in February itself, “We are not just fighting an epidemic; we are fighting an infodemic.”

Several other countries are also dealing with an increased flow of fake news relating to the coronavirus.

The U.K. has set up a rapid response unit within the Cabinet Office which is working with social media firms to remove fake news and harmful content. The U.K.’s anti-fake news unit is also dealing with up to 10 false coronavirus articles a day.

On Sunday, the Indian High Commissioner to the U.K., Ruchi Ghanashyam, also appealed to Indian citizens stranded in the country due to the coronavirus pandemic to beware of fake news doing the rounds about Air India evacuation flights planned next week.

A few days ago, another viral message had re-surfaced about all calls getting recorded and platforms sucha as WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter being monitored with the start of the lockdown period, but it was found to be fake.

Boom FactCheck found that the viral message has been doing the rounds on social media since as far back as 2017. It also found the message to be referring to one ‘Ministry of Internal Regulation’, which does not exit in India.

Police in various parts of the country has also begun taking action in such cases.

In Kolkata, a woman was arrested on Monday for allegedly sharing fake information pertaining to COVID-19 on WhatsApp. She had apparently claimed in her post that 15 people have tested positive for novel coronavirus in New Alipore area of the city and that the state government was suppressing the information.

An officer said the Kolkata Police has also been keeping any eye on social media to prevent circulation of fake news.

In Himachal Pradesh, a journalist has been booked for reportedly spreading fake news regarding plying of buses amid the lockdown.

A 30-year-old man was arrested in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday for uploading a fake and alarmist Facebook post in the name of Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in connection with the lockdown, according to the police.

Similar arrests have been made in Mizoram and some other parts of the country as well, while Maharashtra Police’s cyber unit has registered 36 FIRs across the state against those spreading fake news about coronavirus on social media.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-fear-factor-combined-with-fake-news-creates-new-infodemic-on-social-media/article31207883.ece

The Congress on Monday asked the Union government to pay 70% of the wage bill of the micro, small and medium (MSME) enterprises for the next three months and make it mandatory for the employers not to retrench their employees for the next six months.

Party president Sonia Gandhi also formed a central control room at the headquarters to monitor the ground situation with regard to the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

Party general secretary K.C. Venugopal also announced that the Congress Working Committee (CWC) would meet on Thursday through video conferencing.

In a series of tweets, former Finance Minister P. Chidamabaram demanded a bold new Financial Assistance Package immediately.

Addressing an online press conference, Congress spokesperson Prof. Gourav Vallabh said there are 4.25 crore MSMEs that contribute around 29% to the GDP and employ about 45 crore people.

“One month of the wage bill is around ₹50,000 cr. and for three months, it will be around ₹1.50 lakh crore. So,70% of the same works out to approximately ₹1 lakh crore,” said Prof. Vallabh.

The Congress spokesperson also suggested that truck drivers should be given advance payment through direct benefit transfer to ensure that the supply of essentials were not affected. There are approximately 30 lakh truck drivers and the burden will be around ₹25,000 crore.”

Talking about the exodus of workers leaving cities fearing job losses, he said, “The Central government should come out with a law that there shall be no retrenchment in any sector or company whatsoever for the next 6 months. And this shall be applicable to every company/enterprise.”

“It is now conclusively established that the lockdown was declared and enforced in 4 hours without any preparation whatsoever. Tragic,” said Mr. Chidamabaram. “A confidence boosting financial assistance plan should have been announced either before or simultaneously with the announcement of lockdown.”

“The FM’s FAP was so miserly and inadequate, it actually promoted many to go back to their villages. I urge the government to announce a bold FAP II today or tomorrow,” he said.

The party’s control room under Mr. Venugopal will have three members — newly elected Rajya Sabha member Rajiv Satav, former MLA Devendra Yadav and Party secretary Manish Chatrath.

“The Pradesh Congress Committees will update the Central Control Room on a daily basis with regard to the spread of the virus, the medical preparedness of the respective governments as also the relief work being undertaken by the party and state agencies,” said a party statement.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8jyqh4/article31207866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-CHIDAMBARAM-BJR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pay-70-of-msmes-wage-bill-for-next-three-months-congress-tells-centre/article31207776.ece

The paramilitary forces have directed that ‘live location’ of all officers and jawans allowed to work from home or on leave should be obtained daily to prevent the spread of COVID-19 after two positive cases were reported among them, officials said on March 30.

Border guarding force Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has taken a lead and directed all team heads a few days back to undertake this exercise daily and submit a compliance report twice to the headquarters in Delhi at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

In a directive accessed by PTI, the force has ordered that a senior officer designated for the task should every morning give a call to all personnel allowed to ‘work from home’ or on leave and subsequently ask them to send their ‘live location’ over the latest WhatApp group especially created for this purpose.

“This is aimed to check that none of the personnel misuse their leaves and stay at homes. This is important as it will not only help in strict enforcement of the ongoing lockdown declared by the government but also save the vital manpower of these fighting forces from contracting coronavirus,” a top Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) Commander told PTI.

All supervisory officers have been asked to check the WhatsApp live location provided by their subordinates with the house addresses furnished by them in official records, he said.

He said while no such case of violation has been detected till now but the intelligence and vigilance arms of these about 10 lakh personnel strong forces have reported that misuse of official ID card, uniform or government-issued vehicle by force personnel to visit their homes or family members during the leave period can take place, and hence checks need to be deployed.

“The snoop wings indicated that the police forces manning check posts in the city and at borders may not strictly check official force vehicles or allow those in uniform or carrying ID cards. Some erring personnel can misuse this authority,” the Commander said.

The paramilitary forces comprising the ITBP, Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) are also known as CAPFs.

They work under the command of the Union Home Ministry for rendering a variety of internal security tasks and border guarding.

The officer was himself in-charge of managing affairs of a special quarantine centre created at its academy in Tekanpur to treat COVID-19 patients.

These forces have also circulated a declaration form amongst the personnel to report if any of their family members have returned from abroad in the recent past or they have come in touch with someone who is infected.

This measure is also aimed to ensure that any such individual can been immediately be isolated or quarantined and his medical tests are conducted, officials said.

84,2020/03/30,Tax dept. asks officers working from home to chase large taxpayers for dues,"“While the ITBA platform is not available to the officers for discharging statutory functions, it is still possible to follow up the pending collection matters by contacting large taxpayers telephonically/electronically,” IT Commissioner said.

A three-month extension in deadlines for tax payment and filing of returns notwithstanding, the Income-Tax Department has asked field formations to contact large taxpayers over phone or email to follow up on pending collections.

Rakesh Gupta, Commissioner of Income Tax (Coordination & Systems), Central Board of Direct Tax (CBDT), last week asked field formations to submit a daily report on follow-ups on pending tax collections from large taxpayers.

While most tax officers working from home in view of the lockdown announced to check the spread of Covid-19, it is possible to continue working in today’s connected world, the message to officials said.

“While the ITBA (Income Tax Business Application) platform is not available to the officers for discharging statutory functions, it is still possible to follow up the pending collection matters by contacting large taxpayers telephonically/electronically,” Gupta wrote.

The message came within days of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announcing three months extension in the deadline for filing of income tax returns as well as payment of delayed advanced tax, self-assessment tax, regular tax, tax deducted at source, tax collected source, and securities transaction tax.

The directive from CIT (C&S) has not gone down well with officers with their association writing to CBDT Chairman against it.

The joint body of Income Tax Employees Federation & Income Tax Gazetted Officers’ Association in the letter expressed surprise at the direction “to pressurize the assesses/defaulters to pay taxes when the Finance Minister has recently announced various extensions of the statutory compliances including the extension of the last date for the (dispute resolution scheme) Vivad se Vishvash scheme and also reduced the penal interest rates.”

“The people’s backlash in the wake of such pressures to pay taxes in the present scenario is very much evident,” the convenor Ravi Shankar wrote.

The association said it was not possible for assessing officers (AOs) to furnish a daily report for daily collection of current/arrear demand or applications received under the Vivad se Vishvash Scheme as the contact information of assessees/defaulters was not available at homes of the officers.Also, the officers did not have access to the ITBA platform.

It asked the chairman to direct the authorities below him “to remain positive, sensitive towards the present situation, adopt a humane approach and avoid pressing the panic button within the department“.

The Finance Minister had on March 24 announced an extension in last for filing income tax returns for 2018-19 fiscal to June 30 as well as linking of income tax PAN with biometric ID Aadhaar by a similar three months.

Also, a three-month extension in the deadline was announced for those opting for the tax dispute resolution scheme ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ scheme by paying the principal amount. Previously the deadline for payment of such amount was March 31 and any payment after that was to be charged with an additional 10%. Now, no additional 10% amount requires to be paid if payment is made by June 30, 2020.

Similarly, “due dates for issue of notice, intimation, notification, approval order, sanction order, filing of appeal, furnishing of return, statements, applications, reports, any other documents and time limit for completion of proceedings by the authority and any compliance by the taxpayer including investment in saving instruments or investments for rollover benefit of capital gains under Income Tax Act, Wealth Tax Act, Prohibition of Benami Property Transaction Act, Black Money Act, STT law, CTT Law, Equalization Levy law, Vivad Se Vishwas law where the time limit is expiring between March 20, 2020, to June 29, 2020, shall be extended to June 30, 2020,” an official statement issued on March 24 had said.

85,2020/03/30,"Coronavirus | Indians diplomats return from Afghanistan, sent to ITBP quarantine facility","India decides to temporarily close its consulates in Jalalabad and Herat

Thirty-one Indian nationals, including 26 security force personnel of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and four diplomats from the Indian consulate in Jalalabad returned here from Afghanistan on Monday, after the government decided to temporarily close its Consulates in Jalalabad and Herat over fears of the coronavirus and growing security threats.

Watch | What is contact tracing?

All the personnel, who were brought in on a special Kam airlines flight from Kabul organised by the Afghanistan Embassy to fly out Afghan nationals, were taken directly to the ITBP special facility in Chhawla for 14 days of quarantine, the ITBP spokesperson said. Another group of Indian Ministry of External Affairs and ITBP personnel from the consulate in Herat, near the Iranian border, are expected to return on Thursday. As The Hindu had reported on Monday, operations at the Consulate, which will be serviced by local personnel, are being suspended, and will be resumed only after a detailed assessment, given the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan.

Bodies flown in

The widow of one of the victims in the March 25 Kabul Gurdwara attack was also flown back, accompanying the bodies of three Indians killed: Delhi resident Tian Singh, and Ludhiana residents Shankar Singh and Jiwan Singh. Tian Singh's last rites were held on Monday at a cremation ground here, amidst growing concerns over the safety of minorities in Afghanistan.

In the last few days, both Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, and Cabinet Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal have called for the government to relocate Sikhs from Afghanistan, given the worsening security situation. Twenty-five Sikhs including a 6-year old child were killed during the attack on the Kabul Gurdwara claimed by the Islamic State Khorasan Province group (ISKP), which has been targetting minorities in the country, including two deadly attacks in Kabul this month.

‘Part of Afghan society’

In an exclusive interview to The Hindu, Afghanistan’s Charge D’affaires Tahir Qadiry said that while his government understood the concerns, Sikhs and Hindus remain an “integral part” of Afghan society, and added that President Ashraf Ghani is “personally monitoring” investigations. “As a nation, our minorities adorn our diverse character. And that is why various programmes have been implemented to safeguard the rights and uplift the status of our Hindu and Sikh population. In a recent decree, the President facilitated the provision of identity cards through our Embassy to all Afghan Sikhs and Hindus born in India. There’s also a provision of reservation for Hindus and Sikhs in our Parliament,” he added.

When asked about the impact of the recent U.S.-Taliban deal on the security situation in the country, Mr. Qadiry said the Kabul attacks “warrant the pertinence of an enduring and perennial ceasefire, and the same has been stressed in the deal.” He said that the Ghani government had announced an all-inclusive negotiating team to begin talks with the Taliban, that were due on March 12, but have run into trouble over the issue of prisoner releases.

The envoy also thanked India for its cooperation during the COVID-19 crisis, and for allowing five special flights being operated this week in order to take out about 2,500 Afghan citizens. “We have continuously been engaged with Indian officials to work out modalities to evacuate all the stranded Afghan citizens in India, most of whom had come to India for tourism or to avail medical services,” he said, thanking the government for its cooperation, and Delhi police who helped bring the Afghan citizens from three different locations to the airport despite lockdown restrictions.

Q&A with Tahir Qadiry

What is the latest on the investigations in the ISKP-claimed Kabul Gurudwara attack in which 25 people, including an Indian, were killed?

The attack in the Gurudwara in Kabul is undoubtedly dastardly and diabolical. His Excellency President Ashraf Ghani is personally monitoring the investigations into this. Our National Security Advisor, Hamdullah Mohib paid a visit to the targetted Gurudwara and met with the bereaved families. The Government has accentuated brisk delivery of all possible assistance to the family members of those who got killed.

How do you respond to the demand from leaders in Punjab that all Sikhs in Afghanistan should be brought to India?

We consider Afghan Hindus and Sikhs as an integral part of our society. As a nation, our minorities adorn our diverse character. And that is why various programs have been implemented to safeguard the rights and uplift the status of our Hindu and Sikh population. In a recent decree, the President facilitated the provision of identity cards through our Embassy to all Afghan Sikhs and Hindus born in India. Besides, there's also a provision of reservation for Hindus and Sikhs in our Parliament. All of this explains the significance we ascribe to the diversity manifested by our Hindus and Sikhs as Afghan citizens and how special their place is in our society. Afghanistan has begun the evacuation of about 2,500 tourists and travellers stuck in India.

In what ways are India and Afghanistan cooperating during this COVID-19 pandemic?

Ever since the restrictions were put in place to contain and prevent the outbreak of COVID-19, we have continuously been engaged with Indian officials to work out modalities to evacuate all the stranded Afghan citizens in India, most of whom had come to India for tourism or to avail medical services. With the generous cooperation by the Indian Government, we were able to place 5 ferry-flying through an Afghan private airline. The second flight is taking place today and three more will happen in the coming days. In addition, we have received exceptional cooperation and support from the Delhi Police, amid tight restrictions on movement, who helped to transfer Afghans from three different locations to the airport.

How far will the SAARC initiative by PM Modi, and President Ghani's contribution to the COVID-19 response fund go in countering the pandemic?

I believe it was a very innovative and timely response to propose an Emergency COVID-19 Fund for SAARC nations by Prime Minister Modi. Our Government has reiterated and underscored the call of the Indian Government to put forward the joint efforts in this hour of need to check and prevent the transmission of this deadly virus. That is why His Excellency President Ghani was prompt to announce $1 million to the COVID-19 Emergency Fund. Together, we can conquer this disease in the region.

India has now closed operations and is moving out staff from the Jalalabad and Herat consulates. What is the latest assessment of the virus in Afghanistan?

The Government is well-versed with the gravity of the situation right now, and as a corollary, Herat and Kabul have been put under temporary lockdown. We have adopted various strategies of equal propensity to tame the economic impact of these restrictions and to make sure that there's no shortage of food, essential services, or important commodities. Recently, with the well-meaning and kind cooperation of India, Afghanistan was able to procure 75,000 tonnes of wheat to inject into our food supply. The Government is also proactively coordinating foreign aid to check any hindrances arising in the way of running all essential services in the country. Besides, various public awareness campaigns have been launched in different parts of the country to spread information regarding COVID-19 and the best practices to safeguard oneself and others.

How do you see the security situation in the aftermath of the US-Taliban deal? In particular, what will happen to the planned Intra-Afghanistan talks?

The recent attacks in Kabul warrant the pertinence of enduring and perennial ceasefire, and the same has been stressed in the [US-Taliban] deal. Further, the Government has unequivocally asserted a comprehensive plan, as a part of a deal, to put an end to all kinds of violence festering our country. The Government has announced an inclusive negotiating team, which is working out a detailed, all-inclusive, and realistic plan that will steward all the aspirations of Afghan citizens.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8agdx6/article31207715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-ITBP-QUARANTINE-PTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-indians-diplomats-return-from-afghanistan-sent-to-itbp-quarantine-facility/article31207061.ece
86,2020/03/30,Coronavirus lockdown: SC seeks status report from govt. on movement of migrant workers,"CJI S.A. Bobde makes it clear that the court does not want to create a state of confusion by passing any direction at this point of time while the government is on the job

The Supreme Court on Monday sought a report from the government on steps taken about the largescale inter-State movement of migrant workers during the 21-day national lockdown on account of the COVID-19 outbreak.

A Bench of Chief Justice S.A. Bobde and L. Nageswara Rao was hearing via videoconferencing petitions filed separately by advocates Alakh Alok Srivastava and Rashmi Bansal seeking directions to the government to immediately redress the “heart-wrenching and inhuman plight of thousands of migrant workers” who are walking back to their native villages from the cities without basic essentials in the wake of the lockdown and provide them with medical aid.

‘Stop migration’

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta agreed to file a status report by Tuesday (March 31). The law officer said the migration should be stopped to control the spread of the virus.

Ms. Bansal submitted that counsellors should be deputed to advice people not to panic.

Chief Justice Bobde said the court did not want to comment on anything until the government filed its status report.

Mr. Mehta said a message should not go out to the public that the court was trying to smoothen the process of migration.

The CJI made it clear that the court did not want to create a state of confusion by passing any direction at this point of time while the government was on the job.

Heart-wrenching, says plea

The petition filed by Mr. Srivastava said the sight of migrant workers, forced to walk with their families, which include women, infants, and children without food, water, shelter or medicines was heart-wrenching and inhuman.

The petition asked the court to direct the government to order the local administration/police authorities across India to immediately identify such moving/stranded migrant workers and to immediately shift them to the nearest government shelter homes/accommodations with proper food, water, medicines and under medical supervision, in a dignified manner, till the present lockdown continued.

“Being jobless and stranded, migrants workers are not only struggling to make ends meet, but are now also fighting a stigma as ‘virus’ carriers. Hence, they are not likely to be accepted by their respective villages once they reach there. Even otherwise, it is not safe to allow these migrant labourers, who might be infected from deadly Coronavirus, from mixing up with their village populations, as it may exponentially increase the said virus with fatal consequences,” the petition said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/3mi3er/article31202279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th29-devesh-RetGFM7A2QLP3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-lockdown-sc-seeks-status-report-from-govt-on-movement-of-migrant-workers/article31204990.ece
87,2020/03/30,Kerala MP urges SC to lift Karnataka blockade to avert big crisis,"Blockade is ‘ill-planned and dangerous’ and has led to loss of lives, he says

Kerala MP Rajmohan Unnithan on Monday urged the Supreme Court to direct Karnataka to forthwith open its borders with Kerala for the safe passage of ambulances and other emergency vehicles and trucks carrying essential and non-essential supplies in order to avert a humanitarian crisis during the COVID-19 outbreak.

The parliamentarian, represented by advocates Haris Neeraj and Pallavi Pratap, sought the court to issue an ex-parte stay on the operation of the blockade imposed by Karnataka with its border States.

Mr. Unnithan, who represents Kasaragod, said Karnataka's blockade was “ill-planned and dangerous” and had led to loss of lives. Two patients from Kerala, in need of urgent medical care, died after their ambulances were denied entry at the border by the Karnataka authorities. One of them was a 70-year-old woman.

‘Register FIR’

Mr. Unnithan said the court should direct Karnataka to register an FIR and set up a special investigation team against the Karnataka officials responsible for stopping the patients who died because they could not access medical care.

“Imposition of such a blockade at a time when supply of commodities is itself hit hard and when a medical emergency has plagued the entire country is a clear violation of Articles 21 and 19(d) of the Constitution. This blockade has also resulted in cutting off the essential lifeline of national highways and State highways and major district roads leading to Kerala, which has resulted in the shortage of medical, essential and non-essential supplies”, the petition said.

Kasaragod is the northernmost district of Kerala, and closest to Karnataka. People of Kasaragod go to Mangaluru district for medical care by crossing the border, in particular the Kasaragod-Mangaluru border at Talappadi.

The petition highlighted that any failure to grant ex-parte/ interim stay would cause “irreparable injury and also violate the fundamental rights of the petitioner as well as the crores of citizens of this country especially those residing in Kerala”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rlrxmi/article31202339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HinduTemplateGU37A1SLL4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala-mp-urges-sc-to-lift-karnataka-blockade-to-avert-big-crisis/article31204955.ece

90,2020/03/30,COVID-19 | Numbers show high fatality rate in Gujarat,"Of 69 cases reported from State, six have resulted in death

With six deaths caused by COVID-19 out of the 69 cases of infection reported from the State, Gujarat is apparently witnessing the highest fatality rate in the country.

As per the State Health Department’s morning briefing on Monday, a 45-year-old female patient died of COVID-19, taking the total number of casualties to six in the State. She died in Bhavnagar, 180 km from Ahmedabad, where one person had already succumbed to the contagious disease.

So far, three persons have succumbed to the disease in Ahmedabad, two in Bhavnagar and one in Surat. In Bhavnagar, of six persons found positive for COVID-19, two have already died.

Though the fatality rate appears high in Gujarat, officials of the Health Department are stressing on the fact that most of the patients who succumbed had co-morbid conditions and were suffering from multiple ailments like diabetes, which is a common condition in the State.

However, medical experts attribute multiple factors for the higher fatality rate, besides co-morbid conditions.

Key factors

“Co-morbid conditions may be prevalent and they contribute to higher fatality rate to some extent but other factors like late diagnosis are equally important,” said a top infectious disease expert from Ahmedabad.

He and other private doctors, particularly those dealing with infectious diseases, believe that the State authorities should go for higher numbers of testing to ascertain the extent of epidemic in the public.

So far, 1,206 people have been tested as per the State Health Department’s figures as on Sunday evening.

Over 450 doctors recruited recently as medical officers in the CAPFs have been asked to join service “immediately” as the forces are ramping up their healthcare setup to combat COVID-19, a top paramilitary officer said on Sunday.

Retired medical officers have been “alerted” and modalities are being worked on to hire doctors on contractual service to man the chain of the forces’ country-wide hospitals and quarantine centres that have a combined strength of more than 7,200 beds, ITBP Director General (DG) Surjeet Singh Deswal told PTI.

They will enhance our strength in combating the situation arising out of the coronavirus outbreak in the country,” Mr. Deswal said.

A senior official said the plan was formulated at the ITBP headquarters and top-level sanctions were obtained from the Union Home Ministry before summoning these doctors. These doctors, the DG said, were recruited recently by the government for the CAPFs and ITBP was the nodal agency for their recruitment.

The CAPFs have a combined strength of over 2,000 doctors and specialists at present apart from other paramedical staff. These doctors are being posted to CAPF hospitals and bases near their place of stay so that they can join without having to travel far, the ITBP chief said.

The government had recently taken over the chain of 32 CAPF hospitals across the country, with a total capacity of about 1,900 beds, for isolation and treatment of COVID-19 affected patients. These forces comprise the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Border Security Force (BSF), the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).

Mr. Deswal said the force, apart from round-the-clock medical monitoring and providing essential services of food and entertainment to the inmates, has now begun counselling them.

“Some of the people who have been evacuated from COVID-19-affected countries and are kept at our centre have high anxiety levels as they have seen devastation all around. That is normal for a human. We have begun their counselling and are motivating them by presenting them the facts about this viral diseases and success stories,” Mr. Deswal, a 1984-batch Haryana cadre IPS officer, said.

‘Morale high’

At present, he is also heading the BSF as an additional charge. The DG said the morale of the force doctors and other staff members at the Chhawla camp is “high and they are committed in this fight against coronavirus.”

A leading member of Iran’s Zoroastrian community has appreciated the support extended by the New Delhi Parsi Association and the Zoroastrian Anjoman of Mumbai in fighting the Iranian COVID-19 crisis. Sepanta Niknam, leader of the Zoroastrian or Parsi community in Iran’s heritage city of Yazd, said the medicines supplied by the two associations would help the tiny community in Iran which has been overwhelmed by the viral infection.

He said two consignments of medicines and safety equipment were received by the community till March 26. More such consignments are likely to reach Yazd soon. According to Iran’s 2011 census, the country has 25,271 Parsis. In recent weeks, several members of the Iranian Zoroastrian community including head of the community in Shiraz Aflatoon Sohraabi passed away because of the COVID-19.

Iran has several thousand Indians at present including the stranded Shia pilgrims in Qom and students and members of the Sikh community in Tehran and other cities. Iran’s Mahan Air was permitted to fly a limited number of commercial flights to India since New Delhi has stopped the aviation connection on February 27 because of the outbreak in Iran.

109,2020/03/30,"Helping the helpers: NGO distributes fruits, water to policemen","With the temperature soaring to 35°C even before the beginning of the month of April, it has become doubly difficult for them to work under scorching heat for hours on end.

While most of the country has returned to its shell, duty-minded people are working day in and day out to fight the crisis due to COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, police personnel have to stand for hours at major junctions in a city to ensure absolute lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. Adding to their problems is the unfavourable weather.

With the temperature soaring to 35°C even before the beginning of the month of April, it has become doubly difficult for them to work under scorching heat for hours on end. To help the policemen beat the heat, NGO Praja Chaitnya Vedika founder Kalisetti Appalanaidu distributed watermelons to more than 100 constables in Ranasthalam, Pydibhimavaram, Etcherla and other places of Srikakulam district.

“A majority of the constables are exposed to direct summer heat. There are chances of them suffering from sunstroke too. Therefore, we have decided to distribute watermelons and butter milk packets to all of them during the lockdown period,” said Mr. Appalanaidu.

Srikakulam SP R.N.Ammi Reddy appreciated members of Praja Chaitnya Vedika for their humanitarian gesture, while urging people to cooperate with the police personnel in discharging their duties. He said that their active cooperation was needed to prevent coronavirus cases in the district.

Meanwhile, in Srikakulam district, tussle between police and people have become order of the day. Recently, a constable was at the receiving end of attacks from locals in Tekkali.

112,2020/03/30,COVID-19 | CM Jagan Mohan Reddy unveils two-stage plan for urban areas,"Make sure no house is left out, Jagan tells officials

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday unveiled a two-stage strategy to check the spread of COVID-19 with particular emphasis on urban areas in the State.

At a review meeting on Monday, he set out the priorities for the officials. In the first stage, ward volunteers, primary resource persons of SHGs, health secretaries in ward secretariats, ASHA workers and additional ANMs would be members of the teams that conduct a survey in their respective wards. The teams should keep tab on every house even in cases there are no foreign returnees. In the second stage, a doctor should be designated to every ward of the corporation.

One doctor should be designated for every three wards in municipalities. The data submitted by the first team should be analysed daily and plans prepared accordingly, he said.

It was necessary to focus on urban areas and intensify the measures as virus outbreak in urban areas is more due to the higher density of population and more number of foreign returnees, he said. The CM also underscored the need for home isolation. Adequate number of beds should be set up in every district for the purpose, he added.

“Ensure clean and sanitised surroundings in urban and rural areas. Monitoring in areas from where cases have been reported will be intensified. Migrant workers who are stranded at various places across the State and and on borders will be provided good accommodation and quality food. The officer in charge will monitor the situation at the camps,” he said.

Jagan meets Governor

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy also met Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan at the Raj Bhavan and explained the steps being taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. He thanked the Governor for approving the Ordinance to the vote-on-account Budget.

Mr. Reddy briefed the Governor on the medical facilities, availability of essential commodities, sensitisation programmes, implementation of lockdown, supply of ration and other measures during the lockdown period.

Mr. Harichandan advised the Chief Minister to avail the services of Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), other NGOs and the students in help the poor during the crisis.

113,2020/03/30,Tirumala Jeeyars rubbish social media posts as ‘blatant lies’,"‘Naivedyam to Lord has not been diluted and all rituals are being scrupulously followed’

The Tirumala Tirupati Pedda Jeeyar and Chinna Jeeyar condemned as ‘blatant lies’ the social media posts about non-performance of mandatory rituals and appealed to people to not believe the posts that portrayed the Tirumala temple in a bad light.

Some of the unverified facts, which he called ‘deliberately floated lies’, included non-offering of ‘Naivedyam’ as prescribed in the religious texts to Lord Venkateswara.

There was also a rumour that the ‘Akhanda Deepam’, the main oil wick lamp in the sanctum sanctorum, had extinguished during the period when the temple was closed to public due to COVID-19 restrictions.

Apart from the social media posts, the clarification was also necessitated by the complaint allegedly made by a temple priest to the government that the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) officials were forcing the priests to hurry up their scheduled rituals within the shrunken time.

‘No violation’

The Pedda Jeeyar Swamy told the media here on Monday that the offerings (Naivedyam) to Lord Venkateswara had not been diluted and the ‘Dittam’ (standard measures) was being scrupulously followed.

“Bhagawad Ramanuja established the Mutt and prescribed the code of worship in the 12th century to be followed in tune with the guidelines of Vaikhanasa Agama. The successive pontiffs who have held this post have been following the same and there is no violation as is being alleged,” he clarified.

Pointing to the TTD providing food to nearly 50,000 people in Tirupati everyday during the time of crisis, the pontiff laughed away the charge that the food offerings to the Lord had been reduced. He, however, explained that only the Prasadam meant to be distributed among devotees had been suspended in the wake of closure of darshan for pilgrims.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tirumala-jeeyars-rubbish-social-media-posts-as-blatant-lies/article31211918.ece
114,2020/03/30,Subsistence allowance for junior advocates sought,"Bar Council writes letter to Chief Minister

The Bar Council of Andhra Pradesh has appealed to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to provide a subsistence allowance of ₹20,000 per month to all junior and needy advocates for three months with immediate effect to help them overcome the crisis owing to the COVID-19 lockdown.

In a letter to the Chief Minister on Monday, Bar Council Chairman Ganta Rama Rao requested that the allowance be paid out of the interest accrued on the ₹100 crore sanctioned by the government for the welfare of advocates.

He also sought a subsistence allowance of ₹10,000 for advocate clerks for three months and wanted ₹5,000 stipend to be paid to junior advocates in time.

“The Bar Council has a mechanism to provide financial assistance in the event of death of any advocate, but it has no separate fund to meet the exigencies like the present one,” said Mr. Rama Rao.

Lockdown effect

The advocates and clerks are heavily dependent on the legal profession for their livelihood and they need to confine themselves to their homes as the court work across the State has come to a standstill due to the lockdown, he said, adding that the advocates are unable to provide the basic necessities to their families.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/subsistence-allowance-for-junior-advocates-sought/article31211908.ece

116,2020/03/30,Officials help migrant labourers in Anantapur district,"Shelters are also started for beggars and street urchins

Arid Anantapur district is known for its migrant labour force, who mainly go to Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, but return to their native villages in Kadiri, Puttaparthi and Kalyandurg Assembly constituency areas a week ahead of Ugadi to return within 15 days. But this year, COVID-19 changed their fate and 1,326 of them have been forced to stay back without any source of income.

District officials identified such persons in several mandals with the help of village volunteers and their list has been prepared with house addresses. Each of them has been mapped to a healthcare professional for regular monitoring, said District Collector Gandham Chandrudu. As of now, they are being given welfare benefits as per the State government’s norms. They are also being sensitised on how to fend off COVID-19 with change in personal hygiene and social behaviour.

While 474 persons had come from Karnataka, 27 from Maharashtra, 68 Telangana, 37 Kerala, 10 Tamil Nadu, 3 Delhi and one each had come from Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Place of migration of 700 more is yet to be ascertained. Stay-at-home orders have been issued to all those family members.

Meanwhile, 445 beggars and street urchins in Anantapur town have found a temporary shelter, where they would be fed and health taken care of by the district administration in association with different NGOs.

Four shelters at Kamalanagar, Social Welfare Hostel near Guild of Service, Kazanagar, and Maruthi Nagar were started on Saturday where they had started arriving one by one. While 134 of them preferred to stay put at the place of their begging, but the administration with the help of police is contemplating shifting them to these shelters. “None of them was getting any alms as people had stopped coming out,” Mr. Chandrudu observed.

Deputy Chief Minister holding the Medical and Health portfolio Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas said cases will be booked against foreign returnees if they violate the home quarantine norms.

Addressing doctors at a review meeting at SVIMS auditorium here on Monday, he said they would be shifted to the government quarantine centre, if they were found to have violated the 14-day mandatory home quarantine. “We have found that a total of 29,672 persons have reached the State from foreign countries.

Mr. Srinivas laid emphasis on the need to maintain the prices of essential commodities within the reach of consumers and suggested an increase in the number of rythu bazaars, fair price shops and meat outlets, with strict adherence to the ‘social distancing’ norm.

Committee formed

A district-level coordination committee formed with the Minister as the Chairman and the constituency-level committee headed by the legislator would go a long way in implementing the measures at the ground level, he hoped.

123,2020/03/30,COVID-19 | Naval Dockyard designs multi-feed oxygen manifold,"It will cater to needs of 6 patients at a time

To cater to the requirement of oxygen supply for multiple patients during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, personnel from the Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam, have designed an innovative ‘Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold (MOM)’ using a 6-way radial header fitted to a single cylinder. This innovation would enable one oxygen bottle to cater to the needs of six patients concurrently thus enabling critical care management to a larger number of COVID patients with the existing limited resources. The entire set up was made operational by the manufacturing of a Fine Adjustment Reducer and specific adapters of requisite dimensions for connecting the oxygen cylinder and the portable MOM.

A typical oxygen providing facility at hospitals comprises an oxygen cylinder feeding only one patient through a Ventimask arrangement. During the ongoing pandemic, ventilator support will be required for about 5-8% of patients with symptoms whereas a large number would require oxygen support. The existing facilities are not adequate to cater for such large requirements. A need was therefore felt to design a suitable portable arrangement that could provide oxygen through masks to a number of needy patients using a single cylinder during emergencies which is the need of the hour.

The preliminary trials of the entire assembly was conducted at MI Room at Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam. This was followed by rapid trials at the Naval Hospital INHS Kalyani, wherein the portable MOM was successfully set up within 30 minutes. After successful trials, Naval Dockyard, Visakhapatnam, has commenced manufacture of 10 portable MOMs with two 6-way radial headers catering for 120 patients at makeshift locations to cater to the COVID-19 pandemic.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/2g0abg/article31211782.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31-VZ-OXYGENFEED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/coronavirus-naval-dockyard-designs-multi-feed-oxygen-manifold/article31211783.ece

The spiritual town of Tirupati, besides being an educational hub, of late, has also become a home to several thousands of workers with a spurt in the hotel industry as well as construction field.

With the announcement of lockdown, thousands of workers suddenly found themselves workless and cancellation of trains and inter-State bus services further compounded their woes.

Sensing the gravity of the situation, Tirupati MLA Bhumana Karunakar Reddy, who is also a member trustee (special invitee) in the TTD trust board prevailed upon the authorities and convinced them in shouldering the noble task after taking up the issue with the notice of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and Chairman Y.V. Subba Reddy.

On the first day on Saturday, while the TTD supplied about 35,000 food packets, the number rose to 50,000 on the following day and went up to 70,000 on Monday.

Mylapali Rama Rao, 46, jumped into frenzied dance of joy and jubilation when he reached his home in S. Rayavaram Manral in Visakhapatnam district on Monday evening.

128,2020/03/30,"Merger of banks a mega scam, alleges union leader","‘Consequences will be catastrophic if govt. goes ahead with the decision’

The amalgamation of 10 public sector banks into four as part of the ‘consolidation plan' from April 1, bulldozing pleas to defer it due to the lockdown is a mega scam, alleged a prominent trade union leader.

All India Bank Employees’ Association secretary B.S. Rambabu told The Hindu on Monday that the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India were in a hurry to complete the merger process even as the country was in the grip of fear due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

He said two years ago, subsidiaries of the State Bank of India were merged and subsequently, 9,000 branches were closed and 12,000 employees sent home under the Golden Handshake Scheme.

‘Political interference’

Mr. Rambabu, who is general secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Telangana Bank Employees’ Federation, said there was no necessity for merger when Andhra Bank and other banks were functioning efficiently serving regional aspirations. The losses suffered by some of the banks and the subsequent non-performing assets (NPAs) were due to political interference and the ‘pro-corporate’ approach of decision makers .

“There’s no particular criteria followed for merger, though the stated goal is making the banks globally competitive,” he alleged.

Mr. Rambabu said going by past experience, the current round of merger in the backdrop of lockdown and prolonged slowdown might lead to massive loss of jobs in the banking industry and reduction in capital base due to NPA waiver.

He said now the PSU banks had an outstanding NPA of ₹7 lakh crore. With the reference of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) , bad debts were being written off with mala fide intentions. Terming it ‘legal looting,’ he cited how how Bhusan Steel was sold to a private group for ₹35,000 crore as against the outstanding amount of ₹58,000 crore. Pressure was brought on a consortium of 11 banks to accept the deal, he alleged .",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/p4dre3/article31213958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31VIJ4RAMABABU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/merger-of-banks-a-mega-scam-alleges-union-leader/article31211700.ece

131,2020/03/30,8-year-old boy donates his pocket money to CM’s relief fund,"District Collector Gandham Chandrudu asked the boy if he would repent giving his entire savings, his reply that he wanted the people not to suffer, brought smiles.

At a time when hundreds of people are suffering without food and shelter owing to the lockdown, an eight-year-old boy, Devadarshan of Venugopal Nagar in the city, chose to donate his entire pocket money he has been saving for the past four years. Watching people’s sufferings on the TV channels, Devadarshan insisted on donating ₹5,000 in his two colourful earthen piggy banks.

His parents approached the district officials on Monday, who ensured Devadarshan met District Collector Gandham Chandrudu and handed over the money directly to him at his office. A sense of great achievement dawned on the school boy, who left the Collector's office with a lot of satisfaction as he was sure his money would reach the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund. Despite the quantum of donation being small, the gesture coming from such a young boy moved everyone.

Devadarshan would never buy any eatables from outside, though relatives visiting their house used to give him some small amounts for buying edibles, and saved all of that in two piggy banks. Son of a goldsmith, Devdarshan watched on TV the misery of several persons dying due to COVID-19 and asked the Collector to make use of the money for the dead. The Collector explained that nothing could be done for them as they were dead and gone, but it would be utilised to ensure others do not meet the same fate.

Mr. Chandrudu asked the boy if he would repent giving his entire savings, his reply that he wanted the people not to suffer, brought smiles. His father said even he himself had not thought of donating anything for the purpose, but his son’s insistence for the past two days had forced him to take the boy to the Collector.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ly2mny/article31211630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31VJBOYDONATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/8-year-old-boy-donates-his-pocket-money-to-cms-relief-fund/article31211631.ece
132,2020/03/30,Migrant workers desperate to go home,"‘We have lost our jobs in chilli yard and ginning mills and are facing hostility from landlords’

Over 1,000 migrant labourers are caught in a bind as they have been thrown out of work due to the country wide lockdown which entered the second week on Monday. Many of them are from Bihar and have been working in the chilli yard, spinning mills and ginning mills for the last three months.

“We have have already exhausted our savings. All mills and establishments have been closed and we are without wages and even our landlords are insisting that we pay monthly rent. Our landowner is not even giving us water and we have no option except to go back to Bihar,’’ said Sankat Thrupal, a migrant labourer.

Police and revenue personnel reached the place and the district administration was expected to take a decision.

Asia’s largest chilli yard has been closed down for more than five days by a special order from the Collector and District Magistrate throwing hundreds of daily labourers out of their jobs. The famed red chilli, popularly known as ‘Guntur Sannaulu,’ is known for its pungent smell and is preferred by markets in Europe and East Asia.

This is the peak season, when around one lakh bags of dried red chilli are brought to the yard in open trucks daily, and are traded by domestic and international buyers. Hundreds of hamalis earn daily wages ranging from ₹300-₹500 for ferrying chilli bags from trucks, carrying them to godowns and grading them. Several women workers too work in shanties, processing the chilli and cleaning them before they are packed and taken to cold storages.

Price crash

The first signs were felt a few weeks ago, when the prices quoted low as exports to China had taken a beating. A quintal of premium red chilli, which used to fetch ₹10,000 to ₹15,000 per quintal, quoted as low as ₹8,000 to ₹9,000 per quintal.

Chairman of the agricultural market yard Ch. Yesuratnam said stocks were being kept in cold storages with a capacity to store one crore bags.

“The market has taken a big hit. The borders too have been closed. For now, we are advising the farmers to store the produce in cold storages,’’ said Mr. Yesuratnam.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wuzck6/article31211428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31VJMIGRANTPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/migrant-workers-desperate-to-go-home/article31211429.ece

140,2020/03/30,"COVID-19: Be mentally strong to defeat the disease, says recovered patient","The 50-year-old software employee who tested positive for COVID-19 after he returned from the U.S. has spoken about the need to be mentally strong while one is being treated at the isolation centre.

He was discharged from the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases last Monday after two of his tests came negative for COVID-19. He is all in praise for the doctors at the health facility and said that they handled even an “irritable” person like him well. He said that he travelled to Los Angeles via Heathrow and developed fever while in Los Angeles. He cut his trip short and returned to Bengaluru on March 8.

Speaking to The Hindu over phone, he said that his only grouse in the journey was that those screening him at the airport could not test him immediately. “As soon as I landed, I knew something was wrong and I declared that I have fever and body ache. But they were not equipped to give me a test,” he alleged.

He said that he wore a mask and was isolated from his family and went to a private hospital in R.R. Nagar for a test. “They had no idea about the testing and I later went to RGID and the doctors at the hospital were very prompt in attending to me. In fact, I was relieved when I heard that I tested positive because I knew something was wrong,” he said.

He said that managing his fever was a huge challenge particularly because he was in isolation and he felt a bit low. He also said that there was spike in his sugar level, which was another challenge.

Conversations with his spiritual guru and a message from his wife gave him strength to navigate through this phase, he said adding that most patients are still trying to figure out how they have contracted the virus. At the hospital, he said that he tried to spread positivity among other patients by talking to them from a distance.

He says that his own achievement has been that not a single person was infected because of him as he took the necessary precautions. He even praised the government as his daughter, who is a second PU student, was able to write her examination as alternative arrangements were made by the Department of Pre University Education.

He, however, said that his wife had to go through a harrowing experience after people learnt that he had tested positive. He also had to avoid calls as news was leaked that he had tested positive.

“It was difficult because unlike other health conditions, here my family could not come and meet or take care of me,” he said and added that it was important for a patient to be mentally strong to defeat this communicable disease.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-be-mentally-strong-to-defeat-the-disease-says-recovered-patient/article31212348.ece

The ongoing lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19 is likely to hit lakhs of farmers who are supplying milk to 14 milk unions in the State. The milk unions have been asked by the Karnataka Cooperative Milk Producers’ Federation Limited (KMF) to reduce the procurement price by a couple of rupees, besides limiting the procurement.

KMF chairman Balachandra Jarkiholi said that after the lockdown was imposed, the demand for milk had come down drastically in the State and KMF was not a position to convert 8 to 10 lakh litres of excess milk into powder.

“After the lockdown, private players in the border districts of the State such as Belagavi, Kolar have completely stopped procurement of milk from Karnataka farmers. Those farmers are now supplying milk to our milk unions. The quantity of milk being procured by the unions is increasing by the day. On the other hand, demand for milk has come down after the lockdown. We have reached a saturation level in processing the milk as we can only convert 15 lakh litres of milk into powder at our units. We have asked the unions to give priority to farmers who are members of recognised societies and not to procure milk from those supplying milk because private players have stopped procurement.”

The KMF has already written to the heads of the unions to limit the procurement of the milk by not procuring milk at least three shifts in a week. Farmers usually supply milk in two shifts per day — morning and evening.

On the move to lower the milk procurement price, Mr. Jarkiholi said: “At present, the procurement prices being offered by the milk unions to farmers range from ₹29 to ₹31 a litre. It is up to the unions to decide on how much downward revision they would like to make. As per our information, unions may reduce procurement price by ₹1 rupee to ₹2 per litre. Revision in procurement price provided to the farmers will be a temporary measure till the lockdown gets lifted.”

On reports of KMF contemplating to revise Nandini Milk rate (selling prices of milk), the chairman said that there is no such proposal before the KMF.

In his reaction to some of the vendors selling milk at higher price during the lockdown, Mr. Jarkiholi said he has asked KMF’s marketing officials to assess the situation on ground and initiate action against vendors fleecing customers.

“All measures have been taken to supply milk on time. In Bengaluru, the demand had drastically fallen after lockdown was imposed. Now, we are seeing a gradual increase. On Sunday, we supplied 1.5 lakh litres more milk in Bengaluru. Meanwhile, two instances of vendors asking more money from customers have come to my notice. Our officials have been told to ensure no such incidents happen,” said Mr. Jarkiholi.

Production stopped

At present, KMF procures 69 to 70 lakh litres of milk a day from farmers. It sells 40 lakh litres of milk, curd and others on a daily basis.

Due to poor demand following lockdown, KMF has stopped production of 100-plus milk-based products that include 22 varieties of Nandini ice cream.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5820w0/article31212299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGMILK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/milk-unions-asked-to-reduce-procurement-rate-by-a-few-rupees/article31212300.ece
142,2020/03/30,Pharma case: Packages sent from China to be tested,"Unable to get leads on how employees of a pharmaceutical company tested positive for COVID-19, the Health and Family Welfare Department has decided to test the packages that came from China as raw materials to the company.

Speaking at a press conference, Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief secretary of the department, said they are trying to trace the source of how the first patient may have contracted the virus. The department, however, did not give out more details. Four more employees from the company tested positive on Monday.

However, several doctors in the medical fraternity have criticised this move as the virus does not stay on substances for several days.

The first COVID-19 positive case from the company in Nanjangud town was reported on March 26 and nine others from the same company also tested positive subsequently. Patient number 52, a 35-year-old man, who was working in the quality assurance section of the company, was the first to test positive.

The Nanjangud case had generated a lot of importance in this crisis since the first patient had no travel and contact history unlike other cases reported in the State. This case had also raised doubts about “community transmission”, but was denied by the district administration.

Nanjangud town is now a “cluster case” with multiple positive cases reported and the workforce of the company is under observation. Stringent curbs has been enforced with no movement of vehicles into the town.

Also, it is being examined by the healthcare professionals on whether the persons who tested positive now had any direct contact with the first positive case. More than 1,000 company employees have been placed under home quarantine.

Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar said the investigation on how the patient 52 was infected was still underway since the patient had no travel or contact history.

“We need more clarity on the Nanjangud case and doctors handling the cases are looking for evidence on the contagion. The samples of some of the staff members (even though they are not showing symptoms), who are currently in home quarantine, are being collected for the study. We are checking information on whether patient 52 had come in contact with an Australian national or had visited Thailand,” said Mr. Sankar.

Eight new cases

Eight new positive COVID-19 cases have been detected in Karnataka, taking the figures to 91.

Four of the cases are primary contacts of the employee of the pharmaceutical company in Nanjangud, Mysuru, who tested positive earlier this month. All of them are employees of the same company. They have been isolated at a designated hospital in Mysuru.

Another is a 13-year-old male, a resident of Tumakuru and son of patient number 69. Three members of a family in Hospet in Ballari tested positive and did not have any foreign travel history.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pharma-case-packages-sent-from-china-to-be-tested/article31212279.ece
143,2020/03/30,Infosys Foundation commits ₹100 crore,"Infosys Foundation, the CSR arm of tech major Infosys, on Monday said it has committed ₹100 crore to support efforts towards fighting COVID-19 in the country. The foundation has already contributed half the amount to the PM CARES fund, as per a statement.

“This sum will primarily be utilised across three broad areas: to expand hospital capacity for treatment and enable hospital stays for COVID-19 patients across India, especially ones belonging to the economically weaker sections of society; to provide ventilators, testing kits, and personal protective equipment like masks, and other gear for frontline healthcare workers, and to ensure better access to food and nutrition for underprivileged sections, that is bearing the adverse economic impact of the situation,” the foundation said.

“These are unprecedented times that require every section of society to rise up to the challenge. Infosys Foundation will work with governments, non-profits, and healthcare institutions in their fight. All our efforts will be targeted towards ensuring that relief material reaches people who need it the most, whether it is a patient who cannot afford treatment, our healthcare personnel, or daily wage workers,” said Sudha Murty, chairperson of the foundation.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-infosys-foundation-commits-100-crore/article31212252.ece
144,2020/03/30,"Ensure supply of food to the poor, Karnataka HC tells government","The High Court of Karnataka on Monday said the State government should implement, in true letter and spirit, the directions issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on March 29 for protecting the interests of migrant workers. The court said the government should come out with a comprehensive plan to supply food and foodgrains to the poor.

Also observing that the government has to re-examine supplying food in Indira Canteens as it results in mass gathering of people, the court asked the State to consider the need to supply foodgrains to the poor based on photo ID cards, without insisting on ration cards, under the present circumstances.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice B.V. Nagarathna passed the order during a videoconference hearing on PIL petitions related to issues that have cropped up because of the measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Pointing out that the apex court, in its judgment in the case of Swaraj Abhiyan, while dealing with a situation of drought, had asked the authorities to supply foodgrains based on any identification or proof of residence in lieu of ration card, the Bench said that the government has to consider such a measure under the National Food Security Act. The Bench also noted that the government had declared COVID-19 as a “notified disaster” by invoking provisions of the Disaster Management Act.

Earlier, it was pointed out by additional government counsel Vikram Huilgol that the government had decided to release the foodgrains for April-May all at once to ration card-holders of Karnataka and other States in the first week of April.

Stating that it was not dealing with the issue of migrant workers as the same issue was pending before the Supreme Court and the MHA had issued certain directions, the Bench directed the government to enforce laws to prevent hoarding of essential commodities.

The Bench also sought the government’s response on how food was being supplied to pregnant and lactating mothers, and to malnourished children as anganwadis have been closed. It also asked about the supply of midday meals given the closure of schools.

Portal for NGOs

As many non-governmental organisations are engaged in helping the poor in various parts of the State during the lockdown period, the Bench asked the government to create a portal for NGOs to upload information on their geographical area of operation and the nature of relief measures taken up by them.

Based on the information provided on the portal, the government should allocate works to NGOs in an effective manner and streamline the relief measures, it said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ensure-supply-of-food-to-the-poor-karnataka-hc-tells-government/article31212144.ece
145,2020/03/30,Follow Bengaluru Police Commissioner’s path and check excesses: HC to DG&IGP,"The High Court of Karnataka on Monday directed the Director-General and Inspector-General of Police (DG&IGP) to issue a circular to all police personnel in the State, on the lines of the instructions issued by the Bengaluru Police Commissioner urging personnel to restrain from using lathis and to behave with courtesy and patience with citizens while enforcing the lockdown.

However, the court made it clear that citizens also must follow the lockdown directions, including the restrictions on movement, issued by the State and Union governments.

A special Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice B.V. Nagarathna issued the direction when video clippings of police excesses and lathicharge were brought to the notice of the court. The Bench was hearing PIL petitions on issues that have cropped up owing to the measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Karnataka. The hearing was held as a videoconference, with advocates arguing from their private locations.

Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi and additional government counsel Vikram Huilgol pointed out to the Bench that the Bengaluru City Police Commissioner had already issued instructions to the civil police to leave lathis in police station and asked the reserve police personnel to use lathis only if necessary for bandobust. A copy of the instructions issued by the Police Commissioner was submitted to the court.

Following this, the Bench directed the DG&IGP to issue a similar circular to the police force in the State so that instances of police excesses stop. It also directed the State to file its response to the incident in which the police opened fire on a person who had assaulted them when they were enforcing lockdown at Sanjaynagar in Bengaluru city.

On prisoners

The Bench also directed the State to take steps, as per the apex court’s recent directions, for releasing eligible undertrials (on interim bail) and convicts (on parole) to decongest prisons.

The Bench also directed the government to ensure that prisoners, on their release on bail or parole, do not suffer or end up staying on the streets, but safely reach their homes. It directed the government to ensure that the police do not arrest anyone unnecessarily.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/4nibom/article31212092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/follow-bengaluru-police-commissioners-path-and-check-excesses-hc-to-dgigp/article31212093.ece
146,2020/03/30,Veterinarians continue to render their service,"Many are functioning with skeletal staff

As the country fights its battle against COVID-19, the spotlight has fallen on the medical fraternity that has been at the frontline. At the behest of the Prime Minister, a nationwide appreciation was also dedicated to them and other essential service providers.

But there is another wing — veterinary services — that has been quietly working for patients that cannot speak for themselves.

As the lockdown came into force, the Centre reiterated that medical help for animals should be considered an essential service. Though many clinics have cut down the number of appointments, they are available for serious cases. With staff strength reduced, many are functioning with skeletal staff.

Shahid Vaseem, chief vet, CUPA Animal Care Hospital, R.T. Nagar, said the number of cases per day has come down from 120 to 80 approximately. “We have restricted ourselves on need basis. Emergency could mean life and death. But in some cases, loose motion, vomiting or not eating for many days could get serious later. We are dealing with patients who cannot express themselves or speak. Eventually, we are bound to see all cases,” he said. The CUPA Trauma Centre in Hebbal, which is a free service that is donation based and treats only domestic animals that are not pets, said with vehicles and people off the roads, a lot more people were noticing abandoned, hurt or homeless animals and bringing them to the centre. Abandoned pets are also being brought.

“We recently got a Labrador that was maggot ridden after being tied to a tree,” said Suranjana Ganguly, senior veterinarian at the centre.

The staff is now limited to four from 15, and the doctors are taking turns to ensure there is one of them at the centre every day.

Hospitals and clinics are also taking precautions keeping the pet guardians in mind. “We have taken precautions for the staff, such as wearing gloves and masks. An important notice we have put up is to limit one guardian per patient to ensure there is no community transmission,” Dr. Vaseem said.

Around 40% of their staff is not reporting to work, either as a precautionary measure or due to lack of transport. “We are dividing work and managing. We are still getting cases from the public who bring in injured animals. This is something we are used to. But getting the public under control has been more difficult. As there are holidays, three to four family members come with one patient,” he said.

Aaswin K. Cancure Pet Hospital said: “Right now, we are looking at important cases only. We advise owners to call before coming.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xluzf2/article31212034.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGVET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/veterinarians-continue-to-render-their-service/article31212036.ece
147,2020/03/30,Vishwanath seeks recall of ‘inefficient’ officials from Mysuru,"Former Minister A.H. Vishwanath has urged Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to recall “inefficient” officials posted in Mysuru to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Expressing concern over the situation in nearby Nanjangud after 10 employees of a pharmaceutical company tested positive, Mr. Vishwanath, in a video message, has feared that the dreaded virus would spread to Mysuru if immediate steps were not taken by the officials.

He accused the officials of a few departments of inefficiency and irresponsibility. “They are behaving as though it doesn’t concern them,” he said before urging Mr. Yediyurappa to recall such “inefficient” officials from the district and city. He suggested that a special team should be constituted to prevent Mysuru from falling into the grip of COVID-19.

Meanwhile, former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy held a video conference with JD(S) MLAs in the district.

He told MLAs S.R. Mahesh of K.R. Nagar, Ashwin Kumar of T. Narsipur, and Mahadev of Periyapatna to take up steps to not only create awareness among the public, but also ensure that the requirements of the poor and hungry are taken care.

During the video conference, the MLAs complained that the government had not taken proper steps to quarantine the suspects, who had returned from abroad. Mr. Kumaraswamy, who said the quarantined people had not been given proper guidance, asked the MLAs to take up the responsibility of ensuring that virus does not spread.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vishwanath-seeks-recall-of-inefficient-officials-from-mysuru/article31212018.ece
148,2020/03/30,Elderly hit hard by social distancing,"Those living by themselves suffer the most as caretakers stop coming to work

For 81-year-old Subramanian S., a resident of Rajajinagar, the lockdown has been a nightmare as his helper-cum-caretaker has not come to work since last Sunday. “He travels by public transport. He cooks, cleans and helps me with my daily chores. Without him, I feel completely helpless,” he said.

While his son, who lives in the U.S., has managed to get groceries and medicines delivered from a grocery store in the vicinity, he is unable to find help for other tasks. “My son is trying to get a help from one of the agencies. But they are telling him that there are no people available at the moment,” he said. Over the last three days, Mr. Subramanian, who is unable to cook, has survived on cornflakes and milk, and curd rice.

The lockdown is proving to be an arduous ask for senior citizens, who, if nothing else, would enjoy an evening walk. But now that their movement is curtailed, especially in the light of COVID-19 being seen as a potential risk to the elderly, many say they are feeling trapped.

The ones who are having most trouble coping with the situation are those whose mobility is limited or suffering from health issues, and live by themselves.

Lakshmi and Rajanna (names changed), who are 68 and 72 years, respectively, are struggling without their domestic help and cook. The siblings, residents of Basavanagudi, have started making adjustments. While cleaning of the house happens as and when they can manage, the number of meals has been reduced to two — a 10 a.m. brunch and 6.30 p.m. supper. Making three meals is impossible, they say.

Jalajakshi (name changed), 65, is more fortunate. She recently underwent a knee replacement surgery and the caretaker she hired soon after the surgery lives with her 24x7. Her physiotherapist, who used to come every day, has stopped coming.

While several agencies and NGOs are helping senior citizens by delivering essentials, the most challenging task for them is to do their daily chores and cooking. Incidentally, the Bengaluru City Police has also asked the elders helpline to remain closed and has said that their team, which manages 100, will run the show. “On Monday, the police told us to temporarily suspend services. But this is the time when senior citizens are in panic and want to reach out to us because they are lonely,” said S. Premkumar Raja, co-founder, Nightingales Medical Trust, which manages the Elders’ Helpline (1090) in collaboration with the Bengaluru police.

Sai Keshav, who is heading the initiative to help the elderly at Silver Talkies, a social platform that engages with the elderly, said that they had decided to reach out to senior citizens and deliver groceries and medicines at their doorstep. “Senior citizens can be at risk if they contract the virus. So we have decided to deliver essentials to them so that it eliminates their need to go out,” he said.

(This concludes the two-part series on senior citizens.)",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7eiheg/article31211999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGELDERLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/elderly-hit-hard-by-social-distancing/article31212000.ece
149,2020/03/30,Testing facilities yet to start in North Karnataka,"Nearly a fortnight after the State government announced that COVID-19 testing laboratories will be set up in Belagavi, Ballari and Hubballi, the facilities are yet to be started.

Of the five laboratories in the State, only one is in North Karnataka.

The newly set up laboratory at the Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences in Kalaburagi can handle 30 tests per day. The other testing centres are in Hassan, Shivamogga and Bengaluru..

Health Minister B. Sriramulu has on different occasions announced that testing laboratories will be opened in Belagavi, Ballari and Hubballi to reduce the pressure on the laboratories in Bengaluru and to ensure speedy results. But they are yet to be set up.

The test results are getting delayed due to the distance and the crowding in the laboratories, say officials. “For example, 15 swab samples have been sent from Belagavi,” said a doctor from Belagavi, involved in the COVID-19 management process.

Officials say that the process of setting up laboratories is on and that two laboratories in North Karnataka will be set up in a few days. There are some issues with the approval process. The sole agency to approve such laboratories is the Indian Council of Medical Research. “We are facing difficulty getting quick clearances from ICMR,” an officer in the Health Ministry said.

Belagavi has all the necessary equipment for testing. The ICMR-National Institute of Traditional Medicine, which was earlier called the institute for tropical diseases, has the PCR testing machine.

It also has trained scientists who can supervise testing. “We have sent a detailed proposal to the State government and it has been forwarded to ICMR. We are hoping to receive a positive response in a week,” a senior officer said.

In Ballari, the PCR testing kit equipment has been procured. There is a proposal to set up the laboratory in the Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Sciences in Ballari. But the ICMR approval is yet to come. In Hubballi, the government plans to set up the laboratory in the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences. All the preparations to install testing kits are on. A proposal has been sent to ICMR.

The PCR kits help conduct a detailed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to spot the proteins in the coronavirus and identify the virus. The virus has a ribonucleic acid and some proteins in its body. When the virus enters a human body, it lodges itself in the lungs and creates smaller versions of itself. When this is not challenged by the body’s immune system, it could cause problems and even death, a doctor in the district COVID-19 team said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/testing-facilities-yet-to-start-in-north-karnataka/article31211821.ece
150,2020/03/30,Set up panchayat-level panels to procure vegetables from farmers: HDK,"Stating that the current priority was to fight COVID-19, former Chief Minister H.D.

In a series of tweets, he pointed out the crisis in the farm sector due to COVID-19 scare. “In Mandya, sapota was thrown on the streets, in Chickballapur, grapes were dumped in garbage, in Shivamogga, animal husbandary activities had been stopped, and in Kolar, tomato crop was being destroyed. This shows the crisis farmers are facing. My fear is that it will go worse in a few days of time,” he tweeted.

In another tweet, he said: “The government has to make arrangements to purchase farm produce. Otherwise, farm sector will be in a problem, the effects of which will be huge. This will not only affect farmer families, but also hurt the economy.”

“My suggestion is to set up a committee involving officials, volunteers and organisations in all gram panchayat and ward levels. Government can make use of volunteers and procure vegetables and milk through HOPCOMS and KMF, and sell it,” he tweeted.

Mr. Kumaraswamy said: “Arrangements should be made to sell the produce purchased directly from the farmers through small shops. The government should create facilities for transport of vegetables. I have information of persons being fleeced during transportation of farm produce.” This is the question of farmers’ livelihood and food for the people.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/set-up-panchayat-level-panels-to-procure-vegetables-from-farmers-hdk/article31210565.ece
151,2020/03/30,"Cauvery, tributaries look cleaner as pandemic keeps pollution away","Release of industrial effluents, dumping of clothes and waste temporarily stops due to lockdown

The strict enforcement of 21-day lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic has turned out to be a boon for the Cauvery and other rivers in the old Mysuru region as the prohibition of industrial and religious activities has helped in reducing pollution level in the rivers.

According to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), the Cauvery and tributaries like Kabini, Hemavati, Shimsha, and Lakshmanathirtha are regaining their decades-old status in terms of water quality.

While some industries were discharging untreated effluents/chemicals into the Cauvery, pilgrims were dumping tonnes of waste material, including clothes, every day.

The fate of other rivers was not different from the Cauvery. Untreated sewage from residential areas; pollutants from industries; religious waste material from pilgrims, and construction debris had been polluting the rivers.

These rivers were flowing with hazardous elements such as lead, fluoride, faecal coliform, and some suspended solids in highly dangerous quantity. It is evident that the lockdown has significantly brought down the pollution level in rivers, said sources in KSPCB.

However, the board will test the water samples at the regional laboratory in Mysuru under the national programme ‘Monitoring of Indian National Aquatic Resources and Global Environmental Monitoring Scheme’ shortly, said the sources.

The Cauvery was clean when this correspondent visited Karighatta near Srirangapatna on Monday.

Seventy-year-old Marigowda at Karighatta said he had not seen the Cauvery with such “clear and pure water” in the last three decades. According to Nanjamma of Mandya Koppalu, the colour of water was green-black at some places and blue-black at some places till March 22.

Residents of Agrahara, Maralagala, Doddi Palya, Dodda Palya, Chikka Palya, Chinnanayakana Halli, and Mahadevapura on the Cauvery course near Srirangapatna wished the river remained this clear in the future too.

According to them, the Cauvery has been flowing with surprisingly clean water for the last few days following the stoppage of industrial/religious waste entering the river.

The decreasing pollution level in the Cauvery has also enthused the senior revenue officials in Srirangapatna. It is evident that pollution in the Cauvery has significantly decreased, said V.R. Shailaja, Assistant Commissioner, Revenue, Pandavapura subdivision. Speaking to The Hindu, she said the Cauvery is gaining its original sacredness following the lockdown. Her department would initiate pragmatic measures to ensure the river remains clean in future too.

Srirangapatna tahsildar M.V. Roopa said she would initiate measures to curb pollutants. “We will display caution boards at pilgrim centres along the Cauvery, initiate measures to prevent people from leaving religious waste in the water, and take legal actions against industries if they discharge untreated effluents,” she said.

Priests at Paschima Vahini, Gosai Ghat and Sangam on the banks of the river perform death-related rituals. At least 3,000 people visit these places and temples in Srirangapatna every day and dump tonnes of plantain leaves, garlands, clay pots, coconuts, photos of deities, clothes, polythene covers, leftover food, and other puja material in the Cauvery.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2sgstj/article31210428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30KRACAUVERY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cauvery-tributaries-in-old-mysuru-region-look-cleaner-as-pandemic-keeps-pollution-away/article31210429.ece
152,2020/03/30,Hassan police draw flak for beating up man taking son to health clinic,"The Hassan police have come under severe criticism over the recent assault of a man who was on the way to a clinic along with his feverish son. The man was beaten up on the charges of violating lockdown regulations and attacking policemen on duty.

Shabbir Ahmed, 39, an autorickshaw driver living near Shafi Masjid in Hassan, was on the way to Kiran Clinic with his nine-year-old son around 10 a.m. on March 27 on his two-wheeler. Two police constables, Ganesh and Jagadish, attached to the Pension Mohalla station, stopped him and beat him up with their lathis for venturing out of his house. They allegedly did not allow him to explain where he was going and why.

According to eyewitnesses, Mr. Ahmed got angry with the sudden beating in the presence of his child. The police booked a case against him for attacking the constables.

Video clippings of the incident doing the rounds on social media show the policemen continuously hitting Mr. Ahmed with lathis on his head, back and legs. They did not spare him even after he ran into a nearby house to escape. The clips have been widely shared on social media platforms and the police criticised for their actions.

Wife’s complaint

Subsequent to the incident, Mr. Ahmed’s wife Reshma filed a complaint with the police, accusing the two constables of assaulting her husband. However, the complaint has not been registered yet. She alleged that the police beat her husband severely on the road and dragged him into the police station, where they continued to beat him. According to her, when she went to meet him in the station, she was not allowed inside but could hear her husband being assaulted.

The police got a medical examination done and produced Mr. Ahmed before a magistrate, who ordered his release. His family members took him to a private hospital, and he had to get stitches on his head and body. The doctors who treated him suggested that the family take him to NIMHANS in Bengaluru for further examination.

Imran, an advocate, told The Hindu that the police had initially refused to register Ms. Reshma’s complaint. However, after he spoke to senior officers, he got an assurance that the complaint would be registered. They are still waiting for the process to take place.

Mr. Ahmed’s nine-year-old son, who was witness to the incident, has not yet come out of the shock of it all. “He had a fever that day and his father went through all this on the way to a clinic for a health check-up. He could be seen in the video clips that went viral,” the advocate said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hassan-police-draw-flak-for-beating-up-man-taking-son-to-health-clinic/article31210101.ece

Vijay Bhaskar on Monday directed all Deputy Commissioners and Superintendents of Police to close all national highways in the State during the lockdown period.

Mr. Bhaskar convened a meeting of top officials of various departments and instructed the DCs and SPs to strictly implement the Centre’s guidelines without any relaxation. The Centre had issued guidelines on March 24 directing all State governments to follow the guidelines to control the spread of COVID-19.

Sources said that Chief Minster B.S. Yediyurappa has told DCs and SPs to make arrangements on border areas for food and quarantine for migrants returning from cities to villages. It was reported that a large number of shop workers, autorickshaw drivers, goods/transport vehicles, maids, day labourers, and other informal workers were returning home from cities following the lockdown.

For preventing community spread, Mr. Bhaskar asked top officials of each district to monitor primary and secondary contacts of patients who have tested positive. He also directed DCs and SPs to take strict action against shop owners who charge high prices for essential commodities. The police have been told to take steps to ensure practice of social distance by consumers during entry or purchase of essential daily items at grocery shops/malls.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/police-directed-to-close-national-highways/article31209533.ece

On Monday, the district authorities in Uttara Kannada decided to use drone cameras to quickly identify places where people are congregating. Superintendent of Police Shivaprakash Devaraj came up with the idea, and on the first day of surveillance a bunch of youngsters were caught playing at Kotekere in Sirsi. They were admonished and sent home after being given a strong warning.

Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner K. Harish Kumar said that a helpline for Bhatkal taluk has been set up to address grievances related to COVID-19. In a release, he said that already a concept note had been prepared and, under Assistant Commissioner Bharat, a test run completed. Feedback and real-time access are among the important features of the helpline, he said.

Uttara Kannada has also come up with the concept of doorstep healthcare in Bhatkal cluster, where a health emergency has been declared. Under the initiative, being implemented on a pilot basis in Bhatkal, patients are required to call designated doctors and inform them about their problems. Consequently, the doctor on duty on that day will visit the household and give medical advice to the patient. The Deputy Commissioner said the authorities plan to implement this initiative across the district based on the response from the public.

155,2020/03/30,Ending of lockdown depends on how curfew rules are followed: Yediyurappa,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Monday appealed to the people of the State to strictly follow the lockdown rules so that the restrictions imposed across the country can be lifted after the 21-day period.

In a press release, he said, “people must strictly maintain the lockdown in the State, because the ending of the 21-day lockdown imposed across the country depends on how strictly we follow [the rules].”

Seeking the public’s support to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, he said, “The people of Karnataka are known for tolerance and patience. They are law-abiding citizens. Now, coronavirus lockdown is testing the patience of our people.”

He referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s apology saying that the “lockdown was an inevitable step taken by the government to protect people from the pandemic”. “We have to realise the predicament of a Prime Minister who always cares for the well-being of the country and its people,” the Chief Minister said.

Mr. Yediyurappa appealed to citizens not to come out from their homes. “If one follows the curfew strictly, the lockdown period will automatically end on April 14. If not, the government will be forced to review the situation. Whether to end the lockdown or not is in your hands,” he said.

Noting that people in some urban areas have been brazenly violating the curfew rules, forcing the police to act, the Chief Minister urged members of the public not to test the patience of the police. He referred to the sacrifices being made by doctors, nurses, health staff and civic workers, who have been working round the clock to ensure cleanliness and save lives.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ending-of-lockdown-depends-on-how-curfew-rules-are-followed-yediyurappa/article31209401.ece
156,2020/03/30,COVID-19: Areca growers in peril as trading comes to a halt,"The nationwide lockdown, to check the spread of COVID-19, has hit the grass-roots level arecanut growers with trading in the country coming to a halt.

With both private sector traders and cooperative sector marketing societies stopping procurement, small and marginal farmers are in peril now.

Sources in Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Ltd. (CAMPCO), Mangaluru, Dakshina Kannada, and Totgars’ Coopeartive Sale Society Ltd. (TSS), Sirsi, Uttara Kannada, two among the prominent players in the arecanut market, told The Hindu that it will take at least three months for the market to recover after the lockdown ends.

North India is the prominent consumer market for arecanut. As trading has abruptly come to an end, the entire supply chain has been hit with no purchasers at the grass-roots level.

Even after the lockdown ends, the liquidity issues of traders in the consumer market will continue for another three months.

The money of traders in the consumer market has been held up at different stages of the market chain. It will ultimately come in the way of procuring the produce from the growers, sources said.

Unless the consumer market traders pay, the cooperative sector and private sector traders will not be able to procure the produce from farmers, they said.

Once the lockdown got over and if the farmers released their produce to the market at a time for want of money the market will collapse, the sources said. Hence farmers should exercise restraint, they said.

Concurring with this, Mahesh Puchhappady, general secretary, All-India Areca Growers’ Association, Puttur, Dakshina Kannada, said that farmers should not resort to panic selling.

The growers should release their produce slowly only to meet their immediate monetary requirements, he said adding that unlike foodgrain farmers, whose supply chain has not been hit, arecanut growers have been hit badly.

Stocks of white arecanut or ‘chali’ had closed at ₹263-₹305 a kg and red arecanut at around ₹394 a kg at the time of the lockdown.

Sources said that last year’s weather conditions, flood and ‘kole roga’ (fruit rot disease) have resulted in 28% short supply of white arecanut and about 30 % short supply of red variety of arecanut.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/covid-19-areca-growers-in-peril-as-trading-comes-to-a-halt/article31209275.ece

Out of the 34,000 government-owned temples, 175 fall under the category of ‘A’ grade in the State. All of these temples have been implementing the Anna Dasoha (providing free food) programme for many years.

In its order issued on March 28, the department’s commissioner has instructed temple authorities to utilise the funds available with them to ensure that people do not go hungry during the lockdown. With no money in their hands, many daily wage workers are unable to buy food owing to the nationwide curfew.

The department issued the order following instructions from Minister for Muzrai and Fisheries Kota Srinivas Poojary, who has also told the district authorities to facilitate food for the poor and those in need. The order stated that the decision was taken following a request from Deputy Commissioners.

158,2020/03/30,Kodagu district administration launches e-com portal for door delivery of essentials,"This is to ensure that people do not come step out of homes during lockdown

While the State has been grappling with people flocking shops to buy essentials at the time of lockdown due to COVID-19, the Kodagu district administration has launched an e-commerce portal to deliver items like groceries, vegetables and milk to doorsteps, with the involvement of private shops.

‘Kodagu Groceries’has been launched so that people can stay safe at their home. The public can visit the portal https://kodagu.letstart.in to purchase. It is part of the initiative by the district administration under the #KodaguFightsCorona campaign to make the lockdown successful.

“The step had become necessary to face the challenges posed by the pandemic. The idea was to make the lockdown successful without causing any hurdles in making daily needs available. The portal acts as a bridge between users and local vendors,” according to the Kodagu district administration.

Users have to register first on the portal before placing orders. There is no scope for bulk purchase and home delivery will be done for purchases above ₹100. Online orders can be placed from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. on all days.

The initiative comes handy since the public are allowed to step out for essential items only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m.

Online orders for groceries, vegetables, fruits, medicine, and dairy products can be placed. The vendor can be searched by category. On entering the category of goods and the location, the list of shops and contact numbers will be displayed for consumers to make the option.

As many as 193 provision vendors, 25 vegetable vendors, three medicine vendors, and 27 provision and vegetable vendors who are capable of home delivering the goods have been listed. Doorstep delivery is presently available in about 25 towns and villages, including Madikeri, Kushalnagar, Virajpet, Somawarpet, Murnad, Bhagamandala, Aiyaneri, and Napokulu.

Azeez, who runs a provision store in Murnad, said his store has been listed on the portal.

Babu, who operates a grocery store, said the panchayat had identified his store for the initiative. “But there is not much stock in my shop as I’m awaiting supplies from wholesale vendors. Whatever stock was available has been bought by the people after the lockdown,” he said.

‘Feed the Hungry’ in Kodagu

In a move to ensure that migrant workers and daily wagers do not go hungry during lockdown, the ‘Feed the Hungry’ initiative has been launched in Kodagu, allowing people to donate essentials food items.

Five places have been identified where large donation boxes have had been placed based on the nature of food items (only groceries) and interested donors can drop the items here. The drop boxes for essentials such as rice and toor dal, have been placed at private bus stands in Somavarapet and Kushalnagar; old bus stand in Madikeri; near clock tower in Virajpet, and the bus stand in Gonikoppa.

This is a joint effort of Kodagu district administration and the district police.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kodagu-district-administration-launches-e-com-portal-for-door-delivery-of-essentials/article31208604.ece

Two employees associated with the Department of Public Instruction — a teacher serving with a government primary school and a cluster resource person — have been suspended from service for sharing messages on social media critical of the recent request from Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa for donations from the public for COVID-19 relief works.

Dakya Naik, a teacher serving with the government higher primary school in Thimmapura village of Sorab taluk, had shared an audio clipping on WhatsApp in which the Chief Minister was criticised for requesting the public to chip in funds. The audio also had suggestions for the Chief Minister on mobilising resources from various sources to handle such exigences.

Hassan Police have come under severe criticism over the recent incident of assaulting a person, who was on the way to a clinic along with his son suffering from fever, on charges of violating the lockdown regulations and attacking the police on duty.

Shabbir Ahmed, 39, an autorickshaw driver residing near Shafi Masjid in Hassan, was on the way to Kiran Clinic on his two-wheeler around 10 a.m. on March 27 with his nine-year-old son who was suffering from fever. Two police constables Ganesh and Jagadish, attached to Pension Mohalla Station, stopped him and beat him with lathis for coming out of his house. They allegedly did not allow him to explain to them where he was going and why.

According to eye-witnesses, Shabbir got angry with a sudden beating in the presence of his child. The police have booked a case against him on charges of attacking the police on duty.

The video clips of the incidents that have gone viral in social media show the policemen hitting him with lathis on his head, back and legs. They did not leave him even after he ran into a house nearby to escape. The clips have been widely shared on various social media platforms. The police have been criticised for their actions.

Shabbir’s wife Reshma has filed a complaint with the police accusing the two police constables of assaulting her husband. However, the complaint has not been registered so far. She, in her complaint, alleged that the police beat him up severely on the road and dragged him into the police station, where they continued to beat him up. When she went to meet him in the station, she was not allowed inside, but she could hear her husband being beaten up.

The police got a medical examination done and produced him before a judicial magistrate, who ordered for his release. The family members took him to a private hospital in the town. The doctors, who treated him, have suggested the family take him to NIMHANS for further examination.

Imran, an advocate, told The Hindu that the police initially refused to register Reshma’s complaint. However, after he spoke to senior officers, he has got an assurance that the complaint would be registered. They are still waiting for the process to take place.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/coronavirus-lockdown-hassan-police-draw-flak/article31204236.ece

As many as 30 persons suffering from leprosy, physically challenged, and destitutes suffering from age-related ailments have been staying at the Leprosy Colony at Boodigundi of Srirangapatna taluk. They beg for their livelihood.

They had been struggling to get food since one week owing to the countrywide lockdown imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The situation was similar for 30 families at Harakanahalli. They had been engaged in stone blasting and activities at various stone extraction units. Nevertheless, citing the reason of ban on stone extraction activities, the managements concerned have stopped financially helping them. Hence, the families were looking for help from the district administration, said sources close to those families.

177,2020/03/30,Truck carrying veggies attacked,"Renal patient turned back at Mangaluru border last week dies

A tense situation is prevailing on the Kerala-Karnataka border ever since inter-State roads were blocked by Karnataka in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

On Sunday, a group of people in Karnataka allegedly prevented workers from unloading a consignment of vegetables at Kannadithodu, near the Kerala-Karnataka border. The Karnataka government had dumped earth on the road here preventing vehicles from entering the State.

A trader in Kasaragod had ordered the consignment from Mysuru. Workers were transferring vegetables from the truck to another one on the Kerala side at Kannadithodu. At 8.30 p.m., a group of people came on bikes and threatened the workers and forced the driver to turn back with the consignment.

“Ever since the blockade on the State border by Karnataka, traders are finding it hard to bring materials into Kasaragod,” said Sathish, the trader, who ordered the consignment.

“We could not bring the consignment as the gang threatened and forced the truck driver to return with vegetables,” he said.

Mr. Satish said the gang followed the truck and blocked it at Korichal in Sullia taluk in Karnataka. They not only looted the consignment but also destroyed it. The gang also assaulted the truck driver and the workers. However, the driver and the worker refused to file a case, he added.

The blockade imposed by Karnataka is turning out to be a nightmare for traders and people in Kasaragod district, who are dependent on Mangaluru for their essential needs.

One more patient dies

The blockade took the life of another person in Kasaragod on Monday. Madhav, 45, a renal patient, hailed from Kunjathur in Manjeswaram.

Last Thursday, his relatives tried to take him to a hospital in Mangaluru after he fell sick. But the Karnataka police denied them entry at the State border and turned them back, Lakshmanan, a family member of the deceased, said.

His condition deteriorated on Monday and he died while being taken to another hospital in the district.

Air India and Kerala Tourism will facilitate the return of 250 foreign tourists stranded in the State following the lockdown to Germany and other countries in the European Union on Tuesday.

The national carrier will operate a Boeing 777 as chartered flight from the Thiruvananthapuram international airport at 9.30 a.m. to evacuate 223 Germans and 27 citizens of Austria, Hungary, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, Portugal and Greece to Frankfurt.

This is among the five flights to be operated by Air India to Frankfurt on March 31 to evacuate German nationals stranded in the country. The AI aircraft will arrive from Mumbai at 8 a.m. and leave for Mumbai at 9.30 a.m. as chartered flight en route to Frankfurt, airline sources said. The General Administration Department on Monday issued the formal orders to enable the return of the tourists as a 21-day lockdown period was in place in the country. Initially, the plan was to evacuate only the German citizens. Later, the citizens of the European Union countries were added as the ban on international flights is in force till April 14.

The tourists, who were staying in ayurvedic centres, yoga centres and resorts in 11 districts of the State were shifted to the State capital on Monday under the supervision of tourism officials. The tourists were screened and issued the COVID-19 negative certificate.

A high-level team led by Chief Secretary Tom Jose and comprising Secretary, Tourism, Rani George, Airport Director C.V. Ravindran, Foreigners Regional Registration Officer (FRRO) Aravind Menon and Honorary Consul, Federal Republic of Germany, Syed Ibrahim, is overseeing the arrangements.

The tourists were accommodated at Kerala Tourism Development Corporation’s Mascot Hotel, Samudra at Kovalam and Chaithram at Thampanoor. The rooms and lobby were sanitised and separate teams were posted in the reception and for handling the luggage to prevent crowding.

“We have asked the tourists to remain in their rooms and to make use of the room service.

A Full Bench of the Kerala High Court on Monday granted interim bail to all undertrial/remanded prisoners who have been accused of committing offences which are punishable up to 7 years or less with or without fine in view of the countrywide lockdown.

The Bench of Justices C.K. Abdul Rehim, C.T. Ravikumar and Raja Vijayaraghavan passed the directive while modifying its earlier order issued in a suo motu writ petition. The court, however, made it clear that the order would not apply to prisoners with criminal antecedents, previous convictions, in the case of habitual offenders and also with respect to persons undergoing trial or remanded custody in more than one case.

The court also ordered that the interim bail granted shall be limited till April 30, 2020 or till the end of the lockdown period, whichever is earlier. In case the lockdown period is extended beyond April 30, the interim bails granted will continue till such extended period.

The Bench made it clear that on expiry of the period of interim bail, the released prisoners shall appear before the jurisdictional court within three days. On such appearance, the court concerned shall consider their applications for bail and pass appropriate orders, taking note of all circumstances and attendant factors.

Declaration

The court directed the superintendents of the jails concerned to release the prisoners on their furnishing a declaration showing their intended place of residence, their telephone number and the telephone number of any of their family members or relatives, and on executing a self-bond, without sureties, ensuring that they will appear either before the court concerned or before the superintendent as and when required.

The declaration executed by the prisoners should also contain an undertaking to the effect that they will strictly abide by the guidelines issued with respect to social distancing in the wake of the lockdown. They shall also undertake that they will remain in their declared place of residence, totally avoiding any type of travel or exposure to public.

The prisoners released on interim bails shall report to the local police station within their place of residence immediately on reaching its jurisdiction. The jail authorities shall also give due intimation to such police stations with respect to release of the prisoners, the order said.

The court also made it clear that the accused released on interim bails shall be arrested and produced before the jurisdictional court in case of violation of any of the conditions stipulated or in case they are found indulging in any activity endangering law and order or breach of public order and tranquillity, or in any manner intimidating or influencing the witnesses.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/6jgmkj/article31212438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30KRAHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bail-for-undertrials-remand-prisoners/article31212178.ece

With a video footage of Kerala officials spraying something on people travelling across the State border with Karnataka suddenly springing up on social media drawing comparisons with migrant workers being bathed in disinfectants in Uttar Pradesh, a top Kerala Fire and Rescue Services official on Monday clarified that it was a stray incident in which some local officials sprayed ‘soap solution’ on interstate travellers.

“It was just one incident [at Muthanga in Wayanad],” A. Hemachandran, Director General of Police, Fire and Rescue Services, told The Hindu.

“Over a week ago when fears of COVID-19 were building up, some forest and police personnel on the Kerala-Karnataka border sought the help of local Fire and Rescue Services personnel to disinfect the area. Since soap was believed to be a good defence against the virus, it was sprayed on some people. But then we immediately instructed all units to ask people to use soap or sanitiser themselves and practise good hygiene,” he said.

Disinfection drives

While the department conducted disinfection drives at several public places in the State over the past week, the solution used was bleaching powder-based.

Officials said that the department received its first consignment of 10 tonnes of sodium hypochlorite only on Saturday.

As part of the investigation into the blockade by a section of migrant workers at Payippad Junction on Sunday, a team led by Suresh Kumar, deputy superintendent of police, Changanassery, inspected the labour camps in the village and seized about 20 mobile phones. According to G. Jaidev, District Police Chief, a detailed probe is on to unearth the reasons for the episode.

A special team has been constituted to probe the case. Mr. Jaidev will monitor the progress of the probe. “While there were only a few people around by 11 a.m, it took just half an hour for the remaining people to converge at the spot and stage the protest,” the officer said.

Later in the day, a stakeholder meeting convened by Food and Civil Supplies Minister P. Thilothaman here finalised an action plan to protect the migrant workers camping in the district.

The meeting, also attended by the District Collector, DPC and president of the Payippad grama panchayat Sobha Salimon, also decided to put in place a government mechanism for distribution of food for these workers, besides deploying a team for their medical examination. A three-member panel of officials was appointed to ensure the welfare of workers in the region.

No rent

182,2020/03/30,CM: Keep only 33% of health staff on front line,"Health workers testing positive for COVID-19 raises concerns

After a health-care worker in the district tested positive for COVID-19, as many as 32 persons who worked with him have been placed in quarantine. Swabs have been collected from these Health Department employees. Following apprehensions raised by health-care workers, swabs of nine other asymptomatic employees have also been taken for testing.

The issue has raised concerns as some point out that this might bring down the strength of the front-line workforce of the Health Department, but opinion is divided. The district authorities are tight-lipped about the situation.

‘Adequate precautions’

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the government was taking adequate precautions to ensure that the health-care personnel were not deployed all at once on the front-line. Work arrangements were being made so that only one-third of them were on the front line at a time so that the entire force was not work-weary.

Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association president Joseph Chacko told The Hindu that they had recommended a three-layered working system for the health-care workers from the primary health centre (PHC) level so that the health-care system did not collapse.

One group of doctors, nurses and paramedics needed to be kept in reserve so that care for those who tested positive for COVID-19 was not affected, Dr. Chacko said.

At Mananthavady

Earlier, a doctor at Mananthavady and seven others had to be quarantined as they were among the contacts of a COVID-19 positive patient.

A health-care worker said all those who had completed one schedule of work should be placed in quarantine. Those working in the airport schedule were working for nearly 20 hours at a stretch. Such long hours weakened the efficiency of a person.

However, another health-care worker, who was part of the airport surveillance, said all the workers had been trained to keep their contacts to the minimum and to take utmost precaution. “After the day’s work, going home was also a risk to the family. But I used to take a bath outside the house before entering. Besides, there was hardly any time to indulge in any small talk with others.”

Health workers in PHCs and community health centres were also fully engaged with work, be it calling up quarantined persons or visiting them for any need. ASHA workers, Kudumbashree and Anganwadi workers, who are venturing out for health activities, face risk too.

Meanwhile, the Chief Minister said the government had received reports that some private hospitals forced nursing and paramedic staff to go on leave without wages for four days every week.

The Health Department was looking into the issue. Mr Vijayan said employers could not lay off employees or cut their salaries during the pandemic.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vghbmf/article31212648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31TVKIPTI21-03-2020000092B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cm-keep-only-33-of-health-staff-on-front-line/article31212101.ece
183,2020/03/30,Free ration distribution from tomorrow,"Steps for door delivery of foodgrain to the elderly, bed-ridden with the help of volunteers

Distribution of free ration will commence in the State on April 1 through 14,250 retail outlets and will be completed by April 20, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies P. Thilothaman has said.

Mr. Thilothaman told reporters here on Monday that foodgrain for Antyodaya Anna Yojana and priority household cardholders would be distributed till noon and others in the afternoon. Only five persons would be allowed at a time in a retail ration outlet and ward members and volunteers would help avoid crowding. Dealers could introduce token systems to avoid crowding, he said. The help of volunteers and ward members could be sought for door delivery of foodgrain for the elderly and bed-ridden. Distribution of additional entitlements would begin after April 20, he said.

Those without cards

Families that did not have cards could get foodgrain if an elder member of the family submitted an affidavit to the dealer concerned. The affidavit should comprise the Aadhaar number and phone number of the family members. The facility had been limited strictly to those who did not have cards. A fine amounting to three times the market price of the foodgrain would be levied from those submitting false affidavits.

The Food and Civil Supplies Department and the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation were preparing free kits to be distributed. Income tax payers, the high income group and those who had voluntarily come forward to relinquish it had been exempted from the scheme.

Sufficient stock

The State had sufficient stock to distribute foodgrain to all sections for three months, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ie9gjl/article31212061.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Rice1---Copy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/free-ration-distribution-from-tomorrow/article31212062.ece

The State reported 32 more confirmed COVID-19 cases on Monday, taking the total number of cases reported so far in the State to 234.

Kasaragod accounted for 17 of these cases, Kannur 11 while Idukki and Wayanad reported two cases each.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that of the 32 cases, 17 persons had returned from abroad while 15 cases were that of people who had come into contact with some of the imported cases.

At present, 213 COVID-19 patients are under treatment in hospitals. Twenty persons have been discharged after treatment and one death was recorded.

A total of 1.57 lakh people have been put under surveillance in the State now, of whom, 623 are in isolation wards in hospitals.

RGCB facility

Mr. Vijayan said that the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) had the capacity to do 3,000 PCR-based diagnostic tests for COVID-19 per day and that the State would make full use of the facility

The government, he said, has ordered the Police Department to provide sufficient off-duty time for law-enforcers working under harsh heat conditions to impose the lockdown.

Mr Vijayan said given the relatively high turnout of crowds in the State on Monday, the public should expect the police to be marginally stricter on Tuesday.

He said hotels could deliver food home but could not serve it on their premises. The Excise Department was working on a proposal to restore the sale of legal alcohol. Mr. Vijayan said that shortage of ventilators and the hardships faced by patients at Kasaragod had come up in his discussions with representatives of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

The CII has offered to help with the current situation by setting up some ventilators and dialysis machines at Kasaragod, which is a very welcome step, Mr. Vijayan said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/s3ezun/article31212566.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31TVTVCITYNIGHTOUTCOVID19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/32-more-test-positive-17-of-them-from-kasaragod-11-from-kannur/article31212006.ece
185,2020/03/30,Norm to get alcohol,"Alcohol will now be made available to those experiencing alcohol withdrawal symptoms, as per the new government order on Monday.

The ‘patient’ has to take an OP ticket at a health centre or a hospital in the government sector and get examined for withdrawal symptoms. When the doctor’s prescription is shown at an Excise Department office, a pass for a specified quantity of alcohol will be given. With the pass, the suggested quantity of alcohol can be obtained from Bevco outlets. The Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association (KGMOA) has condemned the order that makes the “medical practitioner prescribe alcohol as a medicine for withdrawal symptom.”

State president of KGMOA Joseph Chacko said the government infrastructure was capable of providing treatment for withdrawal symptoms with medicines and counselling. Besides, withdrawal symptoms are decided by a psychiatrist after detailed examination. Not all doctors can diagnose such symptoms in an alcoholic, said Dr. Chacko.

The order is akin to prescribing alcohol without saying so, he said. “The queue in front of the Bevco outlet will be in the hospitals now and it could lead to a difficult situation when the health segment is battling to contain the COVID-19,” said Dr. Chacko.

Dr. Chacko said the order had a high probability of being misused. It would add to the stress of the medical officers. He said there could be violence in hospitals if a medical officer refused to accept a patient’s withdrawal symptoms.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/norm-to-get-alcohol/article31211907.ece
186,2020/03/30,"Cured of COVID-19, five return home to Ranni","Doctors advise them to remain in home quarantine for the next 14 days

Five persons cured of COVID-19 were discharged from the isolation ward of the Pathanamthitta General Hospital on Monday afternoon.

According to Ashish Mohankumar, Resident Medical Officer, the condition of all five, three of whom had come to their home village of Aythala in Ranni from the pandemic-hit Italy on February 29, and their two relatives in the neighbourhood, is good. The medical board declared them fit for being discharged from the hospital on Monday, bringing an end to their quarantine on the 25th day.

Dr. Mohankumar told The Hindu that all the five had been advised to remain in home quarantine for the next 14 days as the medical fraternity was not definite on the chances of a reinfection or side effects of the virus.

Asymptomatic carrier

The trio who returned from Italy were all praise for the medical team and the care they received at the government hospital. Dr. Mohankumar said the 26-year-old son of the couple from Italy was an asymptomatic carrier and no serious health issue had manifested in him all these days.

However, his father and uncle had Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and their recovery owed much to the perseverance, expertise and dedication of the medical team, he said.

Aythala became the epicentre of the second spell of COVID-19 pandemic in the State with the five persons testing positive for the viral infection on March 7. A day before, the Health Department and the district administration had quarantined them at the isolation ward of the General Hospital. Within 24 hours of them testing positive, the authorities identified and home quarantined their 350 primary contacts and 850 secondary contacts. “That a government hospital in a mofussil region like Pathanamthitta could achieve this, is undoubtedly great,” commented Thomas P. Thomas, environmentalist and academic.

Crowded send-off

However, Mr. Thomas said the hospital authorities should have avoided the crowded send-off given to the discharged patients, attended by nearly 100 persons, in violation of the social distancing guideline, as it would only create a wrong precedent.

No new cases

Meanwhile, in a medical bulletin released here on Monday, District Collector P.B. Noohu said no new COVID-19 cases were reported in Pathanamthitta district for the fifth consecutive day on Monday.

Twelve persons have been admitted in the isolation wards at various hospitals in the district. Of this, five have been quarantined at the Pathanamthitta General Hospital, four at the District Hospital in Kozhencherry, and three others at the Pushpagiri Medical College Hospital in Thiruvalla.

Ninety-two persons quarantined at various hospitals in the district have been discharged.

187,2020/03/30,MP moves SC against Karnataka,"Closure of border road with Kerala

Kasaragod MP Rajmohan Unnithan on Monday filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court against Karnataka closing its borders with Kerala in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. The petition demanded that the border be opened.

He said that since Karnataka had blocked roads, the movement of ambulances and other emergency vehicles for patients’ treatment and for the transport of commodities to Kerala had been hindered. He said the people of Kasaragod depended entirely on the medical facilities in Mangaluru.

The petition stated that the blockade was against the Constitution and violated constitutional guarantees such as the right to travel, the right to food, and the right to health care.

NHAI property

The MP argued that national highways were the property of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the State government had no authority to block them. The NHAI had not given Karnataka permission to block the roads.

The blockade was against the directive of the Union government to all State governments that the transportation of all goods, without the distinction of essential and non-essential ones, be allowed during the lockdown period. Karnataka’s refusal to open the roads was against the guidelines of the Union government and against the interest of the public at large.

Villages isolated

He said that with Karnataka blocking the border by unloading soil and erecting barricades, the villages of Kasaragod were isolated. Two persons died after their ambulance was blocked on their way to Mangaluru. There was also an incident of a woman giving birth in an ambulance, he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mp-moves-sc-against-karnataka/article31211717.ece
188,2020/03/30,Another Salary Challenge in the offing,"Chennithala supports move to collect a month’s salary of govt. staff

The government is contemplating another Salary Challenge to mobilise funds for COVID-19 containment measures by collecting one month’s salary of government employees and teachers in view of a financial crisis facing the exchequer.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan held separate parleys with a few service organisations on Monday to know their opinion on Salary Challenge 2. The maiden effort to mobilise resources for flood relief work in the State had invited criticism.

While some service organisations expressed reservation and demanded audit of the funds that reached the exchequer, the government received a shot in the arm with Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala coming out openly in support of the proposal.

“There is nothing wrong in government employees cooperating with the Salary Challenge,” he said. It should be looked into whether one month’s salary should be collected as sections like last grade employees will face difficulty, with their salaries being low. The government should take a call after holding talks with all service organisations, Mr. Chennithala said.

Only 57.33% of the government employees had participated in the salary challenge for flood relief by donating a month’s salary to the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund. The drive yielded ₹488 crore, whereas the government had expected to garner ₹2,211 crore if all the government employees and teachers had participated in the challenge.

Bolstering steps to ensure the well-being of migrant labourers, the district authorities have cautioned contractors who have engaged workers against evicting them from their camps during the lockdown.

Convening a meeting to review the facilities that were in place for the migrant population in the district, Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran also ordered steps to ensure the availability of chappathi and north Indian dishes from community kitchens. He also directed officials to supply essential commodities from the facilities for those workers who preferred to cook on their own.

The administration has relocated several workers to various places to avoid crowding in their existing accommodation facilities.

The police registered lesser number of violations compared to the previous days on the sixth day of lockdown in the district. The Thiruvananthapuram City police registered 30 cases and arrested 30 people, while the Thiruvananthapuram Rural police registered 86 cases and arrested 90 people for unnecessary travel and violating other guidelines.

The police have also decided to issue special passes to owners, managers and accountants of companies to enable them to process the salaries of their employees.

190,2020/03/30,"1,000 prisoners to walk free for a month","Not applicable to those incarcerated for multiple offences

The COVID-19 scare has come as a blessing for around 1,000 remand and undertrial prisoners of Kerala, who would be released from jails shortly.

The State would soon set them free for one month as the Kerala High Court passed an order for their release on Monday to de-congest the jails in the wake of viral disease outbreak.

There are around 4,600 such prisoners in the State.

The prisoners who are thus set free will have to report back to the jail after the expiry of the 30-day-period.

The Jail Department, in consultation with the State government, had earlier released 711 convicts, including those who were awarded imprisonment of above seven years and even life term. Those who have been awarded their eligible parole of 60 days shall return on the expiry of the term. Others will have to get back to the prison by April 16.

Earlier, the Supreme Court had asked the State governments and Union Territories to release such prisoners to cut the probability of the virus disease spreading among the jail inmates.

The undertrial prisoners are those who are in jail as the trial in cases involving them are pending in courts. In these cases, the police would have filed the chargesheet in the courts earlier.

Remand prisoners are those who have been arrested by the police for their suspected involvement in crimes and jailed during the course of investigation. The police investigation would be pending completion in such cases.

The benefit of the scheme will not be extended to those have been incarcerated for multiple offences. Habitual offenders will continue in their prison cells as their release could trigger trouble. Prison officials will be screening the individual cases before picking the beneficiaries of the scheme, said S. Santhosh, DIG Prisons (Headquarters).

The Kerala jails are considered to be less crowded when compared to other parts of the country as they together houses an excess crowd of six per cent above its capacity, he said.

The Central Jails of Poojappura and Viyyoor are housing inmates beyond their capacity. While the Poojappura jail would have around 1,400 inmates, nearly the double number of its capacity, the one at Viyyoor would have around 900 on a given day against its capacity of 500 persons. The jails in the Thiruvananthapuram are relatively crowded as the prisoners from Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts are accommodated there. While the Alapuzha prison was being repaired, the one at Pathanamthitta was closed down, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1000-prisoners-to-walk-free-for-a-month/article31211317.ece

No fresh case of COVID-19 was reported in the district on Monday. Officials said one person was hospitalised with symptoms of the disease. As of Monday, the number of people under observation in hospitals stood at 15.

They included 12 people at Government Medical College Hospital, Alappuzha, and three at Taluk Hospital, Haripad. Besides, 6,612 people were in home quarantine in the district.

The district has witnessed two COVID-19 cases. The first case, a Wuhan returnee, was discharged in February. The condition of the person who tested positive for the disease last week is stable.

The police have registered 40 cases and arrested 45 people for violating the restrictions imposed to check the spread of COVID-19 in the district. Authorities have seized 24 vehicles. Officials said that steps had been taken to cancel the registration of the seized vehicles and suspend the licence of the drivers for six months.

He said here that the Plan fund utilisation was a dismal 53.46%. He asked the government to defer new tax proposals scheduled to kick in on April 1. The government should channelise Plan funds to local self-governments to pay salaries and clear debts of public work contractors. The State owed contractors ₹2,081.19 crore.

He alerted the government that personal protection equipment for COVID-19 caregivers was fast running out and stocks required to be replenished.

193,2020/03/30,High Court to monitor execution of lockdown,"Court’s focus on reported excesses

A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Monday initiated suo motu proceedings to monitor the implementation of the lockdown in the State.

The Bench of Justice A. K. Jayasankaran Nambiar and Justice Shaji P. Chaly observed that “amid the din of the pandemic that engulfs us all, our laws cannot remain silent. They must continue to operate so as to protect the rights of our citizen.”

Fundamental right

The Bench made it clear that the fundamental right to life and personal liberty, under Article 21 of the Constitution, cannot be suspended even during an emergency. The objective of the lockdown is apparently to enforce social distancing among the people so that the chain of transmission of the virus is broken.

Towards the objective, the State executive has, apart from health workers, deployed police personnel throughout the State to monitor the movement of persons and to ensure that people do not venture out of their respective homes except for procuring essential provisions and articles required for their sustenance, the court observed.

Exemplary work

The Bench said an exemplary work is being done by the health authorities as well as the police personnel.

However, the court cannot turn a blind eye to some of the other material published in media that would point to excesses committed by the police.

Allaying fear

The court has to allay the fear among the citizenry as regards infringement of their fundamental rights.

The court observed that the implementation of the lockdown in the State, by the Centre or State authorities, must be under the watchful eyes of the judiciary and towards this end, the Bench deemed it appropriate to institute these suo motu proceedings to monitor State action during the lockdown period.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9fr01s/article31212621.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31TVKI-POLICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/high-court-to-monitor-execution-of-lockdown/article31211291.ece
194,2020/03/30,State gearing up to meet commitments,"A sum of ₹5,000 crore is needed for just salary and pension

Braving grave financial constraints, the State government is gearing up to clear the salary and service pension bills as well as other committed expenses from April 2.

Finance Department sources told The Hindu that the resources at its command would be channelised for disbursing the salary and service pensions as well as the arrears due to contractors and other sections over the next two months. The outgo for salary and pension has been pegged at about ₹5,000 crore.

In addition, payment of welfare pensions for four months starting from December last and an ex gratia of ₹1,000 to lottery vendors who have been left in the lurch on putting to hold the sale of lottery tickets till April 15 are also among a slew of other payments that are set to be cleared from the treasury in the fortnight ahead.

Battered by the COVID-19 outbreak, some of the prime sources of revenue from the sale of lottery tickets, IMFL and petrol and diesel have virtually dried up. The share from the sale of petrol and diesel have been progressively declining over the past few months and following the lockdown, it has become a trickle.

The loss of revenue on halting the sale of lottery ticket alone has been put at about ₹1,500 crore. An equally plum share from the sale of IMFL has also been blocked on imposing prohibition.

The plan is to complete the procedures for open borrowing in the new financial year before completely exhausting the resources at its command so that the government could tide over the crisis without any hitch.

The alleged silence of the Centre in clearing the Goods and Services Tax compensation arrears amounting to ₹3,000 crore and also the repeated pleas to raise the annual borrowing limit continues to vex the State governments, including Kerala that are facing serious resource crunch.

The only glimmer of hope is a go-ahead on the State’s demands from the Centre in the changed context, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-gearing-up-to-meet-commitments/article31211276.ece
195,2020/03/30,Prohibitory orders in Kottayam district,"Security restrictions tightened as follow-up to migrant workers’ blockade at Payippad

A day after some migrant workers staged a blockade at Payippad, the police and district administration have tightened the security restrictions in Kottayam district to prevent such mass gatherings during the lockdown period.

District Collector P.K. Sudheer Babu on Monday imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the district.

According to the Collector, prohibitory orders were imposed on the basis of reports submitted by sub-divisional magistrates of Pala and Kottayam and the District Police Chief (DPC).

Reports

The DPC’s report said that some people were still venturing into the street and unlawfully gathering in public places. The sub-divisional magistrates reported that people were still gathering for religious, cultural and family functions and venturing out of their houses without reason, thus defeating the goal to achieve social distancing intended, noted the Collector. Meanwhile, the police have booked 2,000 persons for unlawful assembly and violation of the legal restrictions in connection with the public protest staged by the migrant workers at Payippad on Sunday.

The Thrikkodithanam police recorded the arrest of Muhammad Rinju, a West Bengal native, in connection with the case.

196,2020/03/30,Police see no plot at Payippad,"Labour contractors may have orchestrated the unrest

The turnout of migrant workers at Payippad in Kottayam on Sunday is unlikely to be the consequence of a conspiracy by any political parties or religious groups, according to State police officers. A preliminary investigation suggests that some labour contractors might have orchestrated the mischief.

“The workforce managers appeared to have surmised that it could be a losing proposition to afford the wages, stay and food of the labourers during the entire period of the shutdown,” a senior police officer told The Hindu. They could have tried to shrug off their accountability by instigating them to go back home.

Contractors’ role

It is also possible that the contractors had motivated the gullible among the labourers to gather in public to pressurise the district administration into accommodating their demand to go home.

The police investigation is still at a nascent stage. There could be arrests and registration of cases.

However, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said ""one or more devious forces"" had conspired to instigate migrant labourers to gather publicly. Their motive was to besmirch the State's record of ensuring the welfare of migrants and combating the COVID-19 epidemic.

The curfew violation occurred during a crucial period of the State’s stringent pandemic control exercise and it had caught the government by surprise and set alarm bells ringing in the public health establishment. The police say the seemingly impromptu gathering occurred a few days after the taluk authorities summoned the contractors and advised them to ensure the welfare of migrant workers employed by them.

The police say at least eight of the middlemen are under their scanner. Investigators say the mass movement of migrant workers out of New Delhi and the report that the government there had arranged buses for them to travel home had galvanised the workers in Payippad for mass action.

The workers were also upset about the diet served by local authorities as it did not suit their palate.

The district administration in Kottayam has redeemed the grievance by supplying the labourers provisions and fuel to cook food.

The incident at Payippad prompted the police and revenue officials to inspect labour camps across Kerala on Monday. They found many living in crowded shelters with minimal toilet facility.

The police also came across instances of landlords rationing power and water in houses rented by migrant workers. In some areas, local traders and moneylenders have prevented the workers from moving to camps because they fear they would not get back their debts.

Malappuram incident

In Malappuram, two residents used social media to spread alarmist messages among the migrant worker community to make them flee the State. The police have arrested both of them.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran told reporters here that many labourers were unwilling to move out of their rented premises to government camps out of the fear that their landlords would not allow them back.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/whq0hz/article31212587.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30KRAKOTTAYAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/police-see-no-plot-at-payippad/article31211250.ece
197,2020/03/30,Migrants stage protest at Perumbavoor,"Police say fake WhatsApp messages that the workers would be sent home triggered the unrest

A section of the migrant workers at Perumbavoor staged a protest on Monday against the quality and amount of food they were served by the panchayat, resulting in an intervention by the police and the District Collector.

A worker from Murshidabad, staying with migrant workers at a colony near Palakkattuthazham, said a kitchen was set up at the colony on Monday.

Food issue

“We were given breakfast which was not sufficient. At lunch time, we were served rice and curry which did not taste good. In the afternoon, workers stepped outside to protest against this,” he said. For the past few days, the owner of the building provided them with groceries and they had been cooking the food they liked for themselves, he said.

Another worker from the area said those manning the kitchen were struggling to provide food to the 3,000-odd workers in the area. “Even by around 3 p.m. some of us were waiting for food,” he said.

Vazhakulam panchayat officials set up the kitchen at the colony on Monday morning after District Police Chief (DPC) K. Karthick and other officials visited the area on Sunday in the wake of a protest by migrant workers at Payippad. Panchayat president Shereena Basheer said the situation suddenly flared up in the afternoon.

“There was enough food and we were preparing more. Even a machine to make rotis was set up at the kitchen. When food is being prepared for such a large number of people, workers should cooperate,” she said. District Collector S. Suhas visited the area along with the DPC.

The Collector assured the workers that sufficient food of their choice would be provided, since arrangements could not be made for them to go home during the lockdown.

199,2020/03/30,Migrants workers gathering: Kerala police rule out political conspiracy,"Workforce managers could have tried to shrug off their accountability to the workers by instigating them to travel home, says official

The worrying turnout of migrant workers in significant numbers at Payippadu in Kottayam during COVID-19 lockdown on Sunday was unlikely to be the consequence of a conspiracy by any one political party or religious group, according to Kerala police officials.

A preliminary investigation by the police has suggested that some labour contractors might have orchestrated the gathering.

“The workforce managers appeared to have surmised that it could be a losing proposition to afford the wages, stay and food of labourers throughout the entire period of the shutdown”, a senior official told The Hindu. They could have tried to shrug off their accountability to the other-State workers by instigating them to travel home.

200,2020/03/30,Coronavirus: Milk procurement in Kerala likely to be affected,"Large unsold quantities are being converted into milk powder in cooperative and privately-owned plants in Tamil Nadu which is now refusing to accept milk from Kerala

Milk procurement in the State is likely to be hit again with Tamil Nadu reportedly refusing to accept milk from Kerala citing COVID-19 concerns.

A frantic Kerala Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma) has urged the State Government to take up the matter with Tamil Nadu.

Faced with glut due to reduced milk sales following the lockdown, the Malabar Regional Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union (MRCMPU) of Milma has been converting large quantities of unsold milk into milk powder in co-operative and privately-owned plants in Tamil Nadu.

If the issue did not get sorted out at the government-level by Tuesday, Milma may be forced to temporarily halt milk procurement in north Kerala districts, Milma officials said.

Milma’s Malabar regional union covers the six northern districts of Kerala where the milk procurement is relatively higher compared to the rest of the State.

“Against a daily milk procurement of six lakh litres, sales have tumbled to 2.5 lakh litres. We have been converting the unsold milk to milk powder in Tamil Nadu. We understand that the Tamil Nadu Health Department has issued an advisory against accepting milk from Kerala now,’’ K. Vijayakumaran, MRCMPU managing director, said.

MRCMPU has apprised Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Chief Secretary Tom Jose of the situation.

Last week, Milma was forced to declared a one-day ‘holiday’ for milk procurement in north Kerala following a massive dip in lockdown period sales.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fqulqe/article31204981.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MILMAKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-milk-procurement-in-kerala-likely-to-be-affected/article31204982.ece
201,2020/03/30,Kerala to begin distribution of free ration from April 1,"Only five persons will be allowed at a time in a retail ration outlet in keeping with the social distancing norms, says Minister for Food and Civil Supplies P. Thilothaman

Distribution of free ration in Kerala will commence on April 1 through the 14,250 retail outlets and be completed by April 20, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies P. Thilothaman has said.

He told reporters here on Monday that the grain distribution for Antyodaya Anna Yojana and Priority Household card holders would take place till noon and others in the afternoon. Only five persons would be allowed at a time in a retail ration outlet in keeping with the social distancing norms. Ward members of local bodies and volunteers in each locale would help in preventing crowds. Each dealer could introduce a token system to avoid card-holders from gathering in huge numbers, he said.

The help volunteers and ward members could be sought for door delivery of grains for the elderly and bed-ridden who would not be able to reach the retail outlets. Distribution of additional entitlements would begin after April 20, he said.

Families that did not have cards would get grains if an elder member of the family submitted an affidavit to the dealer concerned. The affidavit should comprise the Aadhar number and phone number of the family members. The facility had been limited strictly to those who did not have cards. A fine amounting to three times the market price of the grains would be levied from those submitting false affidavits.

Free kits

The Food and Civil Supplies Department and the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation are also preparing the free kits to be distributed in the State. Income tax payers, the high income group as well as others who have voluntarily come forward to relinquish it have been exempted from the scheme.

The State had sufficient stock to distribute grains for all sections for three months.

The Minister said that he suspected a conspiracy behind the mobilisation of migrant workers at Payippad in Kottayam on Sunday afternoon.

202,2020/03/30,LPG refills can only be booked 15 days after delivery,"Oil companies have put in place a mechanism to prevent panic booking

In an effort to prevent panic bookings of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) refills, oil companies have put in place temporary measures that will be in force till the lifting of COVID-19 lockdown.

Now, if a consumer books and gets a 14.2kg domestic refill, he can make the next booking only after 15 days. The IVRS system that makes the bookings has been programmed to tell consumers that they will have to wait for their turn.

Distributors said that this would help prevent unnecessary cancellations. “Consumers book even if they have a spare cylinder on hand as they are fully dependent on cooking at home. Families at home means more cooking and snacks too, thereby additional LPG usage,” explained a distributor. Cancellation is also being allowed on the respective oil company's app after only one try.

Earlier, if the customer was not available or door was locked, the delivery person had to make three tries and the cancellation of the booking could be done only at the distributorship.

Oil industry sources explained that in place of say 85,000 bookings a day in Chennai region, they were getting 1.15 lakh bookings. This has also led to increase in backlog in supplies of about 3-5 days.

“We are unable to serve genuine customers,” said another distributor.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/5zqvgo/article31214141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27octcbvspLPG-GCQ4TIDDS3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/lpg-refills-can-only-be-booked-15-days-after-delivery/article31212272.ece
203,2020/03/30,Hundreds of foreign returnees being brought on the radar,"People with addresses in other States had been left out till now

A few hundreds of passengers who had returned from abroad via Chennai, Tiruchi, Madurai and Coimbatore airports between March 17 and 23, and whose permanent address is outside Tamil Nadu, are being brought under the ambit of COVID-19 preventive measures being implemented by the Health Department, official sources said on Monday.

Health and police officials suspect that many of these passengers could still be in Tamil Nadu, considering that the State has a large number of IT employees who are non-natives. Moreover, there was a ‘Janata Curfew’ on March 22 and a lockdown from March 24, resulting in just a one-day window to travel out of the State.

Police have managed to get the contact details of some passengers through online travel aggregators and ticket booking agents.

Investigators are also trying to contact cab aggregators to check the bookings from international airports to various destinations this month. Data analysts in the police control room of the COVID-19 quarantine management and tracing team have been analysing the incoming and outgoing list of passengers to check how many have left Tamil Nadu.

Initially, the focus was on passengers whose addresses as mentioned in their passports were in Tamil Nadu, and who had come from COVID19-affected countries. Then, it shifted to all passengers belonging to Tamil Nadu who had arrived from abroad. The third category — of passengers with addresses in other States or international passports, remains a grey area because of the delay in data exchange between different stakeholders in the air transport sector.

The State intelligence is trying to get all passengers who had arrived from abroad on various airlines and landed in the four airports in the State to fill up forms to obtain details of local address with contact numbers. Going by immigration data, about 20,000 passengers with other State addresses or international passports had landed in Madurai, Tiruchi and Coimbatore airports between March 1 and the start of the lockdown. When the figure of total arrivals in Chennai is analysed, it is expected to touch 50,000 since the number of incoming international flights is greater here. Big data, including mobile calls/tower location details, have to be accessed to ascertain the travel history and location of these passengers, and the process is being undertaken by the State police.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hundreds-of-foreign-returnees-being-brought-on-the-radar/article31212215.ece

Twenty-five of the 67 persons who have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Tamil Nadu are either directly or indirectly linked to two Thai nationals who had tested positive on March 21.

This clustering of cases has come as a surprise to the State’s Health Department, which had brought all those who had arrived from China, the U.S., the Middle East and Europe under surveillance.

The two Thai nationals, identified as patients 5 and 6, are undergoing treatment at IRT, Perundurai. They were part of a large group of people from countries including Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, France and Congo, who had visited the State for an annual pilgrimage, officials said.

A 54-year-old man, who had tested positive and died at the Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, had received the Thai nationals. Patient no. 26 — a 63-year-old man — was their co-traveller, while two others, including a 42-year-old man and a 46-year-old, were among their contacts.

Three family members of the deceased have also tested positive for COVID-19. A 29-year-old doctor, who tested positive on Sunday, was declared a contact of the 26th patient. Her 10-month-old baby, mother and maid also reportedly tested positive.

On the same day, four persons from Erode with a travel history to Delhi tested positive. On Monday, 10 men, all from Erode and with a travel history to Delhi, tested positive. They had come into contact with the two Thai nationals.

“This was an unexpected turn of the trajectory. We had successfully brought persons who had travelled from China, the Middle East, the U.S. and Europe under surveillance. There was no spill-over. Nevertheless, these persons were on their annual pilgrimage and we have traced the places they had visited, and where persons have tested positive,” an official said.

“Of the 165 persons who had arrived here, 76 have returned to their country. Apart from them, the department has been tracing around 1,500 persons who had travelled from various parts of Tamil Nadu to Nizamuddin, Delhi, to attend a conference. They have tracked and quarantined 819 persons, who had returned to the State. Those with symptoms were moved to isolation facilities and asymptomatic persons are in quarantine centres, while their family members are under home quarantine,” the official added.

“Those who had come here from abroad had visited areas in districts such as Vellore, Ranipet, Tirupattur, Salem, Erode, Madurai, Dindigul, Tenkasi, Ramanathapuram, Nagapattinam, Sivaganga and Kancheepuram. We have taken up massive containment measures in a five-km radius in the identified areas, and it is a challenge to [exercise] control before the lockdown comes to an end,” he said.

Active cooperation

All those who had been identified and quarantined were cooperating with the department. “In fact, they are actively cooperating in tracing their contacts,” he said.

According to sources, this clustering of cases from the confirmed cases of COVID-19 linked to the two Thai nationals was totally unexpected. “What we are seeing is clustering among contacts, and not community transmission. In many other cases, it is the family contacts of COVID-19 patients who have tested positive. The chances are high that such transmission could happen among family members,” a source said.

While officials are tracking those who had attended the conference in Delhi, the District Collectors have also been alerted to trace them. Some of them have been traced to Erode, Coimbatore and Tiruppur.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/m0qn9r/article31128869.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS-TN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/25-of-67-patients-directly-or-indirectly-linked-to-thai-nationals/article31212197.ece
206,2020/03/30,Distribution of aid tokens to ration cardholders capped at 100 a day,"It may take 10 to 15 days to cover all the ration cards in the State

Having commenced the distribution of tokens to ration cardholders ahead of Thursday’s launch of the provision of cash support and essential commodities free-of-cost in view of the COVID-19 crisis, the Civil Supplies Department is planning to cover a maximum of 100 persons a day.

Given the average figure of 1,000-1,500 cards per shop, it may take 10 to 15 days to cover all the cards. The plan is that the tokens will be delivered at the cardholders’ doorstep. The issuance of tokens had begun, a senior official of the department said.

Last week, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced that all rice-drawing cardholders would get cash support of ₹1,000 and free rice, pulses, edible oil and sugar in April, in a measure aimed at mitigating the hardship being endured by people due to the COVID-19 threat. There are 2.01 crore ration cards in the State.

While the staff at every shop will be wearing masks and gloves, sanitisers will also be kept ready for use. Norms of social distancing will be adhered to, the official said.

Those who wish to give up either the cash support of ₹1,000 or the free rice or any other commodity can do so either through the website (https://www.tnpds.gov.in/ ) or the mobile app of the department.

Meanwhile, the idea of reaching out to the needy is gaining currency, as opposed to making people visit government offices for assistance. Former Director General of Police V. Vaikunth, who also held the post of Director (Civil Defence), recalled that during the 1978-79 floods in the State, three mobile integrated aid units — one with medicines, the second with provisions and the third with vegetables — were sent to every affected area, be it a panchayat union or a municipality. They were supported by the Police Department’s communication system. A similar arrangement could be made now, he suggested. Mr. Vaikunth, who bagged the President’s Medal for distinguished service in Civil Defence and Home Guards, volunteered to donate funds from his trust for the purpose, besides providing training to interested officials.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ba7qo8/article31212183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31RATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/distribution-of-aid-tokens-to-ration-cardholders-capped-at-100-a-day/article31212184.ece
207,2020/03/30,"Next two weeks are critical, say government officials","More number of tests will be done as protocol has been revised

Senior government officials have said the next two weeks will be critical, as more number of tests will be carried out since the protocol to deal with COVID-19 has been revised.

“The protocol has been revised to include testing of patients with severe acute respiratory illnesses for COVID-19. So, persons with pneumonia or other symptoms, who have gone unnoticed so far, will be tested. The current measures should continue to be implemented without laxity,” a senior bureaucrat said.

Home quarantine

A total of 74,533 persons, including passengers from other countries, are under home quarantine for 28 days in the State. While Chennai accounts for the highest number of persons under home quarantine, at 16,767.

Erode tops cases

Erode has the highest number of COVID-19 patients — 24 out of a total of 67.

The total number of samples lifted for testing stands at 2,040. Of these, 120 are being processed. As many as 1,920 samples have returned negative and 67 positive for COVID-19, according to a bulletin issued by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine.

An official said a majority of those under home quarantine had completed the 28-day quarantine period.

“It is now important that those who are presently under home quarantine compulsorily follow the instructions for the next two weeks. People should cooperate with us,” he said.

Sixth patient discharged

Meanwhile, a sixth person who had tested positive for COVID-19 was discharged from hospital.

A 25-year-old woman, who was admitted to the isolation ward of the Government Kilpauk Medical College Hospital, was discharged from hospital.

According to officials, the woman was discharged after two consecutive samples — nasal and throat swabs — returned negative.

Already, three patients who were admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and two patients, aged 70 and 64, who were admitted to the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, have been discharged after treatment.

As of date, a total of 364 persons are in isolation wards in various hospitals across the State. As many as 79 asymptomatic passengers from highly affected countries are being quarantined in designated centres.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5p6a5e/article30682597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29JANTH--HOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/next-two-weeks-are-critical-say-government-officials/article31212161.ece
208,2020/03/30,Govt. steps in to send flowers to scent factories,"Passes issued to units in Dindigul, Kovilpatti, Tiruvannamalai and Coimbatore

As farmers cultivating flowers are unable to sell their produce due to the lockdown, the State government has arranged for the supply of flowers to scent and perfume manufacturing factories in various parts of Tamil Nadu through the Horticulture Department.

“We have issued passes to scent factories in Dindigul, Kovilpatti, Tiruvannamalai and Coimbatore so that they could collect flowers from the farmers and transport them to their manufacturing units. They may not collect the entire produce, but will give some relief to farmers,” said Gagandeep Singh Bedi, Agricultural Production Commissioner and Principal Secretary.

Farmers have complained that flowers either remain uncollected or perish in the fields because of the cancellation of marriages and temple festivals.

After Horticulture Department officials held talks, in Tiruvannamalai alone, 3.1 tonnes of jasmine were supplied to SMR Sri Arunachala Concrete Extraction Unit between March 28 and 30. Similarly, 650 kg jasmine was sent to a unit in Virudhunagar.

“In Dindigul, officials of the Horticulture Department held a meeting with perfume manufacturing units, and they will use 22 tonnes of flowers from Tuesday,” Mr. Bedi said.

The flower market in Koyambedu started functioning on Monday and the government has arranged for the inflow of flowers.

The Horticulture Department is also facilitating the movement of fruits, particularly bananas, to markets in Kerala, Pudukottai, Tindivanam, Coimbatore, Tirupattur and Tiruppur. Accordingly, 15 tonnes of banana have been sent to markets.

“Farmers can keep their produce in the cold storage facilities and godowns of the Agriculture Department for a month without the need for any payment,” Mr. Bedi said. He said farmers who had not paid the premium for the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana in the delta districts and a few other district could remit the amount on March 31.

Helplines set up

“Farmers can pay the premium at the primary co-operative banks and other nationalised banks in Nagapattinam, Tiruvarur, Tiruchi, Salem, Theni and Kanyakumari district,” he said.

The following are the helplines that have been set up to facilitate payment of insurance premium: Nagapattinam: 9750197636; Tiruvarur: 7397753311; Tiruchi: 9443021750; Salem: 9944980436; Theni: 9443828843; and Kanniyakumari: 9965568051.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ptpwwq/article31212139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31FARMERSPADDYFIELDCHENNAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/govt-steps-in-to-send-flowers-to-scent-factories/article31212140.ece
209,2020/03/30,Tech helps HC hear urgent cases,"Lawyers advance arguments from home

COVID-19 has had a crippling effect on regular functioning of courts across the State, but telecommunication technology has helped them stay the course. Despite the three-week lockdown, the Madras High Court on Monday used a video-conferencing mobile application to hear three urgent cases related to the pandemic and its aftermath.

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar heard arguments advanced by lawyers and law officers from their respective residences and instructed the police to be humane while dealing with individuals who venture out of their houses to access essential needs despite prohibitory orders promulgated under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure.

“The court would not like to pass any specific direction to the State or the police in this regard but we expect the police to adopt a balanced and humane approach in this matter since the emergent situation on account of COVID-19 is a very unique kind of problem,” the judges said after Additional Advocate General P.H. Arvindh Pandian denied allegations of harassment.

When advocate T. Sivagnanasambandan, representing the litigant M.L. Ravi, produced some photographs to claim that police were harassing people who step out of their homes to purchase essential commodities, the judges directed the State government to appoint nodal officers, not below the rank of Deputy Tahsildar, at Firka level to issue permits to such people.

Making it clear that the court does not expect people to come out of their houses unnecessarily, the judges also granted liberty to the State to take safety measures to prevent such exodus. They also directed the AAG to submit a report after four weeks listing out the number of criminal cases booked by the police for violation of orders promulgated under Section 144.

Taking up another case filed by G. Muthu Kumar Nayakar of Villupuram, the judges directed a technical committee constituted by the State government to consider representations made for trying out alternative medicines such as Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homeopathy to treat COVID-19 patients apart from using allopathic medicines.

“We hope and expect that the said committee and the State Government shall take appropriate decision in this matter as quickly as possible so that the public at large can avail the benefit of the same immediately,” the judges said and adjourned this case too by four weeks for reporting compliance of their order.

The third public interest litigation petition was the one filed by senior counsel A.E. Chelliah seeking a direction to the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and the State government to provide financial assistance of Rs.50,000 to every advocate and Rs.25,000 to every registered advocate clerk who had to lose their earnings during the lock down period.

Since the petitioner could not be contacted through phone on Monday, the judges ordered notices to the Bar Council as well as the government and asked them to respond within two weeks.

Meanwhile, the High Court administration has also compiled a long list of cases that it had heard despite the lock down and the list includes two suo motu public interest litigation petitions taken by it in the principal seat of the High Court in Chennai as well as its Madurai Bench to extend all interim orders till April 30 in order to prevent miscarriage of justice.

Apart from these cases heard by two Division Benches, one led by Justice M. Sathyanarayanan in Chennai and another by Justice P.N. Prakash in Madurai, Justice A.D. Jagadish Chandira too had heard a host of bail petitions and passed orders on them after hearing the arguments of the law officers over the telephone.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/p5iixm/article31095902.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th17HCcovidAGEQ78OFJQ3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/law/article31212130.ece
210,2020/03/30,"With 17 new COVID-19 patients, T.N. sees sharpest single-day jump","Ten of the new cases from Erode, five from Chennai

In the steepest single-day jump in the number of COVID-19 patients in Tamil Nadu, 17 persons have tested positive for the pandemic, taking the total cases to 67, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said on Monday.

Of the 17 patients, 10 are from Erode, five from Chennai, and one each from Madurai and Karur districts. Results of the swab samples of 121 persons are awaited. So far, six patients have been discharged from hospital after making a recovery.

Asked about the spurt in cases and the large number of patients from Erode, Mr. Palaniswami said: “A group of about 1,500 people went to Delhi [for a conference held by Tablighi Jamaat] and many from that group are testing positive. A total of 24 of them in Erode have it [COVID-19]. Of the 1,500, a total of 981 have returned and they are being tested. It is because of them that the figures have increased.” Ten of those who attended the conference were traced to Ambur. He did not go into specifics of when or how the remaining people from the group would be traced.

A total of 17,089 beds and 3,018 ventilators have been made available in government and private hospitals. There are now 14 SARS-CoV-2 testing labs across the State, including private labs. The State has sought approval from the Centre for three more labs, he added.

In all, 2,09,234 persons have been screened and 3,420 persons have completed the 28-day quarantine. While 1,981 persons were tested, 43,537 persons were under home quarantine and 1,641 in isolation. Mr. Palaniswami said 1,925 persons have been admitted as in-patients as they were suspected to have COVID-19. To a query on the number of persons tested for COVID-19, the CM maintained that testing would be done only if a person developed all symptoms.

The State government had taken steps to procure about 1.5 crore masks and 25 lakh N95 masks along with other medical supplies. “Even when the COVID-19 cases were reported in China, we stocked necessary medical requirements,” he said. Orders have been placed to acquire 2,500 ventilators and 30,000 test kits.

Mr. Palaniswami said applications for granting of emergency passes for travel would be considered only for attending funerals or weddings [scheduled earlier] or emergency medical conditions. “Section 144 would not have been imposed if everyone wanted to go out,” he quipped.

He added that steps were being taken to coordinate with States where workers from Tamil Nadu were stranded. “We have informed them that we will reimburse expenses,” he said and referred to a case in Maharashtra, where over 600 people from Tamil Nadu were stranded. About 1.49 lakh workers from Tamil Nadu were in other States and, of them, 32,469 were in the construction sector.

Self-quarantine was the only way to stop the spread of COVID-19, the CM reiterated and contended: “We have never come across such a situation, these are challenging times.” He sought people's cooperation for the lockdown, noting that people’s cooperation in T.N. was better than other States.

Replying to a query on rent to be paid by tenants, he said it was a pan India issue and the government would look into it. To another query on the possibility of waiving electricity bills, he said: “One should think of the government’s position. The government spends the money that is collected from the people as taxes. Otherwise, there is no money for the government.”

The CM also ruled out the possibility of holding an all-party meeting sought by the opposition on COVID-19, saying it was a medical issue.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tf4eja/article31211964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31THNEWSUITS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/with-17-new-covid-19-patients-tn-sees-sharpest-single-day-jump/article31211965.ece

212,2020/03/30,Officials tough on shops for not maintaining social distancing,"Shopkeepers were partaking in every other violation which could trigger the spread of the virus

With the country-wide lockdown enforced till April 14, it has become a tough task for the shop keepers to have their customers under control. Be it a grocery shop, vegetable shop, bakery, mutton-chicken shop, the scene was chaotic as usual as soon the shops were opened.

The sporadic spread of COVID-19 across the country has jeopardised the health conditions of so many . There are no signs any preventive mechanism in place and the job of maintaining social distancing measures among crowds has been entrusted with the respective shop owners. This has resulted in scant respect for customers.

They are forced to buy goods at higher rates . Some of the shopkeepers were partaking in every other violation which could trigger the spread of the virus .

However, some of them strictly adhered the health department manuals by offering hand washing facilities to their customers. Meanwhile, revenue and health officials were on their toes in identifying problematic areas and asked the shop keepers to ensure social distancing among the public.

For these violating regulations, a team of revenue officials led by Vellore Tahsildar V. Saravanamuthu ordered the closure of fish shops in Bagayam, Thorapadi, Kaniyambadi and Chinnapuram, broiler, chicken-mutton shops in Konavattam and Shenbakkam and a bakery in Sathuvachari, Vellore on Monday.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/yoix7i/article31207907.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/officials-tough-on-shops-for-not-maintaining-social-distancing/article31207908.ece

These poor patients and attendants said that they have been left penniless after a total shut down resulting in delay of their treatment. “Lodge owners are indifferent to us after the lockdown announcement.

Still, few others were not as lucky,” said Swapankumar Mondal from West Bengal.

Former DMK MP and party agriculture wing secretary K.P. Ramalingam has been relieved from his post, party president M.K. Stalin said in a statement on Monday.

218,2020/03/30,Seventeen new COVID-19 cases in Tamil Nadu in one day,"The total number of cases in the State so far now stands at 67; of these one person has died while five have been discharged after treatment, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said

In the steepest single day hike in the number of COVID-19 patients in Tamil Nadu, 17 persons tested positive on Monday, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami said.

Talking to reporters in Chennai Mr. Palaniswami said so far 67 patients have tested positive for COVID 19, of whom one person died, while five patients were discharged after medical treatment, so far. Of the 17 new patients, 10 have been reported from Erode district, five from Chennai, one from Madurai and one from Karur district. He also said results of swab samples of 121 persons were still awaited.

The State government has taken steps to procure about 1.5 crore masks and 25 lakh N95 masks and other medical supplies required. “Even while COVID-19 cases were reported in China, we have stocked necessary medical requirement,” Mr. Palaniswami claimed.

To a query on the number of persons tested for COVID-19, the CM maintained that testing would be done only if a person developed all symptoms.

As for granting emergency passes for people to travel, Mr. Palaniswami said such requests were considered if they were for funerals or weddings (scheduled earlier) or emergency medical conditions. “If everyone wants to venture out, where is the lockdown?” he asked.

Self-quarantine was the only way to stop the spread of COVID-19, the CM reiterated and contended: “We have never come across such a situation, these are challenging times.” He further sought for people's cooperation for the lockdown.

Replying to a query on rents to be paid by tenants, he said it was a pan-India issue and the government would look into it.

219,2020/03/30,10-month-old among eight fresh cases; State tally hits 50,"The new cases had come into contact with two infected Thai nationals

Eight persons, including four from the same family and an infant, tested positive for COVID-19 on Sunday, Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said. All of them had come into contact with two Thai nationals who had also tested positive for the disease. This takes the total number of patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 in the State to 50.

A 29-year-old woman, identified as patient no. 43 by the Health Department, who had come into contact with an earlier patient (case 26), who was admitted to Coimbatore ESI Hospital, had tested positive. Three others, who had come into contact with patient no. 43, also tested positive for the infection. They include a 58-year-old woman (patient no. 44); a 10-month-old boy (patient no. 45); and a 51-year-old woman (patient no. 46), all from Coimbatore, Dr. Rajesh said. They were undergoing treatment at ESI Hospital, she added.

They had contracted the infection from two Thai nationals who had tested positive and are currently undergoing treatment at IRT Perundurai. Four other patients, who were admitted to IRT Perundurai, also tested positive for the infection. The four men, aged 45, 48, 67, and 62, had travelled to Delhi from Erode.

Currently, 295 patients are undergoing treatment in hospitals, and 37 of them have tested positive for COVID-19.

A containment plan is being implemented in 11 districts. Nearly 270 personnel are covering a population of 27,725 in Tiruppur district. Around 50 patients have been picked up with symptoms of fever, cough and breathlessness. In Salem, 500 personnel are covering a population of 80,000, and 20 persons have been picked up with fever and cough. Similarly, in Chennai, the nearly one-lakh population is being covered by 500 personnel fanning out in teams. In Madurai, 88,000 people are being covered, and around 220 personnel are conducting surveillance. Suspected cases will be brought under quarantine and their samples tested, Dr. Rajesh said.

The State has added 2,000 more beds, bringing the total strength to 17,000. Apart from the government hospital at Omandurar Estate which would be used to treat COVID-19 infected persons, the government has converted a few more hospitals, including IRT Perundurai, into COVID-19 treatment facilities. ESI Coimbatore has dedicated 350 beds for COVID-19 patients, while the government hospitals in Theni, Villupuram, Pudukottai and Tiruvannamalai; the Thanjavur Medical College; and Tirunelveli and Madurai PMSSY facilities are taking similar measures. Around 4,000 more beds would be added soon. Private medical college hospitals had been instructed to provide exclusive blocks or buildings to treat patients, the Health Secretary said. Four laboratories in private hospitals had begun testing patients for the infection, she added.

Though the Health Department had covered the population of Virudhunagar under the containment initiative after a person there tested positive for the infection, she said that, if need be, another round of surveillance would be taken up.

Patients discharged

Earlier, the Health Minister said two patients had been discharged from Stanley Medical College after testing negative for the infection post-treatment. The patients have a travel history and are under house quarantine for the next 14 days.

220,2020/03/30,"Coronavirus | Concern in Tamil Nadu over health status of 1,500 who attended conference in Delhi","Authorities have a list of 819 names, police tracing the others.

Health authorities in Tamil Nadu are worried about the health status of about 1,500 people from Tamil Nadu, who reportedly attended a Tablighi Jamaat conference in Nizamuddin, Delhi. They are equally concerned about the possibility of cases spreading from these people.

Sources said there is just cause for alarm as a high percentage of those who were tested turned out to be coronavirus positive in the group. Of the 17 samples tested among the group that had returned, 16 persons tested positive, 14 in Erode district itself. The sudden spurt in the number of cases in Erode can be attributed to this, they added.

The authorities are even more concerned that they do not have the list of all 1,500 people who attended the conference. They have a list of 819 names and are testing all those they managed to identify, sources added.

It is understood that people from Tiruchi, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Erode, Pudukottai and Nagapattinam were among those who attended the meeting.

The sources said police were trying to trace the rest as well, but time is of the essence.

Intensive investigations are under way in the community to identify those who went for the conference. Of the eight who tested positive on March 29, four patients — 47, 48, 49, and 50 — were all from Erode, the government’s release said. They have been admitted to IRT Medical College and hospital, Perundurai.

Officials said those who attended the meeting should come forward and declare that they had been to the conference, since a number of those who travelled with them or attended the conference with them tested positive.

“We have to monitor everyone in the group now, given the current situation and appeal to everyone who attended the conference to volunteer information.

222,2020/03/30,‘Kannamoochi’ review: Too convenient for horror and too convoluted for a thriller,"The web series alters between horror and thriller for the most part and gets clueless beyond a point about its own proceedings

(Spoilers ahead)

Given the number of abysmal content — at least from the ones I have watched so far — being uploaded on OTT platforms in the name of web series, it is fair to conclude that Tamil filmmakers haven’t figured out a way to work around the format. Also given the number of preposterous web series available in Tamil, you tend to appreciate every little effort shown by the filmmaker to break the content clutter. Like the brilliantly-executed stretch that comes towards the fag end of Episode One of Kannamoochi.

It is a Holy Week procession that reconstructs the events leading to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. We see Christ struggling to carry the cross (read: weight of mankind) and is whipped and lashed by men who, we believe, are Roman soldiers in this context. The visual tone seems to suggest that it is dreamy, with Sundaramurthy KS’ single note score aiding this effect. The Passion of the Christ, if one were to call it that, is intercut with an image of Satan, laughing and mocking at the procession.

This is where Priya’s (Poorna, playing Poorna) five-year-old daughter Aishwarya goes missing. The scene does not just end there. Priya’s search for her daughter goes in vain and she finds herself caught in the middle of Jesus Christ and Satan — as if she has been pawned off in a war between gods and demons. It is brilliant for two reasons. For one, it is an unusual way of setting up the tension for a simple case of Gone Girl, even for a web series. And two, the sequence seems allegorical to the larger point of Kannamoochi: sins and sinners. But this Church procession, as Priya calls it, is the only rewarding quality of Kannamoochi, which is too convenient for horror and too convoluted for a thriller.

Priya moves into a luxury apartment with her daughter, who is speech-impaired. She is a single mother and an IT employee — only this much we know of her and only this much Poorna is given on paper. She is left to take care of the family when her husband (who comes across as a loving man) passes away due to pancreatic cancer. There is a huge portrait of her husband in the house. His eyes peer into the room, as if he is still the guiding light of the family. But the series has nothing to do with Priya or her husband, but Aishwarya. The mother-daughter duo lives on the ninth floor. But whenever they take the elevator, it stops at the sixth floor almost by design. In other words, this is Tamil cinema’s way of writing whoo... so scary… stuff. These initial scenes are seriously off-putting, given how lame they are — both in terms of the shock factor and staging (side note: If you cannot get actors/dubbing artistes to speak English with a fake urban accent, kindly refrain from going to the remarkable extent of writing dialogues in English, for ‘urbane’ characters).

Kannamoochi Cast: Poorna, Vivek Prasanna, Amzath Khan and Bose Venkat

Director: Avinaash Hariharan

Genre: Horror-thriller

But Kannamoochi gets moderately interesting when Aishwarya goes missing. She is not the first one to go missing. When all hope is lost, Priya chances upon a mysterious girl with an Anniyan haircut. She knows where Aishwarya is, but would only disclose the location if and when Priya plays a game of kannamochi (hide and seek). She forces Priya to recite the kannamochi song: “Kannamoochi re re, kandupidi yaaru... arakan vaaran pathuko.” Priya’s quest, is to find that Arakan or Satan. If you have not yawned already, we are still at Episode Two and have three more to go. You sense a familiarity when the spirit of a child appears. You expect the series to traverse a known path, but it takes the Yaavarum Nalam route, to establish the case of a missing family and justice for the sins committed. The sinner here is a paedophile and let us call him Mr R.

Written by Aadthiya GR (Mysskin’s brother), Kannamoochi can be seen as a companion piece to Psycho, which also dealt with an Arakan in the form of a psychopath. Psycho ruminates on morality and justice, and portrayed the killer with a sympathetic gaze. There, it was about a woman leading a psychopath to the path of salvation. Here, it is about a woman who leaves no room for such thoughts and wants to vanquish the sinner altogether. Like Psycho, there is a climax ritual where Priya unearths the Chamber of Secrets. Again, it is a good construct but offers very little beyond the obvious.

It is hard to not think of Mindhunter while watching Kannamoochi, for you could hear Avinaash Hariharan screaming that he is a David Fincher fan and has binged on the show. Of course, the series bears no similarities to Fincher’s masterpiece, but pays a fanboy hat-tip to Mindhunter by its design — pay attention to the opening credits. Every episode begins with a two-minute preface about an insignificant (and impotent?) man showing paedophilic characteristics — which might seem inconsequential at first but has an effective pay-off in the end, when Avinaash knits the various events together. But unlike Mindhunter, which was far superior, far serious and far procedural, the idea for Kannamoochi rests heavily on the subject matter and does not go beyond that.

Nevertheless, Avinaash keeps the spirit of the series intact. I liked the gag between Priya and her husband when the former says, “If you can’t help your wife, you have to ‘help’ yourself.” I also liked the cheeky comment that Mr R makes when a little girl is chided for messing up the room. He instinctively says, “It’s our mess. We’ll clean it,” with a grin on his face. I laughed when Mr R sang ‘You’re my Honeybunch’ in the climax ritual. The problem with Kannamoochi is that it treats the psychopath too apologetically, reducing him to a piece of textual information. I wished it had been more explicit than being suggestive.

Kannamoochi is currently streaming on Zee5",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/clo5f5/article31207596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vlcsnap-2020-03-30-16h34m03s831,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/kannamoochi-web-series-review/article31207597.ece

224,2020/03/30,How actor Akshith SK is dealing with the delay of his debut film during the COVID-19 lockdown,"Akshith Shashi Kumar makes sure to keep himself busy even during his stay at home

Son of veteran actor Shashi Kumar, Akshith, was all set to have a dream launch this month, when the Covid-19 decided to play spoilt sport and brought the entire nation into a lock-down. The young actor’s film is titled Seethayana — a bilingual in Kannada and Telugu (Seethayanam). The film, directed by Prabhakar Aaripaka will later be released in Tamil in a dubbed version. Akshith is paired opposite Anahita Bhushan, who also makes her debut with this film, which is produced by Lalitha Rajyalakshmi.

Akshith speaks to MetroPlus about how he feels about his debut film and what he is doing to keep himself busy during the lockdown.

Excerpts

Tell us about Seethayana

The film is very special to me. However this is my second film. The first was Modave. We started the film in March 2019 and suddenly it got stalled. It was falling into a dump. It hurt. Then after eight months, I got this offer and was cheerful, and now this Covid-19 thing happened.

How do you feel now about your second film also being delayed...

What has happened is very unfortunate, but safety and lives are more important. We need people to be safe first. What is the use of a world if there are no people left to enjoy it?

How do you keep yourself busy during the lockdown?

We are all playing almost every board game at home. l feel like a child all over again. I am playing pranks and irritate my mother a lot. Sometimes I help her with the household chores like chopping vegetables or mopping the house and generally keeping the spirit of others at home up with my antiques. (laughs the 24-year-old actor).

How challenging is it to find a footing in the industry being Shashi Kumar’s son ?

Nepotism does not work in the industry. Being a star-son, does not guarantee that I am welcomed with a red carpet. Even I need to work hard, prove I am talented and have a lot of patience. Just because my father was a popular hero during his time does not guarantee people will accept me.

What changes do you see in the industry since you have been a part of it since you were a child?

The changes I see are the manner in which films are being made. They are more realistic and the camera work is brilliant. I never imagined the Kannada industry to boom up with such power. It is good as everyone in every area is open to change, adapt themselves to new ideas and technology and strive to give it their best.

Tell us a bit about your character in Seethayana.

My character, Rahul, in the film is very contrary to the one that I am in real life. He is very serious and takes rational decisions. And the hash-tag for the film is ‘respect women’. It is not a woman-oriented film but portrays women in a very different manner. If I say more then you will get the gist of the story, so we will leave it at that.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/b7776/article31205647.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200310-WA0008-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/how-actor-akshith-sk-is-dealing-with-the-delay-of-his-debut-film-during-the-covid-19-lockdown/article31205654.ece
225,2020/03/30,"‘Shaktimaan’ will return amid lockdown, confirms lead star Mukesh Khanna","There are reports that Khanna will also start working on a sequel to the show after the lockdown is over

Joining the list of reruns on Doordarshan is another cult classic from the golden era of Indian television, superhero show “Shaktimaan”, veteran actor Mukesh Khanna, who featured in the titled role, has revealed.

“Getting to watch two epics of our country ‘Ramayan’ and ‘Mahabharat’ in one day was a matter of great happiness for the 135 crore people who are under lockdown. Sit at home and enjoy. There could not have been a bigger good news. But I’d like to add something to this happy news for my ‘Shaktimaan’ fans, that ‘Shaktimaan’ is also going to come very soon,” he said in the video clip.

However, the actor-producer didn’t disclose the date and time of the show’s re-run, he asked fans to wait for the announcement.

227,2020/03/30,"On 'Kadar', a short film from the Anamalais","Launched on Youtube today, Kadar describes one night in the life of a Kadar tribesman in the Altaghat Rainforests

Altaghat Rainforest in the Anamalai mountain range teems with wildlife: birds, bees, tigers, bears and elephants. It is also home to Loganathan of the Kadar tribe whose ancestors have walked the forests from time immemorial.

He is the protagonist of the short film, Kadar, which was launched on YouTube today. The film is the brainchild of wildlife travel operator Pravin Shanmughanandam. The film has been scripted and directed by Pankaj Singh of Faraway Originals, which makes films about unsung heroes from across the country.

It all began four years ago, when Pravin surveyed a private coffee estate. “We were looking for a good trail in the rainforests and found this 175-acre coffee estate that the owners had given over to re-foresting. So far, the area had been open only to researchers and scientists,” says Pravin. While they were okay with walks and trails on that land, the owners did not want it to become a stomping ground for marauding tourists.

It was the perfect fit. “The biodiversity here is amazing; the forests are spectacular with their trees, streams and waterfalls. But I also wanted it to be all about the local inhabitants. Then, in 2016, I met Loganathan,” says Pravin, adding that he became his constant companion on his tours. Loganathan became a tour guide as he accompanied Pravin’s groups into the forest and shared with them his exhaustive knowledge about the flora and fauna there.

Stories from India Faraway Originals is a collective of Bengaluru-based storytellers, writers, artists and filmmakers who create original films from across India about art and history, sport and movement, the natural world and conservation. They seek incredible tales and craft them into narratives that bring to the fore, unexplored perspectives, unheard voices and unseen expressions, hidden in plain sight.

At nights, sitting around a campfire in the forest, Loganathan would tell Pravin about the animals he shared the forests with and a lot of jungle lore. “His mother, wife, daughter, cousin and his wife and he are the only people looking after the estate. Only the Kadars can live in the leech-infested rainforest,” he says. During one of his trips, Pravin noticed that Loganathan had fitted a new door to his home. “I asked him about it and he said, ‘An elephant did that, so we changed the door.’ Nothing else! I had to prise the details out.”

When Pankaj heard the story of the tusker breaking into Logananthan’s home in the dead of night forcing him to escape into the forest with his family, “we decided it was a story to tell,” he says. “The script is from Loganathan’s point of view; in first person. It recreates what happened that night and what Loganathan made of the incident.”

Pravin says it was not easy convincing Loganathan to agree to the film. “The Kadars do not interact much with city dwellers, and here were some ‘urban people’ who suddenly wanted to make a movie about him,” says Pravin. Filming in the forest was challenging. “We had to trek uphill in the night to check the landscape. It had rained, we were slipping, sliding and falling, with minimal rain gear… there was a lot of hiking and trekking and going across unused trails. It is a completely isolated terrain.”

The film crew consisted of just four members: three from the Faraway Originals and Pravin. “There was no big crew or big lights…We spent a lot of time with Loganathan, listening to him and his mother while we ate together. Only when he warmed up did we start filming. We did it in just one and a half days,” recalls Pankaj.

While the film was about a tusker entering Loganathan’s home, the team had to work out a way to tell the story without an elephant. After all, there was no way they could conjure up a tusker. “Visually, we planned it so that we did not have to show the animal. There are many ways to portray the mood,” says Pankaj. Indeed, the anxiety, fear and suspense are tangible when watching the film. The elephant is always there, just out of the frame.

Pankaj wrote the narrative in English and Pravin narrated it in Tamil. “We decided to go with the local language because it had more impact. There are English sub-titles,” says Pravin.

Kadar releases on YouTube today. “Everybody has a story,” says Pankaj, “only they often do not recognise it as an amazing one. Loganathan’s was one of them.” For Pravin, what stood out was Loganathan’s response to the tusker incident. “This is who I am; this is my life that I share with the creatures of the forest. That night I was scared. As scared and intimidated as I am when I go into town and a bus conductor asks me for my ticket.”

228,2020/03/30,‘The Office’ reunion: John Krasinski and Steve Carell bond on YouTube show ‘Some Good News’,"Krasinski reminded Carell that this would be the 15th anniversary of the show as they shared anecdotes from their time on the drama

Hollywood star John Krasinski wants to spread some good news by bringing positive stories as the world battles coronavirus pandemic.

The actor-director launched ‘Some Good News’ on YouTube, featuring his former “The Office” co-star Steve Carell.

Krasinki, whose sequel to “A Quiet Place” has been postponed due to the virus spread, said he wanted to talk about stories that made people feel good or smile and turns out there were plenty that fans had to share with the actor.

The actor had put up a colorful logo of “SGN”, which he said his two daughters had made.

“For years now, I’ve been wondering, why is there not a news show dedicated entirely to good news? Well, desperately seeking my fix somewhere else, I reached out to all of you this week, asking — nay, begging — for some good news. And boy, did you deliver.”

“After reading those replies and the incredibly heartwarming stories that came with them, I thought, ‘All right. Enough is enough, world. Why not us? Why not now?’ So, ladies and gentleman, this is your fault, and this is SGN. I’m John Krasinski, and if it isn’t clear yet, I have absolutely no idea what I’m doing,” the actor said at the start of the video.

Krasinski said “we all are going through an incredibly trying time” but the human spirit had “found a way to break through and blow us all away“.

He then went on to highlight the stories that people had shared with him, of public cheering for the health care workers, neighbours helping out each other and a grandfather meeting his grandson for the first time through a window in the age of social distancing.

Krasinski also interviewed a 15-year-old girl named Coco whose neighbours cheered for her from the streets as she finished her final chemo treatment.

The actor, who shot to fame as Jim Halpert in “The Office”, interviewed Steve Carell, who played his boss Michael Scott on the show.

Krasinski reminded Carell that this would be the 15th anniversary of the show as they shared anecdotes from their time on the drama.

The “Jack Ryan” star said fans have been clamoring for a cast reunion, but at this time he just wants the pandemic to end so that the team can have an off camera reunion “as people, just to say hi.”

Carell also joked to Krasinski: “I guarantee you that the bottom half of what you have on does not match the top,” referring his suit and tie, as Krasinski laughed and joked he was wearing Jam pants.

As the actor stood up after signing off from the show, he, indeed was wearing pants that did not match with the top half of his suit.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/taf2ug/article31204811.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/jim,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-office-reunion-john-krasinski-and-steve-carell-bond-on-youtube-show-some-good-news/article31204812.ece

Stranger Things star David Harbour has suggested Marvel Studios to release his upcoming film Black Widow online amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Starring Scarlett Johansson in the title role, the film which was scheduled to be released on May 1, has been postponed until further notice.

In a live Instagram Q&A session, Harbour said he was shocked to find out about the delay in the release.

“My publisher also sent me an email saying ‘Black Widow’ had been postponed and I think I replied ‘shocker’,” the actor, who plays Red Guardian in the Cate Shortland-directed MCU film, said.

“Wouldn’t it be fun if we all could just stream it? But that’s above my pay grade,” Harbour, 44, added.

The actor also said the pandemic has delayed the release of “Stranger Things” season four.

Marvel has also postponed Amy Adams-starrer “The Woman in the Window”, a 20th Century title and “The Personal History of David Copperfield”, featuring Dev Patel, from its Searchlight banner, which were supposed to debut on April 15 and May 8, respectively.

It is unclear when any of these films will be released.

230,2020/03/30,Junior doctors threaten to boycott duties,"11 PGs exposed to a child who was detected with COVID-19

At least 11 junior doctors (post-graduate students) working in Niloufer Hospital gave their swab samples to test for coronavirus after they got exposed to a three-year-old male child who was detected with COVID-19 on Sunday.

Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) members threatened not to attend duties across all government hospitals in the State from Tuesday unless Personal Protection Equipments (PPE) are provided as per guidelines of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

The junior doctors allege that PPE is not being provided to the PGs attending duties in emergency rooms from the past three days. Meanwhile, the hospital authorities have denied the allegation.

The toddler suffering from blood disorders, cold, cough, breathlessness, was brought to the hospital.

“As the child did not have any travel history, or contact with a COVID-19 patient, he was admitted in the emergency room. When the toddler developed pneumonia, he was shifted to Isolation Ward on Friday and samples were sent for tests. Up on testing positive for coronavirus on Sunday, the patient was shifted to Gandhi Hospital. All doctors and staff who were in the emergency room when the toddler was there and have symptoms, were asked to get tested,” an official from the hospital said.

President of TJUDAs Dr. K.U.N. Vishnu said that 11 of them developed mild symptoms like cough, cold, gave nasopharyngeal, and throat swab samples were sent for tests.

“We were not provided with PPEs. Around 20 junior doctors checked the patient. The 11 people who gave samples are under home quarantine. As doctors, we want to serve people, our country in this crisis period. But please give us protective gear. If they are provided, we will attend any number of cases,” Dr. Vishnu said.

However, the hospital authorities said that PPEs were handed over to representatives of PGs for distribution. “We kept them at three places in the hospital, including in emergency pharmacy room, for anyone to take,” the official said.

It was learnt that instructions were issued that PGs will liaison with superintendents in distribution of PPEs. The junior doctors can take issues to notice of the superintendents, if there are any.

The TJUDA members, meanwhile, submitted a representation through email to Director of Medical Education Dr K Ramesh Reddy informing him that they will come to respective departments but will not attend duties from March 31. They stated that they were assured of the protective gear when they met the official on March 23.

They stated in the representation that the decision is in the interest of common public because one doctor with coronavirus can act as carrier and spread to hundred of patients as happened in Bhilwara, Rajasthan. “Also, we are losing critical care providers to quarantine or isolation ,” the TJUDAs president stated.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/junior-doctors-threaten-to-boycott-duties/article31211827.ece

233,2020/03/30,Government to cut salaries of staff as well as pensioners,"Bureaucrats to face 60% cut in salaries to offset impact of COVID-19

Faced with the deteriorating economic situation owing to the impact of the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), the State government has opted for an extraordinary decision of cutting the salaries of staff at different levels, including those of the elected representatives.

The decision comes in the light of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao announcing at a press conference on Sunday that the government is not averse to impose cuts in the salaries of the employees from the top level to offset the burden on the financial front posed by the virus which adversely impacted the economy as well as the accrual of finances to the State exchequer. A high level meeting chaired by the Chief Minister on Monday has resolved to rationalize the pay packages for the staff in the aftermath of the COVID-19 impact on the State.

Accordingly, there will be 75% cut in the salaries of the State Cabinet, MLAs, MLCs, chairmen of corporations and elected representatives of different organisations. Bureaucrats, including IAS, IPS and IFS officers, would have to bear with 60% cut in their salaries while the reduction for staff in all other categories would be to the tune of 50%.

The fourth class, contracting and outsourcing staff would face 10% cut in their salaries while the pensioners in all categories would have to bear with a cut of 50% in their emoluments. Burden on pensioners comprising fourth class employees would, however, be less in that only 10% of their assured pension would be cut. The reduction would be applicable for all employees and pensioners employed in the State owned companies and corporations.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/government-to-cut-salaries-of-staff-as-well-as-pensioners/article31211254.ece
234,2020/03/30,Alcohol withdrawal effects drive more people to Institute of Mental Health,"From maximum of 5 patients a day, the number increases to 90; psychiatrists debunk docs prescription of alcohol

The number of people suffering from severe alcohol withdrawal effects who visit Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Erragadda, increased from maximum of 5 patients a day to 90. Along with other commercial establishments, liquor shops too were shut for over a week as part of lockdown for containment of the spread of coronavirus.

Deprived of their regular dose of alcohol, addicts have slipped from atonic symptoms such as restlessness, trembling, to severe effects such as seizures, delirium. Though people have been holding on to wishful thinking that exemption might be made for chronic alcoholics if a doctor prescribes daily consumption of certain amount of alcohol, psychiatrists debunked the concept.

They said that the concept is obsolete and no doctor will prescribe alcohol to patients, be it two or three pegs, as body will demand more. Detoxification and de-addiction treatment was strongly suggested as path to recovery. Liquor shops were closed in the State from March 22. Usually, a maximum of five persons suffering from the withdrawal effects visit IMH. However, the number touched 16 on Saturday, 25 on Sunday and 90 on Monday.

IMH’s superintendent M Uma Shankar said that when a person addicted to alcohol withdraws from it, he initially suffers from effects such as body trembling, anxiousness, sleeplessness in night, perspiration, and cannot sit at one place.“After two to three days, they might develop severe effects such as seizures, delirium - acute confusion where people will be disoriented about time, place, people,” Dr Uma Shankar said.

Psychiatrists at IMH said that people who were hallucinating too consulted them in the past few days. When a person walks in with the problem, his blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration is checked. As chronic alcoholics do not eat on time, they suffer from hypoglycemia. Dehydration, weakness too is observed.

Fluids and detoxifying agents are given as part of treatment. People suffering from delirium, seizures are admitted. Dr Uma Shankar said that detoxification process lasts for eight to ten days. “Time for de-addiction treatment depends on whether patient cooperates, and if family supports,” he said.

Though people are pinning hopes on doctors’ prescription of alcohol dose, former president of Indian Psychiatric Society G Prasad Rao said that though a section of therapists believed that people addicted to alcohol should not be suddenly put off it, the concept is obsolete now.

235,2020/03/30,Druggists want transport of medicines,"Absence of courier service creating shortage of medicines in outlets across State, say association leaders

The Telangana Chemists and Druggists Association has urged the State government to take necessary steps to allow the transportation of medicines to different parts of State on a war footing so that there is no shortage of supplies in the 25,000 and odd pharmacies.

In a statement issued here on Monday, Association president Ch. Janardhan Rao and general secretary J.Satish Rao expressed concern that non-availability regular parcel services by leading transport operators and closure of the courier services due to the lockdown had created a situation where the medicines and crucial drugs are not reaching the pharmacies.

They said right from the wholesale distributors to the retailers, shortage of medicines was looming large. They also wanted government to take steps to see that the drug manufacturing units began production duly following all the precautions.

They said time was running out as there could be severe shortage of medicines in the next few days, if proper steps were not taken.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/druggists-want-transport-of-medicines/article31210693.ece
236,2020/03/30,Account details of beneficiaries being verified,"White ration cardholders to get ₹1500 into their accounts soon

The State government has intensified efforts to credit the ₹ 1,500 cash assured to the white ration cardholders in their respective accounts.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has announced that ₹ 1,500 each would be deposited into the accounts of the cardholders, along with 12 kg rice to each member of the cardholders’ families, enabling them to purchase other essentials. The government earmarked ₹ 1,100 crore towards distribution of 3.36 lakh metric tonne rice to 87.59 lakh families while ₹ 1,310 crore had been allotted for distribution of ₹ 1,500 cash each to families of cardholders.

The arrangements for distribution of rice had been completed, but the process for crediting cash into the accounts could not be started because of the unavailability of details of the accounts of the cardholders. The cards, forming part of the public distribution system, are all linked to the Aadhaar numbers of the holders, but there was no insistence on the submission of the account details in the past.

The government had therefore forwarded the Aadhaar details to the bankers asking them to submit details of accounts pertaining to the Aadhaar numbers. Senior officials said the banks had completed identification of the account details of all the cardholders and the list was said to be finetuned to avoid scope for mistakes.

“The list accounts will be submitted to the Finance department which will then credit the amount into the respective accounts,” a senior official told The Hindu. The process is expected to be completed in a day or two followed by crediting of the amount into the accounts.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/account-details-of-beneficiaries-being-verified/article31210543.ece
237,2020/03/30,"CM says comprehensive TS paddy, rice policy shortly","A comprehensive Telangana State paddy and rice policy will be prepared in view of significant increase in the paddy yield in the State, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said.

He instructed the officials concerned to formulate the policy after consulting with rice millers and other stakeholders. He announced that the government will stand by the rice millers and make them stakeholders in the State’s development and progress. The draft policy will be discussed in the State Cabinet and later in the Legislature before before introduced.

Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao held a high-level review meeting here on Monday at Pragathi Bhavan on paddy cultivation, paddy yield, milling of rice and exports, and the policy to be pursued and other related issues. Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy, Civil Supplies Minister Gangula Kamalakar, Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar, DGP Mahender Reddy, Principal Secretary (Agriculture) B Janardhan Reddy, Civil Supplies Corporation Chairman Mareddy Srinivas Reddy, Commissioner Satyanarayana Reddy, State Rice Millers Association president Gampa Nagender, Mohan Reddy, leaders Chandrapal, Bocchu Bhaskar, Prabhakar Rao, Thota Sampath Kumar, Kanthaiah, Yadagiri and others participated.

“There is a lot of difference between the situation that prevailed during the united AP and now. Construction of major projects like the Kaleshwaram, completion of the on-going projects, revival of tanks under Mission Kakatiya, 24-hour free power to farmers, water in abundance to farmers led to increase in paddy cultivation in the State,” Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said.

In this rabi season, Paddy was cultivated in 40 lakh acres and there is a possibility of more than one crore tonnes of paddy being harvested. This time during the monsoon, paddy will be cultivated in 55 lakh to 60 lakh acres. Under Kaleshwaram project alone paddy can be cultivated in more than 35 lakh acres. Next year paddy will be cultivated in at least 70 lakh acres. Telangana State produces 2.25 crore tonnes of paddy every year and is becoming the rice bowl of India. Under these circumstances, procuring the paddy and sending it to the mills to make rice and selling it will become a major task. There is a need for a comprehensive paddy and rice policy to ensure that the entire harvest can be milled and rice sold without any problem, he said.

“There are 2, 200 rice mills in the State, which can process one crore tonnes of rice per year. In the past, they could not get the paddy to their capacity. There is supply of paddy in abundance, 24 hour uninterrupted power supply and rice mills should take advantage of the situation and mill more rice. They should operate to their optimum level to mill rice for the purpose of consumption within the State, to supply to the FCI and to export to other States. There is a need to have new mills. From the government side we will do everything to run the rice mills in an effective way and to put them in profits. The rice mills in Telangana should become stakeholders in the State’s development and progress,” the CM urged.

Chief Minister also said henceforth there will be no harassment of rice millers by the officials. The government will make changes in the policy to do away with so many permissions. Rice millers should have a proper marketing strategy while a study should be made to know what varieties of rice are preferred by people in the State and those in other States. Such varieties of paddy, based on the study should be cultivated, milled into rice and supplied to people in the State, other States and countries.

Food processing units

Chief Minister said that government will consider allocating sites in the industrial estates for setting up rice mills which will be recognised as food processing units and necessary concessions and encouragement would be given. It is considering increasing capacity of rice mills from 70 HP to 150 HP under the LT Category.

He also said the number of godowns in the State should be increased. Before formation of the State there were only four lakh tonnes capacity of godowns in the region which was increased to 22 lakh tonnes. But this should be increased to 40 lakh tonnes.

Due to the present coronavirus problem, hamalis working in the rice mills have gone back to their home State. The government would make arrangements to get them, he said.

A coronavirus suspect, who was admitted in the isolation ward at Government General Hospital (GGH) here, died of heart attack on Monday, following which family members of the deceased attempted to attack the doctors who treated him, accusing them of being negligent.

The 62-year-old was in contact with one retired employee who arrived from New Delhi recently and was admitted in the isolation ward at Makloor.

Of the 10 others who are neighbours of the retired employee and are in the isolation ward in GGH, two would be sent to Gandhi Hospital as their condition is slightly serious, GGH nodal officer J. Tirupati Rao said.

“Probably the patient might have died due to fear. He had no COVID-19 symptoms when he was admitted to the hospital. Blood samples were sent to Pune, and the results are awaited.

The Communist Party of India has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to convene an emergency all-party meeting to discuss the threat of coronavirus (COVID-19) spread and devise ways and means to tackle it.

Dealing with coronavirus should be taken up collectively as it was the collective responsibility of all the political parties to ensure that people were aware and prepared and that every body took precautionary measures. The pandemic was not limited to the BJP or its wings and it was threat to the entire country. As such the government should take all the stakeholders of society into consideration.

There was an equal need for convening an emergency meeting of all renowned doctors like D. Nageswar Reddy, scientists and intellectuals to discuss preventive, precautionary and remedial measures to contain the spread of coronavirus and take their suggestions for effectively addressing the crisis, CPI national secretariat member K.

241,2020/03/30,‘Need Plan-B for checking COVID-19 post April 14’,"Governments should utilise technology and involve people, says Ch. Vidyasagar Rao

Senior BJP leader and former Governor of Maharashtra Ch. Vidyasagar Rao has underlined the need for the State and Central governments to prepare action plans for tackling the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) after April 14, the time by which the impact of the virus is expected to recede significantly.

Decentralisation should be the focus area in the measures that should be taken up post-April 14. The governments should utilize technology as well as medical, paramedical and technical staff to reach out the services to the grass root level. Mr. Vidyasagar Rao appreciated the steps initiated by the State and Central governments keeping the departments on the alert amid doubts about the containment of the coronavirus.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao assessed the performance of the departments of their respective governments and succeeded in instilling confidence among the people that there was no need for panic. “There is, however, a need for preparing a Plan B as part of which precautionary measures should reach the grass root level on a continuous basis,” he said.

Accordingly, comprehensive plans should be evolved cutting across caste, religion and regional lines and they should be implemented by making people as partners. There was no doubt adequate awareness created among the people through mass media, but efforts should be made to rope in NGOs, technical staff, professionals in medical and related professions for continuing the work. “Depending on the government alone will not be proper,” he said.

Mr. Vidyasagar Rao was particularly appreciative of the rural areas which initiated self-control measures without waiting for the governments’ instructions. The spirit of self-governance and self-reliance became evident in all the villages ever since the news about coronavirus outbreak broke. “Over 60 % of the villages evolved their own self-governance mechanism and stood as examples to the world,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/5z3nsp/article31210584.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY31CHVIDYASAGARRAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/need-plan-b-for-checking-covid-19-post-april-14/article31209191.ece
242,2020/03/30,Uttam asks Congress workers to help people hit by lockdown,"Congress to set up Control Room at Gandhi Bhavan to monitor relief

Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) president and Nalgonda MP N. Uttam Kumar Reddy appealed to the Congress workers from across the State to help those affected by the ongoing lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Speaking to media persons after participating in food and vegetable distribution programme conducted by Congress leaders in Gudimalkapur, Tolichowki and other areas on Monday, Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy said that many Congress leaders and workers were actively taking part in relief programmes by providing food, vegetables and other essential items among the needy persons. He appealed all the leaders and workers to identify the affected persons and extend all necessary help individually and collectively.

He also announced that the Congress party would set up a Control Room at party headquarters, Gandhi Bhavan, to monitor the relief operations being carried out across the State. However, he instructed the party workers to take all precautions while distributing food and other items. He said social distancing and hygiene should be maintained at all times.

The TPCC chief demanded that the State government supply promised free rice and financial assistance on immediate basis. He slammed the government for not extending any help to the poor even after one week of lockdown. He said lakhs of daily wage earners, migrant workers and other poorer sections have lost their livelihood due to lockdown and the authorities were yet to come to their rescue.

He urged the government to take immediate measures to control the sudden increase in prices of essential commodities. He said stern action should be taken against those selling essential commodities at exorbitant prices. He said measures should be taken to curb hoarding and black marketing of all products, especially under current emergency situation.

Earlier, Mr. Reddy participated in distribution of essential commodities organised by Congress leader Feroz Khan in Vambay Colony, Navodaya Colony and Gudimalkapur areas in Nampally constituency. He was accompanied by TPCC Minorities Department chairman Shaik Abdullah Sohail, TPCC spokesperson Syed Nizamuddin and other leaders. Later, he visited Tolichowki to check the preparations for distribution of food and vegetables being arranged by Hyderabad Minorities Department chairman Sameer Waliullah since the last one week.

246,2020/03/30,‘1.2 lakh Odia workers stranded’,"Efforts on to provide all help to them, says Odisha govt.

The Odisha government on Monday said about 1.2 lakh Odia migrant workers are stranded in other States.

“The State government has set up a control room led by 12 senior bureaucrats who are assigned to coordinate with their counterparts in other States. The government is making all effort to provide assistance to all stranded Odia people,” said Subroto Bagchi, Odisha’s chief spokesperson on COVID-19, here.

“As of now, 4,700 calls have been received from people in distress. We are in close contacts with others States about the safety of 1.20 lakh people. Most of them are now stranded in Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala,” he said.

Helpline calls

Mr. Bagchi pointed out that among all the calls received through the helpline number, 200 pertained to groups having 100 or more people stranded in other States. “All help is being extended to them through the respective State governments.”

“It is matter of concern that people are stranded away from their homes. Till the situation is normalised, they will have to wait there. All assistance is being extended to them through highly placed Odia officers and Odia organisations,” said Mr. Bagchi.

The State government had earlier announced that it will bear the expenses incurred for all migrant workers stranded in other States.

247,2020/03/30,Dairy and vegetable farmers count losses,"They are unable to transport their produce to markets because of restrictions

Inability to transport their produce because of lockdown has made small dairy farmers in Assam throw away hundreds of litres of milk while vegetable growers are letting their crop rot or dump nearby for animals.

Some 1,500 members of Sitajakhala Dugdha Utpadak Samabai Samiti Ltd in Morigaon district dumped about 10,000 litres of milk in rivers and streams during the first two days of lockdown. This was because the milk could not be consumed locally after efforts to transport them to the urban centres failed.

The milk processing plant of the 58-year-old cooperative society is situated about 65 km east of Guwahati.

“Our farmers face a combined average loss of ₹12 lakh per day with production dropping from the daily mark of 20,000 litres before the lockdown. But the main problem is availability of cattle feed, which is procured primarily from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal,” said Ranjib Sharma, the society’s chairman.

Smaller cooperative societies at Jorabat and Rangiya near Guwahati have been facing similar problems. A major reason, said milk trader Dilip Chhetri of Jorabat, is the closure of all hotels, restaurants and sweetmeat shops that were the bulk buyers.

District authorities claimed they have streamlined the supply of milk after the initial hiccups as dairy and milk products and shops selling animal fodder fall under essential services according to the Union Home Ministry’s guidelines.

But small dairy farmers said this has benefited major firms and a State government-run dairy unit who have massive refrigeration units to store milk not offloaded for two-three days.

At Singimari in Kamrup district, Mukalmua in Nalberi district and Kharupetia in Darrang district, most vegetable farmers have not been able to find transporters to market their produce. These places are considered the vegetable bowls of Assam.

“Officials are saying the government has relaxed restrictions on farming activities, but I lost more than 50 kg of tomatoes and other vegetables because of this bandh (lockdown). I hope the government compensates some of my loss,” said Ramzan Ali, a farmer of Bechimari area near Kharupetia.

248,2020/03/30,Jails being decongested in J&K,"700 lockdown violators were held, kept together for hours

The J&K administration has started decongesting jails and lock-ups only after rounding up around 700 “violators” of the lockdown and huddling them in police stations and exposing them to the dangers of contracting COVID-19.

In a major step to decongest the prisons, the J&K administration revoked the Public Safety Act, a law dealing with preventive detention, on 31 prisoners. “Eleven of those to be released are lodged in Kotbalwal jail, 14 in Srinagar jail, four in a Rajouri jail and two in Kathua,” an official said.

However, at least 700 civilians, who were designated as violators by the police and booked for their movement on the roads, were detained for hours together in police stations and many were detained for several days.

Police sources said Block Development Council chairman Muhammad Yasin Sheikh from Handwara’s Dolipora was arrested and detained for at least three days for “his movement in Dolipora and arguing with the policemen”. He wad lodged at the Vilgam police station, Handwara, and booked under Section 353 and 506.

The Vilgam police detained 15 “violators” on March 24 and huddled them into the police station. A total of 35 civilians were arrested in the whole of Handwara area that day.

Valley’s Bandipora, Handwara and Ganderbal districts top in detention of “violators” and lodging them in lock-ups and police stations. In the past two days, over 50 “violators” have been detained in these districts.

A man from Indore and Ujjain each were confirmed dead owing to COVID-19 on Monday, taking the toll due to the illness to four in Madhya Pradesh.

While the man from Indore died at 3 a.m. on Monday, the Ujjain resident had died on March 27, but his sample tested positive for the disease on Monday.

“A 41-year-old man from Indore has died,” confirmed Rahul Rokde of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Indore. He was first admitted to a private hospital on March 23, his sample tested positive on March 26, and he was then admitted to the government-run MRTB Hospital on Saturday at 9 p.m..

“The patient didn’t have a travel or contact history,” Dr. Rokde confirmed.

Meanwhile, a 38-year-old man from Ujjain who had died on March 27 while undergoing treatment for chest pain at a hospital tested positive for COVID-19.

“He came with chest pain and was admitted to the hospital, and died soon after. We had taken a sample while he underwent treatment,” said A.G. Sinha, Chief Medical Health Officer, Ujjain.

After the patient was admitted at 7.50 p.m., doctors had sent swab samples to the college, which tested them positive at Monday noon. The patient died at 9 p.m..

“The patient was obese and asthmatic and had hypertension too,” said Ujjain isolation ward nodal officer H.P. Sonaniya.

“It appears to be a case of comorbidity, as the immuno compromised patient contracted the virus easily and died of cardiac arrest. Therefore, the death can be partly attributed to COVID-19.”

Earlier, two patients from Ujjain and Indore each had succumbed to the illness. Madhya Pradesh has recorded 48 cases so far, with Indore, the most populous city in the State, registering 27 cases alone.

250,2020/03/30,Gautam Buddha Nagar DM transferred after requesting for leave,"B.N. Singh’s move was prompted by angry outburst from U.P. CM

Gautam Buddha Nagar District Magistrate B.N. Singh was transferred to Lucknow and attached to the Board of Revenue on Monday after he sought to proceed on three-month leave on a day the number of COVID-19-positive persons in the district touched 38, the highest in Uttar Pradesh. Mr. Singh’s move was prompted by an angry outburst from Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who reprimanded district officials for passing the buck to each other over rising cases in the State.

A leave application he wrote on Monday to Chief Secretary R.K. Tiwari citing “personal reasons” was rejected by the State government, which initiated a departmental inquiry against Mr. Singh and replaced him in Gautam Buddha Nagar with Suhas L.Y., a 2007-batch IAS officer who has served as DM in Prayagraj and Azamgarh.

In the letter, Mr. Singh, who has been in charge of the district for the last three years, said, “In the present scenario when there should be no administrative slackness, I request that some other officer be given the charge.”

Viral video

In a short video that has gone viral, the Chief Minister can be seen telling the officials that due process was not followed in checking the rise in the number of cases that have been linked to the fire security firm whose British auditor allegedly passed on the infection. So far, 23 cases have been found to be linked to the firm.

At one point Mr. Adityanath can be heard shouting, “Apni bakwas band karo (Stop your nonsense).” He said the districts were alerted two months ago but suitable action was not taken to isolate foreign nationals.

Mr. Singh pleaded that he had been working 18 hours a day, but the Chief Minister was apparently in no mood to listen. Sources said Mr. Adityanath also took Chief Medical Officer Anurag Bhargav to task.

Earlier, the Chief Minister visited Greater Noida to take stock of the situation and relief measures in the district. On Tuesday, he is scheduled to visit Ghaziabad.

To check the flow of migrant workers, the Gautam Buddha Nagar administration has decided to turn the Buddha International Circuit on Yamuna Expressway into a shelter home and quarantine facility.

He is unwilling to go inside the vacant rooms of the school to rest. “I want to go to my home in Sitamarhi district as soon as possible and be with my family,” he says. He wants to say more, but is exhausted after his long journey of over 1,000 km from Delhi’s Noida.

For the last five months Balmiki was staying in Sector-12, Noida, where his elder brother Rakesh Kumar works as a tailor. Both the brothers were living in a room they rented for ₹2,000 a month and were earning around ₹15,000 on an average. Their father, Hari Kishore Mahto, is a marginal farmer in Dhanushi village in Sitamarhi district of Bihar. Their youngest brother, Rishi Kumar, stays with father at the village.

When Balmiki, a school dropout, saw people leaving for their home States in hordes in the third week of March, he didn’t understand what was happening. “I didn’t realise the gravity of the situation even when my elder brother told me an unknown virus is killing people and everything is going to be shut soon. I chose to stay back while my brother left with the others,” he says.

Asked to vacate room

When his landlord asked him to vacate the room and it became increasingly difficult to get food, he too decided to leave. “I stuffed some clothes and packed flattened rice and some snacks in my bag and set off on my journey on March 25 with only with ₹1,000 in my pocket,” he says. “I survived on water and the flattened rice for five days.”

How did he find his way on the road? “Using GPS on my mobile,” he says, pulling out a big-screen phone from his pocket. “What option did I have? I walked all day and through the night, only resting briefly by the roadside,” Balmiki says, holding up his worn-out rubber slippers.

When he crossed the Uttar Pradesh border at Kaimur and reached Danapur near Patna early on March 30, the district officials took him to the Patna High School campus — one of the four places in the city where arrangements have been made for food and shelter for migrants.

Robbed on train

K. Raju, 50, was not so lucky. Resting in a corner classroom on the first floor of the school, he says all his belongings, including mobile phone and Aadhaar card, were stolen on the train. “Now I am an identity-less Indian,” he says. He is from Vijaywada in Andhra Pradesh and worked in a hotel in Secunderabad in Telangana. “When the lockdown was declared, everyone was leaving for their homes. I too boarded a train but it brought me to Danapur station near Patna on March 28. From there, some officials dropped me here at the school and now I have no money, no phone, nothing at all to go anywhere or connect with anyone,” he says.

Mr. Raju has an elder brother who is stuck in Mumbai. Clad in a lungi and a half-sleeve shirt, his only belongings are a polythene bag and a towel.

Most of the school’s 30 rooms the district administration has taken under its control are empty. Some local social activists are helping with the food. “Hardly five-six people are staying here. Most of them have left for their villages,” says social activist Raj Shekhar Gupta. A policeman is stationed on the campus and an official maintains a logbook. A large room is cluttered with cooking gas cylinders, beds and cots. Under a tent in one corner, food is being served. “Most of those in the queue are poor people from nearby areas. How can we deny food to anyone in such difficult times,” says Mr. Gupta.

252,2020/03/30,Chandigarh police step in to prevent migration of workers,"Personnel convincing those on the move to return, making arrangements for them in shelters

On his way to Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, after walking from a town in Himachal Pradesh, Lachman Singh — a truck driver — reached Chandigarh on Monday morning where the police stopped him. He along with a few others were asked to go back even as they said that they hardly have any money left.

“They (police) took my details and asked me to return from where I had come. I don’t have any option but to go back. I hardly have any money left. I don’t know how will I return,” said Mr. Singh, who claimed that he was stuck near a village in Himachal Pradesh’s Swarghat town, 78 km from here.

‘No money’

“I had taken my truck to deliver bitumen mixture at a plant near Swarghat from Bathinda. After the lockdown was announced, I couldn’t go anywhere. I had around ₹3,500 with me and almost all of it was spent in my stay over there. I was sleeping in the truck. As I ran out of money, I decided to leave my truck and head to my home town,” he said.

“No one stopped me in Punjab or Himachal... since morning I have just had a cup of tea and biscuit that the police here has offered,” he added.

Pradeep Kumar, an operator at a rice mill based in Mandi Kharar in Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar district, said he wants to reach Moradabad in U.P. He was among those who were stopped by the police at the (Punjab-Chandigarh) border in Sector 48. “They have directed me to go back. I don’t have much money left now. Since, the lockdown, the mill has been shut and workers like me were asked to make travel and food arrangements ourselves. They cleared my dues till the lockdown date,” he said.

Expressing similar sentiments, Rahul and Vishnu, who had been working at a local sweets shop in Kharar in Mohali, said they were headed for Agra but now are going back to the shop owner’s “godown” where they had been staying.

Police step in

Meanwhile, to ensure that migrant labourers do not suffer due to lockdown, the Chandigarh police have been on its toes. The police on Monday shifted 72 migrant labourers, who were about to leave Chandigarh for their native places, to their current place of stay and a few others to a shelter home in Maloya.

Also, a case has been registered under Sections 188, 269, 270 of the IPC at Manimajra against Mahesh Kumar, of Panchkula (Haryana), who forced labourers working in his tavern to leave. Chandigarh police spokesperson Charanjit Singh Virk said the labourers, who were stopped at Sector 48 border, were persuaded by the police to stay at the local shelter, but they opted to go back.

In neighbouring Mohali, at a construction site in the aero city, visibly distressed Shankar Mandal, a daily wager, said he was running out of ration. “I and my brother had come form Bihar’s Araria a few days ago. We earned around ₹400 daily but since the lockdown we haven’t been paid anything by the contractor,” he said.

In Punjab’s Jalandhar cantonment, around 40 people have sought assistance. “We want the government to arrange transport for us to our village in Supaul district in Bihar. Otherwise, arrange food for us,” said Mohammed Sheraj.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/75lsrc/article31212063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE31WORKER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/chandigarh-police-step-in-to-prevent-migration-of-workers/article31212064.ece
253,2020/03/30,"Coronavirus | By walk and wheel, thousands make it to Madhya Pradesh","They endure hunger and cover hundreds of kilometres by foot to reach their hometowns

After enduring hunger for two days, Buddh Singh, a construction worker, set out from Gurugram at 9 p.m. on March 26 on a 580-km journey back to Chhatarpur in Madhya Pradesh, with no transport in sight because of the lockdown.

Carrying two pairs of shirts and pants in a backpack, the 19-year-old, along with three others, walked 204 km through four States. And like them, 34,500 construction and agricultural labourers returned home in the north-western districts of Madhya Pradesh from Haryana, the National Capital Region and Uttar Pradesh, walking and riding on lorries and buses.

Mr. Singh’s group reached Chhatarpur on Sunday midnight after a four-day ordeal. At the outset, they walked from Gurugram to Badshahpur, from where they reached Palwal in Haryana by van. After walking 87 km to Mathura, they got a truck to Agra. A Uttar Pradesh government bus dropped them at the district borders, from where they walked 40 km towards Gwalior, before boarding another truck. Again, they walked 20 km towards Jhansi, boarded a pick-up truck, which broke down within 10 km, and after walking for some more distance, got a bus which left them 20 km from Chhatarpur, where Mr. Singh’s sister lives.

Charitable restaurants and shopkeepers fed biscuits and meals to them and thousands of others returning to Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh on the same route till Agra. “After the lockdown was imposed, the work was suspended, our landlord asked us to leave, the contractor stopped taking calls, and we had to return,” says Mr. Singh, who made ₹300 a day for plastering walls.

“More than 8,000 workers have returned mostly from Uttar Pradesh and the NCR since the beginning of March,” said Himanshu Chandra, CEO, Zilla Panchayat, Chhatarpur. “We are not allowing anyone to leave the district, and have made arrangements for everyone’s food and stay here.”

Gwalior was the main gateway to Madhya Pradesh for those returning from the north as they took the National Highway no. 3 from Agra to Mumbai, explained Madhu Solapurkar, Assistant Director, Public Relations Department, Gwalior district. “At check posts, we are screening workers for illness and giving them food. Most are returning on foot.” Buses sent by various district administrations are bringing them back from Gwalior.

An official of Tikamgarh district, requesting anonymity, said the lockdown had caused panic among workers, making them return in droves unseasonally. “So far 10,000-12,000 of the 15,000 local workers who had gone to other States had returned, with around 2,500 workers entering the district every day,” he said.

In the usual course only a member would return for the ongoing harvest season, not the whole family, as seen during the lockdown, he added “We are pasting quarantine posters outside every worker’s house, and if local officials see them violate prohibitory orders, a case will be registered against them.”

Sealed borders

Since March 18, more than 4,000 workers had returned to Shivpuri district, said H.P. Verma, CEO, Zilla Panchayat, Shivpuri district. “Now, we have sealed borders and will offer food and medical care in quarantine centres to those stuck here from other districts,” he added.

“So far we have screened 10,500 workers who’re put in home isolation,” said Shubham Sharma, Deputy Collector, Bhind district. “And 237 workers from other districts and States were made to stay in isolation centres on Monday.

Mahatma Gandhi Government Hospital’s Principal Medical Officer Arun Gaur said on Monday that 14 coronavirus-infected patients were at present admitted to the hospital’s isolation ward and five of them had tested negative after treatment.

The administration has taken control of several private hospitals and asked hotels and resorts in the city to keep their rooms ready to quarantine patients in case of emergency. District Collector Rajendra Bhatt said the curfew clamped in the municipal limits of Bhilwara on March 20 would be enforced with greater strictness between April 3 and 13, when nobody would be allowed to step out of home and only essential supplies would be allowed to be delivered under the administration’s supervision.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot praised the administration and health officials of Bhilwara for their tireless efforts to control the pandemic. “The massive screening in a short duration and quarantine measures will help save many lives... Much appreciation for the entire team in Bhilwara,” he tweeted.

256,2020/03/30,Coronavirus | Lockdown woes trouble Manipuris at home and away,"Among the stranded people from the State is a group of 35 persons, mostly women, who had gone on a pilgrimage to West Bengal, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, and were caught in U.P. when the lockdown was imposed.

A large number Manipuri students, pilgrims, workers and other travellers are stranded in different parts of the country due to the nationwide lockdown, official reports said on March 30. Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren said that a website had been launched on March 29 to establish contact with them.

Meanwhile, thousands of bags of rice meant for all 16 districts of Manipur could not be unloaded from goods trains at Jiribam in bordering Assam as labourers, stuck in different locations, could not reach Jiribam for unloading the urgently needed supply of rice.

Supply issues

The government has started providing 4 kg of rice through the public distribution system free of cost to every voter. But the scheme has drawn flack as citizens below the age of 18 years are denied access to it. Besides, the government has remained silent over edible oil, vegetables and other kitchen essentials. Some organisations said that the Bharatiya Janata Party was “playing politics” over rice.

Indefinite curfew was relaxed from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Monday though most people were unaware of it. People thronged the three women’s markets in the Imphal city to buy vegetables and other essential items. However, the police soon dispersed them as the crowd became unmanageable.

Police said that some petrol pumps and grocery shops were open in the city. Reports suggested said that a shortage of LPG cylinders was forcing consumers to pay up to ₹2,000 in the black market for them.

In and around Imphal, police are rounding up joyriders violating the curfew and imposing fines.

Quarantine centre

On Monday, Mr. Biren, along with some MLAs and high officials, inspected the under-construction 200-bedded quarantine centre at Imphal west district. The CM said that the centre would be ready in 15 days.

Officials said that apart from launching the website, the government had appointed one nodal officer in Manipur House, Delhi, to look after stranded people from the State. Manipur Houses in Delhi, Kolkata and Guwahati were providing lodging to Manipuri people, including students. Stranded students said they were grateful to the government as they were facing shortage of money. One girl student said, “The government should take up urgent steps to help us reach our homes.”

Among the stranded people from the State is a group of 35 persons, mostly women, who had gone on a pilgrimage to West Bengal, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh, and were caught in U.P. when the lockdown was imposed. One of the women was widowed while they were at Radhakunda. The group said they were facing problems since they had no money for food. One woman said, “Officials in U.P. had promised us assistance, but we are yet to get any help.”

Testing needed

T. Bhimo, Director, J.N. Institute of Medical Sciences, Imphal, said, “We have tested samples of 65 persons, including 11 from Nagaland and some family members of a COVID-19 affected girl. Except for a 23-year-old girl student from London, all others tested negative. The girl’s condition is also improving and, hopefully, we may send her home shortly.”

Meanwhile, the tribal community of Motha village located along the Manipur-Myanmar border are in the grip of fear of contracting COVID-19. Village elders said that one girl from the village is studying in Yangon, Myanmar. She returned to the village on March 10 despite instructions not to do so. Village elders said that they had informed the medical officers at Moreh, the border town. “However, till date, no medical officer has come to test her,” one worried villager said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2cb9hf/article31207808.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MANIPURCORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-lockdown-woes-trouble-manipuris-at-home-and-away/article31207809.ece

258,2020/03/30,28 stranded on bridge to Myanmar brought back to Mizoram,"The Mizos, including 11 children, who had gone to Myanmar to visit relatives, have been quarantined

Stranded in no man’s land on a Bailey bridge between India and Myanmar for two nights, 28 inhabitants of Mizoram were brought back on Sunday night and quarantined.

The 50-foot bridge on the Tiau river connects Zokhawthar in Mizoram’s Champhai district and Rih in Myanmar.

In August 2018, India opened a land immigration checkpost at Zokhawthar, the State’s second such facility along the border with Myanmar after Zorinpui in Lawngtlai district.

The 28 Mizos, including 11 children, had gone to Myanmar to visit relatives much before the border was sealed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent countrywide lockdown for 21 days.

“Until the sealing, both countries were allowing border residents to travel to each other’s territory up to 16 km due because of a free movement agreement. These Mizo villagers were not aware of the lockdown and when they arrived at the border, the Myanmar sentries put them on the bridge and locked their end,” said T.J. Lalnuntluanga, Mizoram’s Minister of State for Transport, Law, Parliamentary Affairs Department and Environment, Forest and Climate Change.

“But the Assam Rifles personnel manning the border locked the Indian end of the gate too, forcing the men, women and children to spend two nights on the bridge with no food, shelter and toilet,” Mr Lalnuntluanga told The Hindu from Aizawl.

Zokhawthar falls within the Champhai South Assembly constituency that he represents.

Local officials and members of the Young Mizo Association (YMA) tried to get the stranded people released but Assam Rifles officials said the gate could be opened only after instructions from the appropriate authority.

CM’s intervention

Chief Minister Zoramthanga and Home Minister Lalchamliana intervened and let the Ministry of Home Affairs know “bringing the Mizo villagers was as important as flying resourceful Indians in from foreign lands”.

The communication to the Assam Rifles took time. The stranded 28 were released at 6 p.m. on Sunday and taken to a facility at the Champhai Deputy Commissioner’s office where they have been quarantined.

“What happened to those people was inhuman. It seemed they were put in an open-air jail for no fault of theirs. Members of the Zokhawthar Task Force and YMA provided them food while they were caught in no man’s land,” local village council president Muani said.

The YMA also provided tarpaulin and other tent materials while they were on the bridge, officials said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/g6o3uy/article31207184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200330-WA0015-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/28-stranded-on-bridge-to-myanmar-brought-back-to-mizoram/article31207185.ece

The situation became tense in Ganesh Nagar and Tirupati Nagar localities late on Sunday after nearly 500 migrant workers residing there came on to the roads, Deputy Commissioner of Police Vidhi Chaudhari said.

Surat’s Pandesara area, where both localities are situated, is a hub of migrant workers, mostly from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, who work in powerlooms and textile processing units and factories.

According to police officials, when hundreds of people gathered, cops on duty tried to prevent them and asked them to stay indoors.

However, they started hurling stones on the security personnel, resulting in damage to police vehicles.

A man from Indore and one from Ujjain were confirmed dead on Monday owing to COVID-19 in Madhya Pradesh, taking the death toll owing to the illness to four in the State.

While the man from Indore died at 3 a.m. on Monday, the Ujjain resident died on March 27, but his sample tested positive for the disease on Monday.

“A 41-year-old man from Indore has died,” confirmed Dr. Rahul Rokde of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Indore. He was first admitted to a private hospital on March 23, his sample tested positive on March 26, and he was admitted to the government-run MRTB hospital on Saturday at 9 p.m.. “The patient didn’t have a travel or contact history,” Dr. Rokde confirmed.

The 38-year-old man from Ujjain, who died on March 27 while undergoing treatment for chest pain at a hospital, tested positive for COVID-19.

“He came with chest pain to hospital and was admitted. Soon he died. We had taken a sample during his treatment,” said Dr. A.G. Sinha, Chief Medical Health Officer, Ujjain.

After the patient was admitted at 7.50 p.m., doctors had sent swab samples to the college, which tested them positive at Monday noon. The patient died at 9 p.m..

“The patient was obese and asthmatic and had hypertension too,” said Ujjain isolation ward nodal officer Dr. H.P. Sonaniya. “It appears to be a case of comorbidity, as the immunocompromised patient contracted the virus easily and died of cardiac arrest. Therefore, the death can be partly attributed to COVID-19”

The patient, who was admitted to the hospital on March 22 after testing positive, had a medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure, according to Pune Divisional Commissioner Dr. Deepak Mhaisekar.

Dr. Mhaisekar, however, said it was not yet clear from whom the patient had contracted the virus.

With five fresh cases being reported from Pune, the total number of COVID-19 positive cases recorded in the district stands at 43. Of these, 15 patients — seven in Pune and eight in Pimpri-Chinchwad — have been discharged in recent weeks, said officials.

Dr. Mhaisekar said that till now, 72 people in Pune division have tested positive for COVID-19, with 43 cases in Pune district, 25 in Sangli and two each in Kolhapur and Satara districts.

Mayor’s call

“While the 30-odd COVID-19 positive patients undergoing treatment at Naidu Infectious Disease Hospital, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and other medical establishments in the district are stable, one patient unfortunately passed away today. This should impress upon Punekars to rigidly adhere to the lockdown rules and not take this epidemic lightly,” Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol said.

Maharashtra witnessed more COVID-19 positive cases as the number went up by 17 on Monday to take the State’s tally to 220, with fresh cases being reported from Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Kolhapur and the first positive case reported from Nashik.

Of these, Pune recorded five new cases, while eight more were reported from Mumbai, two from Nagpur, one from Kolhapur, and one from Niphad tehsil in Nashik, which had hitherto remained unscathed from the coronavirus outbreak.

2 from slum clusters

The authorities are worried that of the new cases recorded, two were residents of slum clusters. They had apparently come into contact with two other previously diagnosed COVID-19 patients who had returned from abroad.

“Despite the first death recorded in the district, the situation is under control and the authorities are successfully carrying out the arduous task of contact tracing. However, I urge all residents of the city to maintain self-discipline during the lockdown period and avoid straying out needlessly,” Mr. Mohol said.

Meanwhile, to preclude citizens from violating the lockdown, Pune Commissioner of Police Dr. K. Venkatesham said that vehicles of those found flouting orders would be seized by the authorities. “Vehicles will not get petrol as per order. Some vehicles already seized. Some violating petrol bunks will be closed. Stay home.

263,2020/03/30,"Coronavirus: In Bareilly, migrants returning home sprayed with 'disinfectant'","It's more important to save them...getting wet does not mean much, says nodal officer in-charge of COVID-19 in Bareilly

Migrant labourers returning to their homes from cities were forced by the administration in Bareilly to take an open bath in groups with disinfectant before they were allowed entry into the district.

As per a footage of the incident, a group of migrants, including women, were seen squatting on the road near a checkpoint in Bareilly as officials in full protection gear spray a solution through a hose pipe on them. The migrants are not only clothed but also have their luggage strapped onto their bodies even as they get drenched. While at least two officials film the incident, one of them can be heard asking the migrants to keep their eyes closed.

The nodal officer in-charge of COVID-19 in Bareilly, Ashok Gautam, confirmed that the administration did bathe the migrants with disinfectant, chlorine mixed with water, but clarified it was not a chemical solution.

Mr. Gautam said the administration had resorted to spraying the migrants with the disinfectants after the huge rush of incoming migrants who arrived in special buses run by the government. “We tried to keep them safe, asked them to shut their eyes,” he said.

Mr. Gautam also justified the step, saying it was necessary to eradicate the possible spread of the disease.

“It's natural they will get wet. It was out attempt to get the clothes wet as it would be better so that whatever signs of virus possibly on it (clothes) will get destroyed,” Mr. Gautam told The Hindu.

“It's more important to save them...getting wet does not mean much,” he said.

The official also said the bathing of migrants would not happen again as their rush into the district had stopped.

Ashutosh Parashari, Medical Officer, Bareilly, said sodium hypochlorite solution was sprayed on the migrants. Sodium hypochlorite is commonly used as a disinfectant. ""It does not have such hazards...that's why it was used,"" he said.

Sodium hypochlorite used on migrants?

Chief Fire Officer, Chandra Mohan Sharma, said sodium hypochlorite was used to sanitize places in the districts, including the bus stand where the migrants were given a bathe. The bus station was sanitized because it had seen big crowds of migrants over the past two-three days, said the official, while admitting that the sodium hypochlorite was harmful for human bodies.

""Because it has chemicals, it is strictly prohibited to spray on human bodies. We have directions to spray it on non-living things like metal surfaces, cardboards and closed walls,"" he said when asked by reporters if the solution could be sprayed on the humans.



""The chemical is hazardous. It has its own properties, naturally it can cause harm but until it comes in direct contact with human ears or eyes,"" he said.



Mr. Sharma said he was probing the incident but claimed prima facie that the chemical was not used on the migrants, even as footage showed that the migrants were made to squat and instructed to close their eyes before being sprayed with the disinfectant.

The migrants may have inadvertently exposed to the fog of the chemical but didn't come in direct contact, he said, adding that the migrants may have reached the fogging site while they were waiting for a bus or moving past it.

District Magistrate orders action against officials

District Magistrate Bareilly, Nitish Kumar, has ordered action against officials who forced migrants to take bath in the open.

Mr. Kumar said ""over active"" Bareilly municipal corporation and fire brigade teams who were instructed to sanitize the buses ended up doing this.

The affected people are being treated under the direction of the chief medical officer, said the DM. The CMO did not take phone calls.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rp9ck9/article31204429.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/barielly,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-in-bareilly-migrants-forced-to-take-bath-in-the-open-with-sanitiser/article31204430.ece
264,2020/03/30,Senior citizen dies of pneumonia in Kolhapur,"Swab sample sent to check for COVID-19

A senior citizen undergoing treatment at Kolhapur’s Chhatrapati Pramila Raje (CPR) Hospital died of pneumonia on Monday morning.

As a precautionary measure, hospital authorities have sent the swab sample of the deceased to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune to check whether the deceased was afflicted with coronavirus.

According to authorities, the patient, aged 75, was diabetic and was admitted to the CPR Hospital on Sunday. He passed away sometime around 8:30 a.m.

“The patient had no travel history to a foreign country or of recent domestic travel nor, as far as can be judged, had come into contact with any person who has tested positive for COVID-19. Yet, as a precautionary measure and as per protocol, we have sent his swab samples to the NIV for testing. The results are awaited,” said District Civil Surgeon B.C. Kempi- Patil.

Kolhapur district has recorded three positive cases till now.

It recorded its first case on March 26 after a girl residing in the district’s Peth Vadgaon area had come into contact with a family from Islampur in neighbouring Sangli district. As many as 24 members of this family have tested positive thus far.

Almost immediately, it recorded its second case after a 37-year-old man residing in Kolhapur’s Mangalwar Peth area tested positive. The man had just returned from Pune, one of the virus hubs in the State.

On Sunday night, the test samples of a female kin of this man returned positive as well, taking the total district tally of COVID-19 positive cases to three. However, the samples of other four close kin have returned negative.

In all, the samples of 31 other COVID-19 suspects that were sent along with those of the woman and her close kin, have returned negative, said authorities.

“As a precautionary measure, all four close kin, whose samples tested negative, have nevertheless been placed in institutional quarantine facilities,” said a district official.

Last week, District Guardian Minister Satej Patil that the administration was keeping a close vigil on more than 40,000 persons who had returned to the district after travelling to Pune and Mumbai – hotspots of the virus.

The administration has tightened its vigil, clamping down on residents seen flouting lockdown orders. The Kolhapur police have confiscated around 400 private vehicles since the announcement of the lockdown and have said that they would be returned to their owners only after April 15.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/senior-citizen-dies-of-pneumonia-in-kolhapur/article31204297.ece

Maharashtra recorded 12 COVID-19 positive cases on Monday to take the State’s tally to 215, with fresh cases being reported from Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur, Kolhapur and the first positive case reported from Nashik in north Maharashtra.

While Pune district recorded five new cases, three more were reported from Mumbai, two from Nagpur, one more from Kolhapur and one from Nashik’s Niphad , which had hitherto remained unaffected.

“One youth in his early 30s has tested positive. He is from Lasalgaon in Niphad Taluk. While we had sent 73 samples for testing at Pune’s National Institute of Virology (NIV) from the district, 72 had returned negative and his was the only one to test positive. So, I again urge all citizens to remain indoors and to prevent any community outbreak of the virus,” said Nashik District Collector Suraj Mandhare.

According to sources, the Niphad youth who tested positive did not have any history of foreign travel.

With five fresh cases being reported from Pune, the total number of COVID-19 positive cases in the district has now risen to 42.

So far, 38 persons across the State have recovered from the virus and have been discharged from hospitals where they had been kept in isolation.

Authorities, however, have expressed fears of a further rise in the number of cases in Sangli district, where four members of a family in Islampur tehsil, who had returned from Saudi Arabia, have infected several others in turn – making it possibly the biggest case of cluster infection in Maharashtra.

Till date, a total 25 persons, of whom 24 are members of the Islampur family, have tested positive.

A total lockdown has been imposed in Islampur tehsil since Sunday and the town sealed-off for a radius 3.5 km from the residence of the persons diagnosed with the virus.

The Centre suspended two Delhi government officers and served show cause notice to two others for dereliction of duty as they “failed to ensure public health and safety” during the lockdown restrictions to combat COVID-19.

Three of them were senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers and the fourth one is from Delhi, Andaman and Nicobar Islands Service (DANICS).

The National Executive Committee formed under Disaster Management Act, 2005, found that the “officers, who were responsible to ensure strict compliance” to the instructions issued by Committee regarding containment of spread of COVID-19, “have prima facie failed to do so.” Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla chaired the committee meeting.

“These officers have failed to ensure public health and safety during the lockdown restrictions to combat COVID-19. Due to the serious lapse in performance of their duties, the competent authority has initiated disciplinary proceedings against them,” a press note issued by the Government said.

269,2020/03/30,"Coronavirus | Despite pandemic, Braille printing press in Berhampur busy with work","Efforts are on to provide Braille textbooks to visually challenged Class XI students in the coming academic year.

While COVID-19 has hit education around the world, Odisha’s only Braille printing press in Berhampur is busy in its efforts to provide Braille textbooks to visually challenged Class XI students in the coming academic year.

Printing of Braille textbooks for +2 or higher secondary course has been taken up for the first time in the State. It was, till now, only printing textbooks up to Class X. Braille textbooks are not available for visually impaired higher secondary students in Odisha.

So, the ‘Red Cross Computerised Braille Braille Press’ in Berhampur had decided to start printing textbooks for Class XI in 2020 and to add up Braille books for XII the next year.

Most visually impaired students in Odisha, after passing Class X, prefer admission to the Arts stream for higher secondary education. These students had to depend on others to read out textbooks to them, and on Braille notes made by their seniors. “There were requests from different parts of the State for Braille textbooks of higher secondary classes of Arts stream. So, the Braille press decided to print books of Class XI Arts course first,” said manager, Prakash Narayan Rath.

Data entry work

Despite the lockdown, data entry work for these textbooks in Braille form is continuing. Mr. Rath and a Braille data entry operator, Chimayee Rath, are now busy transforming the +2 first year or Class XI textbooks into Braille format on computers. “We plan to print and provide Braille textbooks of Odia, English, political science, economics and history subjects by the start of next academic session” said Mr. Rath.

Braille data entry of Odia, English, history, political science textbooks is complete. Work is on to get textbooks of economics and history converted into Braille format.

Funds sought

These books are to be distributed free to students. So, the Braille press authorities have requested the Director-cum-Special Secretary of Social Security and Empowerment of Persons with Disability (SSEPD) to provide funds for printing and free distribution of text books.

A new, faster Braille master platemaker, imported from Germany at a cost of ₹1.12 crore and installed at this press in November 2019, will enable easy and fast printing. During its inauguration, Odisha Minister for SSEPD department Ashok Chandra Panda had promised for printing of higher secondary textbooks in Braille for free distribution.

Also, this press has formatted ‘Galpa Swalpa’, authored by great Odia writer Fakir Mohan Senapati, into Braille form. It will be the first Odia short story collection in Braille format.

This Braille press was established in Berhampur in 1986 by the Red Cross Society, with a printing unit procured from a West German firm. In 2013, two new, modern computerised Braille printing units were imported from Belgium for modernisation.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/suntzs/article31201645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRAILLE4-30march,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-despite-pandemic-braille-printing-press-in-berhampur-busy-with-work/article31201644.ece

273,2020/03/30,Coronavirus | Goa sees two more positive cases,"Tally at five; samples of senior citizen who died in quarantine facility test negative

Two more people tested positive for COVID-19 in Goa on Sunday, taking the number of cases in the State to five.

Officials, however, clarified that medical reports of a 68-year-old woman, who died at a government quarantine facility earlier in the day, said she had tested negative for the virus. The woman, who was suffering from respiratory distress and had been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), had been quarantined due to her symptoms. She died at 3 a.m.

Of the two new positive patients, one had arrived in Mumbai from the Bahamas via New York and then flown to Goa. The other person is the brother of one of the three who had tested positive earlier this week and had already been in isolation. All five were said to be in a stable condition.

Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said the government is increasing the number of isolation beds in the State. “Over 700 people are in different stages of quarantine and isolation in Goa … The new district hospital in Margao will be a quarantine facility. Besides, another private hospital is being requisitioned as a COVID hospital,” he said.

The CM said that though India has entered the third stage of the pandemic, Goa would be a safe zone if no more cases are reported till April 14. “This is possible only provided those who suspect symptoms come forward for quarantine, maintain social distancing and stay at home. With the borders sealed, no more outsiders can enter Goa,” he said.

Dr. Sawant said the government has ordered 100 new ventilators and is looking at requisitioning more from private hospitals.

Health Minister Viswajit Rane said a private hotel in Panaji and the Goa International Centre have been kept ready as quarantine facilities. The government is also looking to turn six hotels into isolation centres.

On making essential supplies available to the people, Dr. Sawant said there were issues with wholesalers. “If wholesalers do not open their godowns for supplies, the government will act against them. Some people are also selling commodities at a higher price. Action will be taken against them,” the Chief Minister said.

He said online food supply aggregators and pizza delivery outlets have been allowed to continue their services so that people can order food.

Dr. Sawant said the State-run transport undertaking, Kadamba Transport Corporation, has started a food bus to ensure that daily wage labourers do not go hungry. The government has also made food and water available to daily wage workers from other States at sports grounds in Peddem in North Goa and Navelim in South Goa.

274,2020/03/30,Blood stocks in Maharashtra will last for just 10 days,"Government calls for mini blood donation camps in a staggered manner

With blood banks in Mumbai running low on stocks, the Lalbaugcha Raja Mandal organised a blood donation camp.

In doing so, the Mandal adhered to the norms of the lockdown. In a large hall, cots were placed at a considerable distance, appeals were sent through social media, and donors were given time slots to avoid crowding. Text messages confirming appointments were sent so that policemen did not stop them mid-way.

Since March 23, the Mandal has collected 1,100 units of blood, which has been supplied to KEM, Sion, Nair, J.J and Cama Hospitals.

As the lockdown continues, the State Blood Transfusion Council (SBTC) has appealed to blood banks, NGOs, housing societies and other organisations to hold mini blood donation camps in a staggered manner to avoid a shortage in the time of COVID-19 outbreak.

“Due to the COVID-19 scare and the lockdown that followed, almost all blood donation camps were cancelled over the past two weeks. But after the appeal by Health Minister Rajesh Tope, some camps were organised,” said an SBTC official.

There is no shortage at the moment, the official said. Mumbai, for example, had stocks that would suffice for eight to 10 days. “We need to plan to that blood banks don’t go dry after that,” he said.

As soon as Mr. Tope sent out an appeal, and the Lalbaugcha Raja Mandal planned the camp. While the camp will conclude on April 1, Prabhadevi’s Siddhivinayak Temple will start its camp on the same day. “Between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., we have managed to get 150 to 200 donors daily. The numbers are small but we wanted to keep it that way to ensure social distancing as well as the necessary hygiene measures,” said Lalbaucha Raja Mandal’s president, Sudhir Salvi.

The State’s daily requirement is about 4,500 to 5,000 blood units while Mumbai requires an average of 1,000 units. “However, the requirement is currently low as many elective surgeries have been postponed and there are not as many accidents because of the lockdown,” said Vinay Shetty from the NGO Think Foundation.

Nevertheless, there are patients with thalassemia or cancer who are dependent on blood transfusions. Emergency surgeries and deliveries too require blood. “We are looking at how to transfer blood from a bank that has units to the bank that has run out of units. We have some camps lined up,” said Mr Shetty.

Another challenge is to assure donors that they are not at the risk of contracting COVID-19 by donating blood, say experts. Dr. Snehal Majumdar, nodal officer of the Pune’s Ruby Hall Clinic’s A.H. Wadia Trust Blood Bank, told The Hindu they had adequate reserves at the moment, but the situation could worsen if the lockdown extended beyond April and no blood donation camps were held.

“As elective surgeries have been put on hold, the immediate demand for blood is less. But then, blood is always required in cases of deliveries, thalassemia, and heart surgeries. Cancer patients have to keep their chemotherapy cycles going as per schedule,” Dr. Majumdar said. The blood bank at Ruby Hall Clinic had an average stock of 900 to 1,000 units, she said.

She also said social distancing measures were being strictly enforced and that the hospital was being stringent about the choice of donors in the wake of the COVID-19 scare.

“We make sure that only five donors are present at a time and a gap of one metre is maintained between them. A strict procedure of history-taking of the donors as per a questionnaire sent to all blood banks by the Indian Society of Blood Transfusion and Immunohaematology is being followed. This questionnaire checks whether the donors have had fever or cough in the past 28 days,” Dr. Majumdar said.

Pune has nearly 30 blood banks and the authorities said they currently have adequate stocks. “We have a stock of 1,000 blood bags which will mainly be required for open heart or cancer surgeries. While this is sufficient at the moment, we will be arranging for fresh donations in the near future,” said a senior official at BJ Medical College.

In districts like Sangli and Kolhapur, with private hospitals virtually shut or operating at 30% of their capacities, blood bank managers say the problem is not so much of shortage as of ‘rationalising’ the available stock in order to avoid wastage.

There are 16 blood banks between Sangli and Miraj tehsils in Sangli district, said Ujjwal Tilve, who manages Dr. Shirgaonkar Blood Bank in the district. “Typically, April, May and June witness high demand of blood given that more people travel during this period and a higher proportion of accidents are seen at this time.”

Sangli and Kolhapur have enough stocks to tide over this period, he said. While the demand had reduced, the problem was about keeping just the right stock of fresh blood so as to preclude any wastage in the near future.

“Platelet blood has a shelf-life of five days while whole blood and red blood cells have a 35-day expiry period. In the event, we stock up more blood anticipating a shortage owing to an extension of the lockdown. There is a risk that this blood may not be used in the future as hospitals demand ‘fresh blood’,” he said.

His blood bank maintained a list of regular donors and that they could call them at a short notice if there is a need, he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/b35mt4/article31201684.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BMBlood-Donationcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/blood-stocks-in-maharashtra-will-last-for-just-10-days/article31201671.ece
275,2020/03/30,Coronavirus | Women warriors join battle against virus in Kashmir,"Fashion designers in J&K volunteer to tide over shortage of masks, protective gear

The battle against COVID-19 gets women ‘warriors’ in Kashmir. Fashion designers, small-time tailors and students volunteer to tide over the shortage of masks, body-bags and personal protective equipment vital for the front-line health workers.

Sadia Mufti, 28, is a popular fashion designer and owner of Hangers, a boutique in Srinagar. This time, it’s not kurtis or khaftan she has innovated upon, but personal protective equipment. “We presented samples of personal protective equipment to experts in Kashmir Valley hospitals, and they have been approved for mass production. Our triple-layered masks have already been approved,” Ms. Mufti told The Hindu.

Her personal protective equipment is different from the routine supply. “It has a boot and a hood, which covers the face except the eyes, in one piece. The stitch is in such a way that it is easy for medicos to put it on.”

She said she wanted to be productive in this time of crisis. “I am fortunate enough to have the resources,” she said, getting ready to stitch over 2,000 pieces in the coming days.

Scores of women tailors have volunteered across the Valley to help in the mass production of triple-layered masks.

Around 60% of the 270 skilled and semi-skilled professionals engaged by Ehsaas International, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), are women. “Besides 500 pieces of personal protective equipment, 3,000 triple-layered masks are supplied on a daily basis to the District Disaster Management Authority, Srinagar,” said a volunteer of the NGO.

Ehsaas International and J&K Skill Development Mission Society have pooled manpower and trained certified professionals to develop health safety gears from a locally procured non-woven polypropylene material. “With their help, we have started making face shields, a substitute for goggles used as a part of personal protective equipment kit,” said Hakim Mohammad Ilyas, general secretary of Ehsaas International.

276,2020/03/30,Van Gogh painting stolen in overnight raid,"Thieves smashed a glass door to get into the museum in the Netherlands

A painting by Dutch master Vincent van Gogh was stolen in an overnight smash-and-grab raid on a museum that was closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), police and the museum said on Monday.

The painting has an estimated value of between €1 million to €6 million.

The Singer Laren Museum, based at Laren in the Netherlands, said that The Parsonage Garden at Nuenen in Spring 1884 by the Dutch master was stolen in the early hours of Monday.

By early afternoon, all that could be seen from the outside of the museum was a large white panel covering a door in the building’s glass facade.

Museum General Director Evert van Os said the institution that houses the collection of American couple William and Anna Singer is “angry, shocked, sad” at the theft of the painting. The value of the work, which was on loan from the Groninger Museum in the northern Dutch city of Groningen, was not immediately known. Police are investigating the theft.

“I’m shocked and unbelievably annoyed that this has happened,” said Singer Laren museum director Jan Rudolph de Lorm. “This beautiful and moving painting by one of our greatest artists stolen - removed from the community,” he added.

“It is very bad for the Groninger Museum, it is very bad for the Singer, but it is terrible for us all because art exists to be seen and shared by us, the community, to enjoy to draw inspiration from and to draw comfort from, especially in these difficult times.”

Police said in a statement that the thief or thieves smashed a glass door to get into the museum. That set off an alarm that sent officers rushing to the museum but by the time they got there the painting and whoever stole it was gone.

A team including forensics and art theft experts was studying video footage and questioning neighbours.

Before the closure, the museum was hosting an exhibition titled Mirror of the Soul” with works by artists ranging from Jan Toorop to Piet Mondrian, in cooperation with Amsterdam’s Rijksmuseum.

The Singer Laren’s collection has a focus on modernism such as neo-impressionism, pointillism, expressionism and cubism.

It is not the first high profile theft from the museum. In 2007, thieves stole seven works from its sculpture garden, including a bronze cast of The Thinker by Auguste Rodin. The famous sculpture was recovered a few days later, missing a leg.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/abjgun/article31211063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31TH-SPRING,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/van-gogh-painting-stolen-in-overnight-raid/article31211064.ece
277,2020/03/30,Batting drills and family bonding — the Jemimah way!,"‘I do workouts given to us by the trainers. That’s how I manage my time and keep myself busy’

These days Jemimah Rodrigues has a fixed routine. She wakes up, finishes her prayers, enjoys some home-made breakfast, watches films and then starts training under the watchful eyes of her father and coach Ivan Rodrigues.

As the country witnesses a 21-day lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, there is no way one can step out of home. “I have scheduled practice time — I do drills and knocking at home with dad. I do some batting drills and knocking at around 4.30 p.m. At 6.30 p.m, I do workouts given to us by the trainers. That’s how I manage my time and keep myself busy,” Jemimah told Sportstar.

Playing ludo

However, it’s not all work and no fun for the 20-year-old! Now, Jemimah said, “I play ludo with my brothers (Enoch and Eli). It’s a tough competition,” she said jokingly.

Jemimah loves watching films -- a habit she has developed recently. “I actually don’t watch a lot of movies because I hardly get time. I am not a movie fan or TV series fan. I have started watching quite a few movies and TV series,” she said with a smiling.

These are challenging times. Had it not been for the Covid-19, India’s senior players would have now been busy with the Challengers Trophy. But with all cricketing activities coming to a standstill, there’s not much to look forward to.

Jemimah has a message for her fans: “It’s a difficult time for all of us. Nobody likes to be at home, there could be so many negatives in the situation. But we need to look out for the positives. You can make the most of it. You can work on yourself, just sit back and get your thoughts together.”

She also believes that such ‘breaks’ are actually an opportunity to strengthen the family bonding.

“Spend quality time with your family, that way you can develop the relationships. And also, follow the government’s guidelines because that’s for our welfare. They care for us, that’s why they are doing so much,” she said.

“It’s like a cricket match, you can’t win a game just by one person playing. You need all the eleven guys to contribute to win the game. It’s the same case here.

“ If all of us contribute to this initiative, we can definitely beat the virus and can save many lives.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/uc8l55/article31211132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30JEMIMAH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/batting-drills-and-family-bonding-the-jemimah-way/article31211133.ece
278,2020/03/30,Sachin my pick to bat in any condition: Warne,"Backs Lara to chase down huge targets on the last day

Spin great Shane Warne on Monday picked his fierce rival Sachin Tendulkar as the batsman to bat in any conditions and called his former skipper Steve Waugh a match saver rather than a match-winner.

One of the greatest spinners to have played the game, Warne was engaged in an Instagram live session with his fans.

When the discussion turned to the best batsman in his time, the 50-year-old Warne said, “If I have to choose any batsman to bat in any conditions, it is a real toss-up between Tendulkar and Lara, but I would just choose Tendulkar.

“If we have to chase 400 runs on the last day, I would definitely pick Lara,” added the leg-spinner who ended his illustrious career with over 700 Test wickets.

Daylight

“There were these two guys, then there was daylight and after that, the rest of the batsmen came.”

Tendulkar played a world record 200 Tests and amassed 15,921 runs with an average 53.78 while in 463 ODIs, he tallied 18,426 runs at 44.83. Lara played 131 Tests and scored 11,953 runs at 52.88. In 299 ODIs he accumulated 10,405 runs.

When asked about his former captain Waugh, who is known for his solid temperament and dogged approach to batting, Warne said he was someone who could bail the team out of a precarious situation.

“Steve was more of a match saver than a match-winner,” Warner said about Waugh whom he included in his all-time Australian Test XI to be led by Allan Border.

Waugh played 168 Tests for Australia in which he scored 10927 runs, including 32 centuries and 50 fifties.

Warner misses out

About his team, Warne said: “I am only picking players that I played with, that is why David Warner is not going to be a part of the side, he is one of the greatest Australian openers.”

Warne’s team comprised Matthew Hayden and Michael Slater as openers, followed by Ricky Ponting, Mark Waugh, Border and Steve. He chose Adam Gilchrist as the wicketkeeper with Glenn McGrath, Jason Gillespie and Bruce Reid as the fast bowlers and Tim May as the spinner.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gk552e/article31210959.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31WARNE,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/sachin-my-pick-to-bat-in-any-condition-warne/article31210960.ece
279,2020/03/30,Umpire Anil Chaudhary rediscovers farming skills during the lockdown,"Forced to stay back in his village, umpire rediscovers farming skills

Cricket took him away from Dangarol, a village in District Shamli. The lockdown has now transported him back to his childhood days when he would spend time in the sugarcane fields owned by his family.

“The India-South Africa series ended abruptly (on March 13) and I came to the village on the 16th to fetch grains and jaggery. I brought my sons (Aryan and Akshat) along, leaving my wife (Meeta) and mother (Kamla) back in Delhi. Then the lockdown happened. We decided to stay put in the village,” ICC panel umpire Anil Chaudhary told The Hindu.

In the village, Chaudhary has used the “opportunity” to rediscover his farming skills. “We are farmers. I used to stay in this village till the X standard and help in the fields. I found the labourers here had left. So I plunged into ploughing the fields (sugarcane and wheat).People are allowed to work in the fields or go to the nearby town to get essentials for three hours beginning 6 a.m.,” he said.

Umpire Anil Chaudhary.

Teaching others

Chaudhary has taken the opportunity to educate people around him. “I told them the importance of social distancing and regular washing of hands. Soap is now kept at every tubewell. Earlier they would wash their hands and feet with mud. Now they have started using soap. I have distributed masks too and told them not to gather to gossip or play cards. I am happy that they listen to me. There is no gathering of people anymore in Dangarol. We also never had this culture of shaking hands and greet each other with a `Ram, Ram,"" he said.

On the experience of staying in the village, Chaudhary said, “I have been enjoying working in the fields. Feels like my childhood days have returned. Every morning I drive the tractor for three hours, but it can be tiring. I have discovered new muscles in the body (laughs).”

Chaudhary recalled his younger days. “My family has always been in the village. Some of my uncles and cousins graduated in agriculture and stayed on. (Brother) Harendra and I would spend months in the village. Cricket took us away from the village where bonding among people is amazing. I have never spent so much time at a stretch with my sons,” he said.

Umpire Anil Chaudhary.

The daily routine is well set. “We go around the fields in the morning. Not in groups. We distribute the work. Eat early and sleep early. By 9 p.m. you are asleep. A melodious aarti from a nearby temple wakes us at 5 in the morning. Villagers are basically nice, gentle, selfless people. I have learned so much during this lockdown.”

A couple of 80-year-olds in the village, revealed Chaudhary, talk of this “unprecedented development"".

Bit of advice

""But they insist 'we shall overcome. It is a test of our will power'. Follow guidelines, accept the gravity of the situation,"" is the advice from the 55-year-old, who sometimes has to climb trees to catch the internet signal in his village.

“I miss my cricket, the packed stadiums, the travelling, the challenges of umpiring, but there is life outside cricket, too. It’s great fun here in the village. The sky is clear – blue during the day and star-lit at night. No man to be seen for miles. Nature has shown mankind its place. Even if forced to stay indoors, I have learnt new ways to live life,” he signed off.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/liqsf2/article31211947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31ANIL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/umpire-anil-chaudhary-during-the-lockdown-at-home-in-the-field/article31208397.ece
280,2020/03/30,BCCI may incur huge losses: Shivlal,"“It is a very sad situation now. The impact will be very severe and the BCCI may incur huge losses because it will take a long time for the economy to get back on the rails,” former India off-spinner and ex-president of BCCI tells The Hindu.

Former India off-spinner and ex-president of BCCI N. Shivlal Yadav, felt testing times are ahead for the governing bodies of sports across the world even after the Coronavirus pandemic comes to an end.

“It is a very sad situation now. The impact will be very severe and the BCCI may incur huge losses because it will take a long time for the economy to get back on the rails,” Shivlal said in an exclusive chat with The Hindu on Monday.

Sponsors won’t desert

“I won’t say the sponsors will desert the BCCI completely but they would be hard-pressed to invest with the same kind of enthusiasm as they have done in the past,” he said.

“But this is no fault of the BCCI or any other sports federation. This is a situation no one expected,” he added.

“There is nothing that can be done now. One has to do abide the government’s guidelines during this lockdown and hope and pray for the best,” said Shivlal.

“The bigger concern is the kind of impact the lockdown would have across different sectors once the situation eases,” he said.

Going down memory lane, he recalled the tied Test in 1986 in Chennai as his one of his greatest experiences.

No regrets in getting out

“I have no regrets in getting out (9/344 and then Maninder Singh was the last man out at 347 with Ravi Shastri unbeaten on 48 and the scores tied) in those tense, final moments. We were all so tensed up there was no time to react.

“Yes, captain Kapil (Dev) was certainly annoyed with my dismissal but didn’t say anything to me,” he remembered.

Another memorable moment

“The other memorable moment was when I was the non-striker when the great G.R. Visvanath scored a match-winning century in the 1981 Melbourne Test. He was a genius and a joy to watch,” said Shivlal.

The 1987 Test against Pakistan in Bengaluru happened to be Shivlal’s last one. That was also Sunil Gavaskar’s farewell game.

“It was a close match which we lost. Despite Maninder Singh’s great spells we couldn’t recover.

“We must agree that Pakistani spinners Iqbal Qasim and Tauseef Ahmed bowled better,” he said.

“Sunil’s knock in that innings was a masterclass in the art of playing spin under the most testing conditions where the ball was turning square, literally,” Shivlal concluded.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/doog2u/article31211331.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31SHIV,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bcci-may-incur-huge-losses-shivlal/article31208149.ece

285,2020/03/30,Weddings in the time of lockdown,"On Monday, amid the lockdown, Pappanaickenpudur resident D. Pushparaj tied the knot to his girlfriend A. Vijayalakshmi. The couple was among the six or seven that got married at the Sri Baladhandayuthapani Murugan Temple in Gandhi Park.

The couple along with 10 members - five each from the bride and the groom family - reached the temple around 5 a.m. and after completing the formalities, left the place by 5.30 a.m.

Mr. Pushparaj’s uncle N. Chandran said the muhurtam was scheduled between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. But the families had to move it forward at the instructions of the temple management, which said it was moving it by 5 a.m. as there at least half-a-dozen weddings to be solemnised and they had to do it keeping in mind the lockdown and personal distance to be maintained.

The families then consulted one another and elders in the respective families. “We decided to go ahead as the elders did not want the wedding to be cancelled or postponed.”

Thereafter, Mr. Chandran reached out to the local police station, where officials asked him to get in touch with the district administration. “At the Collectorate, officials asked me to apply with the wedding invitation. Thereafter, a few family members and I met the Collector, who asked us a few questions and granted permission.” The permission was for not more than 10 persons to attend the wedding and two vehicles to travel to the temple and return home.

Mr. Pushparaj, who works as a salesman in a leading home appliances shop, said he was thrilled and equally tensed in the run up the wedding, as his was a love marriage. Ms. Vijayalakshmi was his junior in college.

One of the important tasks was to call up relatives to tell them about the change in plans, the decision to go ahead with the wedding and seek their blessings. And, also answer calls from concerned relatives and friends.

“My wife and I also kept updating relatives and friends through messages and social media posts.” And, at the temple, the couple made sure that their wedding was captured on a mobile phone camera to be shared on social media platforms. Mr. Chandran said the families had decided to hold the reception at a later date, after the lockdown ended and normality returned.

The bride and groom along with the relatives, who attended the wedding, wore masks and maintained physical distancing, according to sources privy to the development. Other such small-scale weddings also took place at temples in Kalampalayam in Thondamuthur and Chinniyampalayam on the outskirts of the city.

294,2020/03/30,Coronavirus | Consumers oppose opening of EB collection centres,"This forces consumers to find ways to reach the section and it is unsafe for consumers and Tangedco employees.

Electricity consumers and industries have opposed the decision of the State Government to re-open the collection centres for payment of current consumption charges even when the State is under a lockdown as a precaution against the spread of COVID-19.

K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause, said the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) had asked consumers (LT and CT) to pay the previous month bill amount as its staff could not visit houses, shops or industries till April 14 to take the readings.

As a precautionary measure, the Tangedco decided not to disconnect service connections physically if the payments were not paid till April 14.

Consumers were advised to make use of online payment facilities and avoid visiting the counters. But, now, the counters are opened at the section offices to collect the payments.

This forces consumers to find ways to reach the section and it is unsafe for consumers and Tangedco employees.

Further, the Corporation has not bothered to provide relief to the public during this crisis period.

It is only avoiding physical disconnection and even domestic consumers need to pay penalty and reconnection charges.

The Tangedco should not open the cash counters.

The economically weaker section, especially those in rural areas, does not know how to make digital payments.

Hence, the Tangedco should extend the last date to April 30.

It should not collect charges for delayed payment, penalty, or reconnection charges, etc till April 30.

President of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association R. Ramamurthy said Tangedco should give time for the MSMEs to pay the consumption charges and should not collect the minimum demand charges.

Opposing opening of collection centres, he said the MSMEs would not be able to remit the charges during the lockdown.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coronavirus-consumers-oppose-opening-of-eb-collection-centres/article31202758.ece

Following several migrant workers come to the streets here on Saturday, demanding food and facilities to return to their home towns, industrial associations here took the initiative on Sunday to identify workers from other States who are staying in the city and where they are located.

Ravi Sam, chairman of the CSR, Affirmative Action, Sustainability sub-committee of Confederation of Indian Industry - Southern Region, the CII and other associations have started working on jointly identifying the migrant workers who are staying back in the city and what their needs are.

They cannot go back to their home towns now and the industries will take care of their needs.

R. Ramamurthy, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, said that on Sunday he received information that about 60 workers were staying near Athipalayam.

Most of them worked in microindustries on in the unorganised sector for daily wages. Persons, who operated one or two lathes, will not be able to take care of these workers.

Hence, one of the industrial associations has come forward to provide their provisions to cook food for 20 days.

“We will jointly first identify the workers across sectors in Coimbatore and know their requirements. We are coordinating with the district administration so that we can give the provisions to the common kitchens and the officials distribute the food or we can buy the provisions and supply at the accommodations where the workers live. Most of them have accommodation facilities,” he said.

According to J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises, some of the workers are covered under ESI, etc. There are many others who are employed with very small units. The unit owners cannot afford to take care of the workers for a long period. The associations will jointly identify the workers, know their need gaps, and meet these.

The units are also facing financial problems.

Of the 25 news cases on Monday, 18 were reported from Nizamuddin, where a religious programme was organised at the ‘markaz’ (the mosque) around March 18 in which more than 500 people from various States took part.

“Our number of new cases is going up due to the Nizamuddin incident. Going by yesterday’s [Sunday] and today’s [Monday] trend, more people will test positive from Nizamuddin. We expect the daily number of new cases to increase further in the coming days due to this,” a Delhi Health Department official told The Hindu.

One of the nurses had a fever on Sunday evening, so the entire team has been asked to quarantine themselves, said a source.

The Union Health Ministry said that set protocol regarding exposure is being followed.

In an attempt to bolster readiness, AIIMS-Delhi is training doctors and nurses through online classes and has set up a 24X7 call facility for doctors to seek guidance on clinical care of COVID-19 patients. AIIMS had shut its OPD services on March 23 and had also issued an advisory to OPD patients, requesting them to postpone their appointments. The hospital also postponed all elective surgeries from March 20. Safdarjung Hospital is already admitting and treating COVID-9 patients.

Several private hospitals have also offered to convert to dedicated COVID-19 treatment facilities.

The Union Health Ministry has also said that ‘102 ambulances’ should not be used for COVID-19 patients as they are needed to transport only pregnant women or sick infants. It added that all medical technicians in the ambulance as well as the driver must wear protective equipment when handling COVID-19 suspect or patients.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aiims-trauma-centre-to-be-dedicated-covid-19-hospital/article31212501.ece
305,2020/03/30,COVID-19 impact: inmates of two city prisons complain of ‘poor’ conditions,"They demand to be released from Rohini, Mandoli jails on parole

In a few videos that have surfaced online, inmates at Rohini and Mandoli jails can be seen complaining of “poor” conditions prevailing in the prisons since the COVID-19 outbreak. They have demanded to either be released on parole or be taken care of.

In a video purportedly shared by inmates of Rohini jail, a person can be heard saying: “There is no space to sleep. Toilets are dirty. Food is inadequate. Once COVID-19enters the jail, it will spread. One person has been tested positive in OPD. It is being hidden from us.” He added that they are on a hunger strike.

In another video from cell number 15 in Mandoli jail, an inmate said there is no medical facility and the food being served “is worse than what is fed to animals”. He alleged that they are not provided with masks and sanitizers. “If someone suffers from cold and we inform the authorities, we are asked to keep mum and threatened that action will be taken against us,” he said.

An inmate said: “Release us on parole or ensure that if any of us die of the disease, then compensation should be given to our families.” Responding to the videos, Director General of Prisons Sandeep Goel said they are looking into the matter and that a phone, used to record the videos, has been recovered. “Some prisoners tried to create problems on Sunday afternoon but everything was brought under control,” he said.

He said the condition of toilets “is not so bad as projected in the video although there are stains etc. in the toilets...it seems that bottles and plastic have been deliberately stuffed”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/covid-19-impact-inmates-of-two-city-prisons-complain-of-poor-conditions/article31212498.ece
306,2020/03/30,"Wait for food, but no ration cards","PDS stores witness long queues, many worried about ‘next meal’

The extra ration provided by the government has been beneficial especially at the end of the month, said several people who lined up outside the Public Distribution System (PDS) stores in the city. However, those who queued up without ration cards remain concerned about their next meal.

Mamta (40) and Laxmi (60), who work as maids, have been coming to ration distribution point, reportedly run by the area MLA, next to a ration store in Govindpuri for the last three days. “They [officials] took down our names, numbers and addresses and told us that they would send food but nothing has come,” said Laxmi.

Without a source of income, she is unsure whether she will be allowed to continue at her rented jhuggi but more importantly how she would arrange for the next meal. The women said they are not sure if their employers would pay them.

Suresh Chand, whose source of income is a room that he rents to a maid, said: “ I won’t ask rent from her now...how can I? She won’t be able to pay anyway.” Chand, who too does not have a ration card, stood outside the free distribution point hoping to get some ration for home. For meals, he has been leaning on nearby centres run by various NGOs and religious organisations.

CM order

In this regard, CM Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said arrangements are being made so that people who do not have ration cards can get goods from government stores. He assured that an order to this effect would be passed soon.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/epfbf1/article31212493.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30DELPRIYARATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wait-for-food-but-no-ration-cards/article31212494.ece
307,2020/03/30,"Out of work, slum dwellers in the city start losing savings","Many of them, from Basai Darapur and Sudhama Puri slums, face employers’ neglect; for most, food during lockdown remains a daily struggle

At Basai Darapur and Sudhama Puri - slums that are mostly inhabited by daily wage labourers, domestic help and rickshaw pullers - families are finding it difficult to survive. They are out of work, feeling neglected, and trying hard to access basic necessities.

Sangeeta from Sudhama Puri, who worked as a house help, said she is six months pregnant and is concerned over the money required for her child’s birth. “When she [employer] needed me, she used to make so many calls. Now, she hasn’t even asked me how I am managing, whether I am alive or not. She deducted money for 10 days and when I asked for her help, she did not even open the door and treated me like an untouchable,” said Sangeeta. She last went to work on March 22. “Jab waqt aata hai to koi madad nahin karta [When needed, no one helps].”

Sangeeta said her husband, a rickshaw puller, is also out of work.

‘Out of money’

A 25-year-old man, Sajjan Singh from Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao, a rickshaw puller said he walked 17 km from his jhuggi in the hope of getting a bus home but was stopped by the police.

“There is no work. I had savings that lasted for four-five days. I ran out of money and wanted to go back to the village where my family stays but couldn’t. I will have to now wait for the curfew to end,” he said. When asked how he will manage food, he said: “Yahi log khila rahe hain [The people here are feeding me].” He said he has been in Delhi for over 12 years and “have never faced a situation like this”.

With buffalo-litter and garbage around him, the residents of Sudhama Puri slums, also complained of municipal workers not turning up to clean the area. “There is no option for us to stand, sit and sleep away from each other. We are hardly able to take precautionary measures. A majority of us don’t even own masks because they are so expensive,” said Nitu, a house help.

A few meters ahead, in the slums of Basai Darapur, many daily wage labourers were seen waiting for their employers to give them money, which has been due for sometime. Shivam (19), Raju Kumar (20) and Manglu (34), all from Uttar Pradesh, were seen discussing how they will manage the next month’s rent if they are stuck in the city. These labourersmostly pick bricks for a living.

“Wapas jaane ke liye bhi to paisa chahiye. Vo bhi nahin hai. Uske liye hi baithe hain yahan [We need money to go back. That too we don’t have and that is why we are sitting here],” said Shivam, adding that there is no point walking home or going in over-crowded buses.

Manglu said: “I have not heard of any poor person being diagnosed with COVID-19. It’s for the rich, but the worst hit are poor.”

While everyone in Basai Darapur shared their fear of running out of food and money, Nisha, a househelp, said she is most hurt by the treatment meted out to her by her employer. “Usne kaha jab bimari khatam hogi tab aa jana. Pata nahin kahan se aate ho tum log. Main ghar main nahin aane dungi ab [She said come when the epidemic is over. I don’t know where you come from. I won’t let you in],” she said.

Right opposite Nisha’s residence, is Badlu Ram’s jhuggi. With just a kitchen and a washing space inside, nine personslive in that house. “We are worried that where will the next meal come from?” the gardener said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/68cjzy/article31212483.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30DELPRIYAHEMANISTORY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/out-of-work-slum-dwellers-in-the-city-start-losing-savings/article31212484.ece
308,2020/03/30,‘Axed officials chose to sit in their offices’,"Bureaucracy questions suspension move, calls it ‘unprecedented and very unfair’

A day after two senior IAS officials were suspended and another was issued a show-cause notice along with a DANICS officer by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) for alleged dereliction of duty for not being able to contain the exodus of migrant workers from Delhi, sources in the MHA claimed this was done in response to their alleged failure in this respect on multiple counts.

While some in the bureaucracy argued the move was not only “unprecedented” but “very unfair” and questioned why the buck did not stop with the politicians whose “orders were being carried out” by the suspended lot — among them “very senior and capable bureaucrats” with “impeccable career and records”, MHA sources claimed action was taken against officials who “chose to sit in air-conditioned rooms” instead of ensuring “better management” and “proper implementation” of these very decisions on the ground.

Suspended officials

Renu Sharma, additional Chief Secretary, Transport Department and Rajiv Verma, Principal Secretary, Finance were suspended while Satya Gopal, additional Chief Secretary, Home and Land Buildings Departments, and Ajay Kumar Arora, SDM Seelampur, were served show-cause notices.

“There are videos being circulated in the public domain showing announcements being made to migrant workers to reach the inter-State bus terminal at Anand Vihar where arrangements to ferry them to Uttar Pradesh were being made. At whose behest were these made?” the MHA source said.

“After these announcements, which were instrumental in triggering the exodus, were made, instructions were issued to ensure floodlights, tents and urinals — especially for the women among the migrants — but these did not materialise on the ground,” the source argued.

In the run-up to the exodus over the weekend, the source claimed, the suspended officials had “chosen to sit in their offices” instead of ensuring that the situation did not transform into the crisis.

‘Personal grudge’

“This is the first time that such senior bureaucrats have been axed without any explanation or underlying reason,” a bureaucrat argued.

“This may not only have been inspired by some sort of personal grudge against them but may also be an exercise in public relations so the people do not question the politicians who actually sat in their offices to escape public ire,” the official said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/1jnare/article31212315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30DELDANICSIMG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/axed-officials-chose-to-sit-in-their-offices/article31212316.ece
309,2020/03/30,Stranded non-Delhi residents struggle to return,"The affected are reaching out to cab and hearse van drivers to drop them

After public transport services not available and borders sealed during the lockdown, non-Delhi residents who are stranded in the city are reaching out to cab and hearse van drivers to drop them at their respective cities in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

Aarti Singh, who came to Delhi for a job interview is trapped at her friend’s house said that the landlord has stopped meal services and her family back in Lucknow are worried about her. “My family want me back in Lucknow at any cost. Through a contact, I reached out to a cab driver who agreed to drop me, but he will charge ₹7,000 per seat with a condition that if they get caught at borders then no money will be refunded,” said Ms. Aarti.

On condition

She added that she has agreed but she has to wait till he gets three other passengers.

In another case, Phool Devi, who went to visit her relative, admitted at AIIMS, is also trapped at a hostel.

“It is just a single room and we are five persons sleeping in one room. My children are worried at my home town in Rampur. My relative got me connected to a hearse van driver who will drop me to my town on Tuesday,” said Ms. Devi. She added that she will pay ₹5,000 for the drive. The driver said the hearse van is allowed to move in lockdown and it will not be stopped.

Similar was the case with Mahesh Singh, who has come to visit his son who is studying at a college in North Campus. ‘I am a farmer and I have to go back to my farms for harvest time. If I failed to go then I will suffer a huge loss. I will walk till the Haryana border and will arrange some transport from there,” said Mr. Mahesh.

Pickets arranged

The police have directed his personnel to stop the movement of the migrant population, trying to leave the city, by increasing the number of pickets across the city and the border areas with the help of additional forces.

On Sunday, a bus owner and his three drivers were arrested during a picket checking at Dhaula Kuan Flyover for carrying passengers in violation of lockdown orders.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cznnhz/article31212256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30DELPRIYACHECKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/stranded-non-delhi-residents-struggle-to-return/article31212257.ece
310,2020/03/30,Makeshift camp near F1 race track for migrant workers,"Move comes after Central government asks States to seal district and inter-State borders

A makeshift camp at the periphery of a plush housing society, which includes an F1 race track on the Yamuna Expressway at Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh is being readied as a relief camp for migrants headed home as 21-day lockdown is enforced in wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

After Centre asked State governments to strictly enforce the lockdown measures by sealing district and inter-State borders, efforts are on to provide accommodation to migrants and unorganised workers who continued to march on foot from Delhi to their homes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

B.N. Singh, District Magistrate of Gautam Buddh Nagar, that comprises Noida and Greater Noida, had on Sunday issued an order under Epidemic Act, 1897, designating Jaypee Sports City at Yamuna Expressway as a shelter home for migrants. Mr. Singh went on a three-month leave on Monday following a rebuke by U.P Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath as Noida recorded highest number of COVID-19 positive cases in the State.

Used for poll duty

When The Hindu visited the facility on Monday, the tin-roofed camp was being cleaned and readied.

A U.P government official said the camp has on earlier occasions been used to accommodate construction workers and paramilitary jawans who are sent on election duty. “The capacity of this camp is around 1,800 persons. Rows of such tenements are there and each has a separate bathroom. We are cleaning the premises as it has not been in use for many days,” said the official.

An under-construction building where work stopped years ago, stands in the compound.

When asked if the tin tenements will cause discomfort to the occupants amid rising heat, the official said, “The inside of these tents are layered with plywood sheets. It will absorb the heat. This is an ideal location as social distancing norms can be followed here.”

The camp is surrounded by iron gates on all sides. The administration was making arrangements to prepare and serve food to the inmates there.

On Sunday, the Union Home Ministry termed the movement of migrant workers to reach their home towns a violation of the lockdown measures and issued an order that those who have moved out of their work spots must be quarantined in the nearest shelter after proper screening for a minimum period of 14 days as per standard health protocol.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/makeshift-camp-near-f1-race-track-for-migrant-workers/article31212193.ece
311,2020/03/30,Lockdown takes a toll on harvest,"Milk business in villages takes a hit, adding to people’s woes

The nationwide shutdown of non-essential resources to stop the spread of COVID-19 has not just curtailed the free movement of villagers here much like the people across the country, but also made it difficult for them to harvest the rabi crop due to labour shortage and non-availability of the combine harvesters.

Besides, the milk business of the villagers has also taken a hit adding to their financial woes.

Nanak Yadav (41), a resident of Hazipur village on Sohna-Palwal road, said a large number of labourers from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh would throng the villages in the region during the harvest season towards the end of March, but there was none this time around due to shutdown. The combine harvesters would reach the villages, mostly from Punjab, but that too was not allowed.

Mr. Yadav, who owns three acres of agricultural land, said he would begin harvesting his wheat crop in two-acre land in the second week of April and then the mustard. “Though the family members, along with the local labourers would delay the harvest of the crops, the bigger challenge for the farmers would be to keep it stored till the procurement begins,” said Mr. Yadav.

Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar has announced that the procurement for mustard and wheat would commence on April 15 and 20 respectively, if the situation allowed.

Raj, a Nimoth resident, said the delayed procurement also meant delayed payment and it would add to their financial woes. He said though the government may not press for payment of loan under the Kisan Credit Cards, they need to repay the money taken from private lenders.

Ravinder Kumar of Kherili Lala said that most of his fellow villagers ran dairies and supplied milk to Gurugram and Faridabad, but the business was adversely hit due to the shutdown. He said that around 1,500 litres of milk was supplied from his village daily, but now many had stopped the supply.

“After a case of COVID-19 in Faridabad, we held a Panchayat, pleading all villagers to stop the supply. But many did not agree, citing financial reasons. It has now led to fear among the residents that these people could be carriers of COVID-19 to the village, infecting all,” said Mr. Kumar. He, however, said that the villagers had discontinued the practice of playing cards and smoking hookahs sitting in huddles after a police team visited the village two days back to sensitise them and following a similar appeal from the Sarpanch.

Mr. Kumar, who runs a real estate business, said the lockdown had hit him hard since many of his clients had not made the payment.

Om Prakash Chopra, a resident of Gamroj village off the Gurugram-Alwar Highway, said the police did not allow the opening of all grocery shops in his village and threatened the shopkeepers to pull down their shutters. He also accused the police of high-handedness, saying that he was stopped and abused while he was going to a doctor to get his daughter-in-law examined.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lockdown-takes-a-toll-on-harvest/article31212164.ece

315,2020/03/30,"Coronavirus | With nil hopes at Zero Point, migrants face police batons","Lockdown returns at Yamuna Expressway as migrants struggle to find means to travel to hometowns

Police personnel were seen tracking down, confronting and occasionally using their batons to “persuade” hapless migrant workers on the Yamuna Expressway to go to shelter homes here on Monday.

In most cases, however, the workers who failed to find transport to their home towns were told to find their own way to the shelter homes without being given transport or escorted. Nor were they provided any assurances, let alone guarantees, that they would not be chased away by police personnel deployed along the route.

The police resumed “strict enforcement” of the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19 after two days when the workers were allowed to return to their hometowns across Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Bihar.

Turned away

Those who were unsuccessful in doing so over the weekend, like Ram Kumar and his family of seven, which included four children, sought to try their luck at the “Zero Point” on the expressway, but were turned away. It later transpired that in addition to the “strict enforcement” of the lockdown, the reason for such police action was a proposed visit by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to Gautam Buddha University in the area.

“I was engaged at a factory in Gurugram and couldn’t make it in time till here on Sunday. We reached only this morning; the police hit us twice with their sticks and asked us to find some camp which they have set up for us. They didn’t tell us where exactly it is, though,” Mr. Kumar of Firozabad, near Agra, said.

He and his family were among a dozen people who had, somehow, made their way to the location. A few minutes into their wait, however, a police van ascended the elevated entry onto the highway, the personnel aboard it got down, walked over to the motley group and confronted them before chasing them away. While the others, mainly young men, were able to sprint away to save themselves from being detained, Mr. Kumar, however, was caned twice.

Location of shelter

“My family and I have been engaged in work at Gurugram; how would we know where the location of the shelter which they mumbled while confronting us is,” he asked.

Below the “Zero Point”, the same police personnel confronted Satbir Singh and Anil Singh, who were hoping to travel to Mathura. “We tried to go back day before yesterday and the day prior to that, but there were no buses available or there was no space on those which were plying. So we thought we will try to go back again today. We didn’t know the lockdown was back in place,” Mr. Satbir, now an out-of-work factory hand, said.

Anil, Mr. Satbir’s colleague at the same factory, said the police personnel who confronted them merely pointed towards the opposite end of the highway and asked them to “go to the shelter”.

“They didn’t even tell us where to go. Who do we ask where we are supposed to go without being beaten up,” he asked.

When asked where they were supposed to go, one of the police personnel told this correspondent, “There are camps which are being set up.

In another case, a 52-year-old man tested positive after his return to Guntur in Andhra Pradesh. Entry to the Markaz Masjid has been banned till further orders.

A medical camp has been functional in the area for the last one week, collecting samples from people. A World Health Organisation (WHO) team also visited the Markaz.

“We are coordinating with other authorities to track down people who went back to their towns after attending the congregation,” said the officer.

“As per the recommendations of medical team, more people have been shifted to quarantine or hospitals. We are cooperating with authorities and people have been shifted from Markaz,” said Dr. Mohammad Shoiab, spokesperson of the Markaz.

In a report from the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Lajpat Nagar), a Tableegh Jamat was held at the Tabligh Markaz and it was attended by many people including foreign nationals. The attendees of the Jamat were already in the mosque when the March 24 21-day lockdown was announced and no fresh participants were allowed to enter as the Markaz gates and doors were closed immediately after the lockdown orders. In fact an effort on March 23 to decongest and vacate the Markaz premises had to be stopped midway due to extended lockdown.

The officer added that the report had been sent to MHA. DCP (South East) R.P. Meena, said the police had served notices for holding a religious gathering during the lockdown.

Preachers blacklisted

Union Home Ministry will blacklist around 800 preachers from Indonesia who came on a tourist visa and participated in a three-day religious conference in Delhi this month. India and Indonesia have a liberal visa arrangement and allow tourist visa on arrivals for the citizens.

“They came here on a tourist visa but were participating in religious conferences. This is violation of visa rules. We are going to blacklist around 800 Indonesian preachers so that in future they are not able to enter the country,” said the official.

The official added that the preachers had moved in batches to Telengana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and conducted group meetings in mosques and elsewhere.

“Around 50% of Covid positive cases in Telengana are linked to the meetings organized by the preachers. Around 350 people from Telangana had also attended the conference in Delhi,” said the official. When asked whether the preachers were not screened at the airport for any COVID symptoms, the official said, “they entered India before the red alert was sounded.”

“The entire trauma casualty and the emergency is being shifted to the AIIMS’ main emergency. Most of the patients have already been shifted to multiple wards at the main AIIMS hospital,” a source said.

The Trauma Centre currently has 242 beds and 18 more are being added to it. Of the total number of beds, there are about 50 ICU beds and around 30-40 beds in the high-dependency unit. It has around 70 ventilators.

“The capacity can be ramped up, depending on the requirement,” a source said.

The AIIMS has set up a task force to develop a management protocol for COVID-19 and constituted several committees to be able to respond to the challenges that may surface in the coming days due to the rising number of coronavirus cases.

The premier hospital has already closed its OPD, including speciality services and all new and follow-up patients’ registration, from March 24 till further orders.

The AIIMS had earlier decided to temporarily suspend the routine walk-in OPD registration of patients from March 23 as part of its efforts to redirect its resources to control the coronavirus outbreak.

319,2020/03/30,Delhi Court grants bail to three Shaheen Bagh protesters,"They allegedly disobeyed the direction of the government and police over restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19

A Delhi Court has granted bail to three men who were arrested from Shaheen Bagh protest site in NewDelhi for allegedly disobeying the direction of the government and police over restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19.

The court noted that in the current scenario, the Supreme Court and Delhi High Court have both passed directions regarding de-congestion of already overpopulated prisons in Delhi.

The State opposed the bail on the ground that the arrested persons “might mobilise a crowd at the protest site and that the same can prejudice the maintenance of law and order and also may affect adversely the efforts of the State to contain the spread of Coronavirus”.

The court, however, said that the apprehension stated by the State could be addressed by imposing “suitable restrictions” on the persons.

While granting bail to the trio — Syed Taseer Ahmed, Shan Mohammed, and Syed Masood Ahmad — the court directed them not to visit the Shaheen Bagh protest site for the “purpose of any protest”.

“The applicant shall not be posting any opinion regarding the Citizenship (Amendment) Act/ National Population Register/ National Register of Citizens on any social media, instant messengers nor will be giving any interview in this regard to print and electronic media,” the court said.

They should not participate in any meeting or gathering where there were more than five persons in total during the existence of the advisories of the government regarding Coronavirus.

Besides, the trio will have to mark their attendance at Shaheen Bagh Police Station every Monday at 10 a.m. during the investigation period of the case.

The three were arrested after they disobeyed directions regarding the lockdown and prohibition of protest gathering in the wake of pandemic. The police said the accused did not pay any heed to the directions of its officials to remove themselves from the protest site and even obstructed the police from discharging its duties.

On the other hand, the accused in their respective bail pleas contended that they were likely to be infected with the Coronavirus if detained for long.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/x1yeih/article31148866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/shaheen-cleared,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-court-grants-bail-to-three-shaheen-bagh-protesters/article31203508.ece
320,2020/03/30,Result of worship,"The Bhagavata Purana describes many instances when through the practice of prayer and worship human beings as well as celestials are able to fulfil their wants and desires by the Lord’s grace. One such austere practice described in detail is the observation of the Pumsavana vrata that Diti, the mother of the asuras, had undertaken.

Diti was upset that her son Vritra was killed with Indra’s thunderbolt weapon in a fierce and destructive battle. So she took up this vow with the aim of begetting a son who would be free from death and would also be capable of killing Indra. Though her resolve was to destroy Indra, Suka describes the outcome of this episode as auspicious, for it brought about the birth of the Maruts who were endowed with celestial and not asura tendencies by God’s grace, pointed out Sri B. Sundarkumar in a discourse. Diti began this vrata with faith, love and devotion and propitiated Lord Narayana with specific mantras, prayers and offerings.

Indra, hearing about this vow wanted to prevent the birth of the son. So, he disguised his intentions and offered his service to Diti. He hoped he would get a chance to break the foetus during the vrata period. As destiny would have it, on one occasion, Diti slipped from her vow and Indra entered her womb and cut the foetus into seven pieces. The children pleaded with Indra, but he cut them again into seven pieces each. Though cut into pieces, they did not perish owing to the grace of the Lord, just as Parikshit was protected by Krishna in the womb of his mother from the deadly arrow of Asvathama. He then admitted his evil intent to Diti and begged for pardon. Diti did so and was happy that her children were now converted into devas and did not have any asura nature. They came to be known as Maruts.",faith,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/faith/result-of-worship/article31211346.ece

The late night statement issued in Telugu from the Chief Minister’s office said that several persons from Telangana had attended the three-day religious congregation and many of them had contracted coronavirus.

Giving the break of deaths, the government said two had died while undergoing treatment at Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad, one each in Apollo Hospital and Global Hospital. Two other deaths were reported from Nizamabad and Gadwal.

Special teams

As a firefighting measure, the government said special teams under Collectors have identified those persons who came in contact with these persons, and they were shifted to hospitals.

“They were tested and treated. Since those participated in Markaz prayers were infected with coronavirus, all those participated in the prayers should inform the officials concerned. The government would conduct tests and offer treatment to them free of cost,” the statement said.

Further, it was said that all those, who went for the Markaz prayers in Delhi should inform the authorities. “Anyone who has information about them should alert the government, the Medical and Health Department of Telangana State,” the CMO release said.

In a related development, the Telangana police have launched a massive exercise to track them down. Speaking to The Hindu a senior police officer said that forces across the State will identify and track them. “It is a very difficult task. But if we don’t identify and put them in home quarantine, there is every possibility of the virus spreading to more people in the State,” he said, adding that Director General of Police M Mahender Reddy on Monday evening held a teleconference with district Superintendents of Police, Commissioners of Police, and other senior officers on the issue.

He said they will ask the community heads to voluntarily come forward and submit the list of people who were at the gathering. “We also request the attendees to isolate themselves and immediately contact police or health officials in case they develop any COVID-19 symptoms,” the officer said seeking anonymity.

It is learnt that people from erstwhile Nizamabad and Mahabubnagar, and Hyderabad districts attended the congregation in large numbers. “We came to know that at least 200 people from Hyderabad alone were present in the massive religious gathering that took place at Nizamuddin in Delhi,” the senior officer said.

323,2020/03/30,Apollo rolls out project to support isolation care,"Of the 500 rooms created in first phase, 100 will be for Hyderabad

Apollo Hospitals Group which launched Project Kavach, an integrated response plan to tackle COVID-19, four days ago, has rolled out ‘Project Stay I’, an innovative social impact initiative to support isolation care across India.

In the first phase, 500 rooms are being created with 100 each in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai and the rest in other cities in partnership with SBI, HUL, OYO, Zomato and Lemon Tree Hotels.

More rooms soon

Addressing a virtual conference, Apollo Hospitals Group joint MD Sangita Reddy, along with partners supporting the strategy, on Monday said that they were looking to add 50 to 100 rooms per week depending on the demand and up to 5,000 rooms for patients with mild symptoms to stay in isolation with medically supervised beds and through tele-medicine. If needed, it can be scaled up to 20,000 to 30,000 rooms across the country. The location of isolation rooms will be available on the website.

For those who can’t have home quarantine facility with five to seven people staying in a house with single bathroom, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, SBI and Deutsche Bank have come forward to cover the cost of isolation rooms for such socio-economic group. Apollo will not charge for the medical supervision through its telemedicine network.

Window of opportunity

Kiran Majumdar Shaw, managing director of Biocon Ltd, who formed a group with Sangita Reddy and others to rope in partners from the private sector to support and augment the government efforts to contain the epidemic, said “We have a short window of opportunity to make a success out of isolation, quarantine under social distancing and lockdown and not to overwhelm critical care facilities in the hospitals,” she explained.

Project Stay I is a step up model. Those with mild symptoms and asymptomatic COVID-affected persons can be put up in hotel rooms and isolation rooms. Those who need advance treatment will then be shifted to COVID hospitals. The consortium model has to be expanded to cover the entire country, she said.

Ms. Reddy and Ms. Shaw said that the Central and State governments and ICMR have been extremely proactive and this coming together of government and private sector was in true spirit of public-private partnership.

Ms Shaw said they were working to enhance testing facility and the government has allowed private institutions for testing and for hospital care too. Some companies have come forward to make low cost testing kits, ventilators and protective gear for those working in the front line like health care and other essential services.

About her company’s role in the initiative, Ms Shaw said they were willing to provide free testing and support the testing cost for the needy.

Housing healthcare staff

She also suggested that the isolation rooms being provided by private sector should also be used to house the doctors and healthcare staff treating COVID-19 patients to protect the families of healthcare personnel. The more the isolation, less will be the chance of transmission of virus during the 21-day lockdown to quarantine and segregate the population.

Ms Reddy said they were working to provide separate facility for heathcare personnel and added that regular critical care facilities would be kept separate from COVID hospitals.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/apollo-rolls-out-project-to-support-isolation-care/article31212024.ece

Private and government institutions seem to be working in silos was the response of many at the virtual media conference.

Apollo Hospitals Group joint MD Sangita Reddy (in pic), however, was categorical in her response and said, “Everyone realises the extent of seriousness of the pandemic. The government is doing an amazing job and also partnering with private sector to ensure safety of people and for mobilising personal protection equipment, ventilators etc. This is an innovative method to enhance existing infrastructure, be it isolation rooms, medically supervised beds etc. We informed the State governments our ideology and this is a joint effort. Every COVID-19 sick and isolated person is reported to the national grid. The government is clearly in the driving seat. The individual with symptoms should call the government helpline first. Some may come directly to the private institutions. So, it is about making facilities available for common man and for every section.”

She added that institutions were not working in isolation. “There is regular communication from the Centre and State. We are working in a unified and coordinated manner. The lockdown is helping,” she stated.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/govt-is-in-the-driving-seat/article31211959.ece

With people not stepping outside, there is no leftover food dumped on the streets for the animals to scavenge. Garbage bins were a source of food for the dogs while for stray cattle, it was vegetables and fruits thrown outside houses or street corners.

“All that has stopped suddenly. Almost all garbage bins are empty. While coming to office from home, I saw some stray animals and realised they were struggling for food,” Asifnagar ACP Shiva Maruthi said. With the rising mercury, the animals and even birds are struggling to find water too, he said.

When he shared his thoughts with his subordinates, they too agreed to feed the animals and birds. Personnel of Asifnagar, Humayunnagar, Golconda, Tappachabutra and Langerhouz swung into action. They bought bread and handed over to teams of Blue Colts and patrol cars of their respective police stations.

These teams who continuously move around the localities, more so now to check unnecessary movement of people on roads, give out bread and water wherever they spot a stray animal. “We are asking people to do their bit as well by keeping bowls of water outside for birds and to provide food to stray animals, without breaking lockdown rules,” the ACP says.

Moved by the plight of homeless and migrant labourers due to lockdown, Telangana police have started providing food and shelter to them.

On Monday, Hyderabad Additional Commissioner of Police (Crimes and SIT) Shikha Goel visited Classic Gardens in Begumpet where over 700 migrant labourers from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand are being given meals twice apart from shelter with the help of the local community. “They were working in small hotels or as daily wage earners. Now, they are struggling to earn their daily bread owing to the 21-day nationwide lockdown,” Ms. Goel said.

At various police stations, the officials are spearheading efforts to ensure that food and provisions are distributed to the poor and needy so that they don’t go hungry.

The Cyberabad police, in association with the Society for Cyberabad Security Council, are distributing groceries to the poor, destitute and needy through ground police staff and traffic volunteers.

Rachakonda police, on the other hand, have distributed food to nearly 3,000 migrant workers living or working in its limits who were set to walk down to their native States. “A total of 49 migrant workers who set out to walk 850 km from Rahmat Nagar to Rampur in Uttar Pradesh were stopped at Kushaiguda and offered shelter at the training centre of Ankuram, an NGO,” Commissioner of Police Mahesh Bhagwat said.

There are 3,635 foreign returnees in Cyberabad Commissionerate, of whom 2,264 people have been verified till Monday, and 12 are tested COVID-19 positive. “A total of 2,136 are under home quarantine and we are keeping a close watch on them,” said Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar.

He said that enforcing the government orders concerning the lockdown, the Cyberabad police have booked 38 violation cases and 39 black marketing cases against 77 people. The police have also seized 177 two-wheelers, 23 auto-rickshaws and 31 four-wheelers.

328,2020/03/30,Property tax collection 25% short of target,"Property tax collection in the city has taken a hit owing to the present lockdown, which could land the GHMC in difficult straits in the coming year.

A day before the end of financial year, on Monday, property tax collection stood at mere ₹1,359 crore, which is lower than the collection of previous year at ₹1,401 crore. For the current year, GHMC has set itself a target of ₹1,800 crore.

Usually, the corporation receives a bulk of its collection at the end of the financial year, in last week of March. However, due to lockdown imposed for the last one week, the collections have been very low, officials informed.

“During March, the collections are mere ₹90 crore, as against the ₹270 crore collected during the same month last year. We are in doubt if we will be able to cross even last year’s collection, let alone reach our target for this year,” an officials shared.

Bulk of the current year’s collection was through bill collectors who visited from door to door handing over the demand notices.

A total of ₹729 crore were garnered by the bill collectors, while ₹326 crore was received online.

With COVID-19 scare and lockdown taking its toll, hardly any assessees are visiting the citizen service centres at GHMC offices. E-Seva and Mee Seva centres too are not receiving many footfalls.

329,2020/03/30,CCMB gets nod to test COVID-19 samples,"Kits for as many as 1,000 tests approved by ICMR

From Tuesday, the CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) will start testing COVID-19 samples taken from suspected patients. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given permission to take up testing of samples with kits for 1,000 tests approved by it, said CCMB director Rakesh Mishra.

“We seem to have reached a critical stage in the virus spread with experts cautioning that the worst is not yet over so we should not let our guard down at any cost. So far, we have been testing people with obvious symptoms and those in touch with COVID-19 positive patients. The test now has to be done on others too with those with previous travel history and in an identified particular community or area based on the results,” he said.

It is no longer sufficient to just bank on patients admitted to hospitals or from among the fatalities to judge for the virus spread in the community, he affirmed.

‘Mass testing needed’

“It is a pretty complex process of identifying persons needing the tests. It is not as if we can take up testing samples from whosoever is coming forward as these kits are very expensive and only one set has been cleared by the ICMR so far. What is needed is ‘mass’ testing by pooling 10-100 samples each at a time, to gauge the spread of the virus among the people at community or locality level. Several efforts are on in various laboratories and, if successful, this may start in couple of weeks,” Dr. Mishra maintained.

Eye on foreign returnees

The solace is that the Telangana Medical and Health authorities as well as the police department have been keeping a tab on the movement of foreign returnees in their enforced quarantine and this could give a picture on where the testing can be focused, he observed.

‘Worst is not over yet’

The present lockdown may have helped control rapid community spread, but at the same time, unless more testing is done, it is very difficult to claim the worst is over, he added. “Not having the lockdown is not an option at all as it is tough to enforce social distancing otherwise. Experts have been warning that in the next few days, the virus could reach the next stage of social spread. So, people need to very careful,” he asserted.

Several private players from the hospitality and food delivery industry and banks joined the ‘Project Stay I’ launched by Apollo Hospitals Group to support isolation care with medical supervision for those with travel history or with mild symptoms of COVID-19 to curb the spread of the pandemic.

Ritesh Agartala of Oyo Home said worldwide people were trying to create new infrastructure to tackle COVID-19 pandemic. But using existing infrastructure was invaluable. The ‘Project Stay I’ could make 5,000 rooms available in economy and above categories. They would also support accommodation for healthcare professionals — doctors, nurses, and other support staff. Oyo charges ₹1,200 per room.

Vikram Jeet Singh of Lemon Tree Hotel Group said that they had partnered with the State government and now with Apollo Hospitals Group. They provide isolation rooms for those with travel history and those with mild symptoms of COVID-19 with medical supervision from Apollo Hospitals. Absolute hygiene, sanitation will be ensured in upkeep of rooms and delivery of food. The Lemon Tree charges ₹ 3,000 plus food. The Ginger group of Hotels charges ₹2,000 plus food.

For the social groups which can’t afford, Sangita Reddy, JMD, Apollo Hospitals Group, said the Oyo rooms will be made available free of cost under the Corporate Social Responsibility of their partners which include SBI, Deutsche Bank, Hindustan Unilever, Zomato and others.

Gaurav Gupta of Zomato said he was glad to be part of the project to support isolation care and that food is a basic need. “We have to make it safe for those delivering it and those consuming it. We are focusing on contact-less delivery of food at every point,” he said.

331,2020/03/30,"Police to track down over 1,000 who attended Delhi congregation","Director General of Police holds teleconference with unit officers across the State

Alarmed by reports that more than 1,000 people from the State attended a religious congregation in New Delhi recently, Telangana police have launched a massive exercise to track them down.

The exercise follows credible information that many of the attendees could be potential carriers of coronavirus. The police have come to a conclusion after a couple of people from the State who attended the gathering earlier this month were tested positive for COVID-19.

Speaking to The Hindu a senior police officer said that forces across the State will identify and track them. “It is a very difficult task. But if we don’t identify and put them in home quarantine, there is every possibility of the virus spreading to more people in the State,” he said, adding that Director General of Police M Mahender Reddy on Monday evening held a teleconference with district Superintendents of Police, Commissioners of Police, and other senior officers on the issue.

He said that they will ask the community heads to voluntarily come forward and submit the list of people who were in the gathering. “We also request the attendees to isolate themselves and immediately contact police or health officials in case they develop any COVID-19 symptoms,” the officer said seeking anonymity.

It is learnt that people from erstwhile Nizamabad and Mahabubnagar, and Hyderabad districts have attended the congregation in large numbers. “We came to know that at least 200 people from Hyderabad alone were present in the massive religious gathering that took place at Nizamuddin in Delhi,” the senior officer said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/police-to-track-down-over-1000-who-attended-delhi-congregation/article31211424.ece
332,2020/03/30,HC postpones all SSC exams,"SSC exams from March 23 postponed

Telangana High Court on Monday passed an interim direction postponing all SSC examinations, which were earlier deferred following incidence of COVID-19, till normalcy returns in the State.

A bench of Justice M.S. Ramachandra Rao and Justice K. Lakshman instructed the government to notify rescheduled dates of the postponed examinations later. The bench passed the order on the hearing of a PIL petition seeking deferment of SSC exams in the backdrop of rising cases of coronavirus.

The PIL filed by a private educational institute faculty member M. Bala Krishna came up for hearing first on March 20. A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy heard the arguments of the petitioner’s counsel Kowturu Pavan Kumar and Advocate General B.S. Prasad.

The SSC exams started on March 19, a day before the bench heard the petition. The second exam was held the next day (March 20) when the PIL was heard. Notwithstanding the AG’s contention that the administration took all precautions to conduct the exams, the bench instructed the government to defer the SSC exams scheduled to be held from March 23 to 30.

A call on the remaining exams scheduled to be held from March 31 to April 6 was supposed to be taken later. However, the Centre has announced complete lockdown till April 14. Meanwhile, the State government on Sunday held a high-level meeting and postponed the exams to be held from March 31 to April 6.

With this, all SSC exams scheduled to be held from March 23 remain postponed.

334,2020/03/30,Good Samaritans help a stranded destitute woman,"Youth help a woman rendered homeless by lockdown

She is sitting in one corner of Sai Vrudhashram gazing endlessly at the dry hillock some distance away, the silence broken only by a muted sob every few minutes. Obviously, Pushpa Sham Singh Thakur, the widow who landed at the old age home in Talamadugu mandal after getting stranded in Adilabad town thanks to the fast-paced events related with the lockdown, is going over her fate and the darkness of the future that stares at her.

The homeless person was evicted by her landlord in Hyderabad’s Troop Bazar area where she was living all alone after the death of her only son, Sanjay, about a year back. He was her only support in life though neighbours did help her to some extent, but such help had its own limitation.

“I belong to Bidar in Karnataka and was married some 25 years back. My husband abandoned me after some years, my relatives snatched away my lands and I lived with my son who used to make sign boards,” recalled Ms. Thakur.

“After being evicted from the rented house, left with some money which neighbours gave me, I was going to Bohur-Dahegaon village near Gondia in Maharashtra to my sister’s place but I could not get a bus towards Nagpur after I reached Adilabad. I was evicted by the lodge owner who quoted the lockdown rules for doing so, but some local youths helped me out,” she added of the events between March 22 and 24.

The youths from a local NGO had Ms. Pushpa screened for COVID-19 and took her to the old age home located about 18 km from here. The management of the Shri Shirdi Sai Seva Society which runs the Vrudhashram took her in and assured her that she can actually spend the rest of her life at the place.

The story of the destitute woman not only tells about the manner in which bad luck can chase an individual for apparently no reason but also about good samaritans being around to help. “It also shows that in time of crisis the government can utilise facilities like the Sai Vrudhashram which can accommodate 100 persons and philanthropists can contribute towards its maintenance,” pointed out Debbadi Ashok, a retired BSNL engineer as he appealed for people to donate towards the cause.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/d83r61/article31202998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY30ADBOLDAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/good-samaritans-help-a-stranded-destitute-woman/article31203000.ece
335,2020/03/30,A digital hope in the times of lockdown,"Has the Hyderabadi classical music fraternity opened up to the idea of live streaming one’s concerts directly from home yet?

“If people resort to live-streaming a classical concert in the same city as they live and can’t spend two hours in their weekend to attend it, it truly speaks of the love that they have for their country’s roots,” claimed a well-known cultural organiser in Hyderabad in the pre-COVID-19 era.

Hyderabad, unlike many of its Indian counterparts, took time to move towards live streaming its classical concerts. The reasons have been straightforward, at least from what the sabhas have got to say: “There are no audiences to concerts already. Won’t they also diminish if we begin live-streaming?”

But, the situation has changed over the last year or so and the sabhas have thankfully not limited themselves — many cultural groups in the city like Vignana Samithi, Sujanaranjani, Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram, Kalasagaram and Sri Karthikeya Gana Sabha have consistently streamed their concerts and events live on YouTube and Facebook, witnessing impressive view count on the platforms. While the number of people attending a concert hasn’t come down (or increased either), the scope of the events and concerts have widened as a result.

COVID-19, without a doubt, been harsh on the local artistes with most shows in the next few months standing cancelled, postponed and being uncertain. Yet, it’s important to understand every crisis presents a ray of hope and new opportunities too. A series of pre-recorded videos, that have been timely and healing at this hour, by musicians such as Sweta Prasad, Ranjani-Gayathri have generated impressive traction on Facebook.

Sudha Ragunathan had already gone live for an interaction with her followers where she presented a brief concert. T M Krishna has organised a ticketed virtual concert, for which the responsehas been huge. In a first of its kind initiative, Hyderabad-based performers, researchers Carthik Shankar and Ajeesh Menon came together for a series of lec-dems under ‘Ekadantam Bhajeham’, where they celebrate the genius of Muthuswamy Dikshitar commemorating his 245th birth anniversary.

“We’ve regularly streamed the concerts organised by our sabha on YouTube/Facebook. In fact, we were to organise a concert in April, which is unlikely to happen in the current scenario. Streaming in the current scenario will certainly have increased significance because of the larger audience we have, but the organic quality of a live experience is something else. Live-streaming concerts from their homes is something that artistes can consider — it’ll give them fame and reach yes. I, however, see this as a stop-gap initiative which will helpful for the artist yet it won’t provide them with the satisfaction of a regular concert,” Ganapathi Murthy of Sri Karthikeya Gana Sabha shares.

Tumburu Music Academy, a brainchild of musician Sridhar Thoopurani, which has regularly maintained its digital presence for its events, was to host its monthly concert in this weekend (by Vaidyanathan Balasubramania), which now stands cancelled. Sridhar is, however, open to newer horizons at the hour. “While all the musicians remain at home, I am open to the possibility of organising concerts i.e. ensure a digital collaboration where one can club the sounds of the instruments and the voice of the vocalist together. Though I am not sure of the specifics and the technical snags that may occur, I would be open to the idea,” he states.

One doesn’t need to reinstate the fact that a vocal music concert need not always be held amid the presence of instrumentalists (they can instead live-stream their own solo concerts from home too and could give the Italian balconies a tough fight). Tambura is a home-grown option that a vocalist could consider, adds dancer, musician Geetha Ganesan. “Live-streaming can be a feasible option as long as it’s a single artiste who’s performing, otherwise syncing from different locations can be an issue. We need concerts and similar attempts by Hyderabad-based artistes because performances are a two-way exercise for an artiste — it enriches their soul and that of the audience too. And that people have come to appreciate the value of our art is a sign of hope,” she feels.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ctxf5k/article31205629.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf03livestreamingjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/has-the-classical-music-fraternity-considered-live-streaming-concerts-in-the-times-of-covid-19-outbreak-and-lockdown/article31205630.ece
336,2020/03/30,Listen to Vasu Dixit and The Thayir Sadam Project virtually,"The musicians are taking requests on social media and singing social distancing blues away

The four musicians in The Thayir Sadam Project — siblings Ambi and Bindu Subramanaim on violin and vocals, Mahesh Raghavan on iPad, and Akhshay on konakkol and mridanga, are busy attending to requests on Instagram. The group, which blends Indian classical, electronic and world music, wanted to ensure people do not miss out on music because of the lockdown.

Ambi said The Thayir Sadam Project took off two years ago spontaneously, just like the notion of connecting to listeners via social media last week. “We strive to make music available and this was the perfect way to reach people sequestered at home.

“When we asked people for their The Thayir Sadam Project favourites, the response was overwhelming,” says Ambi. “We got nearly 500 requests, some for the group and many for individual renditions. The range of requests was also mind-boggling. Some wanted a Carnatic kriti, others an English pop song, one asked for Todi raga to be elaborated, and one asked for a Korean song.”

“There was a request for the Beatles song, ‘Hey Jude’,” says Bindu. “I recorded the song at home. We posted a short clipping on Instagram Stories, people can listen to the full version on our website or YouTube.”

The Thayir Sadam Project is busy attending to song requests over 24 hours. “This is a nice way to engage people and keep musical conversations going,” says Mahesh. “We need to have a healthy mindset in trying times.”

Describing the mechanics of posting music, Ambi says, “Bindu and I are at home, Mahesh and Akshay are in their houses. Each of us work on our individual layers. We do the audio mixing and balancing later. We are also learning as the requests are varied from a Hindi film song to ‘Let it Go’ from Frozen. We promise the best of melodies even as we create a sound that is completely ours.”

Vasu Dixit online

A post on March 29 from composer and musician Vasu Dixit said Going live on Instahandle @thatextrastep from 7 pm. On March 30, at 10 am, Vasu kicked off his Quarantine Session on his YouTube channel with his song ‘Neelamegha.’ “This is the best we can do,” says Vasu. “We are so used to going out and presenting songs live. Some of my numbers are based on the ondu haadu ondu jaaga concept (one song for one venue) as the lyrics suit the particular space. I also collaborate with other musicians. However with social distancing, releasing songs and performing on digital platforms seems the best bet. It is a good way to stay in touch.”

The musician says the isolation will help him reflect on his music and lyrics. Hari, who runs an NGO called Take that Extra Step asked Vasu to perform for half an hour on March 29 on Instagram. “Apoorva Gnaan, sent me lyrics, which I used for ‘Neelamegha’. The lyrics, which talk of Yashoda’s worry for Krishna as he is on the battlefield, echo these troubling times. The song follows the mother and son’s exchanges every evening after the battle.”

Vasu is used to offering preludes of his songs on Instagram. Now, however, people place requests to hear his solo numbers and songs from Swarathma. “Even if there are no live concerts, we can treat this as practice sessions. That is why when someone asks for ‘Raagi Tandeera' or ‘Taaraka Bindige,’ I immediately record and post it.”

Remembering an interesting request, Vasu says, “A listener said, ‘We have elders in the family who want to listen to your ‘Amma’ and ‘Mullu Koneya Mele’. Could you please present it on your acoustic guitar?’ What more can one ask for?” says Vasu who promises a variety of compositions which are not only devotional, but also have a social and spiritual context.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/9ukebz/article31205332.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG20200215165820,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/how-musicians-are-taking-requests-on-social-media-and-singing-social-distancing-blues-away/article31205334.ece

Billie Eilish sang on her sofa, Elton John played a keyboard belonging to his children, and the Backstreet Boys sang in harmony from five locations as dozens of musicians put on a fundraiser for the warriors against the Coronavirus pandemic.

Those who performed from their homes for the ‘IHeart Living Room Concert for America’ also included Mariah Carey, Camila Cabello, Alicia Keys, Shawn Mendes and Sam Smith.

The one-hour show, broadcast on Fox television without commercials, was the biggest joint effort in the pandemic to lift spirits, raise money for those in the frontlines, and remind Americans to wash their hands and keep their distance.

“There are doctors, nurses and scientists on the frontlines. They’re living proof that most superheroes don’t wear capes,” said John, who hosted the show from his kitchen. “We hope this bit of entertainment can feed and fuel your souls.”

All the performances and appearances by celebrities ranging from comedian Ellen DeGeneres to R&B artist Lizzo and country singer Tim McGraw were filmed on phones, home cameras or online platforms.

The songs were interspersed with short personal stories from nurses, doctors, truckers, grocery staff, and other essential workers as millions of Americans entered a third week subjected to orders to stay home.

Dr Elvis Francois, a surgeon from Rochester, Minnesota, stole hearts on social media with an emotional rendition of ‘Imagine’ performed in medical scrubs.

“Did this doctor just out sing every artist that’s performed?” one viewer, Ender Wiggins, asked on Twitter.

The concert, also broadcast on iHeart radio stations nationwide, urged listeners to donate to charities Feeding America, and First Responders Children's Foundation.

The amount raised was not immediately known, but more than $1 million was donated in the first 10 minutes, courtesy of $500,000 from household goods giant Procter & Gamble and a matching sum from Fox Television.

“My heart goes out to people who have lost loved ones and also those who are losing their jobs,” said Lady Gaga, clad in pink sweatpants and a hoodie.

Alicia Keys, singing ‘Rise Up,’ Dave Grohl performing ‘My Hero’, and Billie Joe Armstrong's acoustic version of ‘Boulevard of Broken Dreams’ spoke to the hardships of millions of those working or laid off as stores, restaurants, gyms and movie theatres have shut down.

“After we come out of this horrible thing, I hope we are nicer to each other, and fairer to one another,” John said.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/du81fo/article31204177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31ELTONJOHN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/from-sofas-and-kitchens-music-stars-hold-coronavirus-concert-fundraiser/article31204181.ece

Even as the health and police authorities continue to grapple with the challenge of keeping a constant watch on thousands quarantined across the State, a Japan-based start-up founded by four Malayali youngsters has come up with a smart solution, ensuring real-time monitoring of the quarantined.

The start-up, Pinmicro, which has an office at Infopark here, is set to conduct a demonstration of the solution, meTrack, for the State health authorities later this week. meTrack was developed by the start-up over the last few weeks by tweaking their existing solution, Assistplus, after COVID-19 spread across the globe and they started receiving enquiries about a potential solution to help effective implementation of quarantine.

“Our existing solution was to monitor the time spent by people inside facilities such as hospitals and factories or by guests in front of a pavilion during an event, to analyse their interest.

“We added a few more components to it to develop meTrack,” said Tiby Kuruvila, Global CEO of Pinmicro.

meTrack enables health authorities to track and locate quarantined people with the help of a smartphone application and a smart-band. It also offers a web console that provides health administrators with dashboards to monitor all quarantine activities real-time.

“The platform integrates multiple technologies including GPS, WiFi and Bluetooth to ensure that the system is reliable and foolproof. Since meTrack can seamlessly integrate with Assistplus at quarantine locations, doctors or nurses can locate patients in real-time and provide fast patient care, including the task of locating critical assets such as ventilators,” said A.V.

341,2020/03/30,Paddy harvest nearly complete in major holdings in Ernakulam,"Govt. has exempted farm operations from lockdown

The puncha paddy harvest in major holdings near Piravom, Nedumbassery and Mulanthuruthy in the district is near complete with the government exempting paddy farm operations from the purview of the lockdown being observed against the spread of COVID-19.

Though there had been a brief shortage of harvesting and baling machines, the problems had been overcome and the harvest was near complete in most of the places, said a senior official of the Agriculture Department on Monday. Around 700 hectares of paddy fields in the district were nearing completion of harvest for the season.

The declaration of the lockdown had resulted in a shortage of harvesting machines as some of the operators, who were usually engaged during the harvest season, had returned to their hometowns in Tamil Nadu.

However, local agro service centres had stepped in to fill the gap with both machines and operators, said an official in Nedumbassery. The official said that around 35 hectares had been harvested in Parakkadavu and another 10 hectares remained at Nedumbassery. There should be no problem in completing the harvest as machines and operators are available. The problem in Parakkadavu was that the first machine that was deployed developed some trouble and later four more machines were brought in, the official added. Around 200 hectares of paddy fields spread over Amballoor and Edakkattuvayal, that includes the Thottarapuncha holdings, have been harvested completely. The initial problem was that the machine operators had expressed fears over police action against those who stepped out of their homes. However, paddy farming was later exempted from the lockdown and harvest operations were near complete, said an official.

Over 400 hectares of paddy crop spread over Thirumaradi, Ramamangalam, Elanji, Pampakkuda and Koothattukulam are being harvested without any problem. There was some uncertainty initially regarding harvest because of the lockdown. However, the issue had been resolved, said an official in Piravom. Shortage of machine operators was not a problem since the agro service centre had offered its machines and equipment.

An official said there was some problem in getting seed farm land at Okkal and Aluva harvested. But, the Aluva farm is now being harvested manually and the Okkal farm land, around five hectares, is being harvested using machines.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/paddy-harvest-nearly-complete-in-major-holdings-in-ernakulam/article31211669.ece

Vegetable, fruit and egg supplies resumed on Monday after a gap of four days, bringing down prices and reassuring both retailers and consumers about the availability of produce in the coming days.

Supplies had been taken care of for the coming week and there should be no shortage according to the present schedule, said C.J. George, wholesaler in Ernakulam market, which is the hub for most parts of the district.

Thirty-five loads of vegetables and fruits arrived at the Ernakulam market on Monday, said N.H. Shameed, another wholesale dealer. He said the supplies arrived from Oddanchatram in Tamil Nadu and arrangements had been made for supplies to continue during the week.

However, he said that wholesale dealings had come down about 50%. There were hardly any retail buyers in the Ernakulam market, mostly due to the restrictions on movement and the lack of public transport, said Mr. Shameed.

The price of small onions (shallot) continued to rule high because of a paucity of supplies while big onion prices have cooled to less than ₹50 a kg in the retail market now.

Vegetable cowpea price was ₹40 per kg in the retail market. Similarly, the price of okra (₹50 a kg), French beans (₹60), carrot (₹60), and beetroot (₹50) had come down and was reaching pre-lockdown levels, said Mr. Shameed.

He said the supplies would be further raised with the arrival of another 16 loads of vegetables and fruits scheduled for Tuesday.

Meanwhile, egg prices had reached a stable level, said Mr. George. There is no shortage of eggs. On normal days, about three lakh eggs reach the Ernakulam market.

Now, with consumption reduced by about 60%, supplies may idle for a while.

With hotels and schools as well as other institutional buyers reducing purchases, egg sales had dipped sharply. This has resulted in considerably good stock position.

Mr. Shameed said the State government had swung into action to ensure regular vegetable supplies. Wholesalers here had also talked to traders in Tamil Nadu about regular supplies. There should be no more problems with the supply channel fully open, he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ldg77p/article31211613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30KI-VEGGIES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/as-vegetable-and-egg-supplies-resume-prices-cool-in-kochi/article31211617.ece

Trusting the messages, several men from other States who got stuck in the district because of the lockdown had come out of their quarters and defied the prohibition.

Shareef Thuvvakkunnu, 36, from Edavanna was arrested on Monday. P.K. Sakir from Edavanna too was arrested soon after the false message began to spread. They were Youth Congress workers.

District Police Chief U. Abdul Kareem said that those spreading false information especially during the lockdown would have to face strong legal action.

He said 61 cases were registered on Monday for spreading false message in the district. So far, police have booked 318 persons for false messages in the district.

YC denies charge

Youth Congress State vice president Riyas Mukkoli said here on Monday that the police had arrested the Youth Congress men on false charges. He said one of them had posted in a local WhatsApp group a message he got from elsewhere to check its veracity, and not to spread it.

Mr. Riyas said some other men had edited it and spread it with the intention of trapping the Youth Congress worker. “Police should arrest those who edited his message and spread it with clear intention to tarnish him,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/two-arrested-for-misinformation/article31210389.ece
345,2020/03/30,Special projects for migrants in Kozhikode,"Police launch awareness drive, collect essential goods for workers

In the wake of the recent protests by migrant labourers in Payippad and Perumbavoor, the police have come up with better surveillance and supportive measures for over 1,500 migrant labour camps in Kozhikode district.

There are 31,800-odd migrant labourers in various camps in the district. A 10-member district-level migrant labourers’ welfare committee comprising government officers is now coordinating special projects for the workers. Camp management committees have been formed to look into their issues.

Police officials said action will be taken against social media messages that foment unrest among migrant workers. Station House Officers and Cybercell teams have been asked to trace such messages. Job contractors, who are primarily responsible for caring their labourers, will also be made more accountable.

‘Apna Bhai’

In Kozhikode rural area, the police have launched a project called ‘Apna Bhai’ to collect essential commodities for migrant labourers. Customers can put goods in the boxes kept in front of shops and supermarkets.

Launched in seven police stations limits in the Nadapuam division on Monday, the project will be extended to other divisions on Tuesday. According to District Police Chief (Kozhikode Rural) A. Sreenivas, the project evoked warm response.

Awareness drive

“We have also deputed home guards as part of a special drive to make migrant labourers aware of the situation and allay their fears,” he said.

Karunakaran, a home guard from Meppayur station who became popular for his Hindi awareness session for migrant labourers, has been officially appointed the mascot of the rural police to lead more awareness sessions in migrant camps. The decision to put him in the lead role was taken after a video showing his awareness session went viral in social media.

According to police sources, some of the migrant labourers are concerned about the payment of their room rent during the lockdown period. Some others are yet to get their wages from the contractors. All these will be addressed on time to ensure their comfortable stay in the district during the lockdown period, they said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/special-projects-for-migrants-in-kozhikode/article31208757.ece
346,2020/03/30,Shortage of staff hits door delivery of essentials in Kochi,"Traders who accept orders online say they lack manpower to meet demand

A section of the traders here has started taking orders from customers through WhatsApp and SMSs in view of the lockdown though their efforts to deliver goods at the doorstep remain unfulfilled owing to the shortage of employees.

The service has mostly been offered by margin-free shops and kirana stores as a measure to reduce the number of customers turning up at shops. “We had sent a WhatsApp message to a few customers stating that we will accept orders through mobile. The message was shared among many others. On an average, we get 30 to 40 orders,” said the owner of a margin-free shop in Aluva.

The system has helped reduce visitors considerably after it was launched two days ago. “The only hurdle is that I am able to get items ready the next day only as there is a shortage of workers. Those staying at faraway places are not coming to work. I am now managing with a few inter-State workers and my family members,” he said.

Customers get a message when orders are ready. Some traders have taken an extra step by arranging a few auto drivers who are ready to deliver goods at the doorstep. Customers can pay bill using a mobile payment gateway after getting details of bill on their mobile.

However, the restrictions imposed by the police on vehicular movement have stopped a few traders from taking orders through WhatsApp. A store owner in Padivattom said that he had no other choice, but to retain the earlier model as there was a shortage of staff. “The existing employees seem reluctant to deliver orders at homes fearing police action against them,” said a trader.

Shops did not witness any major rush on Monday as majority of the customers had stocked essentials ahead of the lockdown. The merchant community said that prices had also started stabilising after the restrictions on trucks carrying essentials were eased on inter-State borders.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/shortage-of-staff-hits-door-delivery-of-essentials-in-kochi/article31207541.ece

348,2020/03/30,Complete lockdown again from tomorrow in Dakshina Kannada,"People unnecessarily coming out is the reason for the decision, says Minister

There will be another three-day complete lockdown in Dakshina Kannada stopping all commercial activities except sales of milk and medicine from April 1 to April 3. This will come after Tuesday’s relaxation to allow people to buy essentials.

A decision would be taken on Tuesday afternoon, district in-charge Minister Kota Srinivas Poojari said and added that it was almost certain that the lockdown would be extended for another three days.

Residents in the district were left wondering how the situation in Dakshina Kannada was different either from neighbouring Udupi or far-away Bengaluru where there was no lockdown on sale of essential commodities.

Mr. Poojari told The Hindu that arrangements were made to lift essentials from wholesale dealers to retailers in every part of the district by Monday evening through village accountants and PDOs concerned. A committee of officials and public would ensure the sale of essential commodities to the public while ensuring social distancing on Tuesday.

Regarding continuation of the lockdown, the Minister said that several instances of wandering, roaming around, etc., across the district defeated the very purpose of the lockdown. A large number of COVID-19 positive cases getting reported from neighbouring Kasargod district in Kerala was another concern. There was no personal interest but public interest behind the decision, he said.

Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath said that the district has around 3,000 people under quarantine who would come out in the next couple of days. Complete lockdown was essential to prevent any possible spread of COVID-19, he added.

While retailers would lift essential commodities from wholesale dealers on Monday and Tuesday, the administration is arranging for online supply as well as neighbourhood on-call supply of essential commodities from Wednesday, Mr. Kamath promised.

With the three-day lockout being relaxed on Tuesday for a few hours followed by another three-day lockout, enforcement authorities were concerned over the possible pandemonium when people come out in large numbers to buy essential commodities.

Already under panic, people might resort to further panic buying to store essential commodities for future complete lockdowns, if any.

Sources said that the bureaucracy was against a complete lockdown as people would be pushed to further panic and was in favour of extended open hours with street-side vending of essential commodities to avoid crowding.

However, the elected representatives of the district, including MP Nalin Kumar Kateel and Minister Mr. Poojari, have insisted for a complete lockdown to prevent further spread of COVID-19.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/xbqlwq/article31211848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MNMANGLOCKDOWN1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/complete-lockdown-again-from-tomorrow-in-dakshina-kannada/article31211849.ece

However, they will be allowed between 6 a.m. and 3 p.m. on Tuesday, said district in-charge Minister Kota Srinivasa Poojary here on Sunday.

Talking to reporters after a three-hour-long meeting with officials, Mr. Poojary said that the sale of milk, petrol and diesel and newspapers will continue to be allowed between 6 a.m. and noon. Pharmacies will remain open and there will be no restriction for supplying domestic gas cylinders. Mr. Poojary said that from April 2 ration shops will distribute ration for April and May to all below poverty line card holders. Ration shop owners have been asked to maintain social distancing norm and make use of hand sanitisers.

350,2020/03/30,The cost of the lockdown is pegged at about $120 billion,"Complete stop would put over 45 mn migrant daily wage earners out of work; government needs to do more to rescue industry and services if they’re to protect jobs

The complete 21-day COVID-19 shutdown of most economic activity has created new roadblocks, causing severe disruptive impact on both demand and supply side elements across sectors. The cost of the lockdown is pegged at around $120 billion (approximately ₹9 lakh crore) or 4% of the GDP.

Further, 90% of India’s workforce is employed in the unorganised sector and this lockdown will effectively put over 45 million migrants living off daily earnings out of work. Sectors like construction projects, mobility services, housekeeping and other informal sector employment will come to a sudden halt. The manufacturing sector faces a triple challenge. First, there are going to be serious supply chain disruptions not just when dealing with foreign parties, but also the domestic industry. Second, sectors like automobiles, pharmaceuticals, electronics, chemical products etc., are facing an imminent raw material and component shortage.

Third, the shutdown and resulting loss of revenue is certain to cause a number of bankruptcies and closures, especially in the MSME sector with corresponding disruption to supply chains.

On the demand side, several industries would get impacted starting with the consumer durable goods and will cascade to other intermediate goods and basic goods. The government was the major spender on investment in the infrastructure sector, which will slowdown now with resources and attention being diverted.

Hence, industries like steel and cement, which did well, last year, will stumble.

The services sector will see a fall in demand. These include aviation, hotels, restaurants, tourism, retail malls etc. The real estate sector, which was already in deep trouble, could well slide even more,in the medium term at least.

Even 10-20% job losses among its 7.3 million employees in restaurants across the country would mean up to 15 lakh unemployed. Any delay in addressing the economic consequences will lead to massive job losses.

SICCI suggests the following: the Reserve Bank of India has to address two problems: Transmission on rate cuts has been inadequate.

Second, rate cuts by themselves are unlikely to stimulate demand as the primary cause for demand contraction will be on account of consumer confidence being low. Though the RBI has provided some relief to industries, it is inadequate considering the gravity of the situation. SICCI feels that only the stronger firms in any sector can have the capacity to keep salary payments going, in the absence of any revenue earnings.

Firms cannot be expected to drain their already stretched cash-flows. To tide over the present crisis, banks should give three months’ salary as overdraft facility to the employees of companies which can be escrowed to the companies with a nominal rate of interest not exceeding 3%.

The same could be recovered from companies over a period of three months, six months after commencement of production, post the present crisis. On electronic component and semi-conductor industry, the impact will be felt in the areas of logistics, packaging and testing. A special package should be designed for this highly skilled industry.

In the case of contract workers, many casual and informal workers are directly or indirectly dependent on the survival of small and medium enterprises for jobs.

The government could lend support through tax holidays and zero-interest loans for three months. In the case of services sector, the government should consider contributing the employer’s share of PF for all employees earning less than ₹20,000 per month and ESI contribution for all employees earning below the statutory threshold level of ₹21,000 per month, for a period of 12 months. For firms that have difficulties in managing their cash flows, the government should extend a government-backed loan guarantee, on the basis of which firms can raise loans on preferential terms to the extent of 25% of their existing working capital arrangements. All rating agencies may be advised to suspend rating reviews till the lockdown is over. The RBI needs to come up with a special window to provide liquidity to NBFCs and microfinance institutions in this period. The government should ensure that all refunds across tax legislation — up to75% should be given without any verification and any wrongful claim can be recovered without any interest.

Private sector hospitals need to be encouraged to provide specific number of isolation wards to the poor and extended financial assistance on soft terms.

Export incentive schemes like Sec. 10AA for SEZ units under the I-T Act should be extended for one more year – i.e up to March 31, 2021. Further, the recent Import Export Policy should be extended for one more year.

In the absence of new Export/Import Policy, all export incentives viz MEIS,SCIS, EPCG license etc. should be extended for one more year. All charges including, port charges, penal charges, demurrages should be waived. Further, all agencies viz ports, air cargo terminals, all custodians of cargo and all shipping lines have to waive penal charges.

Fixed charges levied may be waived and the industry may be charged only on the actual consumption of electricity. Immediate refund of IGST will help exporter in dealing with liquidity issues.

In order to have Business Continuity Plans where the economy is better prepared for a work from home mode, the government should halve GST rates on all laptops, routers, cloud services, dongles and such other equipment and services.

All companies should be asked to devote their CSR funds exclusively towards creation of clean quarantine centres, and addition of hospital beds, ventilators and PPEs, besides investing in testing and other facilities aimed at preventing the spread of the virus.

High Networth Individuals should be encouraged to do likewise. Additional tax concessions may be looked at for this sector. Women’s Self-Help Groups and the informal sector should be asked to produce masks, hand sanitisers, among others in a big way. Banks should be asked fund these activities and State governments should arrange for the marketing of these products to their local primary health centres.

351,2020/03/30,MFI collection to be hit most by lockdown,"Home loan segment to be less affected, says rating agency

Rating agency Crisil has said the nationwide lockdown due to COVID-19 will have near- term impact on collections and fresh-loan disbursements of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and the micro finance institutions (MFIs) , in particular.

The agency said MFIs will be the most impacted because collection of repayments involves visit to households, such borrowers typically have weak credit profiles and their income generation activities would be disrupted.

Home loans will be less affected as a majority of the borrowers are salaried and collections are through auto-debit instructions though affordable housing loans could witness challenges because of higher proportion of self-employed borrowers, whose income streams have been affected by the lockdown.

Vehicle finance would also face challenges in commercial vehicle loans because curtailed traffic will lead to weak earnings for fleet operators, Crisil said.

“We see the impact continuing after the lockdown ends, based on the profile of borrowers. Those self-employed, in informal jobs, and earning their salary in cash would bear the brunt beyond the near term because the economy will take time to recover,” said Krishnan Sitaraman, senior director, Crisil CRISIL Ratings.

The rating agency has already lowered its GDP growth estimate to 3.5% for fiscal 2021 from the 5.2% earlier.

It said any delay in return to normalcy will put pressure on collections and asset-quality metrics and any change in the behaviour of borrowers on payment discipline can affect delinquency levels.

“Disbursement of fresh loans will reduce substantially in the near team and remain muted in the medium term given the expected challenges on the economic front,” Crisil said.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/mfi-collection-to-be-hit-most-by-lockdown/article31211164.ece
352,2020/03/30,TRAI to telcos: Extend prepaid validity so users get uninterrupted services during lockdown,"TRAI has also sought details of the steps being taken to ensure availability of uninterrupted telecom services to such customers on a “priority basis”.

Sector regulator TRAI has asked telecom operators to extend the validity period of prepaid users to ensure that subscribers get uninterrupted services during the 21-day nationwide lockdown.

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has also sought details of the steps being taken to ensure availability of uninterrupted telecom services to such customers on a “priority basis“.

”...you are required to take necessary steps as deemed fit including extending the validity period to ensure that all prepaid subscribers can enjoy uninterrupted services during the period of lockdown,” TRAI said in a communication to all operators on Sunday.

The communication on “measures regarding ensuring availablity of recharge vouchers and payment options for prepaid services” comes in the backdrop of 21-day lockdown imposed in the country to deal with the outbreak and spread of coronavirus pandemic.

“Though the telecommunication services have been considered as essential services and thus granted an exception from closing down... However, lock down may adversely affect the working of customer service centres/point of sale locations,” TRAI said.

The regulator added: “Under the circumstances, it is quite possible that those subscribers who wish to top up their prepaid balances or wish to extend subscription to a prepaid tariff using offline channels may face hardships and/or disruption of services.”

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24, announced a complete lockdown of the entire country for 21 days in an unprecedented move to try halt the spread of the pandemic, shortly after which the Centre said road, rail and air services will remain suspended during this period.

354,2020/03/30,"Jobs scene absolutely unclear, says Teamlease’s Sabharwal","No one can foresee anything right now: temp staffing firm

The job scene has become absolutely unclear, because everything that’s being done to ‘murder the COVID-19 murders the economy,’ but that’s the right sequence, said Manish Sabharwal, chairman, Teamlease, a temporary staffing organisation.

The current situation thrown at the country, its businesses and its people by COVID-19, is ‘unmodellable’ and the net effect and emotional contagion will have a longer tail than the virus itself, he told The Hindu.

“Employers think about hiring and jobs in linear terms, but unfortunately the virus works in non-linear terms. With regard to existing jobs and the outlook for additional jobs, everybody is pretty much unclear. We should wait before we try and come up with scenarios for job markets.’’

There’s a huge difference between risk and uncertainty and nobody will be able to predict or plot different scenarios under uncertainty, as per Mr. Sabharwal.

On the impact of COVID-19 on businesses and employment, he said, “Right now, no one can foresee anything as it is premature for anyone to model the impact. We don’t know how long the situation will remain like this. Our priority is to deal with first things first, that’s saving lives. The first input we feed on a GPS is where you are and not where you are going.’’

COVID-19 pandemic concerns continued to grip the equity markets on Monday with the benchmark indices shedding more than 4% as the number of virus cases in India neared the 1,300- mark.

The 30-share Sensex plunged 1,375.27 points, or 4.61%, to close at 28,440.32. The broader Nifty settled at 8,281.10, shedding 379.15 points, or 4.38%.

The selling on Monday was led by banking and automobile majors with stocks such as Bajaj Finance, HDFC, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, M&M, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Maruti Suzuki India, Hero Motocorp and State Bank of India (SBI) leading the declines in the Sensex.

The sectoral induces, representing banking and financials sector, were among the worst hit on Monday.

Impact on NBFCs

According to Crisil, the 21-day lockdown will have near-term impact on collections and fresh loan disbursements of non-banking financial companies with the microfinance segment getting most impacted as home loan segment would be relatively better as most borrowers are salaried individuals.

A section of the market participants also believe that with the number of cases rising in India and globally, the lockdown could be extended thereby affecting the economy in a much more adverse manner than was expected earlier.

No lockdown extension

On Monday, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba said that the government does not have any plans to extend the 21-day lockdown announced on March 24.

The investor pessimism was reflected in the weak market breadth as almost 1,400 stocks declined on BSE as against only 881 gainers. Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) continued to sell Indian equities with Monday’s net selling pegged at ₹4,364 crore.

362,2020/03/30,New investors flock to market amid fall,"With stocks falling like ninepins, brokerages see surge in new clients looking to strike gold

The equity markets may well be witnessing their sharpest and quickest falls, but that is not deterring new investors from dabbling in stocks.

Brokerages have seen a spurt in new client additions as many investors want to buy stocks that are currently available at multi-year lows with the benchmarks having lost more than 30% from the record highs touched in January. “We have seen about 1.5 lakh new client additions this month, which is double the average monthly numbers seen in most months last year,” said Nithin Kamath, CEO, Zerodha.

“The trend is unique to this fall and the fact that people are working from home and so have more time to monitor and invest, is fuelling the trend. Having said that, if the fall continues for a longer tenure, then the opportunity might turn into pessimism,” added Mr. Kamath.

Discount broking firms, that are largely technology firms, seem to be benefiting the most as bulk of their clients are retail investors trading through the broking firm’s apps. “We are seeing about 80% higher client addition in March compared with the average monthly additions and are likely to add around 60,000 clients or more this month,” said Prakarsh Gagdani, CEO, 5Paisa, another discount broking firm.

Seizing the opportunity

“Most of the people who are opening accounts are the first timers. They are smart enough to seize this opportunity to invest when the prices are low. Young millennials are a smart lot that knows that investment in markets should be done when prices are at the bottom and not when they are at the peak,” added Mr. Gagdani. Similarly, Ravi Kumar, co-founder, Upstox, said that he was witnessing an unprecedented increase in demand for new accounts and while the brokerage saw a record addition of one lakh new accounts in December 2019, this month, it would be significantly higher.

Market volatility

“The growth is due to unprecedented levels of market volatility that we have seen recently, as well as a lot of new customers that are looking at this as the right opportunity to start investing due to attractive stock prices,” said Mr. Kumar.

365,2020/03/30,Work from Home in the time of COVID-19,"The implications for workers are also manifold in terms of productivity, training, and overall well-being.

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the subsequent work-from-home imperatives and lockdowns have led to significant economic disruptions around the world. As several millions of workers across diverse sectors are asked to self-quarantine, an understanding of the impact of this shift and mitigation strategies becomes critical. The insights from prior studies on the impact of work from home arrangements do not extend to the current context since these arrangements were mostly limited to a select group of workers and/or organizations and were often self-selected.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

To better understand the implications of the current imperative to work from home, including readiness of different sectors, cities, and occupations, we measured suitability of diverse occupations to work from home in India. We use a survey of over 3000 workers done in 2019 over 100 occupations listed in the 2004 National Classification of Occupations to assess the susceptibility of the occupations to automation. We use the survey questions to generate an index of suitability of the occupation to remote work or work from home (WFH) and the need for human proximity (HP). We then used the survey questions to create scores for WFH and HP for each occupation. The questions are designed such that a “1” (Strongly Disagree) corresponds to low WFH and HP and a “5” (Strongly Agree) corresponds to high WFH and HP for the occupation. The values for each occupation-level score are then averaged to obtain occupation-weighted industry and district scores for WFH and HP.

Figure I below presents the distribution of occupations along the two dimensions. The figure highlights the negative association between the two dimensions — the greater the need for human proximity, the lower is the suitability of the occupation to work from home. For example, occupations with highest suitability to work from home include occupations such as directors, computing professionals, and general managers, who also require minimal human proximity in executing their jobs. In contrast, the occupations with least suitability to work from home include professions like drivers, shop sales professionals, and domestic help that are also characterized by high human proximity.

However, what is interesting is that certain occupations, although characterized by high human proximity and low suitability to work from home, may well be amenable to this shift through technological innovation and technology-enabled business models. For example, teaching associate professionals is an occupation with low suitability to work from home. However, in the past few days, we have witnessed several ed-tech companies like Byjus and Coursera offer their content for free to students. This can likely lead to changes in consumer behavior and render learning and teaching more suitable to work from home than in the past. Similar innovations are coming to light in other areas such as telemedicine as well.

We further use the occupation-level scores on WFH and HP to construct a district-wise measure to understand the geographical impact of lockdown across India. We measure it by dividing our HP index by the WFH index. Disruption will be higher if jobs require more human proximity and at the same time, there is less potential for WFH. The distribution of this disruption across districts is shown in Figure II below. In this figure, the darker the color, the higher the economic disruption.

image/svg+xml

We find that there are large differences across districts when it comes to disruption. The southern peninsula seems to be less affected compared to the northern and central regions. The reason being that South India is likely characterized by greater levels of automation and has relatively fewer occupations which require high human proximity. Additionally, the inverse relationship of HP with WFH also implies that these activities are more amenable to WFH. The central and northern regions have larger section of people engaged in tradable sectors, which requires more human proximity and at the same time, cannot be done from home. This might lead to relatively larger disruption in these districts.

Finally, what are the key takeaways for workers, firms and government? The latter two need to understand WFH potential of various jobs and sectors to design appropriate policies and practices for dealing with the current crises and to plan future transition. For example, the government needs to design support policies for sectors and workers. A one size fits all policy will be less effective in mitigating the risk optimally. Similarly, firms need to check how they compare to other competitors in their sector. The implications for workers are also manifold in terms of productivity, training, and overall well-being. These developments will have long lasting impact and will require close monitoring for informed decision-making.

366,2020/03/30,From apathy to action,"In dealing with the crisis, the Centre should not only learn from States but also act on its own

In dealing with the health and economic crisis, the Central government’s apathy is disappointing. The Prime Minister’s speech created panic even for the well-off. For the most vulnerable, it triggered a huge exodus from the cities. They were given neither time to prepare for the unplanned lockdown nor support to cope with it. A few days into the lockdown, either as an afterthought or due to public pressure, a relief package was announced, but it is woefully inadequate. For a government that cares so much about optics, the lack of acknowledgement of, let alone relief for, the millions of migrant workers who are stranded without work, money or transport was perplexing.

Also Read An inadequate lockdown package

The government chose to ignore the plight of migrants even though a solution exists. School buildings, community halls and stadiums can serve as temporary shelters. Foodgrains can be supplied in these places for workers to run self-managed community kitchens for themselves, with hygiene protocols. They can prepare food packets (to reduce crowding) for anyone who is hungry. The more shelters and community kitchens, the less crowding there will be.

Relief measures

Some existing programmes have been declared as new relief measures — for example, the payment of the first instalment of the PM Kisan Yojana money. The Finance Minister announced that MGNREGA workers would earn an additional ₹2,000. This assumes that work sites are open, and that the Central government will guarantee 100 days of work. In the last financial year, less than 7% of active job card holders got 100 days of work. The wage increase of ₹20/day was, in fact, part of an annual exercise which preceded the lockdown. Similarly, some States too are focusing only on optics. The U.P. Chief Minister announced that ₹556 crore of wages due to NREGA workers (from the previous financial year) will be paid immediately. So, wages that are already overdue are being projected as a new relief measure.

Oddly, the Centre has blocked attempts by others to ease the economic blow. When two High Courts granted temporary relief on loan recoveries, the Supreme Court stayed those orders in response to a challenge by the Union of India.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Response of the States

Though there is a glimmer of hope from State governments, they lack sufficient resources as they are still owed their GST refund by the Centre.

Kerala has been at the forefront of fighting the disease spread and planning for a lockdown. When Anganwadis and schools had to be shut down, Kerala initiated dry ration supplies to their homes. When other States also shut down schools and Anganwadis, the Supreme Court took suo motu notice of Kerala’s actions. In response, the Central government issued an advisory to provide cooked meals or food security allowance. Jharkhand opted for cash. During the lockdown, when people are being asked to stay home and supply chains are in danger of being disrupted, what sense does it make to give cash?

Some States are also learning from one another: community kitchens already exist in some States such as Tamil Nadu. Others like Kerala and Delhi have quickly scaled up. Other relief measures include advance payment of social security pensions, free PDS ration, food packets for those who are not covered by the PDS and free bus travel (Rajasthan).

One welcome announcement on March 26 was the doubling of PDS rations for the coming three months. Here too, Central inaction and class bias are evident. While a Personnel Ministry order says biometric attendance for Central government employees will be stopped, to reduce the risk of community transmission, no such order from the Food Ministry has come yet. Some States have already suspended biometric authentication for buying PDS ration. Biometric authentication has been a source of exclusion (example, when authentication failed) from the PDS. Suspending it will help further. The Centre should support the States’ actions and learn from them. Before it is too late, the Centre itself must act by increasing resource allocation and setting up sector-specific committees to facilitate prompt responses.

367,2020/03/30,An inadequate lockdown package,"The government must ensure that the spectre of SARS-CoV-2 is not replaced by the spectre of hunger

The Central government has asked States to seal borders to prevent lakhs of workers, who have been rendered jobless overnight with no guarantee of wages and shelter, from reaching their villages. The workers are to be herded into quarantine zones. These atrocious actions amount to a mass criminalisation of the labour force of India. The workers are paying for the callousness of the government in declaring a lockdown without even a day’s notice.

The Home Ministry has also invoked Sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, to imprison those who violate government instructions. However, it is not using the same law to transfer essential funds to the States in the front line of dealing with the COVID-19 crisis.

Also Read From apathy to action

The sealing orders come after the Finance Minister’s announcement of a “package of ₹1.7 lakh crore for the poor”. If the workers really believed that the package was helpful, they would not have started their long march home.

Welcome initiatives

There are two components of the Central government package that are welcome. One, households that are already entitled to receive foodgrains at subsidised rates from the public distribution system will be given an additional 5 kg free for the next three months. With the sharp rise in the prices of essential commodities, this measure will also bring down the prices of foodgrains. The government should follow this up with the inclusion of other essential commodities at subsidised rates through the PDS. Offering one kilo of pulses a month for an entire family, as has been done in the package, does not even rate as a charitable gesture. It is also too small an amount to have any impact on the rising prices of pulses.

The challenge will be to ensure that the free foodgrains reach the beneficiaries. For this all the conditionalities should be waived. For example, lakhs of people, including migrant workers, do not have ration cards. They should not be denied free foodgrains; their presence in the village should be enough proof of their existence. Similarly, the thousands of migrant workers stranded in the cities should also have access to free foodgrains. Mechanisms have to be set up urgently.

Two, all beneficiaries of the PM Ujjwala Yojana will be given free LPG cylinders over a three-month period. Apart from monetary relief, this will especially help women who will find it difficult to step out of their homes to collect fuel. So far, for the last few years, the government has not given any benefits to the people in spite of the sharp reduction in global crude prices, the levying of higher duties on petroleum products, and the consequent windfall in government revenues. A free gas cylinder would be a tiny portion of this revenue. Nevertheless, it is welcome.

Problems in the package

The rest of the “package” can be described in many ways, the most polite of which would be to call it disappointingly inadequate. In fact, although claimed to be a package of ₹1.7 lakh crore, the actual additional funds allocated by the government for alleviating economic distress caused by measures to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 are much smaller and mainly notional.

For crores of daily workers the reality is that if they stay home, their families can’t eat. For this large section of the population, what was required was an immediate cash transfer, through the PM Jan-Dhan Yojana or MNREGA accounts of a minimum of ₹5,000 for the three-week period of the lockdown. Instead, the government has decided to give a cash transfer of just ₹500 a month to women with Jan-Dhan accounts. This is around 53% of the 38 crore accounts. The other cash transfer is equally meagre. The government has decided to give ₹1,000 to pension holders who are widows, disabled and senior citizens. As is known, these are not universal schemes. Only a small percentage of such citizens, about 3 crore people, get the pension. Taken together the cash transfers to the poor comes to under ₹35,000 crore.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

These cash transfers are the lowest in the world. Every other country hit by the COVID-19 pandemic has done more for its poor and working people than the Indian government. It is a shame that a government that can write off bad loans, primarily to corporates, amounting to ₹2.4 lakh crore (in 2019) cannot even match that amount to save its poor from certain hunger and starvation. Whereas countries have guaranteed up to 70% to 80% of workers’ wages to prevent lay-offs, the Indian government limits it to a subsidy on EPF. If workers are thrown out of employment, what good would this be?

The Finance Minister claimed that 5 crore families would benefit from a ₹20 increase in the daily wages for MGNREGA workers. This is based on the assumption that all workers who are registered get 100 days of work a year. The MGNREGA website itself contradicts the Minister’s claims. The average workdays are just between 45 to 49 days a year, which means a less than ₹1,000 annual benefit from the measly wage increase. Moreover, there are a substantial amount of wage arrears that the Finance Minister was silent on. In the lockdown period, all MGNREGA work has stopped. Shockingly, the guidelines issued by the Home Ministry on March 24 do not consider agricultural work as an essential service. The Central government has to change its guidelines so that rural workers can demand work under MGNREGA.

Coronavirus lockdown | At ‘Zero Point’ on Yamuna Expressway, flight from hunger beats fight against virus

The ₹2,000 for farmers is already a government scheme which was due in four months and has been accounted for in the Budget. It would be deceitful if this amount were to be included in the ₹1.7 lakh crore package, as seems to be the case. Also the District Mineral Fund, which is legally mandated to be used for tribal welfare in mining-affected districts, is now to be used by State governments for meeting COVID-19-related expenditure. It is illegal to divert funds meant for the most exploited of our society to fulfil the financial responsibilities of the Central government.

An avoidable tragedy

The government’s refusal to take the people into confidence about the lockdown that had already been planned, as indicated by the Prime Minister in his second address on COVID-19, has led to immense avoidable distress. Thousands of workers remain stranded without food, shelter or money in cities. Countless have walked hundreds of kilometres, facing hostile police forces, just to get home. A lockdown which is considered essential to fight SARS-CoV-2 cannot lead to a disproportionate burden on the poor. The government must expand its package to ensure that the spectre of SARS-CoV-2 is not replaced by the spectre of hunger and suffering for the majority of Indians. At a time of crisis when India unites, the lockdown should not mean a lockdown of the rights of the working poor.

368,2020/03/30,Looking beyond just diagnosis and quarantine,"There is need in India for a rapid response research and development team to handle viral onslaughts

A pandemic is upon the world and coronavirus is not the last word. Ebola, Zika, Nipah, SARS, MERS, H1N1 and now COVID-19 — the viral onslaughts will continue. Mutations of known viruses will periodically cause havoc, whatever be the reasons. While the Zika virus is spread by Aedes mosquitoes, the main reason for these viral infections seems to be the proximity and contact with animals including wild animals, either as exotic food menu or the use of animal parts as aphrodisiacs. Bats seem to be another constant source of new viruses. Seafood has also been stated to be a cause for the Wuhan outbreak.

In India, given the population density and unsatisfactory hygiene conditions and awareness, citizens can face serious situation even though the disease may have originated elsewhere. Bacterial infections such as cholera, typhoid have drug and vaccine options. Some of the viruses listed above do not have a vaccine or drugs available as yet. In India the options are always limited to diagnosis as per World Health Organization protocols and seem to be the exclusive domain of the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and its designated centres. I feel that it is important for India to be able to do much better in terms of therapeutic options, although prevention is the best option. But, there are always leakages as can be seen with COVID-19 cases in the developed countries. India does have the expertise to put a team together to respond much more than just diagnosis and quarantine.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

On sequencing

What can be done? The first requirement is to sequence the genome of all the isolates from infected patients in India. COVID-19, for example, is an RNA virus. This would require conversion to DNA and then the sequence of the alphabets (ATGC) worked out. COVID-19 is less than 30kb (30,000) alphabets in size and can be sequenced in 24 hours in India. There was a suggestion in the article, “How is India containing COVID-19?” (‘FAQ’ page, The Hindu, March 8, 2020), that the virus in India is different from that in China on the basis of genome sequence made available by NIV, Pune.

The virus is evolving rapidly and the mutations seen in the virus isolates in the United States, for example, are different from those in China. There was also a hint that this could also be due to sequencing error. It needs to be realised that the copying mechanism of RNA to DNA can make errors.

In any case, it is important to sequence the virus isolates in at least three different institutions in India to ensure that sequencing errors are eliminated. A knowledge of genome sequence is essential to design drugs and vaccines.

Coronavirus | India shares two SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences

In the short and long term

A quick response is to evaluate repurposed known drugs (a drug development strategy predicated on the reuse of existing licensed drugs for new medical indications) including natural products, for therapy. For example, in the case of COVID-19, anti-HIV drugs are being evaluated. Even hydroxy chloroquine, an antimalarial, is suggested as an adjunct drug option, since it can make the acidic endosome compartment in which the virus replicates alkaline to prevent the process. One other option is to try passive immunisation with plasma derived from convalescing patients, who have completely recovered. Yet another strategy is to clone B cells from such patients to make therapeutic antibodies. All these would require informed consent from patients and policy decisions.

A long-term approach could be to clone the genome, make recombinant antigens and then test for vaccine potential and new drug design. A phage library expressing all possible human antibodies (single chain) is available for screening. The virus, or its mimic, needs to be cultured for drug screening. All these approaches would eventually need clinical trials to be taken forward on fast-track with the cooperation of the office of the Drug Controller General of India.

Use the vast expertise

My estimate of a quick response is three months, and long term is 18 months. In my opinion the expert team should represent the following areas with institutions listed in parenthesis as examples: clinical virology (NIV, Pune; Translational Health Science and Technology Institute, Faridabad, Haryana), molecular virology (Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad; the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru), scale-up of vaccine production (Serum Institute of India, Pune; Gennova, Pune; Bharat Biotech, Hyderabad), clinical trial and drugs (Sun Pharma, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra; Reddy Labs, Hyderabad; Drug Controller General of India), DNA/RNA sequencing expertise (National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, Kalyani; Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad; Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi).

I want to emphasise the point that the institutions listed in parenthesis are only examples and there are many others and with over-lapping expertise, that includes the private sector. Such an expert committee can be overseen by an independent expert committee comprising senior, experienced scientists and administrators. The committees should cut across the territorial integrity of government science and technology departments and include the private sector.

Coronavirus | India to join WHO’s COVID-19 trials

The bottom line is to make use of the expertise built in the country over the years to scientifically respond to such challenges in terms of therapeutic options that are at least as important as sending up satellites into space or landing a man on the moon.

369,2020/03/30,Everyone counts: On Census-NPR postponement,"The Centre must use the opportunity of the pause in NPR to redraft questions

The Centre’s decision to postpone the first phase of the 2021 Census, earlier planned to start on April 1, was expected in view of the COVID-19 outbreak that has brought life to a standstill in India and across the world. The 21-day national lockdown called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is until April 15, but the return of any semblance of normalcy in daily life will take many more weeks, if not months. India is still struggling to make sense of the extent and intensity of the pandemic and the accompanying and inevitable economic calamity. What is for certain is that all resources, public and private, will need to be mobilised, first for combating the malady and then for tending society and the economy back to its health and dynamism. The Census is a massive exercise, which involves mass contact and diversion of resources. According to the original schedule, the first phase, from April to September, would have included house listing and updating of the National Population Register, and the second phase, in February 2021, would have been population enumeration. The Centre has done well by putting off the first phase until further orders. State governments can now focus on the pressing task of combating the coronavirus.

The unexpected suspension of the Census operation also opens a fresh window, and an entirely new context, for reconciliation between the Centre and States on the exercise itself. If the NPR exercise, and the allied questions regarding citizenship rights had turned India into a cauldron of discord, the pandemic forced the collective attention of the country, nay the world, on the interconnectedness of modern life. Several State governments had made their opposition clear to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, and the additional questions in the NPR pro forma that many fear is a prelude to something more cynical and divisive that is based on some quaint ideas of nationhood. The Centre clarified that people could choose to not respond to these questions, but never bothered to address the underlying concerns. The pandemic is a reminder that the future of humanity is collective and cannot be fragmented. The Centre can turn this crisis into an opportunity to restore mutually respectful terms for relations with States and harmony among communities — both currently frayed. Unshakeable national unity is essential for the country to tide over the pandemic crisis. If India can come out of this more united and more resolute, the pains of the pandemic will fade sooner. The coronavirus is forcing the re-examination in many nations about national power. The Centre must use this sobering backdrop to analyse India’s priorities as a country and revisit its idea of citizenship and plans for the NPR.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/everyone-counts-the-hindu-editorial-on-census-npr-postponement/article31200848.ece
370,2020/03/30,Political pardon: On Sri Lankan soldier’s release,"Freeing a soldier convicted for massacre dashes hopes for accountability in Sri Lanka

The grant of presidential pardon, on Thursday, to a Sri Lankan soldier on death row for murdering eight Tamil villagers has sparked justified outrage among those who have been demanding justice from the state for past crimes. Far from helping the cause of accountability for war-time atrocities, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has gone the other way to nullify a rare instance of justice being ensured by Sri Lanka’s judicial system. Not many army men have been brought to book for attacks on civilians; but, in what came to be known as the ‘Mirusuvil massacre’, military police had immediately detained the soldiers involved, thus denying them impunity. The victims included three boys aged five, 13 and 15. In December 2000, a group of internally displaced villagers had come to have a look at their war-ravaged homes at Mirusuvil in the Jaffna peninsula. They ran into some army men, who led them away blindfolded. Their bodies were later found in a sewer, with their throats slit. The only one who escaped later led the military police to the spot and turned a crucial witness. Five soldiers were indicted, and a special provision for having a trial before a bench of three high court judges was invoked. The plodding trial ended in 2015 with only one of them, Sunil Ratnayake, being found guilty. He was sentenced to death, but there is a moratorium on executions since 1976.

It hardly needs emphasis that the exercise of the power of pardon is an act of compassion, and not a tool for political or electoral messaging. However, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has sent out a message to his vast body of supporters among the Sinhalese that he would not let ‘war heroes’ languish in prison, even if it means that the minority Tamils get a chilling message that substantive justice for war crimes will always elude them; and even when rendered, it could be undone with a stroke of the pen. There is also an electoral angle to the decision, as parliamentary polls were set for April 25, but have now been postponed in view of the global pandemic. The process of granting pardon may have been going on in the run-up to the polls. Sri Lanka’s Constitution lays down a procedure that says the President must get a report from the trial judge, the Attorney General’s advice on that, and a recommendation from the Minister for Justice before he can pardon a convict. However, there appears to be no rule that such advice or recommendation is binding. Apart from some domestic voices from the Tamil leadership and individual politicians, the UN Human Rights High Commissioner and rights watchdog bodies have questioned the release of the soldier, rightly calling it an affront to the victims. The pardon, granted at a time when the country’s focus is on fighting COVID-19, is a serious setback to hopes that accountability could be brought about in Sri Lanka through domestic mechanisms.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/political-pardon-the-hindu-editorial-on-sri-lankan-soldiers-release/article31200862.ece
371,2020/03/30,State govt. asks citizens to walk to local stores,"This is to stop people from roaming around in vehicles

People will have to now walk to buy provisions, that too from local stores. A government directive to this effect is aimed at stopping people from roaming around in vehicles as well as migrant workers from leaving the city. In addition, marriage halls across the State will be used to provide shelter to migrant labourers.

“We have decided that in Bengaluru, purchase of vegetables, fruits and provisions should be localised. This purchase should be done on foot as much as possible and vehicles should not be used,” Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai told presspersons here after a meeting with senior officials of the Labour and Police Departments, and BBMP.

Shelter for workers

He further said that migrant workers from other districts in Bengaluru would be accommodated in marriage halls in each ward in the BBMP limits as well as in districts where migrant labourers are located. “Migrant workers leaving Bengaluru has caused administrative problems in other districts. As per the new guidelines, these workers are to be kept in marriage halls. Food and ration would be provided for them,” he added.

2,000 vehicles seized

Meanwhile, the city police continued seizing vehicles and booking cases against motorists who stepped out of their houses. Since Sunday, the city police have seized over 2,000 vehicles found moving on the roads across the city.

City Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao, who reviewed the situation on Monday, said the police will return the vehicles seized on Sunday, but vehicles seized from Monday will be kept at the stations till the lockdown period is over and violators will be booked under the National Disaster Management Act. He has also asked the police to video record the seizure procedure.

Among the other pointers he has given to the police are enforcement without lathi until further orders, barricading of major roads and checking passes and ensuring they are not misused.

Mr. Rao has also said that patrolling vehicles should help people with medical emergency by taking them to hospital instead of waiting for an ambulance. People who are part of essential services, including food, grocery supplies, milk and ATM cash vehicles should be allowed to move freely, he added.

Three-hour shift

The city police personnel deployed for lockdown duty will get to work in three shifts like their traffic counterparts, Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao has said.

At present, they are working for 12 hours since the Janata Curfew. Hence, it has been decided to give them the required rest, he said, addressing the police personnel across the city through their walkie-talkie.

The city police have also set up kitchens in the sub-division to provide food to police staff as well as for those in need - such as the homeless.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/3ucx5z/article31212755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BGSHOPPING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/state-govt-asks-citizens-to-walk-to-local-stores/article31211978.ece

376,2020/03/30,Boosting immunity is need of the hour,"When we are supposed to protect ourselves from the virus from outside, we need to protect ourselves beginning right from within our body by strengthening the immune system. The immune system is indeed complex and is to a great extent impacted by the environment around us.

There are many factors that affect the functioning of the immune system.

A healthy lifestyle involves eating nutritious food, practising hygienic habits, walking and exercising regularly, maintaining good emotional and mental health and having adequate sleep.

It is important to understand that these factors play a significant role in regulating and boosting immunity .

Gut microbiome

A healthy body has a healthy gut. The microbes living in our gut, collectively known as microbiomes play an important role in the body’s response to infectious pathogens like coronavirus.

It is thus important to maintain a healthy gut which helps to prevent impaired digestion that can damage the vital organs like lungs causing respiratory failure.

This is the reason we should think of supporting rather than ‘boosting’ our immunity. Recent research has proved that that the gut microbiomes can be controlled with a good food regime and a healthy diet.

There are many uncertified and unverified claims made on supplements to boost immunity. Instead of following those prescriptions which do not have any scientific evidence, we should consider eating time-tested foods routinely consumed by us.

We are all very well aware that our home made food recipes that had been passed on to us through many generations are definitely capable of providing and sustaining all that is essential for us to strengthen our immunity. They have been found to have the most desirable and positive impact on the gut microbes.

Recommended foods rich in antioxidants and minerals to improve immunity:

Rich in Vitamin A:

Cereals, legumes, yellow and orange coloured vegetables and green leafy vegetables

Rich in Vitamin B (B6, B9, B12) :

Cereals, legumes, green leafy vegetables, fruits, nuts, soy milk, dairy products fish, chicken and egg

Rich in Vitamin C:

Orange, lemon, guava, kiwi, gooseberry, cauliflower, tomato, capsicum and mint

Rich in Vitamin E:

Nuts, green leafy vegetables and vegetable oils

Rich in Vitamin D:

Egg, fatty fish, milk and its products

Exposure to sunlight is also help improve Vitamin D levels.

Rich in iron:

Cereals, legumes, dry fruits, fish, and chicken

Rich in zinc:

Wheat germ, dried beans, nuts, tofu and Sea foods

Rich in selenium:

Cereals, nuts, mushrooms, meat and chicken

Rich in antioxidants, condiments and spices:

Garlic, onion, ginger, pepper and green tea.

It is preferred to include fish, chicken and egg instead of red meat.

Apart from including the above, it is important to follow a healthy lifestyle which involves, consuming nutritious foods, abstaining from alcohol and smoking or moderate indulgence, de-stressing /unwinding with hobbies, having adequate hours of undisturbed sleep, exercising regularly, walking inside your home, in the terrace or even in the balcony of your home and doing simple floor exercises. Static jogging is also recommended

Home and healthy

Consider this as an opportunity to:

Eat freshly-cooked home made food, which is the most safe

Have a fixed meal time which is impossible while at work for many

Develop the habit of eating fruits and vegetables which are an important source of minerals and antioxidants

Learn healthy cooking and new recipes

Learn about food safety techniques and healthy food choices,

Get into the habit to avoid baked and fried foods, pre-packaged snacks high in salt and fat

Try to cut down on salt and sugar intake for at least 2 weeks, leading the way for it to become a habit

Try not to buy or store sugar rich candies, sweets, chocolates, ice creams, fizzy drinks, energy and sports drinks

Keep yourself well hydrated. Get into the habit of drinking more water than usual, at least 8-10 glasses

Have a positive mind

Handle stress in a positive way through meditation, yoga, breathing exercise, listening to music, reading or developing hobbies missed out during hectic work schedules

Indulge in physical activity to lower stress, boost energy, improve digestion and thereby reduce the risk of some chronic disease that could weaken your immune system further. Conserve your energy for essential activities.

Ensure having a consistent sleep schedule that helps in maintaining your cardiac rhythm. Try to have a restful quality sleep time.

This in turn helps to manage mood and appetite which in turn facilitates to improve immunity. Seven to eight hours of sleep is essential for us as sleep deprivation significantly weakens our immunity.

Food safety

Concerns with regard to transmission of virus via food are being rampantly spread across all sections.

There is no evidence to suggest that COVID-19 is transmitted through food and water but considering the fact that food and containers we use may hold and transmit the virus to others, it is essential that we are cautious.

Sharing food by eating out of the same plate and sipping out of the same cup are undesirable and dangerous too.

Anyone with suspected symptoms like cough and cold should avoid cooking food for others

Food safety measures for refrigerated foods:

1. Separate the raw from the cooked foods to avoid contamination

2. Cook the meat thoroughly

3. While reheating cooked food double check if it is still fresh and suitable for consuming

4 . Rinse the chopping board, knives and utensils used while cutting raw meat, chicken and fish.

5. Practice hand hygiene especially after handling fish, chicken and meat

6. All vegetables and fruits to be washed thoroughly

Nutrition tips for athletes during this time at home:

For many athletes who are used to doing a lot of physical activities like sports training and weight bearing exercises, the same may not be possible now. They might have been on a high calorie diet also. It is important to prevent fat gain during this period — so the guidelines for them and those who regularly excercise are:

- Avoid foods high in sugar and fat

- Reduce portion size

- Consume fewer calories than required

- Include adequate protein to maintain muscle mass – soy chunk, tofu, unsweetened soy milk sprouts, nuts, egg, meat, fish and chicken

- Switch to low fat milk, curd and buttermilk

- Include 4-5 servings of vitamins and mineral rich fruits and vegetables

- Snack on low calorie nutritious foods like salad, sprouts and roasted unsalted channa

- Drink adequate water to keep yourself hydrated all the while

- Avoid tetra pack juice, fruit juices, sugary carbonated drinks

- Avoid consuming pre and post workout drinks if not presently keeping up with routine practice sessions

- Avoid deep fried foods

- Do regular routine floor exercises, walking inside home or on the Terrace and skipping

- Keep yourself active throughout the day, learn to do household chores

The police officers said most of the applicants did not come with proper reasons to travel on emergency grounds. For the second day on Monday, hundreds started gathering in front of the Police Commissioner’s office to enquire about the status of their application.

S. Ramachandran, a fisherman in Kasimedu, said, “A few fishermen from Thoothukdui came here for fishing two weeks ago and are stranded. So I came here to get emergency passes for their travel back to Thoothukudi. But we were denied pass after waiting for a day here.”

Hari of Kumbakonam said, “I came here for treatment to my mother who is a diabetic. She was discharged on March 24. But we could not go back. Now we have got the emergency pass.”

Special control room

A special control room of the city police has been functioning since Sunday to help people who need to travel due to emergencies. Those who seek passes for such purposes should produce necessary evidence and the required documents for identity with a letter of request.

The pass can be used by those who require to travel outside city to other parts of the State or a place outside the State, for emergencies like deaths, marriage or medical emergencies of their own family members only.

Deputy Commissioner of Police H. Jayalakshmi said, “More than 9,200 persons applied for emergency passes and 207 passes were issued after thorough scrutiny of application and documents produced.

While prices of several vegetables dropped on Monday, meat was sold at an exorbitant rate in the city.

Transportation played a significant role in the availability of the produce and in determining the price, said traders. The retail market in T. Nagar near the Mambalam railway station was shifted to a playground in front of Dr. Natesan Park where around 25 makeshift shops were set up. This came as a relief to the consumers who were able to buy vegetables at low prices. The market will run from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. till the lockdown is lifted.

Shenbagam, a vegetable seller, said the price of vegetables were the same as in the market.

“I pay ₹200 to ₹300 to transport vegetables from Koyambedu market. I have made only that much today. There are no facilities or even a toilet here,” she said.

Murugan, a fruit seller, said the returns from his investment would be meagre. A person had been posted to safeguard shops.

At the Koyambedu wholesale market too, vegetables were sold for prices that were 10% lower on Monday. It received only 200-230 truckloads of vegetables against its normal 450 truckloads.

S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Wholesale Vegetable Market Association, said most traders brought fewer trucks because there were not many takers.

Only 20%-30% of the retail traders from other places such as Kancheepuram, Arni and Arakkonam visited the market due to restrictions in vehicle movement.

Stock clearance

Most vegetables were sold at a nominal rate to reduce stock as sales was restricted to stipulated time. A few vegetables, including beans, were priced high up to ₹40 a kg in wholesale market due to shortage, he said.

The association had been providing free lunch for 1,000 labourers as food availability was a challenge because of lockdown.

Mutton prices hovered between ₹1,000 and ₹ 1,400 a kg and chicken between ₹200 and ₹230 a kg.

According to Jaikumar, a meat vendor at T. Nagar, logistics was a major hassle.

Saraswathi, who runs a meat stall on Boag Road, said: “We buy goats from Poonamallee. After the coronavirus scare, we are finding it difficult to get goats. We usually buy a goat for ₹7,500. Today, we shelled out ₹9,000 for a goat that weighed 8.5 kg.”

According to estimates, sales of poultry, mutton and fish market in Chennai alone was pegged at ₹2,500 crore. Nishanth Chandran, CEO, Tendercuts, said that mutton prices had gone up because of demand.

Jayakumar on Monday inaugurated helpline 044-46122300 for persons on home quarantine in various parts of the city. “More than 20,000 people are on home quarantine in Chennai. The new facility has been created in Amma Maaligai to give counselling for persons on home quarantine. More than 23 medical professionals will answer calls of the residents on home quarantine, clearing doubts about COVID-19, monitoring their health condition, and checking the availability of food and water at home. The data collected will be used to help the residents on home quarantine,” said Mr. Jayakumar.

The Corporation also conducted a trial run of a vehicle to disinfect major stretches. ""We will use lysol to disinfect stretches. Currently we have started trial run of one vehicle on the road,"" said an official.

Chennai Corporation officials also closed many establishments for failure to maintain personal distancing on the premises.

About 20, 497 violations have been reported so far across Tamil Nadu and over 15,000 vehicles have been seized for violating the curfew implemented from last Tuesday.

To check the spread of COVID-19, prohibitory orders under section 144 Code of Criminal Procedure has been promulgated in the State to prevent the movement of people outside their homes, except for most essential purposes. Since the prohibitory order has been in place from last Tuesday, police personnel have been watching the movement of people and booking cases against those who violated the order.

384,2020/03/30,COVID-19: It takes just a small sacrifice to see them through this crisis,"Here are examples of how individuals, residents’ groups and voluntary organisations are helping those hit hard by the shutdown and also those still serving on the front lines unmindful of the risk

There is no single definition of generosity; it is defined by individuals as they deem fit, and every time, it offers the fragrance of a fresh insight into the spirit of kindness.

Take this one, for example.

A flower-seller who has Raja Street, Mandaveli, as her stomping ground found assistance in a manner she would have hardly imagined possible. Ganga Sridhar, a resident of Raja Street, who buys regularly from this flower seller decided to help her tide though these 21 days, and how!

“I just gave her the money that I would have spent buying flowers from her for a month. Pushcart vendors don’t have anybody to turn to for relief, as technically, they don’t work for anyone,” explains Ganga.

Setting an example

A positive gesture may be small, but it never stays that way. It has a way of multiplying and growing into something exponentially huge, though the agent facilitating its growth will keep changing.

Though conservancy workers, who are among those standing on the front lines and doing their work, will be getting their pay, it is likely that the earnings of their family have registered a drop, as other earning family members may be out of work. So, they may need to be helped in small ways.

Members of Pradeep and Karthik Avenue Residents’ Welfare Association in Chitlapakkam choose to call the conservancy staff of Ward 9 of the Chitlapakkam Selection Grade Town Pnchayat as “Clean Friend Workers”, and their appreciation of these foot-soldiers’ work doesn’t stay with crowning them with a fancy title, and has translated into an useful gesture.

They have provided these “Clean Friend Workers” with provisions that will last a month.

When the Association announced the decision to help them, residents made contributions in cash or essential commodities.

K. Dayanand, president, Pradeep and Karthik Avenue Residents’ Welfare Association, says, “If the need arises, we will again make such a contribution.”

Thiruveedhi Amman Koil Street Residents Association (TAKSRA) in Mandaveli sponsored a day’s food for conservancy workers in its area.

“We extended a financial assistance to the contract company in charge of conservancy operations in Zone 13. Thanks to this assistance, a day’s food requirements for conservancy workers in Ward 173 have been taken care of. A few more residents associations are likely to sponsor food in the weeks to come.”

Neighbourhood service

“Don’t carry the world upon your shoulder” — so goes the Beatles’ song. Just carry the weeny-teeny part of the world that you call home, and the whole world will be taken care of. Going by how localised and decentralised its service activities are, Seva Bharathi, which provides succour to the needy seems to be guided by this wisdom. Its Tambaram Centre recently identified 10 people, who include construction workers, daily-wage earners and maid servants, in the region, and provided them with essential commodities that can be expected to last a month.

The provisions include rice, toor dal, refined sunflower oil, tamarind, asafoetida, rock salt, sesame, chilly and turmeric powder, and onions.

Besides, this group also distributed food packets, water bottles and buttermilk to daily wage earners and the homeless found near bus halting, shops, and bazaars in Tambaram Sanatorium and Tambaram (West).

A puncher shop?

This is an odd one out on this list about COVID-19 related acts of mercy.

Seva Bharathi has centres of service across Tamil Nadu, and its Erode Centre recently did something rather unusual but extremely thoughtful, as it sought to help those who help the needy in these times. And by choosing to do what it did, it has demonstrated meticulous attention to detail, and if one may add, probably a tendency to not leave anything to chance.

The Erode Centre has set up a 24-hour free tyre puncher shop and an air-filling station, for the benefit of ambulances, fire-tenders, police vehicles and other vehicles engaged in essential services during this period.

Well, well, we are on the same page as you — a flat tyre does not happen every day in the life of a vehicle, but if it does happen now, when puncher shops are expected to be closed, it will be some problem to deal with. So, our appreciation for this thoughtfulness!

Think through their problems

Everything boils down to proactive empathy, which alone enables one to anticipate what somebody else is likely to go through, and make sure they are spared the rough edges of that situation.

At AGS Colony in Velachery, R. Sumathi decided to help a pushcart vegetable vendor in the locality, reasoning it out that “as people have begun to stock vegetables they may not have the need to buy from pushcart vegetable vendors every day,” and that the restriction on movement of people and social distancing norms may be more heavily arrayed against them. Residents are also known to be helping the regular neighbourhood iron men, as they are out of work now.

385,2020/03/30,COVID-19: Chennai residents contribute essential items to Corporation’s community kitchen,"The community kitchen established in Ambattur Old Town is meant to feed migrant workers who are now out of work

Residents of Thiruvengada Nagar in Ambattur Old Town (OT) are assisting Zone 7 officials of Greater Chennai Corporation in their efforts to run a community kitchen to feed migrant workers, rendered out of work by the COVID-19 crisis.

The residents have donated 100 kilograms of rice, 10 kilograms of toor daal and 10 litres of edible oil to the civic officials.

“We got the nod from our residents about making a contribution towards the functioning of the community kitchen, by discussing the matter in our WhatsApp group. Immediately, within an hour, we mobilised adequate funds to buy the essential items,” says S. Suresh, secretary, Thiruvengada Nagar Residents Welfare Association.

Residents have pointed out that during two notable crises in the past — the 2015 floods and cyclone Vardah a year later in December 2016 — they personally carried out the relief work through their residents’ associations by providing free food, blankets and clothes to the affected persons in the region. In contrast, this time, they handed over the essential relief items to the zonal officer of Zone - 7 in Ambattur, due to factors such as social distancing and the need for coordinated efforts.

Thiruvengada Nagar has 1,000 households spread across 10 streets and two main roads. Most of the residents are employed in the government sector and the industrial units in Pattaravakkam, Athipet and Ambattur.

Association members point out that during the ongoing lockdown, they have been taking utmost care in ensuring residents stay at home, by having resident-volunteers in every street monitor if if there is any movement of people.

Residents say that contribution in terms of providing free essential items to community kitchen will continue, but at the individual level, due to the challenge involved in organising such a relief work together as a community, when social distancing has to be practised.

“We have asked our residents not to wait for the Association to organise drives to help the civic body in this manner, Instead, through WhatsApp, we have clearly instructed them to make such contributions directly to the civic body. Our residents’ association will also have a record of such contributions made by our residents,” says Suresh.

386,2020/03/30,COVID-19: Two Chennai citizens help their local bodies disinfect neighbourhoods,"Little drops make the mighty ocean — C. Suresh and P. Appu Venkatesh contribute their mite, and set an example for other residents

With distress relief funds being raised at the central and state government levels to deal with the exigencies arising out of the Coronavirus outbreak, through appeals to citizens, the urgent need for resources can hardly be mistaken and ignored.

So, any help, of any proportion and at any level is bound to ease the strain on resources at the disposal of government machineries.

Here are examples of two citizens helping the local administration in their areas by bearing the cost of an effort at having their localities disinfected.

Last week, C. Suresh, an environment and social activist and a long-time resident of Tambaram Sanatorium bore the cost of disinfecting certain parts of the locality — Apparao Colony, Kamakshi Colony, Vedantham Colony, Jain Flats, and a section of Grand Southern Trunk Road in Tambaram Sanatorium. The exercise to sanitise the area was carried out through manual disinfectant sprayer machines. These areas fall under Ward 15 of Chitlapakkam Selection Grade Town Panchayat.

Besides, he also distributed soaps and hand sanitizers to residents and the conservancy staff of Ward 15 of Chitlapakkam Selection Grade Town Panchayat.

C. Suresh, says, “Through volunteers, we also spread awareness about the precautionary measures to be taken, through distribution of pamphlets.”

Another contributor

Similarly, last week, P. Appu Venkatesan, a long-time resident of Pammal, worked alongside the workers of Pammal Municipality, bearing the cost of a sanitization exercise in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Pammal Municipality. Bleaching powder was sprayed through manual disinfectant sprayer machines.

Appu distributed soaps, masks, and hand-sanitizers to the residents, and also demonstrated the correct method of washing one’s hands, to members of the public.

“Our health is in our hands” was Appu’s battle-cry.

The Commissionerate for the Welfare of the Differently-abled in Tamil Nadu is facilitating on-call therapeutic services for children with special needs through phone and video calls during the ongoing lockdown.

“We have circulated posters with the numbers of our therapists from the State Resource-cum-Training Centre (SRTC) in K.K. Nagar. Parents and caregivers can either call our helplines or reach out to the therapists directly,” said Johny Tom Varghese, Director for the Welfare of the Differently-abled.

The Commissionerate recently launched a 24-hour whatsapp and video calling helpline for persons with speech and hearing impairment where they can interact through sign language at 97007-99993. In addition, a 24-hour Toll Free Helpline for persons with disabilities and Senior Citizens is being operated at 18004250111

Mr. Varghese further said that they were also tying up with resource persons and therapists from early intervention centres in the city, to provide these on-call therapeutic services.

Sheeba Ananth, a speech therapist and audiologist from the SRTC in K.K. Nagar, said that parents might have concerns about a long break in therapy for children with special needs owing to the lockdown. “We’re expecting parents and caregivers to call in with queries about how they can continue therapy or keep the children occupied at home. Taking this forward, we plan to collate district-wise information of therapists, special educators and other resource persons whom we can connect the parents to,” she added.

The on-call therapeutic services for children with special needs can be reached at 99408-59017 and 98412-80245.

Schools and centres for children with special needs in the city have been reaching out to their parents and caregivers as well. Kavitha Krishnamoorthy, co-Ddrector, The CanBridge Academy, said that for children and young adults with autism, it is important to establish a routine when they’re at home as well.

“Since our students come to our centre every day, being stuck at home and the absence of a routine might make them anxious. We’ve asked the parents to ensure that a routine is in place which involves them doing the things they like as well as learning some essential skills as they have, in the academy,” she said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/state-sets-up-on-call-therapeutic-services-for-children-with-special-needs/article31205727.ece

390,2020/03/30,A look into key aspects of virus pandemic,"There are a lot of scientific terms being bandied about during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s a short primer on the key aspects everyone should be aware of.

What is ‘social distancing’?

‘Social distancing’ refers to a way of creating a barrier of physical distance between two or more people so that transmission of infectious agent can be prevented or halted. It may also be termed as physical distancing. It is a traditional public health measure of separating people to curb the outbreak of infectious disease, aimed to prevent person-to-person spread of disease to interrupt transmission and checking community transmission.

When does the need for social distancing occur?

Infectious diseases such as COVID-19, transmitted by respiratory droplets require a certain proximity of people. Social distancing reduces transmission, mitigates COVID-19 outbreak, particularly useful in settings where community transmission is believed to have occurred, but where the linkages between cases is unclear, and where restrictions placed only on persons known to have been exposed is considered insufficient to prevent further transmission.

What is ‘isolation’?

‘Isolation’ is the separation of ill persons with contagious diseases from non-infected persons to protect non-infected persons. This usually occurs in hospital settings. It is particularly effective in interrupting transmission if early detection is possible before overt viral shedding.

What is ‘quarantine’ ?

Quarantine demands movement restriction of persons who are presumed to have been exposed to a contagious disease but are not ill, either because they did not become infected or because they are still in the incubation period.

Quarantine may be applied at the individual or group level and usually involves restriction to the home or a designated facility. During quarantine, all individuals should be monitored for the occurrence of any symptoms. Quarantining is most successful in settings where detection of cases is prompt, contacts can be listed and traced within a short time frame with prompt issuance of quarantine. It is one of the oldest, most effective tools of controlling outbreaks & was implemented successfully as an effective measure during the SARS epidemic in 2003.

Is there evidence that physical distancing has been effective to control infectious disease?

Since the flu pandemic in September 1918, studies have showed the importance of distancing measures. Social distancing was the key in reversing the outbreak in Wuhan and the wider Hubei region. The earlier a lockdown is put in place in the epicentre of an outbreak, the smaller it ends up being.

Are ‘isolation & quarantine’ not a form of social distancing?

While isolation and quarantine are forms of social distancing, there is an important distinction to be made.

Isolation and quarantine are aimed at preventing people who are infected or are known to have had contact with people who are infected from passing on the virus.

Social distancing is a wider measure aimed at stopping the kind of mixing of people that allows infections to spread through a population. They range from ending mass gatherings, closing public spaces like educational establishments (schools, universities), gyms, museums, cultural and social centres, swimming pools and theatres and may be a total lockdown with people forced to stay indoors (community containment).

What are periods in the natural history of COVID-19 from public health angle ?

There are four periods:

1. Infected, but not contagious and not symptomatic.

2. Infected and contagious, but not symptomatic.

3. Infected, contagious, and symptomatic.

4. Recovering (assuming survival), where you may still have symptoms but are no longer contagious.

How does social distancing help in reversing the epidemic?

Even with an ignorance of who’s infectious, who's contagious, and how widespread the infection actually is, the social distancing can crush the exponential growth phase of COVID-19 & support reversing the transmission of the disease. One of the main aims of social distancing is to “flatten the curve”, which means delaying the spread of the virus so it reaches people more slowly.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/snzh8l/article31201822.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MARTHSUDHASRINIJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-look-into-key-aspects-of-virus-pandemic/article31201598.ece
391,2020/03/30,The deep void in global leadership,"There is as yet no comprehensive, concerted plan of action by world leaders to combat the pandemic

The coronavirus’s flight across the world at lightning speed, has exposed the total void in collective leadership at the global level. Three months into the catastrophic war declared by an invisible, almost invincible virus, that is rapidly gobbling up human lives, regardless of citizenship and race, and contemptuously ravaging economies across continents, there is as yet no comprehensive, concerted plan of action, orchestrated by global leaders, to combat this terror.

The G20 has just had a virtual meeting, we understand, at the prodding of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It is encouraging to learn that the G20 leaders have agreed to inject $5-trillion into the world economy to partially counter the devastating economic impact of the pandemic. This is indeed good news. But taking collective ownership to fight a global war against the virus will require a lot more than writing cheques.

Good war, bad enemy

World leaders are obviously overwhelmed with their own national challenges and do not appear inclined to view the pandemic as a common enemy against mankind, which it is. China delayed reporting the virus to the World Health Organisation (WHO), and perhaps, in the process, contributed to the exacerbation of the spread of the virus across the globe. It was reported that the Trump administration did not even inform the European Union before it shut off flights from Europe. It must be acknowledged that the initiative taken by Mr. Modi in the early days to convene a meeting of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation countries stands out in contrast to the pusillanimous leadership around the world.

There is no evidence that, at the global level, the pandemic has abated yet and would be brought under control soon. To imagine that nations would be able to tame the virus soon with massive shutdowns might be just wishful thinking. National shutdowns and physical distancing have been a challenge not only in the Unied States and some European countries, it would be more so in populous countries such as India. At any rate, such lockouts come at enormous economic and social costs. As long as the virus is alive in some corner of the world, it would resume its travel across the world the moment international travel restrictions are relaxed. Is it realistic to imagine that international travel will remain suspended until the last virus alive on this planet is extinguished? Epidemiologists point out that unless herd immunity develops — which will take long and come at the cost of at least half the population being infected — the virus will remain alive and strike whenever there is a lowering of guard.

This millennium has already suffered three pandemics and COVID-19 will certainly not be the last.

This is a war. A good war against a bad enemy, and a common enemy, that respects no borders. If this global challenge is not a battle to be fought by a collective global leadership, nothing else is. And yet, the typical response by all affected nations, has been to impose ‘National distancing’ by closing borders. While this is no doubt, a most appropriate response, there is a much bigger and emergent need for leaders of nations to come together for collective global action.

Seeds of indifference

Two developments in the global polity in the last few years have contributed to the indifference towards collective global action.

One, the swing towards right-wing nationalism, as a guiding political ideology, in large swathes of the world, particularly in the U.S. This ideology posits ‘global good’ being in conflict with and inimical to national interests. The dramatic announcement by U.S. President Trump, in June 2017, that the U.S. will cease involvement from the Paris Accord on climate change, preparatory to full withdrawal after the mandatory period, on the ground that the accord will ‘undermine U.S. economic interest’ is a classic demonstration of narrow nationalism trumping global interests. There is no issue more global than climate change, and yet the U.S. Administration chose to look at it from the prism of national, short-term economic interest.

Two, the atrophy of multilateral institutions. The United Nations was the outcome of the shared vision of the world leaders after World War II, that collective action is the only way forward to prevent the occurrence of another war. That institution has notoriously failed to live up to its expectations to maintain peace among nations in the nearly 80 years since its formation. Its affiliate organisations have, in several ways, failed to deliver on their lofty missions. In particular, WHO, which has as its objective ‘to be the directing and coordinating authority among member countries in health emergencies’, has proven to be too lethargic in reacting to pandemics in the past. Its responses to COVID-19, has come under the scanner, not merely for incompetence, but also for lack of intellectual integrity.

G20 offers hope

If the world leaders realise the relevance and critical importance of collective global action in the context of the present pandemic, it is not difficult to contrive an appropriate mechanism quickly to get into war. A nimble outfit, not burdened with bureaucracy, is required to manage a global crisis of the nature that we are confronted with, today. The G20, with co-option of other affected countries, itself might serve the purpose for the present. What is important is for the global leaders to acknowledge what every foot soldier knows: winning a war would require the right strategy, rapid mobilisation of relevant resources and, most importantly, timely action.

In facing the present challenge, the following actions should come out of such a collective.

First, the collective should ensure that shortages of drugs, medical equipment and protective gear do not come in the way of any nation’s capacity to contain or fight the pandemic. It is very likely that some nations that have succeeded in bringing the pandemic under control, such as China, Japan or South Korea, might have the capability to step up production at short notice to meet the increasing demand from other countries which are behind the curve. This would typically involve urgent development of an information exchange on global production capacity, present and potential, demand and supply. This is not to mean that there should be centralised management, which is not only infeasible, but counterproductive, as the attendant bureaucracy will impede quick action. A common information exchange could restrain the richer countries from predatory contracting of global capacities.

Second, protocols might need to be put in place among participating countries to ensure seamless logistics for the supply chain for essential goods and services to function efficiently. This might be particularly necessary in the context of controls on international traffic and national shutdowns. There would need to be concomitant accord to eliminate all kinds of tariff and non tariff barriers.

Information exchange is vital

Third, there needs to be instantaneous exchange of authenticated information on what clinical solutions have succeeded and what has not. A classic example is the issue relating to hydroxychloroquine, which is being used experimentally, bypassing the rigours of randomised clinical trials. While there is no substitute to classic clinical proof, the more field-level information is shared within the medical community, the better will be the success rates of such experimentation.

Fourth, this is a time to have cross-country collaboration on laboratory trials and clinical validation for vaccines and anti-viral drugs. It must be acknowledged that WHO has already moved on this issue, although, perhaps, belatedly. The world can ill-afford delays, as the pandemic is predicted to stage a comeback once the shutdowns are gradually relaxed. The best way to ensure speedy research is to pool global resources. Any effort at reinventing the wheel will only delay the outcomes. This attempt to collaborate might also bring in its wake an acceptable commercial solution that adequately incentivises private research, while ensuring benefits being available to the entire world at affordable costs. Such a framework might be necessary for sustained collaborations for future challenges.

Fifth, there is a need to facilitate easy movement of trained health professionals across the world to train others and augment resources wherever there are shortages. In other words, nations should come together to organise a global army to fight the pandemic, equipped with the best weapons and tools.

Food watch

Sixth, we must anticipate food shortages occurring sooner or later, in some part of the world, consequent to the national shutdowns. Ironically, while we might have saved lives from the assault of the novel coronavirus, we might run the risk of losing lives to starvation and malnutrition, somewhere in the world if we do not take adequate precautions. This requires not only coordinated global action; it would also turn out to be the test of global concern for mankind in general.

Eventually, there is no doubt that human talent will triumph over the microscopic virus. It may be some months before we declare our win. But the economic devastation, that would have been caused as a result will be no less than the aftermath of a world war. Economies of the world are inexorably intertwined. An orderly reconstruction of the global economy, which is equitable and inclusive, will eventually involve renegotiating terms of trade among key trading blocs, concerted action among central bankers to stabilise currencies, and a responsible way to regulate and manage global commodity markets.

Does India have the power to awaken the conscience of the Superpowers and catalyse collective global action? Remember, historically, it is always the weakling or the oppressed, who have caused transformational changes in the world order.

Under these very testing circumstances it is easy to blame China for the global crisis we are currently facing. But let us be objective: it could happen anywhere. We must consider this global catastrophe as a wake-up call. We are all in a situation of complete uncertainty, perhaps, for the first time in our living memory. Thus, it would be unwise not to learn the important lessons from this crisis. Some of them are already emerging: the Russian President sent humanitarian support to Italy, forgetting Europe-Russia tensions; Cuban doctors flew there to provide their assistance. India put aside party politics and has spoken in one voice when it came to imposing a lockdown. COVID-19 has united us; it has also shown our vulnerability as well as ‘universal equality’. In any case, life will hardly be the same when the pandemic subsides. There is bound to be a new lexicon entry: ‘post-COVID-19’. We must identify the positive side of this crisis: as a global opportunity to rectify our previous wrongdoings, to become responsible global citizens, to critically assess our vulnerabilities, and to re-establish the lost ties with precious nature.

The media is abuzz with the news of political figures making donations to the anti-virus fight fund having us in awe of their “charitable mindset and munificence”. One would like to know whether these are from their private funds and not from the Constituency Development Fund allocated to them. It is telling that not many have opened their hearts and loosened their purse strings to exhibit their concern and care. It is strange that film actors who fight on screen as good Samaritans are not doing much in this unprecedented crisis.

The plight of lakhs of migrant workers shows up the half-prepared measures of State governments (Inside pages, “At ‘Zero Point’, flight from hunger beats fight against virus”, March 29). Bus complexes now overflowing with migrants are a striking contrast to the most emphasised point in the anti-COVID-19 fight — namely, physical distancing. But at the same time, the woes of so many Indians on the margins of society cannot be brushed aside. The Centre needs to act fast in these extraordinary times.

393,2020/03/30,No laughing matter,"The idea of a political cartoon is to provoke readers to think and act, and not to be divisive

When daily reports and graphs in this newspaper are highlighting the hardships faced by different sectors and geographies due to COVID-19, we were hardly expecting a slip-up on a cartoon. But on March 26, some readers took serious exception to a cartoon by Deepak Harichandan. The attire given to the virus was seen as reinforcing stereotypes and perpetuating social prejudices. Readers reached out through e-mails and social media posts. There were arguments about interpretations of symbols and representations. How did the newspaper address the concerns of these readers? The Hindu modified the cartoon for its Internet edition with a note from the Editor.

Blurry lines

While it is easy to evaluate text, it is not so with images. There are vexatious ethical questions which do not have ready answers: do people have the right to free speech even if they hold offensive and hurtful opinions? What are the limits? Who draws the red lines, the frontiers of tolerance? While the lines for reportage and analysis are stringent, there is an element of fluidity when it comes to cartooning. Readers may wonder why we give more leeway to cartoons.

The U.S. Library of Congress listed five persuasive techniques used by cartoonists to effectively tell their story or critique: symbolism, exaggeration, labelling, analogy, and irony. I also remember Winston Churchill’s praise for the cartoonist David Low and Jawaharlal Nehru’s plea to Shankar (Keshav Shankar Pillai) following the cartoonists’ pungent criticism of the leaders of the U.K. and India, respectively. “Low is the Charlie Chaplin of caricature, and tragedy and comedy are the same to him,” wrote Churchill. When Shankar launched the magazine Shankar’s Weekly in 1948, Nehru told him, “Don’t spare me, Shankar. Hit, hit me hard.”

The irony of cartooning was succinctly captured by one of the finest writers and cartoonists of independent India, O.V. Vijayan: “It is an unutterable sadness which punctuates the reality that I am called upon to portray, and yet the dominant superstition of my profession demands that I raise a laugh.” Cartoonists are supposed to use humour to criticise authoritarianism, fearlessly question those in power, and provoke people to react against injustice. Right from the days of the first-known political cartoon, ‘Join, or die’, attributed to Benjamin Franklin and published in the Pennsylvania Gazette on May 9, 1754, cartoons have retained elements of grotesque and wanton distortions.

Modifying the cartoon

It is against this backdrop that we evaluated the complaints against the cartoon by Mr. Harichandan on COVID-19’s attempt to hold planet Earth to ransom. When the focus of attention became the attire and not the message, the original purpose of the cartoon was lost. The Editor asked the cartoonist to modify the cartoon to remove specific symbolic associations. Online readers of the newspaper would have seen a modified version of the cartoon on the website, with a note from the Editor: “Some readers have objected to the cartoon published on March 26, 2020 as Islamophobic. Any link to Muslims in the attire of the virus was completely unintentional. The point of the cartoon was to show the world being taken hostage by the virus. However, we agree that the virus should have been shown as just a blob or a stick figure and we express our regret for the hurt or unhappiness caused. Accordingly, we are taking down this cartoon online and replacing it with one that has a neutral representation of the attire.”

When the intention and meaning of the cartoon was explained in plain words and the cartoon was modified to have neutral representation, the newspaper faced a second round of attack, this time saying that it had succumbed to “unedifying self-censorship”.

In a polarised environment, we need to understand the distinction between an act of course correction and self-censorship. Some decisions in newspapers are made instinctively. Flemming Rose, the Danish editor who published controversial cartoons, reflected on the nature of the trade in a 2016 interview to The Atlantic: “As a journalist, as an editor, you do a lot of things based on instincts. … And when it all exploded I had to wind back the movie and find out why did I think this was the right thing to do.”

The idea of a political cartoon is to provoke readers to think and act, and not to be divisive. Hence, the act of modifying the cartoon is a result of editorial judgement.

394,2020/03/30,COVID-19: Here are 21-day regimens to meaningfully ride out the lockdown,"Kochi’s influencers have come up with 21-day programmes to help people spend time during the Coronavirus lockdown

Wondering what to do during the Covid-19 lockdown? Check out these 21-day programmes from Kochi’s influencers that help people choose ways to spend their time meaningfully.

21 days of wellness

NuvoVivo, the Kochi-based online health and fitness company, has launched a 21-day wellness challenge that began March 26. “It takes 21 days to form a habit,” says Rajiv Ambat, the founder. “Why not use this opportunity to start something positive?” According to Rajiv the depressing news about the virus has dampened people’s spirits and the idea is to spread some cheer. “There are a number of things one can do to improve overall well being. Not just eating healthy or exercising. You could learn a new skill, do a 10-minute meditation routine or call a friend whom you have not spoken to in a long time. All this could create a sense of positivity, says Rajiv.

Those who enrol will be added to a WhatsApp group, through which basic guidelines and assistance will be provided. Since it is a group challenge, there will be no one-on-one guidance, Rajiv clarifies.

Each day will include small tasks such as 10 minutes of meditation, reading a book or calling a friend, along with videos of home-based simple exercises and breathing exercises. A few recipe ideas will also be shared.

The subscription fee will go towards Covid-19 related charity and care.

Create positive habits

Thara George, who formerly worked with Emirates airlnes and for the private jets of the Qatar royal family, reacted swiftly to the situation posting her video on YouTube on March 23. “Before we let this 21-day lockdown period go waste or people take time to decide what to do I immediately sent out this video related to fitness, yoga and healthy eating. It takes 21 days for a habit to become automated in your subconscious mind, like driving or brushing teeth. We can use this time to inculcate a positive habit.”

Let’s play Antakshari If it’s music that you want and from the best, log onto the Instagram accounts of some of Kerala’s young and happening playback singers who are part of the #instantaksharichallenge. “It keeps us busy and have fun. One has to keep doing something and antakshari is one way of doing it,” says singer Renjini Jose.

Antakshari is a game where each singer sings a song, which begins with the last letter of the previous singer’s song. The tag game has had songs in seen the singers sing Malayalam, Hindi and Tamil songs have been rendered by Jyotsna Radhakrishnan, Vijay Yesudas, Rimi Tomy, Nithya Mammen, Jeenu Nazeer, Ravishankar and others in this tag game.are amon those who have participated.

Other Instagrammers have also jumped on to the bandwagon. It is not just singers even other Instagrammers have taken it up. Filmmaker Mohammed Sohal says, “How many movies or shows can you watch? Cook, read, gardening... there is a limit to how long one can do these. After a point you want to interact with others, and this challenge is a good way of doing in while practising social distancing.”

His friend, Mumbai-based actor/voice artist Veenah Naair, tagged him to the challenge. Though he doesn’t sing, his wife took up the challenge on his behalf. Veenah, who was tagged by friends who were part of a Hindi antakshari challenge on Instagram, says, “Music is a healer and in these difficult times it will help. Social media now plays an important role, it is the only way we can be in touch with each other.” she says. The singing creates a sense of community and that one is not alone in this despite the social isolation.

Thara’s concept of wellness is based on forming a good habit by practising it — sleeping, eating, exercising — at the same time everyday. She will add more videos about the specifics of positivity in the coming days.

She goes as stylethara on Instagram.

The yoga way

Yoga and wellness guru Sudkashna Thampi was quick to move her Yoga classes online and also opened them up for others during this period of isolation. “We must use this time for self love. It is so quiet and gives us time for introspection. Normally, on a busy day, we put this aspect aside,” says Sudakshna whose students have moved on to the video platform, Zoom, where she can see and guide them. “Everyone has tuned into it. It is new for many of us but it is friendly and clear. It is important I see how they are performing.

In addition to the Yoga classes, she will be livestreaming her food philosophy based on ‘Eat What Nature Intended You To Eat’ from her kitchen, at 8.00 am daily. This was in response to the misinformation on social media about immunity-boosting foods in the time of the corona virus.

The focus over the 21 days will be Movement (Yoga), Food, and Social Meet ups via social media. “At the end of the day, we are social beings and meetings, even if on social media, is a mood booster. It motivates you to do everything . I look at these days as regular working days except that you are working for yourself,” says Sudakshana.

395,2020/03/30,"Lockdown: Narendra Modi shares fitness routine, yoga videos","The Prime Minister also urges people to share their ways of remaining fit

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday shared his fitness routine during the coronavirus lockdown with the public, saying practising Yoga has been an integral part of his life for many years.

In a series of tweets, Modi shared the animated videos of him doing Yoga that were uploaded on the YouTube in 2018. “During yesterday’s ‘Mann Ki Baat’, someone asked me about my fitness routine during this time. Hence, thought of sharing these Yoga videos. I hope you also begin practising Yoga regularly.”

Modi shared the link “https://t.co/Ptzxb7R8dN”. He said he is neither a fitness expert nor a medical expert.“Practising Yoga has been an integral part of my life for many years and I have found it beneficial. I am sure many of you also have other ways of remaining fit, which you also must share with others.”

The Yoga videos are available in different languages, “Do have a look. Happy Yoga practicing....,” the Prime Minister said.

396,2020/03/30,"You’re WFH, but are you Working out From Home?","How to work out from home to stay healthy, with cities in lockdown mode

If we were in the US, had 2,500 dollars to spare, and liked the meditation-meets-night-club sweat session that is SoulCycle, we’d be pre-ordering our bikes in candle-lit anticipation. But to be honest, we are more likely to do a bunch of floor exercises on our balconies, in lazy pyjamas, without anyone judging us.

Don’t, says Radhika Gordhandas, an exercise psychologist and HR professional who currently works at Tata CLiQ. “Wear the workout gear you usually would, because it’s a preparation to get you into your routine ( Fill your bottle of water, follow the warm-up and cool-down). If you’re in your pyjamas, you may get casual about these,” she says.

Because working out from home is free and you can do it anytime, there’s the danger of procrastinating and ending up never doing it. “It’s best to keep it to the time you always do it at, because you don’t want to be distracted by anything else,” says Radhika. By switching on and off from a particular activity, you perform your best at both, rather than scattering yourself among many things.

If you’re asking yourself why you can’t just treat this period as an exercise holiday, especially if you’re healthy, Prof Deepak Joshi, an orthopaedic surgeon at the Sports Injury Centre at Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi, takes away hope. “Remember what exercise does for children, adults, and the elderly is different,” he says.

While children need an hour to an hour-and-a-half to stimulate growth, adults need about 40-45 minutes in order to keep the body fit. The elderly need frequent movement if they can’t do the 40 minutes at one stretch, so they don’t lose muscle strength or bone minerals. “Your body form is directly proportionate to function: muscles remodel according to how you use them,” he says.

Derive a formula

It’s a good idea to plan your routine either the night before or a week in advance, so that habit rather than choice, drives you to exercise. Dr Deepak Chaudhary, who heads the Arthroscopy & Sports Medicine Centre at BLK, Delhi, suggests a combination of daily exercises.

Warm-up: Jogging on the spot, skipping, a few burpees and a few surya namaskars can be used as a warm-up activity.

Cool-down: Stretch, especially targeting the muscles that have been in focus through your workout. For instance, if you have been jogging on the spot, then stretch the quads, hamstring, calf, IT band and glutes for 20-30 seconds.

Build your own workout

Shiba Mehra, ACE-certified instructor and rehab specialist, who runs Spectrum Fitness that trains trainers, helps us piece together a workout.

Use a series of three-five exercises; do 10-15 repetitions each, taking a water break after you complete one circuit. Continue until you do 20-30 minutes, if you are doing it at high intensity. You can choose to do a different one each day.

Cardio: Jumping jacks, burpees, mountain climbers, high knees, skipping – you can do this in any order.

Arm Strength: Fill two water bottles to use them as weights. Perform for two minutes each, side planks (raising the free hand with the weight), bicep curls, squat jumps, shoulder presses, lunges – all with weights. Take a water break; repeat until you have completed 30-40 minutes.

Flexibility: Go from bottom to top, stretching the longest muscles first: calf, hamstring, quad, IT band, glute, back, chest, deltoid, rhomboid, traps, biceps and triceps.

A full-body workout: Perform planks, mountain climbers, burpees, pushups, squats, lunges. Take a water break; repeat until you have completed 30-40 minutes.

Use your furniture

The bed: Suitable for restorative exercises like leg raises (pictured here), legs up the wall, seated forward bend, reclining bound angle pose. The wall: Suitable for wall sits, wall plank (pictured here), standing push-ups The wall: Suitable for wall sits, wall plank, standing push-ups (pictured here) The staircase: Suitable for the step up, calf raises (pictured here), running up and walking down (make sure you walk down, or else you may get injured; alternate with walking up and walking down).

Score on yoga

Done on its own, the surya namaskar works as an exercise for the whole body, and can work to strengthen (if done slowly), build flexibility, endurance (if done repeatedly and gradually increased in number according to individual fitness levels), and cardio-vascular fitness (if poses are done in quick succession to get the heart rate up).

Take micro-fitness breaks

By definition, a micro-break is a burst of high-intensity activity for 2-10 minutes, depending on the time you have and your fitness level. “Set an alarm every hour, or else you will forget,” says Shiba.

Pick any body weight exercise or simply do a series of stretches, especially the chest, back, neck, and glutes that are affected by prolonged screen time. “Tadasana is also a good pose,” says Shiba, who advises people to hold stretches for between 12 and 20 seconds each, breathing through it all.

Do remember

Use a mat, the grass, a wooden floor, or mud to exercise, and not the cement floor.

Catch the morning sun on your balcony for 40 minutes while you exercise, to get your vitamin D exposure too.

Avoid exercises you’re unfamiliar with, especially if you have a problem with balance, because you don’t want to be in a situation where you need to go to the hospital.

Get other people to move

Whether it’s elderly parents or screen-grabbed kids, exercising with them, while maintaining a distance of three feet, helps. This is important if someone has a medical condition that needs special attention: diabetes or hypertension, for instance. “People can walk for about 20 minutes just outside their houses, with recommended precautions,” says Dr KK Aggarwal, President, Heart Care Foundation of India.

He also suggests playing table tennis, which again keeps people at a distance while giving them a time to bond. “Anyone who can walk 500 metres in six minutes can do any type of regular exercise, so walking up the steps is fine too,” he says, adding that it’s best to keep grandchildren apart from grandparents, as the former can have an asymptomatic infection that can affect the latter.",fitness,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/oedd3b/article31206052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30mplead1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/how-to-work-out-from-home-to-stay-healthy/article31206053.ece
397,2020/03/30,Quarantine cooking: Chef Saransh Goila shares easy recipes to cook during lockdown,"Celebrity chef Saransh Goila, has an interesting digital initiative going on — he goes live on Instagram every morning with his celebrity friends from various fields and cooks. He does so as he deems it important to spread joy in the community at a time when loneliness is at it’s peak during the Coronavirus lockdown in India. His mantra? “Isolated but not alone.”

#MorningsWithGoila, features the likes of Chef Sanjeev Kapoor, Chef Ranveer Brar, Pooja Makhija, Mithila Palkar, Prajakta Kohli and many more. The videos give us a sneak peek on the guests’ eating habits, along with some simple breakfast recipes.

Excepts from an interview:

What’s the idea behind #MorningsWithGoila?

The idea behind #MorningsWithGoila is to spread joy while we are all under self-isolation.The idea is to add a positive note in everybody’s morning, so that they can actually spend the rest of the day with fun and happy thoughts.

Also, to teach amateurs and give them basic tips on how to survive in their kitchen while they are in self-isolation. It presents breakfast tips and shows how others are dealing with this situation — what are they eating, how are they spending their mornings and how they wake up. It is basically a community exercise, an Instagram live at 10 am everyday. The idea is to get people to cook together and tell them that they are not alone while secluded in their homes.

How has the experience of self-isolation been for you so far?

Honestly, the experience has been tough. Yes, I am getting time for myself, I am relaxing, it is also a break from the fast-paced life that I am usually used to. But, I would say that it is a tough situation to be in. I am trying to be as active in my home as I can be. I am generating a lot of content, I have a schedule and I am not treating this like a holiday.

People, at this time, are getting creative with food. How would you encourage them to channel their inner chefs at this time?

Yes, people are getting creative especially with food. The videos are to tell them that cooking is not tough. It i, in fact, therapeutic. People should treat it as they would treat music. They should imagine how good music makes them feel and that is how cooking should feel too.

The idea is to tell them that it is easy. You don’t have to necessarily know how to cut, chop, and bake. You can use a lot of quick tips and tricks on how to preserve things or how to save time and energy while you are in the kitchen. Quick fixes, quick recipes, lots of eggs, pulses and basic ingredients can be made into fun things. I am doing #MorningsWithGoila of course to encourage people to channel their inner chefs and I would tell them not to make same things every day, because that also depicts monotony in your life.

You could take the same ingredients but create new dishes every morning. I am also sharing a lot of recipes on my IGTV while in self-isolation.

Cooking is a survival skill. Everybody should know that cooking is as important as swimming or driving and I think. It is definitely one of those art forms that does not keep only you happy but those around you as well.

Everything is in your control when you are cooking by yourself in the kitchen. I think it is a beautiful way of meditating, of keeping yourself healthy and ensuring that all vitamins, minerals, carbs, proteins, good fats are part of your diet. I think a lot of people need to cook to survive but a lot of people should cook to be happy and to meditate.

What are some of the recipes that can be easily cooked if supplies are available?

A lot of people can make use of dal in different ways — tikkis, salad or khichdi out of dal. The idea is to use one ingredient and make different things around it. Like the same poha that we are used to eating for breakfast, can be made into a poha pulao or a poha biryani. You can also use the poha to give your tikki a crust. So start imagining an ingredient from different angles and I think that is what will help you to make a good breakfast.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/531gta/article31206145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MPMOLECULAR2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/quarantine-cooking-chef-saransh-goila-shares-easy-recipes-to-cook-during-lockdown/article31206146.ece

399,2020/03/30,"Lakhs of face masks, sanitisers seized in multiple raids in a day","10 arrested for raising prices of essentials during crisis

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch’s crackdown against black marketing in the time of COVID-19 continues, with three different units of the agency conducting raids in separate locations in Mumbai over the last 24 hours and seizing lakhs of face masks and hand sanitisers being hoarded and sold at enhanced prices.

In an order dated March 13, the State government brought masks and sanitisers under the ambit of essential commodities and capped their prices at ₹50 for 50ml of sanitiser, ₹8 for each two-ply mask and ₹10 for each three-ply mask.

According to officers, the first raid was conducted by Unit VIII at a medical store in Malad where, according to a tip-off, sanitisers and broad spectrum anti-microbial solution were being sold at enhanced rates. “We verified the information by sending a dummy customer, after which we raided the medical store. We seized 160 50-ml bottles of sanitiser being sold at ₹90 each, 175 100 ml bottles being sold at ₹175 and 279 bottles of anti-microbial solution being sold at ₹635,” an officer said.

The officer said the manager of the medical store, Bharat Dubaria (32), was arrested and is now being interrogated to find out how long he was running the racket and how many hand sanitisers he has sold so far.

Eventful 24 hours: (Clockwise from top) Officers from Unit X, XI and VIII of the Mumbai Police Crime Branch with the accused in all three cases.

The second raid was conducted by the Unit X in Bainganwadi Govandi, where three-ply face masks were allegedly being sold at ₹25 apiece. “Acting on the information received, we raided the premises and seized two trucks full of ₹2.97 lakh worth of masks and arrested four accused from the spot. We are now finding out where they procured the face masks from. If the accused can have such a large quantity at retailer level, there is bound to be a much larger stash with the suppliers,” an officer said.

The accused have been identified as Hussain Niyazi (28), Khursheeda Shaikh (30), Shahid Kudus (25) and Vikas Parmar (30), while two others are still wanted in the case, officers said.

Meanwhile, the third raid was conducted at three godowns in Dharavi by a team from the Crime Branch Unit XI in the early hours of Sunday. “We have seized 2,800 bottles of 100 ml and 420 bottles of 50 ml each of sanitisers worth ₹4.51 lakh and 1.51 lakh three-ply masks worth ₹22.74 lakh from the godowns,” an officer said.

Unit XI has arrested five accused in the case, identified as Adarsh Mishra (21), Shubham Tiwari (23), Ashraf Shaikh (50), Akhtar Faqoorui (48) and Yusuf Ansari (31).

400,2020/03/30,CIDCO opens exhibition centre to migrants,"More shelter homes, which will follow social distancing norms, to be set up

The CIDCO Exhibition Centre in Vashi has been opened up to migrants who have been rendered jobless and homeless due to the current COVID-19 crisis, on the orders of Konkan Divisional Commissioner Shivaji Daund. Many of these labourers have been trying to reach their hometown either on foot or in container trucks meant for transportation of essential goods.

Navi Mumbai’s Municipal Commissioner plans to have 14 such shelter homes across the city from Belapur to Digha ward. The collector and him will identify other places in the city which can be converted into shelters, which will follow social distancing norms. The Panvel City Municipal Corporation too has planned to approach private schools to identify makeshift shelter homes.

The exhibition centre is currently housing 63 people from Uttar Pradesh, 66 from Karnataka and 11 from Maharashtra, making a total of 140. Of these, 37 are women.

These 140 include people who were caught by the Vashi and Panvel City police in the wee hours of Sunday, trying to leave the city.

In the first incident, 77 passengers were caught at Vashi toll naka travelling in a truck meant for essential goods around 12.30 a.m. Meanwhile, around 1.30am, 16 people were found travelling in another container tempo near Palaspa.

The labourers were taken to the exhibition centre while two drivers in the tempo were booked. “States are not accepting their own people and borders have been blocked. To avoid this, the migrant workers will be taken to shelter homes and provided food,” Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Kumar said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dxuejy/article31201895.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BMCIDCO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cidco-opens-exhibition-centre-to-migrants/article31201896.ece
401,2020/03/30,APMC issues guidelines to prevent crowding,"Only 30% of traders will work with ID cards, trucks will not be allowed to park in market overnight

With vegetable traders deciding to stop work to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) board has come up with strategies to keep the market functioning without crowds.

The market saw a huge rush of customers on March 28, as vegetables were brought in on 1,200 trucks. The traders decided to stop work for their own safety. “We understand the traders’ concerns but at the same time, it is important that the essentials reach the citizen, so we have made a plan,” said Anil Chavan, secretary of the APMC board.

As per the plan, only 30% of the traders will function. Every trader will have to take approval from the board on the quantity and number of trucks that will be ordered, and can order the necessary stock only after the approval comes in. Only 300 trucks — the approved ones — will be allowed to enter inside the market. “We have started the work of constructing barricades outside the market for regulating queues,” Mr. Chavan said.

Due to the excessive stocks received on Saturday, the market was open on Sunday too, and 10% traders attended work. “Whoever takes the approval first will trade but only 30% of them will be there at a time,” said Shankar Pinglay, secretary of the vegetable market.

Meanwhile, the grain market too has made changes in its functioning as per directions from the police in consultation with the Grain, Rice & Oil Seeds Merchants Association and APMC.

“On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, only loading of goods will be done. On Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, unloading of goods will be done. Mathadi labourers will work from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m, so traders will have to manage their work accordingly,” said Nilesh Veera, director of the grain market.

APMC will issue identity cards to the traders and their staff, and no one will be allowed to enter the market without these, he said. All goods for delivery will need to be loaded into the local transporter’s truck, which will have to exit the market whether loaded or empty. “It is compulsory to wear a mask and wash hands while entering the market. Customers will not be allowed to enter,” said Mr. Veera.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/3iq0sz/article31201876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BMAPMC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/apmc-issues-guidelines-to-prevent-crowding/article31201877.ece
402,2020/03/30,BMC distributes food to homeless,"Over 6,000 packets given out with help from NGOs, donors

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has started distributing food packets to the homeless, pavement dwellers as well as to migrant labourers stuck in Mumbai during the lockdown called to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It distributed more than 6,000 food packets on Sunday.

According to the BMC’s planning department, there are about 12,000 pavement dwellers in Mumbai. It took up a drive to provide food packets to these people with the help of not-for-profit organisations and donors.

The corporation distributed about 2,000 packets on the first day and gradually increased it to 6,618 homeless persons on Sunday (two meals). It also distributed food to 725 migrant labourers who can’t leave the city.

“We had khichdi donated and provided to us by non-profit organisations. We distributed it among the homeless. In one case, some migrant labourers have been living at Mahim station. They came to the city only 10 days ago from Andhra Pradesh and are stuck. We are providing them with food too. We also ensured our night shelters were well stocked,” said Sangita Hasnale, assistant municipal commissioner (planning).

Ms. Hasnale has appealed to Mumbaikars to donate food to the BMC, preferably dry food, as that will not get spoilt in the heat. The BMC also needs drinking water bottles as the homeless and migrants, in many cases, have lost access to their source of water.

Meanwhile, the BMC has appealed to people to provide masks and gloves for its doctors. State Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray has donated 1 lakh Gamex gloves to the BMC. It also received more than 1,000 pieces of personal protective equipment recently.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5v1cys/article31201845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30bmfood-distribution,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-distributes-food-to-homeless/article31201847.ece

404,2020/03/30,Migrant labourers sent back to Mumbai from Igatpuri,"Workers boarded train thinking it was for Gorakhpur; it was to halt at Bhusaval yard

Nearly 51 migrant labourers were sent back from Igatpuri to Mumbai after they thought a train standing at the station was bound for Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh.

The labourers had reached Igatpuri on trucks and were in the vicinity of the station, when the train arrived on Sunday. Central Railway (CR) was running an empty rake from Mumbai and had contract workers of various railway departments on board the train.

According to sources, the rake’s eventual destination was Gorakhpur, which is its originating point, but it was to be stationed in Bhusaval yard before being sent to Gorakhpur.

“Since all trains were stopped, we were facing an issue of space at our yards in Mumbai. This rake originates from Gorakhpur and hence it was decided to run it empty till there with a halt at Bhusaval. Since we also had move a few workers to Bhusaval as well as a few who belong to Gorakhpur, they were on board the train,” a senior railway official said on condition of anonymity.

The issue cropped up at Igatpuri, where the train halted around 9 a.m. Other migrant workers stranded near the station entered, which was noticed by railway employees. Sources said since these workers had come from Mumbai and the railway authorities were not comfortable with evicting them, it was decided to return the rake to the city.

The rake left for Mumbai around 2 p.m. and reached Dadar station at 6 p.m. where the migrant labourers were handed over to the district administration. Arti Singh, Superintendent of Police, Nashik (Rural), said the local administration had not been informed by the railway authorities regarding the movement of the rake and only learnt about the development after local railway authorities informed them.

“Passenger train movement is shut till April 14. People are requested not to believe in rumours about such trains being run. We are running freight trains to supply essential commodities to various parts of India,” said chief public relations officer, CR, Shivaji Sutar.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/j4kra3/article31201813.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BMIGATPURI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/migrant-labourers-sent-back-to-mumbai-from-igatpuri/article31201814.ece
405,2020/03/30,"Truck smuggling labourers to U.P. intercepted, two booked","Accused charged the victims ₹2,500 per head

People-smuggling rackets seem to be the next big thing amidst the panic spawned from the ongoing lockdown after black marketing. The Saki Naka police, in the early hours of Sunday, busted one such racket, rescuing 64 people and booking two.

According to the police, the truck was stopped for a search during routine nakabandi in Saki Naka around 3 a.m.

“While the driver initially claimed that he was ferrying essentials, a closer inspection revealed that 64 people were packed in its back compartment with almost no space left, even to breathe. They were made to alight and we made inquiries, after which we found out that they were daily wage labourers,” an officer, who was part of the operation, said.

The officer said the workers, after running out of options for earning a livelihood in light of the lockdown, had opted to pay to get smuggled to their native place.

“The labourers had paid ₹2,500 per head to be dropped till U.P. as they had no other transport options available. Some of them were initially going to walk as far as they could and hitch rides wherever possible but weren’t sure they would be able to do so in light of the nakabandis and health concerns.” the officer said.

The police then counselled the workers and sent them back home, while also contacting the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to arrange for food and rations to last them for the time being.

“Meanwhile, the truck driver, Amjad Ali Shah (32), and owner, Ali Razaak Shah (35), were booked for disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant and negligence likely to spread infection of a disease under the Indian Penal Code along with sections of the Epidemic Diseases Act and the Disaster Management Act and the police are conducting further inquiries,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone X) Ankit Goyal said.

Also known as human-smuggling rackets, the offences are among the top serious concerns in the U.S., where illegal migrants from various countries are smuggled in boats and trucks under extremely inhuman conditions into the country’s borders, often leading to loss of life.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/truck-smuggling-labourers-to-up-intercepted-two-booked/article31201786.ece
406,2020/03/30,Civic training centre now an isolation facility,"A 250-bed isolation-cum-quarantine facility has partially started functioning at a civic training centre in Powai and already has nine COVID-19 positive patients. Much like Seven Hills Hospital, this centre had to be repaired within a few days and made functional. The repairs were funded by the real estate industry.

Considering the limited capacity at Kasturba hospital, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had planned isolation centres wherever possible. One such centre was to be operational at MCGM Municipal Capacity Building and Research Centre in Powai. The centre was built to train officers of other municipal corporations in an almost decade-old, seven-storey building.

Since the centre had to be turned into an isolation-cum-quarantine facility, the BMC had to take immediate measures to get it up and running.

The project was funded by the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) and the Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry. The repair work on one floor was completed, and it was readied within two-and-a-half days. Currently, two floors of the building are operational while the rest will be converted by the end of next week.

Manish Walunj, assistant municipal commissioner of L ward, said, “When we started work, we realised that the building had no bathrooms, only toilets. Those had to be built, electric connections had to be repaired, and lights and leakages had to be fixed. The fifth floor was made functional within two-and-a-half days.”

Currently, the BMC has set up a facility with around 100 beds. It will be expanded to 250. It has also appointed housekeeping staff and laundry service while food is being provided by a charitable institution.

The facility now has 14 patients, of whom nine are positive, while the rest are in quarantine. Municipal doctors and nurses are working in three shifts.

Prashant Sharma, treasurer of NAREDCO, said, “The building was almost like a warehouse. Since the facility was mostly cabins and conference rooms, we had to turn it into a proper isolation facility. Hospital beds had to be brought in from different cities as there is a dearth of that also. Besides, we have provided facilities like Wi-Fi, CCTV cameras, and intercom. We are happy to contribute.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/atjsb4/article31201776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BMPowai-facility,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/civic-training-centre-now-an-isolation-facility/article31201757.ece
407,2020/03/30,Will take care of all migrant labourers: CM,"Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said his government will take care of all migrant labourers and provide them shelter, food and water amid the COVID-19 lockdown.

“The State will protect them and provide food, but they should not leave. I understand they are anxious, but they should avoid increasing the risk of infection,” he said in an address on social media.

He said the Shiv Bhojan meal, which costs ₹10, will be available at ₹5 from April 1, and the government has already set up 163 centres across the State to provide food and water to migrant labourers.

“There are people from Maharashtra who are stranded in other States. I appeal to them as well not to move anywhere. In case of any emergency, you can get in touch with the Chief Minister’s Office,” he said.

The government on Sunday authorised district collectors to use the State Disaster Relief Fund (SDRF) to provide food, shelter, water and medical facilities to tourists, migrant labourers and the homeless. The State has already disbursed ₹45 crore from the SDRF to district administrations.

A government official said labourers are reaching borders using any possible mode of transport. “Directions have been given to ensure facilities to quarantine them if necessary. Special medical attention will be given to pregnant women and children. If there are more than 500 labourers, a 24-hour medical facility will be provided.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/will-take-care-of-all-migrant-labourers-cm/article31201714.ece
408,2020/03/30,300-bed facility comes up at Miraj medical college,"Govt. also contemplating 500-bed centre at Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College: Forest Minister

Miraj Government Medical College in Sangli district has been converted into a hospital to treat patients infected with novel coronavirus (COVID-19), Medical Education Minister Amit Deshmukh said on Sunday. The decision comes in the backdrop of 24 positive cases reported from Sangli’s Islampur.

A three-member committee under the leadership of Dr. Pallavi Saple, dean, Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, was set up after the sudden rise in number of positive patients. Following a visit by the team to Miraj, the medical college was converted into an exclusive facility with a capacity of 300 beds.

The hospital has 15 ICU beds, CT scan, and MRI facilities. A special centre to check the symptoms of the virus will also be set up in the next three-four days, Mr. Deshmukh said. “The process to train all resident doctors, nursing staff, drivers, and other staff members to treat such patients has begun. We will be completing the whole process within next week.”

Sangli’s Guardian Minister and Irrigation Minister Jayant Patil said all the patients, who had tested positive, were stable. “We hope to see improvement in their health soon. The hospital will be useful in treating patients.”

Similarly, Yavatmal’s Guardian Minister and Forest Minister Sanjay Rathod on Sunday announced that the government was contemplating to set up a 500-bed facility at Vasantrao Naik Government Medical College. “All three patients from Yavatmal, who were initially feared to be positive, have turned out to be negative. It is an extremely comforting news for us.

409,2020/03/30,COVID-19: two with no travel history die,"Toll in State now stands at eight

A 40-year-old woman from Kandivali in Mumbai and a 45-year-old man from Buldhana became the latest casualties of COVID-19 on Sunday, taking the State’s death toll to eight. Both had no international travel history and health officials are yet to trace their contact with any patient or high-risk person.

The Mumbai woman’s husband is a taxi driver. She was admitted to a private facility and when her condition worsened, they suspected COVID-19 and she was taken to KEM Hospital. While being examined at the outpatient department, she collapsed. “The doctors rushed her to a room in the casualty ward designated for suspected COVID-19 patients. Her condition deteriorated quickly and she succumbed,” said additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani. “Her husband is not in a position to narrate the exact history and her contacts,” he said.

A 23-year-old resident doctor who intubated the woman has been placed in home isolation. “About eight to 10 staff members [including nurses, ward boys and others] have been placed in home isolation and will be tested on the third day. If we test immediately, the tests may come negative,” KEM dean Dr. Hemant Deshmukh said.

Civic officials said the woman had hypertension, and her COVID-19 test came positive on Sunday.

Health officials remain puzzled by the death of the Buldhana man, a school headmaster, who was diabetic and had no travel history. “We haven’t found him in contact with any person with a travel history either,” said a health official. Twelve staff members, including doctors from a private hospital where he was admitted, have been placed in isolation along with his family members and contacts.

On Sunday, the State recorded 17 new cases — nine from Mumbai, one from Pune, three from Nagpur, two from Ahmednagar and one each from Sangli and Buldhana — taking the tally to 203. So far, 35 patients have been discharged.

86-year-old critical

An 86-year-old woman from Ghatkopar, who tested positive on Friday, is in a critical condition. Her son, a U.S.-returned man, had tested positive earlier as had his 68-year-old domestic help. While those two were discharged from Kasturba Hospital, the mother had tested negative earlier and was in home isolation. After she tested positive, civic officials traced her contacts afresh as she had stayed with relatives for a few days and was admitted to a private nursing home.

411,2020/03/30,Health Minister flays L-G,"The Minister said it was important to support the Prime Minister than putting hurdles to his initiatives

Minister for Health Malladi Krishna Rao on Monday flayed Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi for her decision not to allow Yanam Old Age Home or Yanam Voluntary Association to provide home delivery of essential items to people of Yanam.

Talking to reporters in the Assembly, the Minister said the organisations were denied permission citing the reason that they were promoted by him. The organisations came forward to deliver goods so as to avoid people from coming out and to put pressure on outlets selling food products to reduce the price, he said.

“In fighting and opposing me, the Lieutanant Governor has denied the people an opportunity to get free service. After all I am only a founder member of the two organisations and not an active member. Such initiatives are not just done in Yanam but in the entire country after the lockdown announced by the Prime Minister,” he said.

412,2020/03/30,MGMCRI opens up tele-consultation modes,"The Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute Hospital (MGMCRI), a constituent unit of Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth, has launched seven alternative modes that help patients seek medical consultations form the safe confinement of their homes, as part of promoting social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 24x7 services will be available on toll free number 18004251008.

The patients can also call via video calling through WhatsApp on 8300654933 or send a direct message to @mgmcrihospital on Facebook and @mgmcrio on the official Twitter handle of the Hospital.

Further patients, may also place a video call through Skype app on mgm.tele or make a telephonic call on landline numbers 0413-2616771, 2616774. The Skype id and landline numbers will be attended from 9am to 4pm including Sundays. All calls will be answered by specialist doctors,said Nirmal Coumare, Medical Superintendent of MGMCRI.

According to MGMCRI, though telemedicine will not solve all problems, it is well suited for scenarios in which medical practitioners can evaluate and manage patients. Telemedicine practice can prevent the transmission of infectious diseases reducing the risks to both health care workers and patients. Unnecessary and avoidable exposure of the people involved in delivery of healthcare can to be avoided using telemedicine and patients can be screened remotely.

It can provide rapid access to medical practitioners who may not be immediately available in person. Thus, health systems that are invested in telemedicine are well positioned to ensure that patients with Covid-19 kind of issues receive the care they need.

Patients can in if they have any queries regarding COVID-19, old symptoms not improving, new symptoms, minor ailments, confusions regarding long term medications/illnesses, said M. Ravishankar, Dean of MGMCRI.

“The delivery and facilitation of health and health-related services including medical care, provider and patient education, health information services, and self-care via telecommunications and digital communication can go a long way in maintaining social distancing and flattening the curve,” Subhash Chandra Parija, Vice Chancellor of Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth, said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/mgmcri-opens-up-tele-consultation-modes/article31209442.ece
413,2020/03/30,Fire service ill-equipped to handle major accident: CAG,"Absence of fire-safety equipment in schools, hospitals and cinema halls, non-compliance of fire safety rules while setting up industries and non-adherence of fire safety rules during issuance of cracker licence are some of the glaring deficiencies pointed out by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India in its audit report for 2017- 18.

The CAG report, which was tabled in the Legislative Assembly on Monday, said there were 430 government and 301 private schools in the Union Territory.

While the private schools had obtained non objection certificate from the Fire Service Department (FSD) for accreditation, the government schools had failed to adhere to the safety norms.

Of the 349 government schools surveyed, only nine schools had installed hose reels and had fire extinguishers with validity period. The validity period of fire extinguishers installed in the remaining schools had expired long back.

None of the public health centres, including eight general hospitals, had provided fire safety devices such as fire extinguisher, hose reel covering entire floor area and electric fire alarm system. The hospitals are functioning without proper fire safety measures in place, jeopardising the safety of doctors, patients and visitors.

It also pointed out deficiency in providing fire control mechanism in cinema halls, the audit report pointed out.

The National Disaster Management Authority had stipulated preparation of a comprehensive data, population, land use, type of buildings, accessibility, health care system and industrial locations. The FSD had, however, failed to gather details of high rise buildings, hazardous industries and high risk area.

Pointing out that U.T. had witnessed 1065 fire accidents during 2013-18, the audit expressed dismay over the government’s failure to enact the Fire Force Act. In the absence of such a legislation, there was no legal framework enabling the fire force to take control of the area of fire accident to prevent or limit the damage to life and property.

""Thus in the event of an accident, fire service personnel are handicapped to exercise powers as given in the Fire Act of neighbouring States to control crowd, access water sources, remove obstructions and people,” the report pointed out.

Painting a grim look at the operational preparedness of the department, the report revealed that all the 18 fire engines/tenders available in U.T. were more than 10 years old and were in use for a period ranging from 12 to 26 years. They also had leakage problem, poor tyres and major repairs.

In Puducherry region, the report said, nine fire stations which which have to cater to a population of 9. 50 lakh were provided with nine water/feeder tenders against the requirement of 19. There is also lack of sufficient foam tenders and communication equipment.

“The shortfall in fire fighting equipment and also the poor condition of the existing fire fighting equipment and also the poor condition of the existing machinery would handicap the department in combating any major fire disaster,” the report said.

The non-adherence to safety regulations and apathy of the administration to facilitate compliance leaves the population of U.T. vulnerable to destruction caused by fire accidents, the report charged.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/fire-service-ill-equipped-to-handle-major-accident-cag/article31209008.ece

419,2020/03/30,COVID-19 | Officials puzzled over how man got infected,"68-year-old has no travel history, contacts with infected

The district administration continues to grope in the dark over the source of infection of a Pothencode native who was tested positive for COVID-19 a day ago.

That the 68-year-old man, who has been battling multiple ailments, has no recent history of foreign travel and no infected contacts identified so far has kept the officials on tenterhooks.

The patient, who has been undergoing dialysis, remains in a critical state in the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH) where he is being treated since March 23. Based on the information obtained from his family members and relatives, the district authorities have released a patient flowchart for contact tracing.

He had attended the wedding of a relative in the Rajasree auditorium at Ariyottukonam, near Pothencode, on March 2. The same day, he had gone to the sub-treasury office near the Thiruvananthapuram MCH to collect pension and later attended the funeral of a relative at Nagaroor Manzil Kabaradi.

During the next few days, the places he had visited included the Nagaroor Manzil Kabaradi (on March 11); Juma Masjid, Vavarambalam, near Pothencode (on March 13); Ayiroopara Farmers Service Cooperative Bank (before 2 p.m. on March 17); and Mohanapuram (on March 18).

He had sought treatment at the Thonakkal primary health centre on March 18 after developing symptoms of the disease. After seeking medical care in the hospital again on March 21, he had gone to Sree Gokulam Medical College, Venjaramoodu, two days later. He was referred to the MCH a short while later.

Health workers are currently engaged in efforts to identify the people who participated in the functions he had attended during the period. With the patient engaged in tapioca cultivations, efforts are also on to identify his customers.

Chance for contact

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran said there was information that he could have come in close contact with people from Kasaragod, Chennai and Dubai, but such details were yet to be ascertained. He added that the Pothencode native used to frequent a tea stall that used to be a meeting point for many local residents in the locality.

Mr. Surendran added the patient had been residing with his daughter who works as a bus conductor. His two other daughters are currently settled in Malappuram and near the Thiruvananthapuram MCH.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ookwup/article31214265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/officials-puzzled-over-how-man-got-infected/article31212049.ece
420,2020/03/30,Giving the right info during COVID-19 times,"KSSP teams up with experts to stop spread of fake news, help people cope with lockdown fallouts

Over the past two days, migrant workers in different parts of Kerala have been receiving fake messages about transportation being arranged for them to travel back home.

The Kerala Sasthra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP) has been quick to react to this, spreading messages in six languages to reassure the workers, in WhatsApp groups and directly at their shelters.

What enabled this quick response was the KSSP’s vast network of WhatsApp groups, at least one each in every panchayat, titled ‘Coveto – veto to Covid’, that have been formed over the past few weeks to disseminate accurate information on COVID-19 and to dispel fake messages.

“People get a lot of information on WhatsApp, but 75% of it is false, which a layperson cannot identify easily. We formed a campaign cell with doctors and public health experts, who prepare the core material to be spread. Videos, audio, posters and small write-ups on government directions, simplified scientific information on the virus, precautions to be taken, the importance of the lockdown and such issues are sent to the district-level groups and from there to the local body level. In these local-level groups, we have members from various political parties, Kudumbashree and ASHA workers and others who regularly interact with the public. They spread this to their WhatsApp groups and speak about it to those whom they meet,” says K. Radhan, State general secretary of the KSSP, a people’s science movement started close to 60 years ago.

The team of doctors include State Planning Board member B. Ekbal, K.P. Aravindan, A.K. Jayashree and others. They have published messages busting fake information like how coronavirus would die at high temperatures or that it cannot survive on surfaces beyond a day. Post the lockdown, the messages have been reoriented to address psychological issues faced by people forced to stay indoors.

For children, they have devised interesting competitions like identifying the bird from a short sound clip of its chirping and a drawing competition for various ages. For the adults, the KSSP has released a small list of physical exercises that can be taken up to maintain fitness during the lockdown. Also continuing are the ongoing campaigns on handwashing, social distancing, the need to take special care of the old who are afflicted with other serious diseases.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/7zpqbl/article31212377.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200330-WA0025,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/giving-the-right-info-during-covid-19-times/article31209188.ece
421,2020/03/30,Collector to hold talks with labour contractors,"Unhindered supply of food, water to migrants to be ensured

With the migrant population coming under the spotlight in the State during the ongoing lockdown, the district administration has intensified efforts to remove hindrances in supply of food, water and health-care facilities for workers who have been accommodated in various areas.

District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan will convene a meeting of contractors who have engaged labourers from other States for various projects on Monday to ascertain the welfare of the migrant population.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran, who has been spearheading the COVID-19 containment efforts in the district, said that certain contractors had failed to honour their responsibility of ensuring the well-being of migrant labourers.

“There have been reports of migrant workers being denied food and water. Such instances cannot be taken lightly at a time when migrant workers have begun to raise concerns in various parts of the State,” Mr. Surendran said.

The Fort police have registered a case against a contractor who threatened to evict around 40 migrant labourers whom he had engaged for a construction work at Kalippankulam, near Manacaud.

422,2020/03/30,Community kitchens come to the aid of many,"Each canteen provides food to 250-300 persons

She has been reaching the Kudumbashree canteen near the bus-stand in the Attingal municipality by 5.30 a.m. since Wednesday. The canteen where Sobha B. used to cook is now a community kitchen which serves free food to over 250 people in the wake of the lockdown following the COVID-19 situation.

Besides breakfast, lunch too is served here to people in home quarantine, migrant workers, the destitute, bedridden patients, those unable to cook for other reasons, and so on.

Used to cooking for 100 to 200 people, Sobha now finds herself cooking breakfast and lunch for many more, with the support of seven others.

“Breakfast on Friday was upumavu and banana. On Saturday, we added puttu to the menu.”

It is hectic work. “Rice for lunch is already cooking by 7 a.m. By 11 a.m., the food has to be ready for packing.”

Municipal councillors, Kudumbashree CDS chairpersons and Kudumbashree neighbourhood group members all pitch in to help prepare the food and pack it for home delivery. As Sobha’s husband helps her out in the kitchen, food for their two children back home is also delivered from the kitchen.

The destitute come to the canteen and are given food packets by maintaining social distancing norms. In the case of the remaining people, food is delivered to to their houses.

Huge demand

The demand, Sobha says, is so much that many people had to be turned away. From Monday, they plan to serve food to all those who ask for it for ₹20.

Dharmarajan S. has been a cook for 40-odd years. He is in charge of cooking free food at the Thenguvila Devi temple auditorium in Kottukal panchayat for those affected by the lockdown.

In Kottukal, lunch was served to over 300 people on the first day of the community kitchen on Saturday. Dharmarajan started his day early and with the support of panchayat members and Kudumbashree CDS, ADS, and neighbourhood group members, got food ready and packed to be delivered by the panchayat’s vehicles.

Kottukal CDS chairperson Prasanna Kumari says the number of people they expected to serve was around 250, but on Saturday, the demand had upped to 300. This included three persons in isolation and nearly 130 in home quarantine.

Financial constraints

Though they want to serve food three times a day, financial constraints may play spoilsport. Depending on the turnout on Sunday, they will take a call on serving breakfast, at least to those who ask for it.

They have also arranged to provide food to anyone for ₹20 if they call up or message on the WhatsApp number provided by the panchayat.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/l4uj9w/article31203213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30tvtvcommunityjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/community-kitchens-come-to-the-aid-of-many/article31203214.ece

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran said the Malayinkeezhu native’s wife and son had also been quarantined. While he remained confined in his house since his arrival on March 21, the patient apparently failed to maintain a safe distance from his family members as suggested in the COVID-19 guidelines.

The other Thiruvananthapuram native who tested positive on Saturday was residing with his mother in a flat at Pattoor here.

He was in home quarantine since his return from the United Kingdom a few days ago.

Six under treatment

424,2020/03/30,Postal employees demand closure of post offices,"With the Department of Posts seeking to offer offer basic postal services to the public through as many post offices as possible despite the curfew imposed to contain the spread of COVID 19, a section of the postal employees have express concern over the personal safety of the employees and urged the Centre to remove postal services from the list of essential services.

According to sources, only the Head Post Office in Tiruchi and a few other offices in the Central postal region were functioning with limited number of staff. Many staff members were not reporting for duty and several sub post offices remain closed, sources in the employees unions say.

“We have not been provided with adequate personal safety gear such as masks and sanitisers. In some places, we have been asked to purchase them. But they are not available in the market. Besides, would it be possible to maintain personal distancing norms when a lot of people visit the post offices,” wondered S. Sasikumar, State Deputy Secretary, National Federation of Postal Employees, said.

Contending that employees would be forced to work with constant fear if forced to come to office, Mr. Sasikumar pointed out that movement of postal articles remain suspended in the absence of road, rail and air transport services. Aadhaar services have also been suspended. Only financial services can be offered at the post offices. However, as debit cards having been issued to account holders with post offices, customers can withdraw cash from Automated Teller Machines, he maintained and added that keeping the post offices would only lead to the spread of the virus.

When contacted, a senior officer in the region conceded that employees had apprehensions turning up for work and only a few post offices were functional but maintained that steps have been taken to supply sanitisers and masks to the staff. He also conceded that movement of postal articles have been affected due to lack of transport. However, he said bookings of speed post and registered posts were being accepted but customers were being told that there will be a delay in delivery.

In another recent representation, office bearers of employees unions expressed concern over the administration asking the staff to attend duty without adequate precautionary measures.

“We cannot come out from houses since police are objecting. Besides there is no mode of public transport to reach the office. In these situation,we don't understand how it is possible to reach the office,” they said.

Alternatively, they demanded transport arrangements from and to the residences and offices of the employees; issue of passes by the Revenue authorities to venture out of their houses, risk allowance and supply of thermal scanners, masks, gloves and sanitisers, besides insurance for employees and officers, called for work.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/p19tnz/article31210033.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY31POSTOFFICETRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/postal-employees-demand-closure-of-post-offices/article31210034.ece
425,2020/03/30,Milk producers stare at loss as procurement dips,"Farmers, who rear milch animals, in Tiruchi and Perambalur districts, stare at huge loss due to drastic scaling down of procurement by dairy firms in the wake of lockdown.

There are about 30 private dairy firms in Tiruchi and Perambalur districts. According to a rough estimate, they procure about 10 lakh litres of milk every day directly from the farmers. Besides meeting the residential and commercial requirements in Tiruchi district, they supply milk in sachets in Chennai, Kancheepuram, Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga and other parts of the State.

Since the enforcement of curfew on Tuesday, most of the dairy companies have drastically reduced procurement as they find it difficult to market the milk mainly due to closure of restaurants, eateries, confectioneries and tea stalls across the State.

Though there is no bar on transport of essential commodities, most milk transporters are said to be reluctant to operate tankers due to problems in inter-State and inter-district movement of transports.

Vijay Dairy, one of the leading firms in Tiruchi district, has scale down procurement by 50%. It just procures about 50,000 litres a day as against one lakh litres. Most companies procure only for domestic supply.

“Though milk comes under the list of essential commodities, we come across various hurdles in transportation and other issues due to the lockdown. Hence, we have no other option but to reduce the procurement,” says J. Mathan Mohan, Managing Director, Vijay Dairy, Tiruchi.

As a sequel to it, several farmers sell milk at throwaway prices in their respective areas, thereby causing huge loss.

As against the average procurement price of ₹31 a litre, milk is sold at ₹10 -15 a litre in villages.

“I suffer a loss of ₹900 a day as no company comes forward to procure milk. So far I have incurred a loss of ₹2,700 since Saturday. Just imagine the total loss during the remaining curfew period. It is really a rough period for us,” says I. Raja of Naganallur near Thuraiyur, who has five cows.

However, the Tiruchi District Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union (Aavin) continues to procure milk as usual.

A senior official of the Aavin said that there has so far been no change in volume of procurement from the member societies due to curfew restrictions.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/milk-producers-stare-at-loss-as-procurement-dips/article31209968.ece

Assuring the public that essential commodities such as fruit and vegetables would be made available in the district, Mr. Sivarasu said that precautionary measures to avoid the gathering of large crowds are being taken. “Public will only be allowed to enter these markets if they are wearing face masks,” he said.

Mr. Sivarasu said that the Gandhi Market would be locked up on Monday evening after which no vendor would be allowed to enter it. “The police department has been instructed and action will be taken if anybody tries to enter the market area,” he said. The police would, however, allow the transportation of vegetables and fruit around the city to those who have acquired identity cards from the district administration, he added.

Meanwhile, the distribution of ₹1,000 as financial assistance announced by Chief Minister Edappadi K.

The Commissionerate for the Welfare of Differently Abled has set up a helpline for persons with disabilities and through the helpline, officials in the district are arranging supply of grocery and food delivery for visually impaired people.

The District Differently Abled Welfare Officer R. Ravichandran said that since the helpline number- 18004250111 was set up last week, they receive about 45 to 50 calls seeking help in purchasing groceries and other essentials. The helpline number is routed through the DDRO and revenue officials in the district, he said.

Mr. Ravichandran said that through various philanthropists in the city they were able to acquire donations and provide groceries for families across Tiruchi. “We have distributed rice, sugar, dal, palm oil and other necessities. But many requested cooked food,” Mr. Ravichandran said. With the help of city-based NGOs, food is now being provided, he added.

Over 600 visually impaired members, including their families, reside at a designated colony at Nagamangalam in Manikandam block of Tiruchi. As they live away from the city and due to the lockdown they were unable to get access to any shops, Mr. Ravichandran said.

Through Shri Foundation, an NGO, lunch was being provided to the residents in the colony. “A coordinator from the colony has been appointed and he takes the food from the volunteers and serves them at lunch time,” Mr. Ravichandran said.

Although transporting the food was initially a problem, the support of the Tiruchi City Police has encouraged them to continue, said M. Veerapan, a coordinator at the colony.

The residents are also being trained on the importance of hygiene and personal distancing. “It is difficult for a visually impaired person, especially those who are aged, to walk independently but it is important to keep clean at this time,” Mr. Veerappan said.

Donations to provide groceries continue to pour in Mr. Ravichandran said. “It is heartening to see that people want to help others in this testing time.

“We feel that we have been made a laughing stock as proceeding to a pharmacy or to the hospital is allowed all through the day from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Some motorists casually flaunt the pharmacy bill indicating that they had gone to purchase sanitisers or other medicines. The worst of all is that during morning hours, couples travel in motorcycles to the Keezhavasal area for purchasing vegetables and groceries from the Old Town area, housing board area, and the Medical College Road though such shops function in their area itself,” lamented a traffic constable posted at a junction on the Gandhi Road.

Another problem faced by them was the movement of relatives of patients near the government and as well as private hospitals. As hospitals have cancelled visiting hours, visitors who were keen on meeting their relatives admitted at the hospitals adopt the technique of getting into the premises as out-patients, said a private security guard at the Government Rajah Mirasdar Hospital.

“How can you prevent a person wanting to enter the premises under the pretext of seeking medical assistance for his or her children. Once in they somehow manage to get their work done and leave the premises with glee”, he regretted. A similar technique was said to be adopted by the relatives of patients admitted to other hospitals also, though some hospitals denied that such practices were not entertained in their institutions.

Meanwhile, a woman constable posted at a junction near the Big Temple fretted that she was scolded by a doctor on Monday morning. “The doctor indicted the police of not realising the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic as if we are encouraging the people to roam around during curfew”, she said.

Expressing displeasure over the situation in which they were asked to execute their duties, a constable at Keezhavasal junction claimed that people would remain indoors only if they were allowed to deal with violators firmly.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/in-thanjavur-police-find-it-tough-to-control-public/article31207213.ece
431,2020/03/30,Dumping of waste on roadsides is back,"The Tiruchi City Corporation had, in May, declared that nearly 95% of the 1,172 large bins across the city were removed to ensure that waste is handed over to a sanitary worker directly.

Irregular garbage collection during the lockdown is causing inconvenience to residents across the city.

Dumping of waste in public places, especially in road corners and unclaimed land has also increased, residents complain.

“Every morning at around 7 a.m., the garbage truck would pass by our house with loud music announcing its arrival and we would rush to hand over the waste, however, in the last week, the vehicle has come only once,” said S. Yogesh, a resident of Puthur.

“We collect our waste in a larger bin outside the house so we can hand it over whenever the sanitary workers come,” he said.

Meanwhile, some residents especially those residing in apartment complexes have begun dumping waste in road corners.

The Kathirikai Vaikal passing through Ramalinga Nagar and Kumaran Nagar is filled with garbage.

“Residents drive past and throw bags of garbage in the Vaical or near it almost everyday these days. If we question them, they speak rudely and ask us to pick it up if it bothers us,” said R. Farooq, a grocery shop owner.

The Tiruchi City Corporation had, in May, declared that nearly 95% of the 1,172 large bins across the city were removed to ensure that waste is handed over to a sanitary worker directly. “Those big bins would have made our lives easier in a situation like this. Sanitary workers would only have to clear the bins,” said M. Nisha a resident of K. K. Nagar.

“In our locality the sanitary workers come by foot door- to- door to collect waste instead of coming in the vehicles. With the summer heat and the looming threat of coronavirus, they are putting themselves at a major risk,” she said.

Officials of the civic body denied irregularities and said that the workers are going to collect waste regularly.

“Because of the lockdown, many residents are dumping the waste on the roadside instead. Checks will be made and those found dumping will be fined,” a senior official said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/r0e6kh/article31213024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY31GARBAGETRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/dumping-of-waste-on-roadsides-is-back/article31207209.ece
432,2020/03/30,Wives of police personnel chip in to make masks,"Big demand for the protective gear in open market prompted the four women to make masks for the men in uniform attached to Tiruchi Rural Police.

Over the past three days A. Chandramathi and three other women residing in the District Armed Reserve quarters here have been devoting about four hours a day to make masks for police personnel apart from their regular household chores. The four women who are members of the newly formed Margaret Self Help Group have been doing this as a service for the well-being of the law enforcers deployed at various public locations in Tiruchi district to strictly enforce prohibitory orders issued in the wake of COVID-19.

Big demand for the protective gear in open market prompted the four women to make masks for the men in uniform attached to Tiruchi Rural Police.

All the four women who have sewing machines in their respective residence were given a hands-on training by an official from the Mahalir Thittam here recently on making masks.

“Raw material is provided by the district police and using the material we make masks every day”, says A. Chandramathi whose husband Arumugam is a Head Constable attached with the District Armed Reserve Unit here.

“We have jointly made about 600 masks so far ever since we commenced this task three days ago after being asked by the police authorities,” says Ms. Chandramathi.

The masks made of cotton are washable and could be reused.

Ms. Chandramathi says she and the other three women, whose husbands were also police personnel attached with the District Armed Reserve Unit here, set apart some time to make the masks in addition to carrying out regular household works.

“Since there was a great demand for masks in the open market, we took up this work to do our bit as a service for the well-being of police personnel,” says Chandramathi adding that she was now in a position to make about 100 masks every day.

A senior police officer attached to Tiruchi Rural Police said the masks made by the Margaret Self Help Group were being sent to the District Police Office from where it was being distributed to the police sub divisions in Tiruchi Rural as well as to the personnel in the Armed Reserve.

The Tiruchi Rural Police accounts for a total number of five sub divisions: Tiruverambur, Lalgudi, Jeeyapuram, Musiri and Manapparai with teams of police personnel deployed in 35 check posts and in other places all over the district to enforce prohibitory orders.

Ariyalur

Similarly, a couple of women in neighbouring Ariyalur district whose husband were police personnel attached with the Armed Reserve Unit were engaged in making masks.

The women have made about 350 masks with 50 pieces every day.

438,2020/03/30,"Data | To reduce coronavirus spread, India needs to test more, lockdown notwithstanding","As witnessed in countries which imposed strict restrictions but saw a surge in cases later, a nation-wide lockdown may not be enough in India

In India, the growth of COVID-19 cases has neither been exponential nor has it flattened out. The curve lies somewhere in the middle. But this picture is misleading as India has a poor testing rate.

Despite the fact that India has among the lowest % of positive cases of those tested, the 21-day lockdown, which began on March 25, may not be enough. This is borne out in countries which imposed lockdowns but saw a surge in cases later.

The three curves

The graph shows the day-wise progression of COVID-19 cases since the 100th case in each country. Some countries such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea have managed to flatten the curve.

Many such as the U.S., the U.K., Spain and Italy are seeing an exponential rise in cases.

The rest such as India, Indonesia, Peru, Iceland, Finland and Saudi Arabia are middling.

Is a lockdown enough?

Countries such as South Korea chose not to impose a lockdown but instead reduce the spread by ramping up testing rates early. Others who did not increase their testing rates early chose to impose a lockdown in order to contain the spread.

While Belgium, like India, imposed a lockdown early, the infections continued to increase as testing rates increased.

439,2020/03/30,‘Bag valve masks’ pitched as alternatives to ventilators,"IIT-Hyderabad scientists say the low-cost devices need to be manufactured on a war footing under the monitoring of a government task force.

B.S. Murty, Director of the Indian Institute of Technology – Hyderabad, has urged the government to consider the use of ‘bag valve masks’ as an alternative to meet any surge in demand for ventilators, in the wake of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

State Helpline numbers | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India | Coronavirus - Live updates

Conventional ventilators are generally expensive, hard to produce and not portable, Prof. Murty said. He, along with V. Eswaran, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, IIT-H, explained that ‘bag valve masks’ were small devices used to deliver breathing support in emergency situations. They are also known as “ambu bags”.

The scientists said that ‘bag valve masks’ are currently hand-powered and therefore not suitable for continuous use as a ventilator. But, they posited, this could easily be remedied by designing similar devices powered by an electrical source, which could be a car battery or conventional power supply. The devices would be made portable, and therefore easy to use in villages and other areas without power supply and could be manufactured in bulk quite inexpensively.

“Our estimate is that it can be made for less than ₹5,000, or one-hundredth of the cost of a conventional machine. The cost is so low that it can be considered a single-use device that will be given over to a single patient, and never used again. It needs to be manufactured, however, on an industrial scale, in millions, within a short time of a few months. There have been several designs proposed within India itself, with IIT–H having at least one proposed design,” Prof. Murty said.

The scientists said the idea was not new. In the past few weeks, many countries have come up with the idea of manufacturing low-cost ventilators and have even initiated competitions where the winning design would be declared open-source, which are not patented, and can be given free for anyone to adopt. Several designs are already available for 3-D printing, and so can be manufactured on a small scale on a 3-D printer.

The scientists added a note of caution that some designs were untested and uncertified. They proposed that the government (through the Department of Science and Technology or the Defence Research and Development Organisation or any other nodal organisation) constitute a task force, to oversee the production of low-costs devices within a limited time. The production rate would need to be of several lakh units per week, so the preparation has to be done at a war-footing, under the scrutiny of the government.

High demand

The Indian industry has a maximum manufacturing capacity of approximately 6,000 units per month, but even the Indian-made devices use a lot of foreign-made parts whose availability would now be uncertain, when every country would be maximizing their own ventilator production.

A ventilator is a device designed to force breathable air into the lungs of patients who are unable to breathe for themselves.

Modern ventilators are expensive and sophisticated devices, which are generally found only in the ICUs (intensive care units) of large hospitals.

The most sophisticated computer-controlled ventilators cost around ₹40 lakh while more modest ones cost around ₹15 lakh (made abroad) and Indian-made ventilators cost around ₹6 lakh each.

Also Read Coronavirus | With over 180 fresh cases in 24 hours, India shifts focus to hotspots

The IIT scientists said that assuming a low 6% infection rate, 80 million people could get affected in India. Of these 80 million, at least 5% (4 million patients) would require ventilators. Each of these 4 million patients would need the ventilators for around 21 days, thereby blocking that machine for at least that amount of time.

Further, the machines are not portable and are found only in high-end hospitals in large cities, so patients from villages would need to be transported to these cities, which would be a logistics problem of unimaginable complexity. Even if the Indian industry was at peak production of ventilators, it could manufacture only another 60,000 machines in the next 10 months, at a cost of ₹3,600 crore, the scientists estimate.

Therefore, the total number of ventilators would barely be 1 lakh devices — at a time when millions of machines may be needed. “We cannot depend of the conventional ventilators for a solution to this crisis,” Prof. Eswaran said.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/lqa7f2/article31211949.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31th-ambu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/bag-valve-masks-pitched-as-alternatives-to-ventilators/article31211951.ece

“Project Stay I is an initiative to strengthen the bulwark against COVID-19 by creating isolation rooms in hotels with light medical supervision for quarantine and creating a barrier to ensure people recover without spreading the virus,” Dr. Sangita Reddy, joint managing director, Apollo Hospitals Group, said. This will also ensure that people who don’t need hospital beds are not using the scarce resource if they are not critically sick, she said, adding that the project will help to “Break the chain” and is expected to help over 10,000 patients in a month and prevent over 50 lakh infections.

These isolation rooms will be rolled out in Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Delhi, starting with approximately 500 rooms. About 50 rooms will be added every three days to take the total number of such rooms to 5,000 in the country.

Even as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) insists that there is no community transmission of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in India, on March 29, the Health Ministry on its website mentions that there is “limited community transmission”. In the document on standard operating procedure for transporting a suspect/confirmed case of COVID-19, the Health Ministry website says that there is both local transmission and limited community transmission.

Also read: Coronavirus | Cases surge; ICMR denies community transmission

On March 29, Dr. Raman R. Gangakhedkar, Chief Epidemiologists at ICMR told ANI that 11 of 110 people with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) had tested positive for coronavirus. Only a few days ago ICMR allowed testing pneumonia and SARI patients for novel coronavirus to know if there is community transmission.

Also Read COVID-19: It takes just a small sacrifice to see them through this crisis

Since, almost 85% of people infected with the virus do not require hospitalisation, 11 SARI patients testing positive for the virus is an reflection of wider spread of the virus in the community. Since the virus is known to spread fast, wider testing in the community is required in the areas from where the SARI cases have been reported.

But Dr. Gangakhedkar insists that there is no community transmission yet in India. “Three of these patients, who belong to Chennai, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra do not have any travel history or any contact with an infected person. These few cropped up cases are not the base of solid evidence for community transmission,” Dr. Gangakhedkar told ANI. The Hindu could not reach Dr. Gangakhedkar.

“Community transmission is well defined in epidemiology as number of cases with no known contact with a confirmed case per 1,00,000 cases or in a particular geographical area. But its use in a given situation is an operational issue,” says Prof. Giridhara Babu, Head of the Lifecourse Epidemiology at the Public Health Foundation of India, Bengaluru.

According to Prof. Babu, once the government confirms community transmission, the testing strategy currently in use has to be changed and testing has to be expanded to confirm the extent of community transmission.

The Situation Reports of the World Health Organization, including the latest one on March 29, lists all countries where even a single case of novel coronavirus has been reported as having either local transmission or imported cases only. The WHO has not listed community transmission for any country including the U.S., which with 1,43,527 cases is the highest in the world, and other countries such as Italy, China and Spain.

However, in the legend, WHO defines community transmission as the “inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases”.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/nxggt0/article31210936.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-health-ministry-says-limited-community-transmission-in-india/article31210937.ece
442,2020/03/30,Specialised care for the elderly during the COVID-19 crisis,"Doctors in Chennai offer services to support senior citizens in every possible way, without them having to step out of their homes

“Anxiety and panic is gripping the geriatric population now. Let me assure you that those above the age of 65 are safe as long as they do not expose themselves. Staying completely locked down within their homes will safeguard them,” says Dr Lakshmipathy Ramesh, practising geriatrician, and founder Geri Care, Chennai. “If they are living as a joint family with their sons/daughters, I would suggest that they stay in their room during this lockdown period and avoid coming into contact with other younger members of the family,” he says.

Going by trends across the globe, the elderly seem to be more at risk if they are infected by the Coronavirus; they require more protection during these times. Dr Kannan Pugazhendi, sports medicine expert and founder of SPARRC Sports and Fitness Medicine Centre, says, “We are conducting a geriatric camp for this population via an online platform beginning April 2.”

At Geri Care, there is a team of four doctors who offer tele-consultation services round the clock for their existing patients as well as new. “From a psychological perspective, elderly patients feel assured and communicate well if they see the doctor face to face, which is why we have started video consultations. This way, it is easier for us to assess their condition and anxiety levels,” says Dr Lakshmipathy. Ever since the COVID-19 threat surfaced in our country, he has been receiving calls from senior citizens seeking clarifications about various vaccines and medicines to contain the virus, based on information circulated on social media and WhatsApp forwards. Often, he gets distress calls from anxious elderly people. “Couples whose children are living abroad seem to be more worried. We have been advising them to stay indoors, stock up on medicines for two months, follow their diet carefully so that their BP and sugar levels are maintained during the lockdown,” he adds.

Mobility is essential for the geriatric population, and even a minimal stretch or movement gives them immense benefit, and slows degeneration. “We strictly advise senior citizens to avoid going for a walk during this period, but we encourage them to do some simple isometric exercises to strengthen their muscles, or do yoga, basic breathing exercises and meditation,” Dr Lakshmipathy says. The Geri Care team suggests that they not do physiotherapy until the lockdown ends as outside contact is to be completely eliminated. Elderly people are also advised to stay hydrated.

“At SPARRC, we have divided our geriatric patients into various groups based on their medical history; for example, we have the neurogeriatric group, cardiogeriatric and so on, where we give specific exercises and therapy assisted by the physiotherapist. But now, because they are all completely cut off from the world, we have decided to conduct 30-minute therapy sessions via an online platform,” says Sujatha Pugazhendi, managing director of SPARRC. Guided by therapists, the elderly can follow instructions and do stretches, most of which can be done seated.

The online geriatric camp is being implemented using the app Paindoctoronline, which is senior citizen friendly, where every day, they would conduct 20 minutes of one-on-one sessions, with slots segregated according to age, mobility and health background. “All they have to do is call us on the telephone number given and we send them the link via text message and they have to click on it to get connected. For those who need assistance, we request one of their family members to assist them,” says Sujatha.

“We will take a holistic approach to health and will focus on geriatric-specific aspects with minimal exercises. I will however lay emphasis on yoga. For some people, I will be giving proprioception training to improve quality of movement,” says Dr Kannan. He says that breathing exercises are essential. “Without taxing their cardiovascular system by way of exercise, we can achieve the same by various types of breathing practices.”

“The elderly should understand how COVID-19 spreads and accordingly take necessary precautions.

443,2020/03/30,COVID-19: The Boxing Federation of India motivates boxers through video conferencing,"It includes a core group of Olympics qualifis boxers, coaches and support staffs like doctors and physios

The Boxing Federation of India (BFI) became the first national sports federation in the country to reach out to its players through video conferencing to guide and motivate them during the 21- day lockdown as India battles COVID-19.

BFI President Ajay Singh spoke at length on Sunday and checked on the health, training regimen, nutrition and mental well-being of all the boxers. “This is a challenging time for all of us and is all the more a reason for us to take care of ourselves. My message to all our boxers is to stay fit, continue with the exercises as directed by the coaches and try to maintain your weights as much as possible. We will tide over this crisis soon and get back to the ring but staying motivated in the meantime is absolutely necessary,” said Ajay Singh.

A core group comprising all Olympics qualified boxers, coaches and support staff including doctors and physios has been set up to take care of the needs of the boxers and on a daily basis these conferences will be conducted. Coaches will be conducting sessions and talk to the players every day for an hour to keep them motivated and help them to stay positive during this crisis.

President Ajay Singh, Executive Director R.K. Sacheti and other BFI officials will be monitoring these meetings and will keep a tab on the boxers’ requirements.

444,2020/03/30,Air purifying technology to disinfect State hospitals in COVID-19 fight,"Developed by Pune-based start-up incubatee of Scitech Park

The Department of Science and Technology (DST) on Monday said that an air purifying technology developed by an incubatee company of the Pune-based Science and Technology Park (STP or Scitech Park) could offer an effective solution to the country’s fight against the coronavirus COVID-19 contagion by reducing the viral load of the infected areas.

ICMR invites quotations from manufacturers for COVID-19 test kits

The DST, in a release on Monday, announced that it has released a sum of ₹1crore to manufacture and scale up the product titled ‘Scitech Airon’ and that 1,000 units of this new air purifier would soon be ready for installation in various hospitals across Maharashtra.

The technology has been developed under the ‘Nidhi Prayas’ programme initiated by the Department of Science and Technology (DST). Another city-based company, J-Clean Weather Tech, is manufacturing the product.

“The negative ion generator titled ‘Scitech Airon’ helps to control the virus, bacteria, and other fungal infections in a closed environment and could help purify the air and disinfect areas around COVID-19 positive cases and suspects. Hence it could ensure the wellbeing of the staff, doctors, and nurses who are working round the clock in quarantine facilities by enhancing their disease-resistance power and ability to fight the virus,” said the DST release.

Isolation is India’s best weapon: ICMR

According to Dr. Rajendra Jagdale, Director General of STP, a single hour of operation of the ion generator machine, which costs around ₹40,000 including GST, has the potential to reduce viral load within a room by 99.7% depending upon its size.

The air purifier is compact in form, weighing a mere 9 kg and barely 1.5 feet in height, a foot wide and ten inches deep, rendering it highly convenient for use in enclosed spaces like hospitals, clinics, flats and other spaces like railways, airports and theatres to make them “virus-free” zones, the release said.

The ionizer machine generates negatively charged ions at approximately hundred million per 8 seconds (10 ions per sec).

Why are only a fraction of cases tested?

The negative ions generated by the ionizer form clusters around microparticles such as airborne mould, corona or influenza viruses, bacteria among other pollutants and renders them inactive through a complex chemical reaction by creating highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and atmospheric detergents (hydroxyl groups are composed of one hydrogen atom bonded to one oxygen atom and denoted as -OH or HO-).

The detergent property thus generated by the ion generator aids the breakdown of the outer protein of the allergens, viruses and bacteria, thus checking airborne diseases and increasing the body’s resistance to possible infections, the release said.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/i92fep/article31211177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31th-air-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/air-purifying-technology-to-disinfect-state-hospitals-in-covid-19-fight/article31211178.ece
445,2020/03/30,COVID-19: Priorities for national biomedical research centre located in a hotspot region,"The Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology has now set up a clear clinical and discovery research roadmap on COVID-19 to support outbreak management and maximise benefit to the public

COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS CoV-2 has become devastating. With explosive spread affecting approximately over 5,50,000 people and a mortality of more than 25,000 persons the world over, it is now a global calamity. The Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) located in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, is Government of India’s autonomous institution for research and development in disease biology that in addition also does extensive public health services.

Kerala holds an entire conjoining geography with the Western Ghats forests considered as the source of emergence and persistence of several virus infections such as Kysanur Forest Disease, dengue, chikungunya and more recently Nipah in the country. The vulnerability of Kerala as an entry point of novel viruses into the country or emergence of new infections also come from the fact that it has one of the highest numbers of expatriates working in all parts of the world, especially in the Middle East; its direct global connectivity owing to the presence of four international airports; its global reputation as a preferred tourist destination; and a tropical climate with high rain, humidity and temperature with proximity to rain forests of the Western Ghats. With excellent state-of-the-art infrastructure, the RGCB has now set up a clear clinical and discovery research roadmap on COVID-19 to support outbreak management and maximise benefit to the public.

The current approach to diagnose SARS CoV-2 infection is by Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) using real-time reverse transcription Polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) screening of samples collected from patients. The RGCB is also such an approved testing facility. This test is costly, time-consuming and not adaptable to large-scale screening to avoid disease spread to other individuals. Antibody detection tests cannot be used in the early phase of the disease as these molecules are elicited at least 5-7 days after the onset of symptoms, by which time transmission to others will have already occurred. Also, there are no available alternative tests for early diagnosis or prediction of severity. The RGCB has one of the best proteomic facilities in the country that will be put to use for biomarker identification. The RGCB has designed analysis of early and late plasma samples from COVID-19 patients to identify protein markers for developing alternative tests for diagnosis and prediction of severity.

The SARS CoV-2 is an RNA virus that is capable of undergoing rapid genetic changes. In a pandemic situation, where large numbers of people are affected, chances of mutation are significantly increased. Once characterised, the RGCB will correlate observed mutations with disease severity and neutralisation antibody response. This is critical for efficient design of vaccines and predicting severity of future outbreaks in new geographical areas and their management.

Community spread

Our worst fear at present is whether a community spread has already started, thereby taking India into the third stage of the COVID-19. Naturally, checking this is a priority. Rather than directly going into the community for verification at this stage, we strategically planned two hospital-based approaches. Since patients with severe COVID-19 develop viral pneumonia, to appraise the SARS-CoV-2 transmission situation in Kerala, a Statewide pneumonia-screening programme is being done. Initially, 10 sentinel hospitals from the government and private sector will be selected in each district. All patients with pneumonia will be tested for SARS-CoV-2. Severe cases will also be tested for Influenza A, Influenza B, H1N1, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human Metapneumo virus, and Adeno virus. The second hospital-based approach would look into SARS CoV-2 antibody responses in the hospital staff, including doctors and nursing staff. They form the target group since they are the people who would have contact with undiagnosed COVID-19 patients and would be ideal sentinels for the study.

New drug candidates

Another aspect that needs immediate attention being addressed by the RGCB is development of both new drug candidates and drug repurposing of approved drugs for treatment of COVID-19 patients. It is now known that ACE2 is the SARS CoV-2 receptor and peptidase that is important to cleave S protein for priming and entry into cells. RGCB will make tagged pseudovirions and track the entry of virus particles into the cells. This will be a model to screen for viral entry inhibitors using endocytosis tools developed in the institute. Also being done at the RGCB is repositioning of existing drugs active against RNA viruses using rapid assays in cell culture and then adapting them to the clinical environment

Monoclonal antibody therapy using humanised monoclonal antibody (HmAb) therapy is becoming an accepted therapy for infectious diseases. The feasibility of using antibodies from COVID-19-recovered patients in the form of plasma therapy has already been demonstrated in the trials conducted in China. Using immune cells from recovered patients, the RGCB has started protocols for engineered therapeutic humanised monoclonal antibodies against the pandemic. Once developed and scaled up, this will be a valuable biological for treating severe COVID-19 patients.

Ayurveda studies

India has a rich tradition of Ayurveda and use of natural compounds in acute and chronic disorders. The RGCB recently discovered, characterised and transferred to the industry one such molecule from a plant source for liver cancer. Traditional knowledge and ancient Ayurveda texts describe methods thought to be useful in managing febrile conditions. Modern science assumes that these mostly work through immunomodulation and the RGCB has strong preliminary data for this. Hence, studies evaluating both standard Ayurveda formulations such as Rasayanas and Ghrutams and many natural products for their antiviral and more importantly immunomodulatory properties have started at the RGCB.

The RGCB has proven record in developing rapid antigen-based detection kits for swine fever and snake bite venom detection rapid kits. The RGCB is in the process of developing a highly cost-effective Corona-detection kit, reducing the detection time by nearly half of that of today’s kits. The highlight of this kit, on completion, will be that it can be used in limited resource laboratories that do not have real-time PCR machines, which are costly to procure and operate. A second methodology being developed by the RGCB is field-testing of samples using-RNA based detection completely bypassing the PCR machine, but with the similar sensitivity and specificity of conventional PCR. This capability has already been previously developed and demonstrated in dengue virus detection by the RGCB. In response to “Make In India” call of the Honourable Prime Minister, the RGCB and Kerala Start up Mission manage an excellent technology development incubator called BioNest that currently has 23 start-up companies. The RGCB works very closely with these companies to promote development of low cost new diagnostic kits that can be used as point-of-care tools for rapid diagnosis of Corona virus infection. This will allow widespread screening in the population not possible now with expensive time-consuming methodology.

446,2020/03/30,Opinion | Researchers in India must join the fight against COVID-19,"The failure of the Indian research community to respond to the imminent threat with sufficient alacrity is surprising.

Over the last three months, the world has changed irrevocably. The most-mentioned words around the world in recent weeks have to be coronavirus and COVID-19.

Let’s recap the history of this pandemic. The first known case of the viral infection later called COVID-19 was noticed in the Wuhan City of People’s Republic of China on December 1, 2019. It was dubbed an outbreak on December 12 by the Chinese state broadcaster, and the WHO was notified on December 30 and the viral genome sequence was decoded on January 3, 2020. The events since then are well-known – the virus has spread to 200 countries (areas, territories), resulting in over 4,65,900 confirmed cases as on date.

In India, the first case was detected in Kerala on January 30, 2020, in a student who had come back from China. By this time, it had spread to several countries outside of mainland China, and the WHO declared coronavirus as a ‘public health emergency of international concern’ on January 31.

Till February 29, 2020, three cases were reported in India, all in Kerala. They were swiftly identified and quarantined. This period was the first and perhaps the most important window of opportunity for the research experts and public health specialists to come together and contextualise the available evidence as applicable to the Indian setting in terms of testing, treatment, prophylaxis and mathematical models of transmission and help guide policy.

Given that India has a long history of dealing with infections and the existence of a disease surveillance programme for epidemic detection and response since 2004, and the wide expectation that such a pandemic was inevitable (Bill Gates spoke about exactly such a scenario in a 2015 TED talk), the failure of the Indian research community to respond to this imminent threat with sufficient alacrity is surprising. The first reports of coronavirus being noticed by the Indian research community appear in the third week of February. Still, there seems to be little urgency amongst the Indian public health community in trying to predict the impact of this pandemic.

During this time, modelling exercises were going on around the world. The impact of science on policy became apparent when the publication of the Imperial College modelling study forced the British government to abruptly change its policy position from attempting to ‘ride out the storm’ and allowing the population to develop herd immunity to taking urgent steps to suppress the pandemic. In the U.S., the calm visage of Dr Anthony Fauci has had a reassuring effect on the American public, even as the bumbling political response has led to a crisis situation.

The Indian reaction relied heavily on the reactionary approaches to scout for evidence in the middle of a pandemic. To date, only one data modelling on COVID-19 has been published from India. However, this analysis did not focus on predicting the burden or behaviour of COVID-19 but to identify the effect of intervention strategies that were unlikely to work anyway. There was enough evidence that close to 50% of infected individuals would not be detected through the airport thermal check-based screening (the prevalent screening approach in India), and that simply quarantining symptomatic individuals would miss large numbers of infected but asymptomatic individuals. Thus, this report had little likelihood of informing policy development. An editorial in British Medical Journal on the COVID-19 response in South Asia noted “for a region that has sent rockets to Mars and includes two nuclear powers, lack of a single academic centre with the epidemiological expertise to model a rapidly progressing epidemic seems remarkable.”

During this time, global public health experts, including those in the WHO, were stressing of the need to make the testing criteria liberal and adopting strict isolation policies of identified cases, but the official response from the Indian health authorities was to reassure the Indian public that all was well.

It was only after the mayhem in Europe, the drumbeat of voices from the U.K. and U.S., and the appearance of expert opinions on alternative media portals, that the response changed, and the national lockdown was implemented. The official Indian position still denies the existence of community transmission, based on data from random testing. The design and the data that supports this conclusion has been widely questioned, largely on the basis of the small number of subjects samples, which does not truly represent the large and diverse Indian population.

The importance and need of the lockdown at this time is not in doubt. At the time of writing, on the fourth day of lockdown, the number of cases in India stands at 873, with 149 new cases in a single day, a 50% jump over the rise in the previous day. Further, it is unclear whether we are substantially expanding our testing capability. Serological tests are available now, which allow results to become known in a matter minutes. The lockdown will end some day, and its benefits can only be sustained only through a policy of aggressive testing, contact tracing and isolation.

During these testing times, even as the scientific research activity has ground to a halt, coronavirus researchers must remain busy. The basic scientists around the world including in India are trying to understand the fundamental organism and disease biology, developing simple and affordable test kits and vaccines.

We need to find safe and effective intervention strategies, for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The global standard for finding such strategies is through randomised clinical trials. Based on anecdotal experience and pre-clinical data, one candidate molecule for such a trial is hydroxy-chloroquine, used currently for treatment of malaria and certain autoimmune diseases.

In violation of the principle of recommending interventions only after establishing the safety and efficacy, the national taskforce for COVID-19 issued a recommendation advocating empiric use of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis of this infection in asymptomatic individuals including healthcare workers. The purported evidence they use to support this recommendation is highly speculative, has been criticised as being bad in science, and riddled with conflicts of interest. Standing next to, and despite exhortations from U.S. President Donald Trump, Dr Fauci declined to support its use, pointing out the need for a randomised clinical trial.

The U.K. has restrained the use of this compound outside of a trial. Under pressure, the French authorities allowed the use of hydroxychloroquine and another antiviral drug to treat patients infected with the coronavirus. The recommendation is highly contextual, with the statement from France’s Director General of Health allowing “a temporary authorisation to allow certain patients with coronavirus to benefit from this therapeutic route.” It needs to be emphasised, however, that the authorisation is for treatment of infected individuals, and not prophylaxis.

This advisory has led to a run on this compound, making it disappear from market, putting patients who legitimately need for treatment for other conditions at risk. Moreover, reports of self-medication leading to complications and even deaths have been reported. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has declared hydroxychloroquine as a Schedule H drug, suggesting that it intends to double down on this poorly conceptualised recommendation.

Moreover, this recommendation puts in jeopardy any planned clinical trial of this intervention by removing equipoise (a state of genuine uncertainty regarding the comparative therapeutic merits) which is essential for such investigation. This is at a time when research groups around the world, including the WHO, have started large trials in order to find effective interventions. We have possibly lost an opportunity because the advisory will prompt healthcare providers to adopt this approach, more so to compensate for the shortage of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers, with potentially tragic consequences.

There can indeed be genuine tension between research and the urgent desire to help patients with whatever is available during public health emergencies. Some caregivers may feel that providing clinical care and conducting clinical research are incompatible. However, there is a difference between opinion-based advice by a doctor and recommendation from an authoritative body.

During the recent G20 Virtual Summit, India’s Prime Minister underscored the need to put people at the centre, freely and openly share the benefits of medical research and development, develop adaptive, responsive and humane health care systems, and promote new crisis management protocols. U.S. Democratic Presidential contender Joe Biden said in a tweet – “If I'm elected president, I will always lead the way with science. I will listen to the experts and heed their advice”.

As the country cowers in fear of COVID-19 and hopes that the lockdown will suppress the spread of the infection and prepare to provide appropriate care to those who might develop its ill-effects, the Indian research community must join the fight and shine the light on the path that leads to good health.
