0,2020/03/24,Postponing Olympics an appropriate decision: Sindhu,"Gopi Chand welcomes move, awaits new guidelines

World badminton champion P.V. Sindhu has welcomed the decision to postpone the Tokyo Olympics.

“I think it was the most appropriate decision given the prevailing critical situation.

“The organisers have shown concern for the the health of every one involved by not going ahead with the original schedule,” Sindhu told The Hindu on Tuesday.

“Athletes should be prepared for unforeseen developments. Now, with the Games officially postponed, naturally we will have to re-plan our preparations. But, first, let us all hope that the situation improves globally,” added Sindhu.

Chief badminton coach P. Gopi Chand also welcomed the decision.

“I welcome this very good decision for it would have been difficult to conduct the Games given the uncertainty shrouding the situation. Athletes would have found it extremely challenging to make it to the Games if they were to be held as per the original schedule in July.

“I don’t know what kind of impact it (the postponement) will have on badminton players, for first we have to know the BWF guidelines and the new qualification norms. Whether they will go ahead with the existing norms or not,” Gopi said.

More time, new challenges

“Yes, the move also gives the coaches and athletes time and at the same time new challenges too,” said Gopi, who is in self-isolation on return from the All England championship.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/cvogzo/article31156793.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25SINDHU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/postponing-olympics-an-appropriate-decision-sindhu/article31156794.ece

Junior rifle team coach Suma Shirur said, “We saw it (the decision) coming. The whole world has been affected and the athletes were not able to train. Considering the situation, this was the right decision. Postponing it by a year is better and gives the athletes more time to prepare.”

Apurvi Chandela, who has been training at her own shooting range at home, said she was taken aback by the decision. She, however, said this doesn’t affect her preparations. “We have to look at our preparations and stay focused.”

Abhishek Verma, who has self-quarantined at his Chandigarh home, said: “This is an important decision keeping the public interest in mind. It was necessary to ensure public safety. All the countries will be able to participate in full swing next year.”

2,2020/03/24,Coronavirus | Maxime Mbanda tackling a different opponent now,"The Italian rugby international is now an ambulance driver for Yellow Cross

Italian international Maxime Mbanda has leapt from the back row on the rugby pitch to the front line in the fight against the coronavirus, becoming a volunteer ambulance driver in Parma, and bears witness to a frightening reality on the pandemic.

Last Saturday, Mbanda was scheduled to face England in front of 60,000 people in Rome for his 21st Italian cap, but that match, like so many others, has been postponed.

Volunteers to help

Instead, wearing a mask and protective suit, he went out again as an ambulance driver with other volunteers from the Yellow Cross in Parma, in Emilia-Romagna, one of the areas most affected by the coronavirus.

By Saturday, almost 800 more people in Italy had died from the disease, taking the total in the country to 4,825.

“When everything was cancelled in rugby, I wondered how I could help, even without medical expertise,” Mbanda, who plays for Zebre Rugby, the Parma club, said.

“I found the Yellow Cross, which had a transport service for medicine and food for the elderly.”

Physical strength used

After delivering masks, food and prescriptions one day, the physical strength of the 26-year-old forward was put to good use where it was most needed, “on the front line, at the heart of the problem”.

“I found myself transferring positive patients from one local hospital to another. I help with the stretcher or if there are patients to be carried from a wheelchair. I also hold the oxygen,” he explained.

It is a situation of desperate urgency, where, he says, “95% of hospital facilities are dedicated to coronavirus patients”.

“If people see what I see in the hospitals, there wouldn’t be a queue in front of the supermarkets anymore,” he said. “They would think two, three or four times before leaving home, even to go running,” he said.

“What I see are people of all ages, on respirators, on oxygen, doctors and nurses on 20-or-22-hour shifts, not sleeping one minute of the day and just trying to get some rest the next day,” he added.

“I wish I could say that the situation here has reached its limit. But I’m afraid I have to say that's not the case.”

No medical experience

Mbanda has no medical experience, but he is working with the support of his girlfriend and his father, a surgeon in Milan, “also on the front line.”

Mbanda has had to become a psychologist in contact with patients put in wards “where death is the order of the day”.

“When you see the look in their eyes... even if they can’t speak, they communicate with the eyes and they tell you things you can’t imagine,” he said.

“They hear the alarms, the doctors and nurses running from one ward to the next. The first person I collected from the hospital told me that he had been there for three hours when the neighbour in the next bed died. And during the night, two other women died in his room. He had never seen anyone die,” Mbanda narrated.

“I started eight days ago, without a day’s break and with shifts of 12 or 13 hours. But faced with what I see in the infectious disease rooms, I tell myself that I can’t be tired,” he said.

Accustomed, as an Italian international, to tackling stronger opponents, Mbanda said he won’t give up.

“As long as I'm strong, I'll keep going. I'm here and I'm staying here. As long as there's an emergency, I'm here and I'm staying here.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/9r5jde/article31156723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25HERO,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/coronavirus-maxime-mbanda-tackling-a-different-opponent-now/article31156724.ece
3,2020/03/24,Ian Nepomniachtchi stays ahead,"Ian Nepomniachtchi scored his second win in as many days to consolidate his lead at the Candidates chess tournament.

The Russian defeated second seed Ding Liren of China in the sixth round and took his tally to 4.5 points.

He is now one point ahead of the second-placed Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of China.

Top seed Fabiano Caruana of the United States is third with 3.5 points.

Eight rounds remain in this double round-robin tourney featuring eight players. The winner will play the World No.1, Magnus Carlsen of Norway for the World title later in the year.

4,2020/03/24,"Leander Paes says postponing the Olympics is a ‘tough, but smart move’","India’s tennis ace Leander Paes has termed the decision to postpone the Tokyo Olympics a ‘smart move’.

Paes, who won a bronze at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, told The Hindu that it was the right call.

“The Olympic movement stands for good health and is about the global community coming together. At a time like this, when the corona pandemic has touched almost every corner of the world, including Tokyo, full credit to the Olympic committee for postponing the Games,” Paes said.

Paes said every aspect had to be considered before taking such a tough call.

“It’s a very tough decision to take, because millions and millions of sporting commerce goes into the Olympics. Given the effort the Olympic movement takes to run the Games, it was a hard decision,” Paes said.

5,2020/03/24,Postponement an athlete’s nightmare,"Calls for re-drawing plans and fortitude to keep going

Rescheduling of a major event is any athlete’'s nightmare, says 1996 Atlanta Olympics hockey goalkeeper Aloysius Edwards.

Months of planning and preparation go for a toss, Edwards, who represented India in 147 internationals between 1989 and 2000, including the 1994 World Cup, told The Hindu on Tuesday on receiving news of the Tokyo Olympics being postponed.

“The worst-hit will be those who are on the verge of making it to the Olympics, the dream of any athlete,” he says.

Different challenge

“The challenge is of a different nature, too, given that the athlete is at home during a lockdown. If you are forced indoors by injury, you know you can make it back by working on it, but here you are staring at grim possibilities,” he says.

“There will be some who may miss the bus for the simple reason that there will be fresh guidelines and qualifying standards, especially in individual disciplines. Young contenders who cannot be ignored will emerge.

“With each passing month, it will be difficult to sustain the motivation to keep going as the time-frame has changed,” he feels.

“Most athletes prepare with the specific objective of peaking at the right time for a major event, especially the Olympics. And, the Games not being held as scheduled will be a huge dampener,” he said.

And, Edwards should know what it means to miss an Olympics! For, after attending the one-month preparatory camp in Brisbane before the 2000 Sydney Olympics and even being presented the official No. 12 jersey (which he exchanged with Jude Felix’s No. 1 on the latter’s request), the Hyderabadi was sent home and Devesh Chauhan preferred.

Hurdles

“There are bound to be many hurdles when the original schedule is changed. A major challenge for athletes, as well as coaches, will be re-drawing the entire training programme,” he says.

“However, postponement was the only sensible option left for the Olympics organisers, given the grim scenario across the world. After all, athletes’ health and safety are of paramount importance,” he concluded.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/x31i39/article31156659.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25EDWARD1,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/postponement-an-athletes-nightmare/article31154750.ece
6,2020/03/24,"Olympics postponed; to be held latest by 2021 summer, says Japanese PM","Abe made the comment in a briefing with reporters following a call with International Olympic Committee (IOC) head Thomas Bach.

The 2020 Tokyo Olympics has been postponed to no later than the summer of 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe, the International Olympic Committee announced on Tuesday.

Also read: 2020 Olympic Games will be postponed, says IOC member Dick Pound

The Games were scheduled for July 24-August 9, but after telephone discussions between IOC president Thomas Bach and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, a historic joint decision was taken for the first postponement of an Olympics in peacetime.

Abe said Bach was in “100% agreement” when Japan asked the IOC to push back the Games and said the delayed Olympics “held in a complete form will be a testament to mankind’s defeat of the new virus.”

In a joint statement, the pair said that based on current World Health Organization information, the Tokyo Games “must be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community.”

“The leaders agreed that the Olympic Games in Tokyo could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present.

Flame to stay in Japan

“Therefore, it was agreed that the Olympic flame will stay in Japan. It was also agreed that the Games will keep the name Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020,” the statement concluded.

Bach later said he did not discuss new dates with Abe and the exact dates is a question for the Tokyo organising committee and an International Olympic Committee panel overseeing the preparations.

The torch relay, due to start on Thursday from the Fukushima, will be postponed and the flame will remain there for now.

The move would be a devastating blow for Tokyo, which had won widespread praise for its organisation, with venues finished well ahead of time and tickets massively oversubscribed.

The Olympics, which has experienced boycotts, terrorist attacks and protests, but has been held every four years since 1948, would be the highest-profile event affected by the virus that has killed thousands and closed sports competitions worldwide.

The IOC has come under increasing pressure in recent days to postpone the Games, scheduled to start on July 24, with 1.7 billion people across the planet in lockdown to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.

Preparations affected

Training has become impossible for many athletes and exposes them to the risk of contracting or spreading the disease. Competitions and qualifiers have been scrapped, while international travel is severely limited.

On Sunday, the IOC had initially given itself a deadline of four weeks to come up with a proposal to postpone the Games, a Herculean task that touches on every aspect of Tokyo 2020 planning from venues to security to ticketing.

But after Canada and Australia withdrew their teams and the powerful US Olympic Committee and World Athletics also joined the chorus calling for a postponement, the writing was on the wall for the July start.

Tokyo was spending some $12.6 billion to host the Games, according to its latest budget, and experts believe a postponement could cost it some $6 billion in the short-term before recouping it when it eventually goes ahead.

It will also be a bitter blow to sponsors and major broadcasters who rely on the four-yearly extravaganza for critical advertising revenue.

It is not the first time Tokyo has seen unscheduled changes to the Games — it was due to be the first Asian country to host the Olympics in 1940 before pulling out due to international pressure over its war with China.

But Tokyo 2020 organisers point to the unparalleled complexity — not to mention cost — of shifting the Games. It is not even clear venues will be available and tens of thousands of hotel rooms will need to be cancelled and rebooked.

Logistical issues

Squeezing in the 16-day Games into what will already be a hugely crowded 2021 calendar is another major headache, with arguably the two biggest sports, swimming and athletics, due to hold their World Championships that summer.

However, World Athletics has already said it was prepared to shift its World championships, scheduled for August 6-15 next year in Oregon, to accommodate the move.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/tusqze/article31154195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OLYMPICS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/olympics-postponed-to-be-held-latest-by-2021-summer-says-japanese-pm/article31154196.ece

9,2020/03/24,How to keep your gadgets clean while working from home,"MetroPlus speaks to experts about which chemical agents are safe for gadgets and how to avoid physical clutter in your space

With many people working from home for the first time, your home starts to feel like a bubble of safety, the walls and shut windows a barrier against who-knows-what. But there is a Trojan horse, so to speak, bringing in some worrisome unknown bodies about which we should be vigilant.

Speaking with MetroPlus, Ashok Nair, Lenovo’s director for India Service Operations, gives a step-by-step breakdown of how to keep each gadget in the home as clean as possible.

Children and safety Working from home for most families means the children will be making the most of the surrounding gadgets. Dr Anuradha Vinod, consultant paediatrician at Manipal Hospitals, Bengaluru, explains, “We usually don’t encourage screen time at all. At times like these, it could be unavoidable. But we can limit screen time to one or two hours. And, it is actually not necessary to engage them with a tablet or a phone all the time. It is actually a good time to bond with family and also enhance their creativity. It is risky for parents to give their phones to children, especially for those who have to head out every day. All kinds of viruses can spread through the phone since children hold it against their faces. We are also asking parents to make sure children are washing their hands before every meal and snack. They should take a shower first thing in the morning.”

Input from Praveen Sudevan

Before proceeding with a deep clean, it is recommended that you remove any media from the drives and turn off all connected devices and the computer. Then, disconnect all power sources such as batteries or power cords from electrical outlets and disconnect all cables that are connected to the computer, to avoid unpleasant shocks.

Before diving into the dirt, it is important that you do not engage in panic-buying, seeing these ingredients. Most of these are used in minute amounts. He states that it is safe to use a disinfecting wipe designed for office/home use and that “some disinfecting wipes designed for medical use may cause discolouration, harm surfaces, or even affect functionality of your device.”

Ashok further elaborates, “Medical wipes and their chemical composition vary greatly. Depending on the chemicals, frequency, and duration of use, medical wipes may impact cosmetic appearance and system functionality. To minimise this risk, we recommend hydrogen peroxide wipes (such as Virox Accel wipes with a maximum of 0.5% hydrogen peroxide), and alcohol-based wipes (such as PDI Germicidal or B Braun Meliseptol Wipes sensitive). Do not use wipes containing sodium hypochlorite (bleach). We also recommend wiping away residual solvent as soon as possible after the prescribed contact time and wiping the surface again with a dry, lint-free, soft cloth.”

He also repeats that one should always squeeze out excess liquid from wipe or disinfecting cloth before using. “Gently wipe the system thoroughly, being careful to ensure no liquid drips into the computer. Do not wipe on connector pins. After disinfecting, follow the cleaning procedure from the wipe supplier to minimise chemical build-up of disinfectant residue (i.e. wiping away any residual disinfectant after the prescribed contact time). Always allow the computer to completely dry prior to any use.”

Screens galore

Keyboards are a major carrier of bacteria as mentioned by numerous studies over the past 15 years, including 2018’s ‘Degree of Bacterial Contamination of Mobile Phone and Computer Keyboard Surfaces…’ by Jana Koscova et al. “Species of the genus Bacillus and representatives of the family Enterobacteriaceae (which cause systemic inflammatory and vasodilatory responses) were abundant. The potentially pathogenic species were represented by Staphylococcus aureus (often cause skin infections but can cause pneumonia, heart valve infections, and bone infections). Cultivation of swabs performed five minutes after disinfection and subsequent calculation of the reduction of contamination have shown that simple wiping with antibacterial wet wipe led to a significant reduction of microbial contamination of surfaces, with effect ranging from 36.8 to 100%,” says the study.

We recommend you to give your keyboard a clean wipe everyday before you use it and every five hours while using. Ashok says “Absorb some isopropyl alcohol on a lint-free, soft cloth, then squeeze out excess liquid from the cloth. Wipe the keyboard surface with the cloth, making sure no liquid drips on or between the keys. Allow to dry,” he explains. However, it is vital that liquid cleaner is never sprayed or poured directly on the LCD display or the keyboard. One can use compressed air from a can to remove any crumbs and dust from beneath the keys. Also, do not use an air compressor, he adds.

Most notebooks these days have a touchscreen component. Using a dry, lint-free, soft cloth, wipe or dust the stain gently, he starts. “If a stain, smudge, or other blemish remains, moisten a lint-free, soft cloth with water or a 50-50 mixture of isopropyl alcohol and water (distilled or deionised). Wring out as much of the liquid as you can from the cloth. Wipe the display again; do not let any liquid drip into the computer. Allow the display to dry, then close the lid if the computer has one.”

And the space...

Gayatri Gandhi of JoyFactory.in

It is not just the chemical grime, but also the physical clutter. Gurugram-based Gayatri Gandhi of JoyFactory.in is India’s first KonMari-certified consultant, and she points out, “Most of the gadgets that get accumulated are the old and outdated devices that continue being stored with a thought that ‘it may come handy’ later. Also, old wires, cords and chargers form a major part of these gadgets. The best approach has been to thank and get rid of them because they will never be used as much as we think they will be! The other times when people are unwilling to let go, I give them a three-month period to see if they end up using it, and if they don’t, then I strictly guide them to give it away.”

Self-discipline is key, she adds. “It is not easy to work from home because of the number of distractions one has, this often leads to clutter, whether on your desk or generally across the home. Another practical aspect that one can follow during times like these is to make sure each item in the house has a home, a resting place that becomes its own. The important aspect of organising is to return the item to its home when the task is completed.” Gayatri adds that she is engaging in virtual consultations for those working from home too.

There is a lot that goes into keeping the home clean, Coronavirus or not, and it is encouraged these habits are maintained throughout our relationship with technology. Be sure to keep hand sanitiser at the ready and do avoid touching your face and eating between using gadgets. If you have the amenities to use earbuds or earphones to take calls, opt for those to keep mobile phones away from your face. And, of course, wash your hands.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/dpvz1k/article31149770.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy25-tech,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/how-to-keep-your-gadgets-clean-while-working-from-home/article31149774.ece
10,2020/03/24,"Coronavirus | Italy’s virus toll shoots back up, but medics see hope","Italy's 743 new deaths broke two days of successive declines that had taken the number down to 601 on Monday.

Italy's daily COVID-19 death toll shot back up on Tuesday, but more evidence emerged that the coronavirus infection rate is slowing thanks to a painful national lockdown.

Also read: Coronavirus | Italy’s death toll tops 4,000 after new one-day record

Health officials across the ravaged Mediterranean country are poring over every new piece of data to see whether two weeks of bans and closures have made a dent in the crisis.

The harshest restrictions are theoretically due to expire on Wednesday evening — although the government is all but certain to extend them in some form for weeks or even months.

Italy's 743 new deaths broke two days of successive declines that had taken the number down to 601 on Monday.

It set a world record of 793 fatalities on Saturday.

But the rate of officially registered new infections was just eight percent — the same as Monday and the lowest level since Italy registered its first death on February 21.

Also read: Coronavirus | Italy reports 475 new COVID-19 deaths, highest single-day toll for any country

It had been as high as 50 percent at the start of March.

“The measures we took two weeks ago are starting to have an effect,” civil protection service chief Angelo Borrelli told the daily La Repubblica before Tuesday's toll came out.

He said more data over the next few days will help show ""if the growth curve is really flattening.""

Few scientists expect Italy's numbers — if they really are dropping — to follow a steady downward line.

The slowing contagion rate is offering a ray of hope in the midst of a global crisis that is deepening in parts of Europe and the United States.

Scientists believe that countries such as Spain and France are following in Italy's footsteps with a lag of a few weeks.

The numbers from the US are also similar to those of Italy's from about 20 days ago.

Also read: COVID-19 | A range of factors are at play behind Italy’s coronavirus disaster

Most other European nations and some US states have followed Italy's example and imposed their own containment and social distancing measures designed to stop the spread.

Eyes on Italy

The data that Borrelli has gathered from Italy's 22 regions are of crucial interest to global policy makers and medical experts.

They are however extremely reluctant to draw any definitive conclusions from the two-day drop.

Italy's daily deaths are still higher than those officially recorded in China at the peak of its crisis in Wuhan's central Hubei province.

They are also higher than those seen anywhere else in the world.

Italian officials are using the downward trend in infections to double down on their insistence that people stay home at all times, no matter the personal discomfort or economic pain.

Most big global banks think Italy has already entered a deep economic recession that could be more severe than anything seen in decades.

The Lombardy region around Milan at the epicentre of the pandemic has begun imposing 5,000 euro ($5,400) fines on those venturing outdoors without a good excuse.

Borrelli said he supported the measures because it was “credible” to assume that the infection rate is 10 times the reported number.

Italy is perplexed over how it managed to become the global epicentre of a pandemic that began on the other side of the world.

Without blaming anyone or any single factor, Borrelli said: “From the very start, people were behaving in a way that fuelled the national problem.”

But he did point to a Champions League match between Italy's Atalanta and Spain's Valencia's football clubs in Milan's San Siro stadium on February 19 as a particularly egregious mistake.

It was attended by 40,000 fans who celebrated the local team's win deep into the night.

“We can now say, with hindsight, that it was potentially a detonator,” Borrelli said of the match.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/o9bfcw/article31156874.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDITALY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-italys-virus-toll-shoots-back-up-but-medics-see-hope/article31156875.ece
11,2020/03/24,Mahinda convenes all-party meet on COVID-19 preparedness,"MPs suggest reconvening of House for better coordination

As Sri Lanka’s Parliament stands dissolved since early March, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa convened an all-party leaders’ meeting on Tuesday to discuss the government’s ongoing strategies in combating COVID-19 that has affected over 100 persons so far.

“I emphasised the need of working together to successfully battle #COVID19. All present were in agreement and pledged full support. #TogetherWeCan #COVID19SL,” Mr. Rajapaksa said in a tweet.

Meanwhile, some participants suggested that the Prime Minister and the government consider reconvening Parliament to help MPs coordinate better in districts. Tamil National Alliance spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran said in a tweet: “Reconvening #Parliamant was raised at the Party Leaders’ Mtg by @Rauff_Hakeem [Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader] and myself. It is not necessary to meet physically in one place but it is important to have an active Parliament so that feedback from the people are received and for better accountability.” While there has been no official response yet, Mr. Sumanthiran tweeted that there was a “favourable response” to his suggestion.

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved Parliament and announced general elections for April 25 that now stand indefinitely postponed.

Sri Lankan public health authorities, along with a national task force being headed by the Army commander, has implemented various measures, including an enforced curfew in the country. Over 2,000 people have been arrested since Friday for violating it.

When the curfew was temporarily lifted on Tuesday morning, long queues were seen outside supermarkets but adequate arrangements were made to manage the crowd.

The government said it is organising door-to-door delivery of essentials in capital Colombo, Gampaha and Kaluthara districts.

Meanwhile, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has asked legal experts and the Department of Prisons to explore the possibility of granting some relief to the prisoners who were charged with minor offences.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uvt7y5/article31156816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MAHINDARAJAPAKSHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mahinda-convenes-all-party-meet-on-covid-19-preparedness/article31156817.ece
12,2020/03/24,Bangladesh to release Khaleda Zia,"Former PM’s family had sought her release following the virus outbreak

Bangladesh on Tuesday initiated a process to “conditionally” release jailed former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia for six months following the COVID-19 outbreak in the country.

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party chief is serving a 17-year prison term in two graft cases since February 8, 2018.

“The decision has been taken on humanitarian ground,” Law Minister Anisul Huq said.

Also read: Battle for Dhaka

He said the decision was taken in line with Prime Minister Shekh Hasina’s directives and considering the age of the former Prime Minister.

Freedom for 6 months

“... Zia will be released for a period of six months and she must stay in her own house,” the Minister said.

He declined to elaborate immediately but officials familiar with the process said the Home Ministry would take subsequent steps for the former premier’s temporary release under a criminal procedure code (CrPC).

Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said his office would take steps for the release of Zia, who is being treated for old-age complications at the prison cell of a State-run specialised hospital, “as soon as” they receive the file from the Law Ministry.

The development came a day after Zia’s family sought her release over the COVID-19 outbreak.

“This is a decision we welcome,” BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi told reporters in brief comments at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University here.

“I thank Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,” Zia’s younger sister Selima Islam said.

Zia served thrice as the premier since 1991. Her party suffered a miserable defeat in the 2018 elections bagging only six seats in 300-seat parliament.

Her conviction on “moral turpitude” charges debarred her from contesting the polls.

She was sent to jail in February 2018 by a local court on charges of embezzling foreign donations meant for an orphanage, named after her slain husband and President Ziaur Rehman, during her premiership between 2001 and 2006.

Rehman, a military ruler-turned-politician, was the founder of the BNP.

She was convicted in another corruption case later the same year, though her party claims both cases are politically motivated.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/s9zo0y/article31156547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Zia,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bangladesh-to-release-khaleda-zia/article31156548.ece

14,2020/03/24,UAE-based Indian stranded at Dubai airport after missing flight back home,"All flights have since been suspended.

Dozing off at the airport in Dubai left an Indian national stranded at its Terminal 3 as he missed his flight back home and now he cannot even go to his UAE resident as the country refused entry to residency visa holders as a precaution to limit the spread of the coronavirus, according to a media report.

Arun Singh, a UAE resident, missed the last flight to India on Sunday.

Mr. Singh, 37, from Pune, had passed immigration and security and was due to board the 4 am Emirates flight to Ahmedabad on March 22 — when he fell asleep in the waiting area and missed the final boarding call by a few minutes, The Gulf News reported.

All flights have since been suspended. He was not allowed to re-enter in the UAE because residency visa has also been suspended, the report said.

It was an honest mistake, Mr. Singh, who works in the IT department of a bank in the UAE, said.

I just fell asleep as I was so stressed. I’m getting a divorce so I was flying back to India to file it,” he said.

“Initially I was allowed back into the arrivals immigration hall but then they said entry was only for GCC nationals. I explained to them that I had fallen asleep and that it was an accident,” he added

Mr. Singh said he has also contacted the Indian consulate in Dubai but they don’t have any information, the report claimed.

I can shower and the shops are open so I can buy food and I will need to buy some clothes because my luggage is not with me. Things are available, but they say after Wednesday everything will close in the airport, so I don’t know what will happen then, he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/656e40/article31152596.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UAE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uae-based-indian-stranded-at-dubai-airport-after-missing-flight-back-home/article31152597.ece
15,2020/03/24,Two Indians arrested for entering U.S. illegally,"As the driver continued to flee, she crashed her vehicle into several Border Patrol vehicles.

Two Indian nationals have been arrested and charged by the U.S. border authorities for entering the country illegally and apprehended them during a failed smuggling attempt in upstate New York, officials said.

The U.S. Border Patrol Agents from the Burke and Massena Border Patrol Stations arrested four individuals in connection with the failed smuggling attempt last week.

The agents attempted to stop a vehicle that was suspected of being involved with an alien smuggling event. As the vehicle appeared to be stopping, three occupants exited the vehicle and then the driver sped up in an attempt to flee.

As the driver continued to flee, she crashed her vehicle into several Border Patrol vehicles and was ultimately apprehended by agents.

Agents apprehended the three occupants, two of whom were determined to be citizens of India and the third was a citizen of Italy. All three were found to be illegally present in the United States, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement.

The three occupants in the vehicle were found to have illegally entered the United States from Canada through the St. Regis Mohawk Indian Reservation and were charged with Improper Entry by an Alien, a misdemeanor.

The driver was charged with Alien Smuggling, a felony that carries a penalty of a fine and up to 5 years in prison.

Publishers of three U.S. newspapers urged China on Tuesday to reverse a decision to force out about a dozen of their American journalists, saying in an open letter that the expulsions come at a time of “shared crisis” for the world.

China announced on March 18 it was revoking the press accreditations of all American journalists in the China bureaus of the three newspapers that were due to expire at the end of 2020, effectively expelling them.

“We strongly urge the Chinese government to reverse its decision to force the Americans working for our news organizations to leave,” the publishers of News Corp's Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and the New York Times said.

The decision “uniquely damaging and reckless” as the world is fighting a global coronavirus pandemic, they said.

“Perhaps more than any major news event in modern history, this moment underscores the urgent importance of both probing, accurate, on-the-ground reporting from the centers of the pandemic and of sharing the information.”

The expulsions were the latest escalation in a dispute with the United States over media freedom and access, which last month saw the United States require that Chinese state media register as foreign embassies.

China then expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters - two Americans and an Australian - after the paper published an opinion column calling China the “real sick man of Asia”.

The United States then cut the number of journalists allowed to work at four major Chinese state media outlets there from 160 to 100, citing a “deepening crackdown” on independent reporting in China.

South Korea on Tuesday doubled a planned economic rescue package to 100 trillion won ($80 billion) to save companies hit by the coronavirus and put a floor under crashing stocks and bond markets.

The package includes 29.1 trillion won in loans to small- and medium-sized companies, while another 20 trillion won will be used to buy corporate bonds and commercial paper of companies facing a credit crunch, President Moon Jae-in said in an emergency economic policy meeting.

The announcement follows similar moves by governments and central banks globally as the world economy buckles under the weight of national shutdowns. On Monday, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in a drastic move, pledged to back purchases of corporate bonds and buy unlimited amount of Treasury bonds for the first time to ensure credit flows to corporations and local governments.

“We will make sure that companies don't go bankrupt from the COVID-19 shocks. Normal, competitive companies will never be shut just because of a temporary liquidity shortage,” Moon said in a meeting with finance chiefs and Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol.

South Korean companies are racing to secure lifelines as encouraging self-isolation hits restaurants, airlines, hotels and the entertainment industry in Asia's fourth largest economy.

Investors are dumping their holdings of commodities, stocks and riskier bonds, leading to funding constraints for companies.

South Korea reported 76 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, maintaining a downward trend in new infections, which raised hopes that Asia's largest outbreak outside China may be slowing.

The daily tally brought the country's total infections to 9,037, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The death toll rose by two to 120.

It marked the 13th straight day the country has posted new infections of around 100 or less.

21,2020/03/24,"Sen. Rand Paul tests positive for virus, forcing quarantines","“The coronavirus has hit the Senate today,” said McConnell, R-Ky. “It’s not just back in our states but right here in the Senate.”

Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, becoming the first case of COVID-19 in the Senate and raising fears about the further transmission of the virus among Republicans at the Capitol.

Sen. Paul, an eye surgeon, went into quarantine Sunday after learning his results. He said he has not had symptoms and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He said he was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.

“The coronavirus has hit the Senate today,” said McConnell, R-Ky. “It’s not just back in our states but right here in the Senate.”

Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona elected in 2018, chastised Paul on Twitter, saying his decision to return to the Capitol after he was tested - but before he learned the results - was “absolutely irresponsible.”

Sen. Sinema said she has “never commented about a fellow Senator’s choices/actions. Never once.”

But she added- “This, America, is absolutely irresponsible. You cannot be near other people while waiting for coronavirus test results. It endangers others & likely increases the spread of the virus.”

Other senators, including Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, had gone into self-quarantine while they awaited the results of a coronavirus test. Both were negative.

Responding to criticism on Twitter, Paul’s office said, “We want to be clear, Senator Paul left the Senate IMMEDIATELY upon learning of his diagnosis. He had zero contact with anyone & went into quarantine. Insinuations ... that he went to the gym after learning of his results are just completely false & irresponsible!”

Paul’s office did not say when he was tested. Representatives of his office could not immediately be reached for comment.

President Donald Trump called Paul “a great friend” and said he’s “always there when we needed him.”

Paul’s diagnosis came after two House members, Reps. Mario Diaz Balart, R-Fla., and Ben McAdams, D-Utah, tested positive for the virus. Mr. Trump said the positive test results showed the virus was “hitting quite close to home. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on.”

Sen. Paul and other lawmakers “are going to be fine,” Mr. Trump said. “I hope they’ll be fine.”

Paul, a deficit hawk, was among eight Senate Republicans who voted against a House-passed bill last week that provided more than $100 billion to boost testing for the coronavirus and guarantee paid sick leave for millions of workers. He also was the only Republican senator who opposed an earlier bill authorizing $8.3 billion for the initial response to the coronavirus.

The senator was on Capitol Hill this past week, including at a luncheon Friday among GOP senators. He spoke on the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon, addressing the cornonavirus and a failed amendment he sponsored that would have paid for virus relief efforts by withdrawing U.S. forces from Afghanistan.

A spokesman for Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., said Moran briefly saw Paul at the Senate gym Sunday morning and that he shared that information with GOP colleagues at a policy meeting. Moran “followed CDC guidelines and kept a safe distance between him and Sen. Paul,” spokesman Tom Brandt said. Moran has spoken with the attending physician at the Capitol and has been told he does not need to self-quarantine, Brandt said.

South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the second-ranking Republican senator, said on the Senate floor that lawmakers will consult with the attending physician about all senators who have been in contact with Paul.

Romney said he was praying for Paul and noted that Paul’s health is compromised. Paul, 57, broke several ribs in 2017 when a neighbor assaulted him over a long-standing landscaping dispute. Paul, who was later awarded $580,000 in damages and medical expenses, had surgery last year to remove part of a lung damaged by the assault.

The Senate was in session Sunday seeking a bipartisan response to the pandemic. If approved, the bill would be the third measure Congress has approved in response to the coronavirus this month.

The White House has increasingly emphasized that testing should prioritize the elderly and health care workers who have symptoms of the virus. While most cases of COVID-19 are mild and tens of thousands of people have recovered, older people and those with underlying health problems are at higher risk for more serious problems, such as pneumonia.

""We don’t want everyone to go out and get a test because there’s no reason for it,” Trump told reporters Friday.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tells people to seek testing if they have certain symptoms of the flu-like illness caused by the coronavirus - fever, cough and trouble breathing - and if they have traveled recently to an outbreak area or have been in close contact with someone who is infected. They should first be tested for the flu and other routine infections.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qaoyk2/article30995407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSUSA-CONGRESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sen-rand-paul-tests-positive-for-virus-forcing-quarantines/article31148975.ece

Of these, over 10,000 were added in one day, according to Worldometer, a website which compiles COVID-19 cases. With 139 deaths, the number of fatalities crossed 550 by Monday night.

U.S. President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to prevent hoarding of vital medical supplies and personal protective equipment as the country for the first time registered over 130 deaths in a day due to coronavirus.

Till Monday, more than 43,700 confirmed cases of coronavirus were reported in the United States. Of these, over 10,000 were added in one day, according to Worldometer, a website which compiles COVID-19 cases. With 139 deaths, the number of fatalities crossed 550 by Monday night.

Signing the executive order, Mr. Trump said his government would take action against hoarding and excessive pricing of vital medical and personal protective equipment as well as supplies such as hand sanitisers and face masks.

“Very simply, we will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of American citizens for their own profit,” he asserted, adding the Department of Justice will aggressively prosecute fraudulent schemes related to the pandemic.

New York State, in particular New York City, emerged as the hotspot of one of the worst public health crisis in the United States in recent memory. Nearly one in every two Americans infected by novel coronavirus are from New York City which reported 5,085 news cases on Monday taking the total to 20,875.

As many as 157 residents of New York, a city which has one of the highest concentration of people in the country, have died of coronavirus so far. Of the total deaths in the city so far, 43 were reported on Monday.

Health officials warned that COVID-19-related casualty figures in New York are expected to jump significantly in the coming days.

White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Deborah L Birx told reporters that New York City, the New York Metro area of New Jersey and parts of Long Island have an attack rate close to one in 1,000. This is five times of what the other areas are seeing.

“Through high throughput lab investigations we are finding that 28 per cent of the submitted specimens are from that area, whereas it is less than 8 per cent in the rest of the country,” she said.

“So to all of my friends and colleagues in New York, this is the group that needs to absolutely social distance and self-isolate at this time. Clearly, the virus has been circulating there for a number of weeks to have this level of penetrance into the general community,” Birx said.

President Trump told reporters at a White House news conference that New York along with other hotspots such as Washington State and California is the top priority for his administration.

“Essential medical supplies and emergency equipment are being rushed to New York.” he said, adding the Federal Emergency Management Agency is distributing eight million N-95 respirator masks and 13.3 million surgical masks across the country right now.

“Focusing on the areas with the greatest need, we have shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York City and 36 pallets to the State of Washington. In the past 96 hours, FEMA has also received donations of approximately 6.5 million masks. We are focused on some of the hotspots,” Trump said.

He also announced that clinical trials for existing drugs that may prove effective against the virus will begin in New York.

“The federal government is working to help obtain large quantities of chloroquine. It will be a big game-changer. So, we will see distribution starting tomorrow (Tuesday) early morning in New York. I think a lot of people are going to be hopefully very happy with the results. We all will be watching it closely,” Mr. Trump told reporters.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1eeksd/article31070849.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DONALDTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-139-covid-19-deaths-in-1-day-trump-signs-executive-order-to-prevent-medical-supplies-hoarding/article31148806.ece
23,2020/03/24,"USOPC hears athletes, sees Olympics delay as ‘clear’ path","The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee sent a survey over the weekend to more than 4,000 athletes for details on how the coronavirus pandemic has influenced their training and their feelings about the upcoming games; they received responses from 1,780.

Leaders of the U.S. Olympic team said “it’s more clear than ever that the path toward postponement” of the Tokyo Games “is most promising” - a conclusion drawn from a survey in which nearly seven in 10 American Olympic hopefuls say they don’t think the games will be fair if held in July.

The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee sent a survey over the weekend to more than 4,000 athletes for details on how the coronavirus pandemic has influenced their training and their feelings about the upcoming games; they received responses from 1,780.

Sixty-nine % said they would feel comfortable competing in July if the World Health Organization - one of the groups consulting with the IOC - deemed it safe. But virtually that same number - 68% - said they didn’t think the Olympics would be fair under those circumstances.

The best explanation for that has been the massive disruption in training schedules, as athletes prepare for qualifying events this spring and summer. Other concerns were over unfair qualifying standards and the undermining of worldwide drug-testing protocols.

With city and state governments closing gyms and asking people to stay in their homes, fewer than one in 10 of the athletes said they can continue to train without any impact. And 65% said that continuing to train and prepare will put their health at risk.

The USOPC has come under criticism for not advocating for a postponement, which is the position taken by its own sports organizations in swimming, track and gymnastics, along with national committees in Canada, Australia, Brazil and Germany.

Part of the hesitance, CEO Sarah Hirshland told on Sunday, was to get a clearer picture from athletes about their training conditions and their feelings. Armed with the data, Hirshland and board chair Susanne Lyons put out their strongest statement to date.

""It’s more clear than ever that the path toward postponement is the most promising, and we encourage the IOC to take all needed steps to ensure the Games can be conducted under safe and fair conditions for all competitors,” they said in a statement.

The calls for postponement are growing seemingly by the hour, and the chances of it happening felt virtually certain by Monday evening.

An IOC member, Craig Reedie, told AP that conditions in Japan and worldwide “clearly indicates the likelihood of postponement.” The decision will be made within four weeks, with IOC President Thomas Bach guiding the outcome.

Mr. Bach has taken the idea of a full cancellation off the board, and the American athletes agreed with that view- 93% said they preferred the option of postponing over canceling.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k2eoel/article30939665.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OLYMPICS-IOC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/usopc-hears-athletes-sees-olympics-delay-as-clear-path/article31148739.ece
24,2020/03/24,Britain imposes lockdown to combat spread of coronavirus,"“From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction - you must stay at home,” Johnson said in a televised address

Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered Britons on March 23 to stay at home to halt the spread of coronavirus, imposing curbs on everyday life without precedent in peacetime.

All but essential shops must close immediately and people should no longer meet family or friends or risk being fined, Johnson said in a televised address to the nation.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Johnson had resisted pressure to impose a full lockdown even as other European countries had done so, but was forced to change tack as projections showed the health system could become overwhelmed.

Deaths from the virus in Britain jumped 54 to 335 on Monday as the government said the military would help ship millions of items of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks to healthcare workers who have complained of shortages.

“From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction — you must stay at home,” Johnson said in a televised address, replacing his daily news conference.

They would only be allowed to leave their homes to shop for basic necessities, exercise, for a medical need, to provide care or travelling to and from work where absolutely necessary.

“That's all — these are the only reasons you should leave your home,” he said, adding that people should not meet friends or family members who do not live in their home. If you dont follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them, including through fines and dispersing gatherings,” he warned.

The new measures would be reviewed in three weeks, and relaxed if possible.

“These rules are not optional,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan said.

The opposition Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he supported the measures, and police chiefs said the moves were sensible, and that they would be working with the government on how to enforce them.

The government will close all shops selling non-essential goods, Johnson said, including clothing stores, as well as other premises including libraries, playgrounds and outdoor gyms, and places of worship.

The British Retail Consortium said shop owners understood the gravity of the situation.

The tougher tone followed evidence at the weekend that many were ignoring official guidelines about social distancing as they flocked to parks and beauty spots.

Under the new measures, the government will stop all gatherings of more than two people in public who do not live together, and stop all social events, including weddings and baptisms but not funerals.

Parks would remain open for exercise but gatherings would be dispersed, Johnson said.

Later on Monday, Britain's lower house of parliament is expected to approve emergency legislation giving authorities sweeping powers to tackle the outbreak, including the right to detain people and put them in isolation to protect public health.

“Without a huge national effort to halt the growth of this virus, there will come a moment when no health service in the world could possibly cope; because there wont be enough ventilators, enough intensive care beds, enough doctors and nurses,” Johnson said in his address.

Earlier, in a letter pleading with him to increase PPE supplies, more than 6,000 frontline doctors warned they felt like “cannon fodder” and were being asked to put their lives at risk with out-of-date masks, and low stocks of equipment.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there had been issues but promised action was being taken. He said the army would drive trucks throughout the day and night to get supplies to medical staff.

“It's like a war effort — it is a war against this virus and so the army have been incredibly helpful in getting those logistics so we can get the supplies to protect people on the front line,” he told the BBC, saying the health service now had 12,000 ventilators, 7,000 more than at the start of the crisis.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2yysky/article31148705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSBRITAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/britain-imposes-lockdown-to-combat-spread-of-coronavirus/article31148706.ece
25,2020/03/24,"Coronavirus | Zimbabwe reports first death, shuts borders","The deceased person had travelled to New York late last month and returned home on March 9.

Zimbabwe’s second coronavirus patient, a 30-year-old man, has died in the capital Harare, the government said Monday, as borders were closed to curb the spread of infection.

Health Minister Obadiah Moyo “has confirmed the death of Zororo Makamba, who was the second person to test positive for COVID-19 in Zimbabwe,” his office said.

Makamba, a broadcaster and son of a business tycoon and politician, was confirmed positive with the virus on Saturday.

He had travelled to New York late last month and returned home on March 9, transiting through Johannesburg in neighbouring South Africa.

The government said he began showing mild flu-like symptoms on March 12 that progressively worsened. He consulted a doctor and was instructed to self-quarantine.

On Friday the country reported its first COVID-19 case, a 38-year-old man who returned from Britain to his home in the tourist resort town of Victoria Falls.

President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced the closure of borders to human traffic on Monday as part of a new raft of measures to step up the country's response to a pandemic that has hit more than 190 countries worldwide.

“We have decided to ban all non-essential traffic and travel, both inbound and outbound, except for the movement of cargo,” Mr. Mnangagwa said in a televised address to the nation.

He added that public gatherings of more than 50 people would be prohibited and encouraged residents to avoid in-country travel.

“Government has put a blanket ban on gatherings around nightclubs, bars, beer halls, swimming pools, gymnasiums and sporting activities until further notice,” Mr. Mnangagwa said.

Zimbabwe’s government previously ordered schools closed and cancelled public and sporting events.

It has also prohibited government officials from travelling outside the country, although Mnangagwa flew to Windhoek at the weekend to attend the inauguration of his Namibian counterpart Hage Geingob.

Zimbabwe's public health system has been suffering for years from a lack of equipment and drugs and there are fears it will struggle to cope with the outbreak.

“The system... is overstretched and inadequate to deal with a coronavirus epidemic,” Norman Matara, secretary general of the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights, said at the weekend.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v1b2qc/article31146789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ZIMBABWE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-zimbabwe-reports-first-death-shuts-borders/article31146790.ece
26,2020/03/24,Coronavirus | Italy bans domestic travel,"Numbers will continue to grow, warns Prime Minister Conte

Italy banned domestic travel and shut down a range of industries on Monday in a last-ditch push against the spread of a virus that has killed nearly 5,500 people in a month.

The wave of restrictions is designed to ensure Italy gets through a 10-day stretch in which the rate of deaths and infections is supposed to finally drop. “Everyone’s effort is needed,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told reporters. “The country’s social and economic strength is at stake.”

Italian health officials reported that the rate of increase in both deaths and declared infections slowed on Sunday — albeit from a high base. There were 651 fatalities on Sunday compared with Saturday’s record 793 deaths while the number of new reported infections fell to 5,560 from 6,557. But Mr. Conte told Italians it was too early to let down their guard.

“We have not reached the most acute phase of the infection and the numbers will continue to grow,” he said. “Much depends on the responsible behaviour of each one of us.”

Mr. Conte’s latest order comes after he caused confusion on Saturday by ordering all “non-essential” factories and trades to shut until April 3. The government released a long list of industries and professions that would still be allowed — including translation services and computer repair shops.

The initial restrictions placed on Lombardy — the northern region at the centre of the Italian epidemic that includes the financial capital Milan — expired on Sunday and the national measures are set to end on Wednesday.

“If everyone — and I stress everyone — respects our bans, we will emerge from this very difficult test first,” said Mr. Conte said Monday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-italy-bans-domestic-travel/article31146242.ece
27,2020/03/24,Coronavirus | China sees drop in imported cases,"Many of them are students returning from other nations

Mainland China on Monday reported a drop in its daily tally of new COVID-19 cases, reversing four straight days of increases, as the capital, Beijing, ramped up measures to contain the number of infections arriving from abroad.

China had 39 new confirmed cases on Sunday, the National Health Commission said, down from 46 a day earlier. All the new ones involved travellers arriving from abroad, many of them Chinese students returning home.

Beijing stepped up measures to contain imported infections, diverting all arriving international flights from Monday to other cities, including Shanghai and as far west as Xian, where passengers will undergo virus screening.

Beijing reported 10 new imported cases, the National Health Commission said, down from 13 a day earlier. City authorities said cases came from Spain, Britain, France, the U.S. and Pakistan. Infections from abroad in Beijing hit an all-time daily high of 21 on March 18.

Shanghai and Guangzhou have also said all arriving international passengers will be tested to screen for the virus, expanding a programme that previously only applied to those coming from heavily affected countries.

32,2020/03/24,50 nations impose lockdown measures,"Around 1.7 billion people across the world have been asked to stay home as COVID-19 crisis intensifies

Some 1.7 billion people have been asked to stay home in over 50 countries and territories around the world as governments battle the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the globe, according to an AFP tally Monday.

Some countries have imposed mandatory lockdown measures, while others have issued stay-at-home recommendations to stem the spread of the virus.

Lockdowns in parts of India alone have kept some 700 million people hemmed in. At least 34 more countries and territories have also established mandatory lockdown measures ordering people to stay in their homes, accounting for some 659 million people. France, Italy, Argentina, the U.S. State of California, Iraq and Rwanda have also rolled out enforced lockdowns.

Also read: All about COVID-19

Greece is the most recent country to impose mandatory confinement measures, which came into effect on Monday morning. Colombia will enforce an obligatory lockdown on Tuesday and New Zealand will follow suit on Wednesday.

In most cases, it is still possible for people to leave the house to go to work, buy essentials or seek medical care.

At least four countries with a collective population of more than 228 million people, including Iran, Germany and Britain, have urged their populations to stay indoors and limit contact with other people as much as possible.

Limited impact

But the impact of these non-mandatory recommendations has been limited.

In Britain, the government warned of tougher measures after crowds gathered in parks and beaches over the weekend, while millions of people in Iran travelled for the Persian New Year last week.

Curfews in 10 countries

At least 10 countries and territories with a total population of 117 million people have issued curfews and barred overnight travel.

33,2020/03/24,‘99 Songs’ music review: Why this AR Rahman soundtrack is what we need in these troubled times,"The 14-track album puts the spotlight on two vocal talents, Shashwat Singh and Bela Shende

There are many reasons why AR Rahman’s latest soundtrack 99 Songs is special, and one of them is the timing of its release.

With zero fuss and fanfare, the Oscar winner has unleashed on us a musical tornado, that will surely give us hope, even as we are social distancing and keeping ourselves abreast with Coronavirus updates.

The other speciality of this 14-track album is that it puts the spotlight on two supremely-gifted vocal talents in Shashwat Singh and Bela Shende.

Shashwat kickstarts musical proceedings in the hummable ‘Teri Nazar’ that begins with a whiff of Charukesi raga, which takes you back to the magical Rahman that gave us ‘Udhaya Udhaya’ (Udhaya) and ‘Aahista Aahista’ (Swades). There’s longing and pining in the vocals and with the flute as accompaniment, it hits all the right notes.

‘Jwalamukhi’ has been doing the rounds for some time now, and for the right reasons. There are two versions — one with Arijit Singh, who delivers predictably, but the Poorvi Koutish contribution stands out for its vocal texture.

If ‘O Aashiqa’ has a tightly-knit chorus that metamorphoses into a neat melodical line, ‘Sofia’ has an old-fashioned charm before it becomes a beast of its own, with the word ‘Sofia’ repeatedly hitting home musically.

With ‘Nayi Nayi’, Rahman taps into the world that he created so exquisitely with 2011’s hit flick Rockstar. Shashwat Singh’s vocals stand out in this heavy-on-guitars piece that could have well made it into a modern-day Aamir Khan or Shah Rukh Khan film and become a blockbuster song.

Singer Armaan Malik gets a tough challenge in ‘Humnawaa’, an intricately-designed track that needs more than a few listens to get into your head. So does ‘Soja Soja’ (Shashaa Tirupati). The problem with many AR Rahman soundtracks, something well-known with listeners of film music, exists in 99 Songs as well — it requires more than a few listens to get into its soul. But once you devote that time, which you have aplenty now thanks to ‘social distancing’, you’ll be sold.

Bela Shende (the other vocal pick of the album) goes all devotional in ‘Sai Shirdi Sai’, an ‘Oh Paalanhaare’ kind of song that somehow doesn’t fit into the scheme of things here. She more than makes up for it with ‘O Mera Chand’, another throwback melody that’s right up there to match with the in-form Rahman albums of Meenaxi and Taal. ‘Gori Godh Bhari’ brings back vintage Alka Yagnik, but this classically-inclined number, with traces of raga Bageshri, would probably not appeal to the popular musical palate.

Among the stand-out pieces in 99 Songs is ‘The Oracle’ — an instrumental piano piece that builds some nice momentum before reaching a grand crescendo. In these times of crisis, all one requires is to plug your earphones and listen to ‘The Oracle’. The magic in its notes gives us hope.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dpums/article31154657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/99-songsjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/ar-rahmans-99-songs-soundtrack-hope-in-these-troubled-times/article31153488.ece

At a time when people can’t go out and have to maintain social distancing, storytelling offers a way to not only keep oneself engaged but also entertained. On March 22, during the Janata Curfew, Coimbatore’s Story Theatre organised a day-long Facebook Live storytelling from 10.00 am to 9.30 pm. “The idea was to give the people something positive at a time when they were bound to the house,” says Manoj Kathir. “The storytellers also responded to queries from viewers on chat.”

If Vishnu Babu spoke about how a banker became an emcee and anchor for events, RJ Srinivas spoke about how claps spread good vibes and he gave the example of two children who were much encouraged when their work was appreciated.

36,2020/03/24,Ugadi in the time of Coronavirus,"The New Year for Telugus and Kannadigas offers an opportunity to celebrate the human spirit and usher in new beginnings

In times like these, festivals do cheer us up, celebrations within the family notwithstanding. Ugadi is celebrated across different communities to mark the new year and brings family members together over a traditional meal. Having the traditional Ugadi Pachchadi first thing in the morning and listening to Panchanga Sravanam is a customary part of the celebrations for Telugus and Kannadigas. With most cities under lockdown due to COVID-19, the celebrations this year will not be the same though.

Jhillam Chattaraj looks forward to Ugadi for two reasons. Being a Bengali and married to K Uttam, a Telugu, Ugadi heralds festivities with Bengali new year to be celebrated next month. For the couple, the festival holds a cultural significance and gives a space of intimacy to them living and working in two different cities. On Ugadi, the duo also visit Uttam’s grandfather in CR Foundation Home For the Aged in Kondapur. Over a traditional meal, the couple spend the day chatting sharing and recollecting memories. However, this year Jhillam, a poet and assistant professor in English at RBVRR Women’s college will spend the day alone at home reading poetry. “Due to the lockdown, my husband cannot come from Sangareddy; I will read and upload my poems on Instagram,” she says, adding technology is liberating in these times.

“Without technology we would have been so isolated. Friends and students will share pictures of the feast. The communication is on; Even if physically we are away, emotionally we are connected. In fact, it has now brought people emotionally closer.” She calls festivals a reminder of hope and something good to look forward to. “In times like these when the world is in crisis, festivals cheer us up. We are emotionally needy people and festivals energise us. Rituals make us forget the mundanity of life. This time all our prayers for everyone’s safety”

Across oceans

For Pavan Kumar and his wife Ashwani living in Singapore, Ugadi brings special memories. The couple celebrating their first anniversary on the eve of Ugadi had initially planned to come to their parents’ house in Hyderabad. “Group video calls with family and friends living in Hyderabad is the best thing happening now. We are more connected than ever,” says Pavan.

It has been a ritual and professor Sagi Kamalakar Sarma has been following for 10 years now. Every Ugadi, he is at at Shilparamam reading Panchanga Sravanam and interpreting the almanac readings to the audience. “Panchanga Sravanam is an intrinsic part of Ugadi festivities but this year, I am not taking any risk and going anywhere. I will do a pooja at home,” he adds.

With all the shoots cancelled, television star Suma is at home. “We will not celebrate Ugadi this year because we lost my father-in-law Devadas Kanakala. Also because of the conditions prevailing in the world, we need to be mentally strong and hope and pray that we come out of Coronavirus lockdown and everybody is responsible and stays safe at home and healthy. Let us hope we are successful in breaking the Corona chain and are able protect us and our families.”

On small screen, she brings a special Ugadi episode on her new show House of Hungama (Wednesday; 9.30 pm) on Star Maa and has also participated a special Ugadi event for the channel. “Thank god these shows were shot earlier and we have banked a few of them. With all the free time, I plan to make videos for my YouTube channel Sumakka on my own without taking assistance.”

The Centre will soon announce an economic package to deal with coronavirus (COVID-19) situation, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman assured on Tuesday, adding that the government and regulators were constantly monitoring the state of the economy, markets and the rupee’s movement.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India | About 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide due to coronavirus: UN

The minister, however, offered little clarity on the composition of an economic task force announced by the Prime Minister last week, and explained that the delay in announcing an economic package was on account of the need for extensive consultations, which had been delayed as Parliament had been in session till Monday and the Finance Bill had had to be cleared.

Also Read | No economic task force for COVID-19 yet | Also Read A pandemic, an economic blow and the big fix

“Work is going on and we are very close to coming out with an economic package, which will be announced sooner rather than later,” Ms. Sitharaman said, adding that the Centre, the Reserve Bank of India and the regulators had been jointly monitoring the volatility in the stock markets thrice daily. “Every attention is being given to the economy. The Prime Minister himself is closely monitoring the situation. A multi-layered composition of the task force is already working.”

As The Hindu had reported on Tuesday morning, the economic task force announced in the PM’s address to the nation on March 19 has still not been constituted, with the Finance Ministry saying that the PM’s Office or the Cabinet Secretariat would be responsible for issuing an order to create it. On Tuesday evening, after the FM’s press conference, a Finance Ministry spokesperson once again confirmed that no order had as yet been issued to set up the task force.

Ms. Sitharaman was more ambiguous about the status of the task force, saying that sub-groups of MPs, academics and industry leaders were already generating ideas for the task force, but refusing to elaborate on its composition or specific mandate.

“The Finance Ministry is working intensively on all these suggestions which are coming in from the various sub groups within the multi-layered task force that exists,” she said. “So the work of the task force which is multi-layered is already almost intensively nearing a conclusion. So the task force and the task force based report and the action following the task force’s report are almost at its peak and that is why I have said we will announce the economic package sooner rather than later.”

Ms. Sitharaman also declined comment on specific queries about how the economic package would provide relief for millions of informal sector and daily wage workers who have been hit the hardest by the shutdown.

“I appreciate that you would have liked the package to be announced last week,” the minister told journalists at the press conference. “But most things which are as big as an economic package for this kind of unusual situation requires a lot of consultation to get it right,” she added.

“We had no intention to delay, we don’t want to delay, but then but let us be realistic. Till yesterday, the Parliament was in session and the Finance Bill had to be cleared,” she said, adding that she would have been happy to announce the package in the House if it was ready and the Finance Bill had been passed. “And once the Finance Bill got cleared, it was important for the MPs to recognise there is a lockdown in this country, so everyone had to go where they had to go and serve and be of use for their own constituents. So the Parliament adjourned sine die.”

40,2020/03/24,FMCG companies see a spurt in ‘COVID-19 sales’,"Consumers on panic buying spree stock up essentials; firms step up production of soaps, liquid handwashes, cut prices

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a spike in the demand of consumer staples like milk, milk products and biscuits along with hand sanitisers as people are stocking up essentials amid a complete lockdown like scenario.

Companies like Amul, Parle and Godrej Consumer Products have seen a 10-15% jump in demand across product categories and ramped up production to meet the growing demand.

This assumes significance as more States initiate a complete lockdown amid a growing number of confirmed cases of the virus, which would only push up the demand for such staples.

“We have seen an increase of 15-20% in our average daily sales across most product categories as consumers are stocking products like milk, butter, ghee, cheese and paneer,” said R.S. Sodhi, managing director, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which owns Amul.

Some States like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab and Delhi have imposed stern restrictions on people movement, along with a lockdown, which has made consumers wary of essential products going out of stock, thereby leading to panic buying.

The popular Parle G biscuit has also seen a notable increase in demand on the back of panic buying.

“There is a bit of panic buying and we have seen around 10-15% increase in our average weekly sales of Parle G,” said Parle Products category head Mayank Shah.

Apart from food essentials, products like hand washes have also seen an increase in sales as authorities have been highlighting the importance of sanitising hands at regular intervals.

“In some categories, such as hand washes and sanitisers, we have seen temporary spike in demand, driven by the impact of COVID 19,” said Vivek Gambhir, MD and CEO, Godrej Consumer Products.

“We have also heard of some instances of consumers trying to hoard essentials. Retailers have begun to put restrictions on quantities being purchased. We believe that there should be no reason to panic as there should be sufficient supplies available,” Mr. Gambhir added.

Production ramped up

To meet the increased demand, companies have also ramped up their production as the virus threat is not showing any signs of abating as of now. “We have recently ramped up production of soaps by 30% and have increased production of liquid hand washes by 3.5X at our units as well as through our vendor partner units,” Mr. Gambhir said.

In a similar context, Mr. Shah said that the company had increased production by 15% while closely working with governments to ensure there is minimal logistical issue and all its trade partners have sufficient stock.

Incidentally, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), which is the country’s largest pure play fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) company, has also reduced the prices of Lifebuoy sanitisers, Lifebuoy Liquid handwash and Domex floor cleaners by 15% and said that the products with the reduced prices would be available in the market in the next few weeks. The company has also ramped up the production of Lifebuoy sanitisers, Lifebuoy Handwash liquid and Domex Floor Cleaners and will be scaling it up even further in the coming weeks, it had said in a statement issued last week.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fmcg-companies-see-a-spurt-in-covid-19-sales/article31156697.ece

42,2020/03/24,Markets look up a day after worst fall,"India VIX index jumps another 14%

Equity benchmarks opened on a strong note on Tuesday, a day after registering their worst single-day fall, but failed to maintain the levels as the underlying weakness in investor sentiment led to some amount of selling pressure. The benchmarks fell into the red briefly before ending the day on a strong note, which was in line with the positive global cues on the back of measures announced by the U.S. Federal Reserve to boost U.S. economy.

The 30-share Sensex gained 692.79 points, or 2.67%, to close at 26,674.03. Earlier in the day, it had gained nearly 1,500 points to touch an intra-day high of 27,463. The broader Nifty settled the day at 7,801.05, up 190.80 points or 2.51%.

The India VIX index, however, jumped another 14% on Tuesday. Elsewhere in Asia, Nikkei gained over 7% while Hang Seng was up nearly 4.5%. The overnight U.S. markets also registered strong gains of over 7%.

“Post hitting lower circuit for second time in a month, Indian equity markets bounced back today amidst recovery in global equity markets,” said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

Incidentally, stocks pared some of the gains after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a slew of relaxations in compliance and reporting requirements even as no economic stimulus was included in the announcements.

On BSE, nearly 1,400 stocks were in the red as against 890 gainers.

45,2020/03/24,"RAI complains to CMs against local police beating up retail staff during curfew, bats for home delivery of grocery to prevent coronavirus transmission","Shutting down grocery stores selling essential daily items will cause inconvenience to citizens and may set off panic buying: Retailers Association of India

Retailers Association of India (RAI) has flagged concerns to different Chief Ministers about police in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, UP and Gujarat beating up employees and delivery staff of retailers while they were doing their duty.

“RAI praises the State governments for allowing essential daily goods and pharmacy retailers to remain open so citizens are not deprived of daily need items. All retailers are committed to selling and delivering essentials in a safe manner,” RAI said in a statement.

“However, in some unfortunate incidents in the States of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Gujarat the local police are going beyond word of law, beating employees and delivery staff of such retailers, and taking them to chowkis for doing their duty. These employees are risking their lives for serving citizens,” it added.

“RAI has put forward a request to the Chief Ministers and the DGPs of these States to intervene in this situation so that essential goods are accessible,” it further said.

RAI has requested all the State governments in the country to allow all food and grocery stores within malls or outside, air-conditioned or not air-conditioned, small or large stores and online or offline to stay open during the lockdown period.

“Most of the State governments have agreed with RAI’s view that shutting of stores selling essential daily need items will cause gross inconvenience to citizens and may set off panic buying of daily need items in the State, thereby creating a shortage for the needy,” it said.

RAI has also requested the home deliveries be allowed to prevent people from stepping out of their homes thereby preventing the infection from spreading.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/qh5ye9/article31151045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GROCERYCORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rai-complains-to-cms-against-local-police-beating-up-retail-staff-during-curfew-bats-for-home-delivery-of-grocery-to-prevent-coronavirus-transmission/article31151046.ece

Meanwhile, complaints of shortage of Personal Protection Equipment for doctors and health workers poured in from across the country, indicating critical gaps in efforts to contain the pandemic.

In a Twitter post that soon went viral, Kamna Kakkar, a government doctor in Haryana’s Rohtak, addressing the Prime Minister’s Office, said: “Please don’t send me to war without weapons @PMOIndia. Please arrange #PersonalProtective Equipment for us doctors ASAP. We need #N95masks #HazmatSuits to defeat #Corona. Sincerely yours, an Indian Doctor”. Following the tweet, the Congress attacked the government over the inadequate supply of equipment.

Enforcing stringent curbs, cases were booked against several people for violating prohibitory orders.

With the lockdown hitting the Indian industry hard and causing job losses, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters an economic package to help tide over the crisis will be announced very soon.

In a letter to Chief Secretaries on Tuesday, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba asked them to ensure that no suspected or high-risk person was left out of surveillance efforts to prevent the spread of the pandemic.

He also called upon chief secretaries to make sure that hospitals are earmarked for treating COVID-19 cases and in a state of “full readiness” to deal with the situation in the event of a “further spike in the number of confirmed cases.”

Meanwhile complaints of discrimination against healthcare workers, airline staff and people who have been quarantined have also emerged.

As journalists and workers associated with the media faced police action amid the lockdown in some parts of the country, the Centre advised States to facilitate functioning of all print and electronic media outlets.

The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (I&B) said in an advisory, “false and fake news need to be avoided and good practices need to be promoted and these networks play a pivotal role in ensuring the same.”

49,2020/03/24,Coronavirus | Enforcement Directorate officials to attend office on rotational basis,"Probe into important cases continues as before

The Enforcement Directorate has directed its officials to attend office on a rotation basis to avoid crowding in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

“Necessary instructions have been given to ensure skeletal staff in offices across the country. However, officials required for urgent court proceedings have to be present,” said a senior official, adding that the agency had taken all precautionary measures, as directed by the government.

The ED's probe into all important cases is continuing as before. Although there is no written order pertaining to the issuance of summons to witnesses and suspects, sources said the agency may not mandate anyone's presence during the lockdown period. Statements of those turning up may be recorded as per procedure.

Last week, the Department of Personnel and Training had issued a directive to the heads of Ministries and Departments to ensure that 50% of Group B and C employees attended office every day, and the remaining worked from home. They were also told to draft a weekly roster of duty for Group B and C staff, and ask them to attend office on alternate weeks. Working hours of officials have also been staggered.

50,2020/03/24,Coronavirus | No curbs on essential goods: Centre,"States will act against those violating measures, will send a daily report to Union government

The Ministry of Home Affairs issued a slew of guidelines to be followed by the States to contain COVID-19 and asked all “enforcement authorities to note that these strict restrictions fundamentally relate to the movement of people, but not to that of essential goods.”

Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said in a tweet that the “list of essential services remains unchanged since March 22nd Janata Curfew.”

The Ministry of Home Affairs said all commercial and private establishments shall be closed, except “ration shops (under the PDS), dealing with food, groceries, fruits and vegetables, dairy and milk booths, meat and fish, animal fodder.” “However, district authorities may encourage and facilitate home delivery to minimise the movement of individuals outside their homes,” the guidelines said.

The Ministry said “delivery of all essential goods, including food, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment through e-commerce” would be allowed.

The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued an order asking the States to act against any person violating the containment measures as per provisions of Section 51-60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, besides legal action under Section 188 of the IPC, punishable by up to two years in jail and and a fine.

In another letter addressed to the Chief Secretaries, Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla asked the States to send daily reports on the implementation of the strict measures as “lack of uniformity in the measures adopted as well as their implementation may not serve the purpose of containing the spread of the virus.” The guidelines were similar to the measures being taken by the States. According to the guidelines, the district magistrates will deploy executive magistrates as “Incident Commanders” in the respective local jurisdictions for the enforcement of the 21-day lockdown as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The guidelines said offices of the government of India, its autonomous subordinate offices and public corporations shall remain closed. But the offices of defence, Central armed police forces, treasury, public utilities (including petroleum, CNG, LPG, PNG), disaster management, power generation and transmission units, post, the National Informatics Centre and early warning agencies would be exempted.

“Hospitals and all related medical establishments, including manufacturing and distribution units such as dispensaries, chemist and medical equipment shops, laboratories, clinics, nursing homes and ambulances, will continue to remain functional. The transportation for all medical personnel, nurses, para-medical staff, other hospital support services be permitted,” the Ministry said.

It said hotels, homestay, lodges and motels, which are accommodating tourists and persons stranded because of the lockdown, medical and emergency staff, air and sea crew and establishments used/earmarked for quarantine shall remain open. “All places of worship shall be closed for the public. No religious congregations will be permitted without any exception,” the Ministry said.

In case of funerals, a congregation of not more than 20 persons will be permitted, it said. “All persons who have arrived in India after February 15, 2020, and all such persons who have been directed by health care personnel to remain under strict home/institutional quarantine for a period as decided by local health authorities, failing which they will be liable to legal action under Section 188 of the IPC,” the Ministry said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qa0m2r/article31156705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-PHARMA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-no-curbs-on-essential-goods-centre/article31156707.ece

As the death toll from COVID-19 rose to 12, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday announced a 21-day lockdown for the entire country, stating that it was the only way to break the chain of infection. The lockdown will be in effect till April 14.

COVID-19 has claimed 12 lives in the country with authorities reporting one death each in Delhi, the second in the national capital, and in Maharashtra on Tuesday, and in Tamil Nadu early Wednesday. Over 500 persons were afflicted by the viral infection. Fears are also mounting that more could be hit as the global coronavirus toll inches towards 17,000.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

In a nationwide television broadcast, Mr. Modi said the pandemic was a huge challenge to every country and even countries like the U.S. and Italy, considered to have good health infrastructure, were struggling to control the situation.

“In such a situation we have learnt from the experience of the countries that have managed to get some control over the surge in cases, and these show that a lockdown for a sustained period of time is the only way to break the chain of infection,” he said.

India on Tuesday recorded 564 positive cases, with the number of positive patients in Kerala and Maharahstra crossing 100.

Stating that it was the priority of both the Centre and the State governments to set up health infrastructure as fast as possible to deal with the pandemic, Mr. Modi said the government had allotted ₹15,000 crore for the purchase of personal protection equipment for healthcare workers, setting up testing laboratories and quarantine centres.

“Draw a Laxman Rekha outside your house door and do not step outside of it. Stay where you are. This will be the decisive battle against coronavirus,” he said.

Sounding a note of caution, he said: “If we are not able to adhere to this lockdown sincerely for 21 days, believe me, India will go back 21 years.”

“Several families will be destroyed. India is at a stage of the pandemic where our actions will decide our future,” he said.

“While at home you must think of those endangering their lives to combat this pandemic — medical care workers, doctors, nurses, sanitation workers, ambulance drivers who are facing the challenge of treating the disease,” the Prime Minister said.

“Pray for the sanitation workers cleaning up our neighbourhoods to keep you safe, please think of the media personnel who are braving infection to keep you informed, of policemen enforcing the law while facing, in some cases, your anger,” he added.

Mr, Modi quoted figures on the spread of the pandemic to stress his point. “It took 67 days for the first 100,000 cases to come up, the next 100,000 came up in just 11 days, and it took only four days for the next 100,000 cases to appear,” he said.

“The rate of infection of the Corona virus is very fast and the only way to break the chain of infection is social distancing, staying indoors. This applies to every citizen of the country including the Prime Minister,” he said.

Resist rumours

Mr. Modi also cautioned against believing rumours.

He acknowledged that the challenge would be particularly hard for the poor and said that alongside the government, civil society organisations should also step up to mitigate some of the hardships.

53,2020/03/24,Coronavirus | Students from Kashmir stranded as India seals Bangladesh border,"They were on their journey home from medical colleges in Bangladesh

A group of 75 Indian medical students from Kashmir were stranded at the Benapole border crossing of Bangladesh on Tuesday as India shut all land crossings with neighbouring countries.

The students were returning home from medical colleges in Mymensingh and Dhaka and were scheduled to reach Kolkata to board afternoon Kolkata-Srinagar flights, which they missed as they remained stranded at Benapole in Bangladesh’s Jessore district.

“We journeyed for 10 hours in buses to reach the Benapole-Petrapole crossing and we learnt of the closure of the border check-posts on the way,” said a fourth year student, explaining that the medical colleges in Bangladesh had asked students to vacate hostels in view of the COVID-19 crisis. “We were assured by authorities that they would let us enter India but now we are being denied,” the student, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, added.

Bangladesh has so far detected 33 cases of COVID-19 infection. Out of that, three patients had died and five had recovered fully while the rest remain under observation. The medical student said that they required urgent help in view of the total transport halt that India was set to begin from the midnight of Tuesday. Apart from the Indian decision to suspend rail and air services, Bangladesh too will suspend train services from Tuesday evening.

That apart, Bangladesh will also suspend domestic air services from midnight of Tuesday. In view of the unprecedented suspension of air, road transport and railways in both India and Bangladesh, the students urged for prompt action from the Indian authorities to help them reach Srinagar.

Of the stranded students, a few are from institutions in Dhaka while most are from the Community Based Medical College of Mymensingh, which is a private medical college popular with students from India.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5qfr68/article31156495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-BORDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-students-from-kashmir-stranded-as-india-seals-bangladesh-border/article31156496.ece
54,2020/03/24,News Analysis | India’s health diplomacy cannot ignore Iran,"Iran has approached India for essential medical support

Energy rich Iran, reeling under the Covid-19 onslaught and sanctions marshaled by the United States, is testing India’s diplomatic guile, of maintaining its core strategic interests with a pivotal state in the Eurasian heartland.

On Monday, Coronavirus cases had jumped to 23,049, with 127 new deaths — pairing Iran with Italy, Spain and China, which have been worst hit.

In tune with the spiraling infections and fatalities, Iranian leaders have stepped up their campaign for the lifting of crippling U.S. sanctions which have apparently hampered the flow of essential overseas medical supplies, impeding containment of the pandemic in the Islamic Republic.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif is spearheading the outreach. Foreign ministers of the European Union, Japan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, South Africa as well as the U.N. Secretary General, have been tapped over the last week for providing humanitarian assistance, as well as the lifting of sanctions re-imposed against Iran by the Trump administration.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry has slammed Washington’s assertion that is not curtailing the transfer of drugs, pointing out that Washington is interfering with the Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement (SHTA) — a mechanism that would allow Tehran to access vital medical and humanitarian supplies from Switzerland under the supervision of the U.S. Treasury Department.

Iran has approached India for essential medical support. On March 12, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Ravish Kumar confirmed that Iran and Italy were among the countries which had sought India’s assistance, and their request was “under process”. “ Please try to understand, you know, we can only spare items, which we have at this point of time and accordingly based on the request and based on the availability of such items, packages has been put, ” Mr. Kumar said.

So far, Iranian officials have lavishly praised China for its support during the outbreak. Iran’s Tasnim news agency quoted Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Major General Mohammad Hossein Baqeri as saying that “the humanitarian moves exhibited by China, while it was struggling with the outbreak of this dangerous disease itself, have drawn the admiration of everyone.”

“On behalf of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I express gratitude to the Chinese people, government and Armed Forces for their goodwill, benevolence and health and medical aids for controlling and countering the coronavirus,” the senior Iranian commander observed.

Iranian media has also praised Japan not only for offering cash donations, but also the Avigan (Favipiravir) drug, which has apparently shown promising results during clinical trials for treating the infection in China. Mr. Zarif has also thanked Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan for exhorting the U.S. to lift sanctions against Iran, in the wake of the pandemic. India, so far is missing from the list of countries to which Iran has publicly expressed gratitude.

Analysts point out that despite its limitations, and commitment to SAARC neighbours to combat the disease, India also needs to be sensitive to Iran’s pressing requirements, as part of its effort to champion Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) in the region. Iran is an energy powerhouse. Despite minimising its oil imports, in the backdrop of Washington’s emergence as an enerergy supplier and other geopolitical factors, Iran is India’s long term partner in oil and gas. It is also India’s gateway to Eurasia, via Afghanistan and Central Asia through the India-run Iranian port of Chabahar.

Besides, Iran is at the heart of the International North–South Transport Corridor (INSTC) — a 7,200-km-long network of ship, rail, and road route for used for transporting goods between India, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Central Asia and Europe. Iran is also a major player in Afghanistan — a role that it is expected to assert on account of its deep nodes both within the Hazara community in central Afghanistan as well as factions within the Taliban, which are not all backed by Pakistan. In the past, India had worked closely and profitably with Iran, Russia and Central Asian countries, as a vacuum developed in 2001 after the collapse of the Pakistan-backed Taliban in Kabul.

Ideologically, Iran is a major player among Shia Muslims, with significant concentrations across the globe including India, Afghanistan Pakistan, and the Arab world, including Syria, Iraq and Lebanon.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gp1ull/article31118290.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUSIRAN-NOWRUZ-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/news-analysis-indias-health-diplomacy-cannot-ignore-iran/article31156361.ece

Meanwhile, Union Minister of Health & Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan, visited National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Control Room and the testing laboratories on Tuesday.

“The 24x7 helpline for COVID-19 undertaken by NCDC has in all got more than 2 lakh calls and nearly 52,000 emails have been answered,” he said.

He added that the need of the hour is that all the people who are either in home or facility quarantine, need to maintain strict vigil, and practice the laid down protocols of social distancing, and personal hygiene.

“Special care needs to be taken of the elderly, pregnant women and small children”, he said.

Michael J Ryan, Executive Director, WHO Health Emergencies Programme in a statement issued on Tuesday noted that India, like China, is a hugely populous country. “The future of this pandemic to a greater extent will be determined on what happens in very large and densely populated countries. So it’s really important that India continues to take aggressive action at the public-health level and at the level of society to contain, control, suppress this disease and to save lives.”

56,2020/03/24,"Coronavirus | Amid lockdown, foreign embassies worry about stranded tourists","Diplomatic missions are dealing with twin challenges of keeping staff safe while ensuring their nationals are able to return, given the ban on all commercial flights

Germany is hoping to fly out the first batch of an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 tourists who have been stuck in India since the government banned commercial flights a week ago to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The special flights, starting on Wednesday and expected to operate all week, are being coordinated by an “embassy crisis centre” being run 24/7 at the Embassy in Delhi, which is registering all German tourists and travellers in India so as to evacuate them.

“As an act of solidarity in these difficult times, we are also taking some European Union citizens with us. We will keep on working to facilitate for all who want to fly back,” Germany’s Ambassador to India Walter Lindner told The Hindu.

Close to airports

In a video broadcast in German on social media on Tuesday, Mr. Lindner also told citizens that they should try and move to hotels near the Delhi airport in preparation for the flights.

Apart from the challenge of dealing with the large numbers of Germans in India, is the fact that many are individual travellers, including some who are travelling in remote mountains, embassy officials explained.

As the lockdown in Delhi over the pandemic continues, several embassies say they are dealing with the twin worries of keeping their own staff safe while ensuring their nationals are able to return.

The government announced on March 17 that it would not allow any nationals from 37 countries to come to India, and has banned all commercial flight operations from March 22. However, the External Affairs Ministry says it will “facilitate requests for special flights by resident missions on a case by case basis.”

The government has also been coordinating with missions so that flights coming in to evacuate foreigners can bring in Indians stranded in their home countries as in the case of a KLM flight from Amsterdam and an Air Asia flight from Kuala Lumpur. The Home Ministry announced last week that it would extend all visas for foreign nationals until April 15.

Another worry a number of embassies say they are facing is the harassment of, and discrimination against, foreign nationals. One European diplomat said their citizens had been denied rooms at hotels when they arrived in Delhi, over fears they might carry the virus. Among the first major cases of the novel coronavirus in India were 16 Italian tourists in Rajasthan, who came into contact with an estimated over 200 Indians during their stay here. Most of them have now been discharged from hospitals in Gurugram.

The Spanish Embassy in Delhi says it estimates more than 400 of their tourists are still in India, and have been negotiating with local hotels to help accommodate them until they are able to get a special flight, or when commercial operations resume.

“While no hotel is throwing guests out, we are having a hard time securing new hotel reservations, as tourists are returning from places such as Pushkar and Rishikesh, and need to stay in Delhi,” said a Spanish Embassy official.

Face stigma

“Many of them say that Europeans are being identified and targeted particularly, taunted by bystanders who call them “corona”. It is very unusual for them, when this is normally such a friendly country,” he added.

The U.S. Embassy in Delhi, which has among the largest citizen populations in India, is also working on ways for Americans to be transported back. “We are working with airline companies and Indian authorities to identify transportation options for U.S. citizens to return,” an embassy spokesperson said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maxdf/article31156239.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-RUNWAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-amid-lockdown-foreign-embassies-worry-about-stranded-tourists/article31156240.ece

The official said around 350 CRPF doctors were sent to these centres, having been trained in treating COVID-19 patients.

He said the CRPF had asked its personnel to declare if any of their family members had recently returned from a foreign country. “We got to know of 6-7 cases, and the families have been quarantined at these centres, though none has tested positive,” he said.

The official said some isolation wards were equipped with ventilators and the CRPF had placed an order for more. “We have an adequate stock of personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors and other medical staff. If need be, more will be procured,” said the official.

At some locations, pre-fabricated structures have been used to build the isolation wards, but mostly the existing structures near the CRPF camps have been designated as quarantine centres.

The CRPF has asked its personnel on leave not to report to duty before April 15. “We have reduced the number of administrative staff members and only the minimum number of employees is reporting to work. The financial powers have also been decentralised, and officers at the unit level have been empowered to make purchases,” the official said.

Earlier, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), deployed primarily along the border with China and in the areas affected by the left-wing extremism, was tasked to open a quarantine centre. It was established at the ITBP camp in Chhawla on the outskirts of New Delhi. The first batch of 103 people, who had been evacuated from Wuhan, China, on February 1, were kept here. So far, 1,023 individuals have been sent to this facility, and many have been discharged in phases after the mandatory 14-day quarantine period and medical tests.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9syk7c/article31156476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24IN-CRPF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-crpf-readies-19-quarantine-centres/article31156212.ece

All meetings of parliamentary standing committees have been deferred indefinitely because of the lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19.

The meetings will not be held till the lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in place.

The Rajya Sabha Secretariat has ordered a total shutdown till Friday and the Lok Sabha Secretariat till March 31.

The meetings of the committees on commerce and government assurances, scheduled for Tuesday, were cancelled.

Finance committee chairperson Jayant Sinha told The Hindu that at least two committee meetings, scheduled for March 19 and 26, had to be deferred. “We will resume our meetings once travel restrictions are lifted.”

A meeting of the committee on information and technology, scheduled for Wednesday, was also cancelled. It was meant to discuss the 48-hour ban on Malayalam television channels Asianet and Media One.

Committee chairperson Shashi Tharoor said MPs could not travel, with domestic flights cancelled from midnight Tuesday. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla had asked the committees to defer all meetings till April 3. “I have asked for the next meeting for April 15. But it would be subject to how things are then,” Mr. Tharoor said.

The committee on science, technology, environment, forests and climate change has sought to defer the deadline to present its report on the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019. In a letter to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu, committee chairman Jairam Ramesh has sought an extension till the first week of the monsoon session. He argued that the committee was unable to get witnesses owing to the travel restrictions and it needed more consultations with the stakeholders as the legislation was “very badly drafted and requires a thorough examination”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ubvulm/article31156136.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THOMBIRLA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliamentary-panels-defer-meetings/article31156137.ece
60,2020/03/24,Opposition welcomes Omar Abdullah’s release,"Free Mehbooba Mufti and others, says Tharoor; Yechury calls for full access to Internet in J&K

The Opposition parties have welcomed the release of National Conference leader Omar Abdullah from eight months of detention. They have also called for the release of other political leaders, including Mehbooba Mufti of the Peoples Democratic Party.

Though the Congress has not issued any official statement, many of its leaders have welcomed Mr. Abdullah’s release.

Party MP Shashi Tharoor wrote on Twitter, “Welcome the release of @OmarAbdullah, which we have been calling for ever since his unjustified arrest. Maybe the #COVID19 lockdown makes all detentions unnecessary now? Please release @MehboobaMufti & all other political detainees without delay!”

Manish Tewari, another Congress MP, called for the release of the other leaders, including former Union Minister Saifuddin Soz.

“Glad @OmarAbdullah is being released after his illegal & unjust detention. All others should be released too. Not that they can go anywhere. #COVID19,” Salman, son of Mr. Soz, wrote on Twitter.

Congress leader and former Home Minister P. Chidambaram said Mr. Abdullah’s case would remain a shocking example of the failure of the justice delivery system. “The Supreme Court should restate the cardinal of a Writ of Habeas Corpus so that citizens and judges will have no misunderstanding of the law,” he wrote on Twitter.

Ghulam Nabi Azad, a former Congress Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, said Mr. Abdullah’s detention was “undemocratic and uncalled for”.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said political detainees outside Jammu and Kashmir should also be released. He also called for an unfettered access to the Internet in Jammu and Kashmir at a time of panic over COVID-19.

61,2020/03/24,Chouhan’s floor test sends a wrong signal: Vivek Tankha,"‘Congress should rejig and rebuild itself’, he says

Senior Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Vivek Tankha on Tuesday criticised the newly sworn in Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan for taking a floor test amidst a nationwide lockdown due to the Coronavirus outbreak.

In an exclusive interview with The Hindu, Mr. Tankha, who fought against the Chouhan government over the Vyapam scam in the Supreme Court as a senior advocate, asserted that “nobody was challenging his [Mr Chouhan's] majority”.

He said, “A wrong gets legitimised, in a wrong manner and at a wrong time, which sends a very wrong signal to society.”

Mr. Tankha was also forthright about the shortcomings of his party in M.P. and the 15-month old Kamal Nath government. “The Congress should rejig and rebuild itself, remembering that it was the BJP that had lost in 2018 [Assembly Elections] and we had not won the battle convincingly,” he observed.

Though civil society groups, activists and farmers ensured the “ascendancy of the Congress”, the State leadership didn't quite reward them by making them stakeholders in the government. “The start itself was wrong. The first principle of politics is sharing and we had seven alliance partners. From day one, I had been saying about accommodating them more than our own people. But there were no takers for this argument,” he stated.

The senior Congress leader from M.P. asserted that not all 22 Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) were loyalists of Congress-rebel-turned BJP leader Jyotiraditya Scindia.

Three categories

“While all of them may have been allured, the MLAs fell into three categories. One group was die-hard Scindia loyalists, while the second group was the lot made up by senior Congress leaders who were disenchanted. The third group was the one that is supposed to have gone entirely because of alleged allurements,” he said.

Mr. Tankha, who tried to broker peace between the dissident group and his party, said the State leadership, including Mr. Nath and Digvijaya Singh may have ‘misread the signs of discontent’. “They knew that things were not alright and something was amiss but perhaps they didn't realise the magnitude of the problem.”

Asked about the rampant factionalism in M.P. Congress, he stated that it had a ‘long history’ but it was never an impediment for senior leaders like Mr. Scindia, Mr. Singh or Mr. Nath to work together. “I wish they had worked it out together,” he said when asked if Mr. Scindia's exit could have been stopped.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/5xlnlf/article31154777.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-VIVEKTANKHA-SKP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chouhans-floor-test-sends-a-wrong-signal-vivek-tankha/article31154699.ece

Interacting with senior journalists from the print media via video links, he also said the citizens need to be assured that the government is committed to countering the impact of COVID-19. He said it is critical to improve social cohesion to safeguard national security.

During the interaction, Mr. Modi asked the media to act as a link between the government and people and provide continuous feedback at both the national- and regional levels.

“He underlined the importance of social distancing, asking media to generate awareness about its importance, inform people about the lockdown decision by States and also highlight the impact of spread of the virus through inclusion of international data and case studies about other countries in the papers,” a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said.

According to the statement, Mr. Modi underlined that “it is imperative to keep the fighting spirit of the people up”.

The Prime Minister also “emphasised that it was important to tackle the spread of pessimism, negativity and rumour mongering. Citizens need to be assured that the government is committed to countering the impact of COVID-19,” the statement said.

The Prime Minister thanked the participants for the feedback and reminded them of the social responsibility towards the less privileged. Mr. Modi said the media has played a praise-worthy role in disseminating information to every nook and cranny of the country. He said that the network of media is pan-India and spread across the cities and villages.

This makes the media all the more significant in fighting this challenge and spreading correct information about it at micro level, he said. He said that newspapers carry tremendous credibility and the local page of a region is widely read by people. It is, therefore, imperative that awareness about coronavirus is spread through articles published on this page. It is essential to inform people about where the testing centres are, who should get tested, whom to contact to get tested and follow home isolation protocols.

This information should be shared in newspapers and web-portals of the paper, the Prime Minister said. He also suggested that information such as location of availability of essential items during lockdown can also be shared in the regional pages of newspapers. The journalists and stakeholders from print media appreciated the role played by the Prime Minister in communicating effectively and leading the country from the front.

68,2020/03/24,Coronavirus | Strict social isolation for next 3 weeks key to containing COVID-19: Rahul Gandhi,"Country should have taken coronavirus threat more seriously: Congress

The Congress on Tuesday welcomed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement of a complete lockdown for the next three weeks but qualified their response by asking about what steps the government had taken to protect the poor.

Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram, in a series of tweets, said he had a “mix of emotions – relief, vindication, frustration, disappointment, worry and fear”.

“The lockdown is late, but better late than never. Those who mocked the idea of a lockdown will do the country a great favour by remaining silent for 21 days. PM’s announcement left a gaping hole. Who is going to provide cash to the poor that they need for the next 21 days?” asked Mr. Chidambaram.

Hours before the lockdown announcement, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday had appealed to citizens to adopt strict social isolation to fight the spread of novel coronavirus in India.

“I strongly appeal to each of you to follow strict social isolation and distancing measures. Containing the virus requires us to minimise our contact with people as much as possible,” Mr. Gandhi said in his open letter to citizens.

“Global public health experts have warned that a large number of cases remain undetected in India and could spread in the absence of containment measures,” he said while asserting that the next three to four weeks would be crucial.

“The public health personnel have displayed exemplary courage, even at great personal risk to themselves...The COVID-19 pandemic is a test of our ability to work together and collectively fight against unpredictable crises. This is the time for national solidarity and unity. I strongly appeal to all of you again to heed all the public safety advisories being issued and remain vigilant,” Mr. Gandhi said.

His open letter came just hours after he had tweeted that the Narendra Modi government didn’t realise the magnitude of the crisis .

“I am feeling sad, because this was completely avoidable. We had time to prepare. We should have taken this threat much more seriously,” Mr. Gandhi tweeted in response to a tweet from a Haryana-based doctor Kamna Kakkar who said hospitals faced an acute shortage of essential personal protective equipment (PPE).

Dr. Kakkar, who had tagged the Prime Minister and Haryana Chief Minister, had tweeted, “When they arrive, please send N95 masks and gloves to my grave. Taali aur thaali bhi baja dena waha! [clap and beat an utensil for me there] Regards, frustrated sarkari (government) doctor”.

The Congress said Mr. Gandhi had raised the alarm on the virus outbreak as early as February 12 but his suggestions were not taken seriously. The party’s chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala questioned the delay in banning exports of essential medical supplies like surgical masks and ventilators.

“Between Februray 1 and March 2, 2020, Health and Textile Ministries didn’t determine specifications for PPEs despite repeated requests from Protection Wear Manufacturers Association,” Mr. Surjewala alleged.

“Commerce Minister permitted export of Masks, Coveralls, Ventilators uptil 19th March as India faced scarcity. When will this equipment be available now? Pl tell a time frame.

Union Labour and Employment Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar on Tuesday wrote to all Chief Ministers and Lieutenant-Governors asking them to directly release funds into the accounts of construction workers using the cess collected by their respective Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Boards.

The Minister wrote that the government was taking various measures to provide relief to workers in view of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Ministry said about 3.5 crore construction workers were registered with the State boards and about Rs. 52,000 crore was available to the boards in the form of cess collected over the years.

In his letter, Mr. Gangwar said each State or Union Territory could decide the amount of payment to be made to the workers. “The financial assistance at this point of time would help to mitigate the financial crisis of our construction workers to some extent and boost their morale to deal with this epidemic,” the Minister wrote.

Deadlines for filing income tax and GST returns have been extended to June 30, as part of a slew of relaxations of financial year-end compliance announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday. The changes had been prompted by the shutdown of large parts of the country in a bid to control the spread of the COVID-19 viral infection, so that taxpayers were not forced to endanger their health in a bid to meet compliance requirements, she said.

73,2020/03/24,Pune’s MyLab gets approval for COVID-19 diagnostic kit,"Several labs in India had applied to National Institute of Virology, Pune, for getting their kits vetted

Pune-based MyLab is the first indigenous manufacturer to be approved for deploying its kits for COVID-19 testing.

“Congratulations to our Biotech innovators first make in India COVID 19 diagnostic kit,” Renu Swarup, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, tweeted. Ms Swarup also leads the government’s Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) that supports biotechnology companies, and MyLab was one of them.

While diagnostic tests for COVID-19 are largely reliant on foreign companies, several labs in India had applied to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for getting their own kits vetted. Written guidelines by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) require that only diagnostic kits that have been approved by the United States Food and Drugs Administration or certified by the European Union be allowed to offer commercial tests for detecting SARS CoV-2. However, Director General of ICMR Dr. Balram Bhargava on Monday said this was no longer a requirement and even those approved by the NIV would be eligible for approval.

The Managing Director of Mylab Discovery Solutions, Hasmukh Rawal, told trade magazine BioSpectrum India: “With emphasis on ‘Make in India’ and support from local and Central governments, COVID- 19 kit has been made as per WHO/CDC guidelines. It was developed and evaluated in a record time”.

The support and the immediate action from regulatory bodies (CDSCO/FDA), evaluation centre of ICMR, NIV, BIRAC and the Central and State governments during this national emergency was commendable, he said.

Dr. Bhargava said at a press briefing on Monday, “For private labs, we have issued detailed guidelines and 12 lab chains have been registered and they have begun work. They have 15,000 collection centres across India and these labs will increase as and when they register.”

74,2020/03/24,Delhi HC restrains Indian e-rickshaw maker from using trademark similar to German auto major BMW,"BMW has accused the Indian manufacturer of infringing upon its trademark with a “dishonest intention” to take advantage of its reputation and goodwill

The Delhi High Court has restrained an Indian e-rickshaw manufacturer from “in any manner dealing with any goods” bearing the mark ‘DMW’ or any other mark identical or deceptively similar to that of German automobile major, BMW.

Justice Jayant Nath in his interim order said that prima facie Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) has made out a case that the Indian company was infringing upon its trademark with a “dishonest intention” to take advantage of the reputation and goodwill of the German company.

The court also rejected the stand of the Indian company, Om Balajee Automobile (India) Private Limited, that it has been manufacturing e-rickshaws under the ‘DMW’ trademark since 2013 and BMW approached the High Court only in 2017 after a delay of four years.

The court said: “Even if there was delay on the part of the plaintiff (BMW) in filing of the present suit as has been claimed by the defendant (Om Balajee), the same delay would not be sufficient to deter grant of injunction in favour of plaintiff“.

It noted in its order that the German company has been manufacturing motorcycles under the BMW mark since 1923 and cars since 1928.

It said the company has assembly plants in 14 countries, global sales network in more than 140 nations, revenue of €94.163 million in 2016 and in these circumstances, use of mark ‘DMW’ by the Indian company “prima facie appears to be a dishonest act with an intention of trying to take advantage of the reputation and goodwill” of BMW.

“It is likely to mislead an average man of ordinary intelligence,” the court said.

It further noted that the Indian company’s brand was “visually and phonetically similar” to the mark of BMW which is a well known trademark and therefore, its use by Om Balajee on its products “constitutes infringement” under the Trademarks Act.

“The defendant (Om Balajee) is obviously seeking to encash upon the brand quality and goodwill which the mark BMW enjoys in the market.

“Such use by the defendant is detrimental to the reputation of the registered mark BMW of the plaintiff company. The defendant is prima facie guilty of infringement of the trade mark of the petitioner,” the court said.

It further said,”The plaintiff (BMW) has made out a prima facie case. Balance of convenience is in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant.

“An ad interim injunction is passed restraining the defendants, its officers, agents etc. from manufacturing, exporting, importing or offering for sale, advertising or in any manner dealing with goods not limited to e-rickshaws bearing the mark DMW or any other mark which are identical or deceptively similar to the plaintiff’s BMW marks.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qdmrcm/article31151775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BMWFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hc-restrains-indian-e-rickshaw-maker-from-using-trademark-similar-to-german-auto-major-bmw/article31151776.ece

Elections to 18 Rajya Sabha seats that were scheduled to take place on March 26 have been deferred due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the Election Commission of India (ECI) said on Tuesday.

On February 25, the ECI announced elections to 55 Rajya Sabha seats spread over 17 States that were to be vacated in April due to the retirement of MPs. Candidates for 37 seats in 10 States had been elected uncontested. Polling for the remaining 18 seats in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya and Rajasthan were to take place on Thursday, as per the ECI’s schedule.

Taking into account the World Health Organization’s declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11 and various advisories from the Centre on containing the spread of the disease, the ECI on Tuesday decided to defer the elections. In a statement, the ECI noted that the States in question had also issued lockdown orders.

“The poll process in the above-said elections would necessarily include the gathering of polling officials, agents of political parties, support officials and members of respective Legislative Assemblies on the poll day, which may not be suitable in view of the prevailing unforeseen situation and related advisories in the country,” an ECI statement said.

A senior ECI official said polling for the seats, which will be vacated in April, had been postponed and the situation would be reviewed after March 31. The decision comes after several State Assemblies, which are the electors in Rajya Sabha elections, curtailed their sessions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

India, which led the world in eradicating two silent killers – smallpox and polio – in the past, has a tremendous capacity in eradicating the deadly coronoavirus pandemic that has now claimed nearly 15,000 lives globally, according to a top WHO official.

The executive director of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Michael Ryan, said India, the world’s second most populous country, has a tremendous capacity to deal with the coronavirus outbreak as it has the experience of eradicating the small-pox and polio through targeted public intervention.

“India led the world in eradicating two silent killers and eliminating them from the country,” he said during a press conference in Geneva on Monday on the COVID-19 pandemic.

India, through targeted public intervention, ended smallpox and gave a great gift to the world. India also eradicated polio, he noted.

“India has tremendous capacities. It is exceptionally important that countries like India lead the way to show the world what can be done,” Mr. Ryan said.

India led the world in eradicating two silent killers, small-pox and polio so India has a tremendous capacity,” Mr. Ryan said.

“There are no easy answers. It is exceptionally important that countries like India show the way to the world as they have done before,” he said.

His remarks came as the WHO said the number of deaths soared to 14,652, with more than 334,000 people infected worldwide.

India has reported 492 cases of coronavirus and nine deaths, according to Health Ministry data on Tuesday. The total number of active COVID-19 cases across the country now stands at 446, after over 22 fresh cases were reported, the ministry said.

Meanwhile, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday warned that the coronavirus pandemic was clearly “accelerating” but said it was still possible to “change the trajectory” of the outbreak.

“The pandemic is accelerating,” Mr. Tedros told journalists in a virtual news briefing.

He said it took 67 days from the beginning of the outbreak in China in late December for the virus to infect the first 100,000 people worldwide.

In comparison, it took 11 days for the second 100,000 cases and just four days for the third 100,000 cases, he said.

“The #COVID19 pandemic is accelerating. It took 67 days from the 1st reported case to reach the first 100K cases, 11 days for the second 100K cases & just 4 days for the third 100K cases.

Former Chief Minister and National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah, who was released on Tuesday from a Srinagar sub-jail after 232 days, demanded the release of other detainees in Jammu and Kashmir and called for a joint fight against COVID-19.

“We face the fight of our lives over the next few weeks and months as we come to terms and work to defeat COVID-19. I will do everything in my individual capacity to help the authorities overcome this challenge and I appeal to all of you to do the same,” he said.

Mr. Abdullah was detained on August 5 last ahead of the Centre's decision to revoke J&K’s special status and later booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA) and kept in the Hari Niwas sub-jail. Earlier on Tuesday, J&K spokesman Rohit Kansal announced that Mr. Abdullah's detention order was revoked.

Sporting a long flowing white beard, Mr. Abdullah, who turned 50 in the jail on March 10, called for the release of other detained persons. “There is a lot to talk about. It’s a very different world today to the one that existed on 5th August 2019. J&K is now two Union Territories (UTs). But that is later. For now, I believe all those arrested or detained should be released, even those who don’t even belong to any party. High-speed 4G Internet services must be restored forthwith so that people can access sites and learn how to fight the COVID-19,” he said.

Later, Mr. Abdullah posted pictures of reunion with his family, including mother and father Dr. Farooq Abdullah, on the social media. “I had lunch with my mum and dad for the first time in almost eight months. I can’t remember a better meal even though I’ve been in a bit of a daze and don’t remember what I ate,” he said.

Political parties welcome decision

Several political parties welcomed the decision. “I am glad he is released. For all their talk of women emancipation, it seems this regime fears women the most,"" said Iltija Mufti, daughter of incarcerated ex-Chief Minister and Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti.

CPI(M) leader M.Y. Tarigami said Mr. Abdullah’s release was a step to correct one wrong among many wrongs. “The government should release all, including PDP's Mufti and J&K People's Movement chief Dr. Shah Faesal,” he said.

Recently floated J&K Apni Party chief Altaf Bukhari welcomed Mr. Abdullah’s release, saying: “it will help in creating conducive political atmosphere.”

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra expressed satisfaction over his release. “So happy to learn that Omar Abdullah’s unconstitutional and undemocratic detention has been revoked at last.

Given the urgent need, construction giant Larsen and Toubro is among the agencies that hopes to provide expertise to build exclusive hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients, in record time.

L&T CEO and M.D. S.N. Subrahmanyan told The Hindu that a task force from the company’s Buildings and Factories vertical will be capable of building a 50-100 bedded hospital from scratch with state of the art facilities within three to four months.

“We have the necessary design and capability. It is technically feasible,” he said, exuding confidence at completing the task.

Following the novel coronavirus outbreak and rapid spread, China had built a large health facility with space for 1,000 beds, within 10 days in Wuhan. “With this kind of emergency building happening in the rest of the world, we have been thinking of our capabilities here. In fact, in India, we have done other projects, building structures rapidly, in record time. And so, we started thinking about building a hospital too,” Mr. Subrahmanyan said.

The Union Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry on Monday asked all States and Union Territories to make information about measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 accessible to Persons with Disabilities (PwD).

In a letter to all Chief Secretaries, the secretary of the Department for PwD, Shakuntala Gamlin, wrote that while the States and UTs had been taking steps to contain the spread of coronavirus, very often the information disseminated was not accessible by PwD. She cited the Rights of PwD Act, 2016 that mandates dissemination of information in accessible formats in print and electronic as well as making government websites accessible.

Priority treatment

She asked the Chief Secretaries to instruct the health and publicity departments of their States and UTs to make all COVID-19-related information available in Braille and audio format for persons with visual impairment, videos with sub-titles and sign language for those with hearing impairment and information on all websites and social media with optical character recognition and e-PUB format. She also asked the States to provide priority treatment to PwD, as envisaged under the Act.

Exemption to staff

The Department has also asked the Department of Personnel and Training to exempt employees with visual impairment from going to their offices as they rely on “touch functions for mobility and work,” increasing their risk of getting infected, a March 20 office memorandum said.

87,2020/03/24,India ends evacuation flights for transit passenger,"Last flight with 113 Indians from Malaysia lands in Chennai

Stuck at Kuala Lumpur airport for six days, a group of 113 Indians finally made their way back to Chennai on Monday night, as the government said it was winding up efforts to bring back Indian passengers who are in transit at several international airports. However, hundreds of others who were not inside the airports as transit passengers, but were staying in city areas around the world, will probably not be able to return until commercial flight restrictions are lifted, as currently expected, on March 29.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

“There are now just a few Indian nationals who are stranded as transit passengers in different airports, and we are trying to bring them all back,” said Dammu Ravi, additional secretary in the MEA, who is coordinating the international evacuation effort.

Stranded in Iran

“We brought back those who were stuck in Amsterdam on Sunday night and we hope to bring home the rest,” he added. About 17 Indians are stuck at London’s Heathrow airport, and about 400 Indians are in Iran, for whom special flights may be arranged, after which no special flights are being planned, officials said.

Among those in the group coming from Kuala Lumpur were about 80 employees from the Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), who had travelled to Malaysia on an assignment on March 1.

Last week they were issued tickets on a Sri Lankan airline flight to Colombo, but were turned away just before they boarded the plane, after the Indian Health Ministry and DGCA reportedly refused clearance. Around 20 of them who did fly to Colombo, were forced to return by the same flight, and spend the next few days and nights on the carpeted floor in one section of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA).

“Despite all the hardships, they refused to return to Kuala Lumpur city in case they missed a chance to leave. Above all they feared being abandoned by India, and having nowhere to go in Malaysia, where the coronavirus situation has worsened,” R. Venkataraman, a relative of one of the TCS employees, told The Hindu, expressing relief that they were finally coming home.

Housed in hostels

However, the Air Asia flight on Monday was unable to bring back hundreds of others, that the Indian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur said it had taken to “different hostels, hotels…in close coordination with local NGOs and community organisations,” as these were no longer transit passengers and did not comply with the government’s March 17 travel advisory that had prohibited all passengers from Malaysia, Afghanistan and the Philippines.

Malaysia has about 1,200 confirmed cases of COVID-19, and its military has now been deployed to ensure people stay home.

A video circulated widely had caused the government some embarrassment as it showed angry Indian passengers at KLIA asking why they were the only nationality not being repatriated despite having paid for air tickets. “Our money is finished and we have no money for food. No other country has people stuck here…only Indians have been left behind. Are they waiting for us to get coronavirus too?” asked a visibly agitated passenger who identified himself as Amarjeet Singh.

With evacuations nearly completed for all Indian transit passengers worldwide, the focus is shifting to facilitating special flights for thousands of tourists and foreign nationals who are still stranded in India, who have not been able to fly out after India banned flights from about 37 countries on March 16, and subsequently shut down all commercial airlines operations from March 22-29, officials said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xgcxf8/article31145916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDMALAYSIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-ends-evacuation-flights-for-transit-passenger/article31145917.ece

Taking social distancing to a higher level, residents of Peddaganjam in Prakasam district practise social isolation religiously to prevent the spread of the dreaded coronavirus.

The elders in Peddaganjam, a hamlet of Upugundur village, went into huddle after the authorities declared a lockdown across the State, and decided not to go out of the village.

The lockdown is total in the coastal village with the residents, many of them fishermen, voluntarily confining themselves to their homes.

“We will not allow outsiders to enter our village as well till such time the health situation improves,” says a group of villagers in a conversation with The Hindu after putting thorny bushes across the road leading to the village close to the east coast highway to prevent entry of vehicles from outside.

“We are hale and hearty. The dreaded disease can spread only if someone comes from outside. Hence the decision,” they add making a mention of the disease spreading fast across the country after infected non-resident Indians landed in the country.

‘Age-old practice’

“Social isolation is nothing new. It is an age-old practice,” says a village elder M. Nageswara Reddy while referring to social distancing observed by their ancestors to avoid the spread of contagious diseases in the past.

“We will not hesitate to isolate any person infected with communicable disease till such time he or she recovers.

As they are foreign returnees, we can’t take any chances,” he said.

The incident led to a mild panic in the town and surrounding villages. Though there was some public activity in the temple town in the morning despite lockdown, the incident prompted the residents to remain indoors.

Emergency meeting

The official organised an emergency meeting with the paramedical and gram secretariat staff at the MPDO office at Narayanavanam mandal, and conducted a mock drill as to how a COVID-19 suspect case had to be tackled. In view of about half a dozen quarantine cases elsewhere in the mandal, Dr. Ravi Raju urged the field staff to spray disinfectant at the houses with quarantined persons.

Meanwhile, several gram-volunteers and ASHA workers complained during the meeting that the foreign returnees under quarantine at their houses and their family members were not cooperating with the surveillance and survey teams. “They are not allowing us to visit their houses. We do not even know whether the quarantined are really inside or not. Some of them are also using vulgar language with us,” a ASHA worker from Keelagaram village said.

Sub-Inspector (Narayanavanam) Hanumantha Naik urged the COVID-19 Task Force field staff to immediately seek the assistance of the local police while dealing with such reluctant persons. He said that those defying the norms of house-quarantine, including foreign returnees and their family members, would be shifted to special wards and cases would be booked against them in view of public safety.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/boy-with-covid-19-symptoms-creates-flutter/article31156157.ece
97,2020/03/24,"Act fast to contain COVID-19, parties and corporates urged","Govt. should ask the industry to manufacture more marks, ventilators and material: ex-IAS officer

Political parties and corporates have to act fast to contain COVID-19, said social activist and former IAS officer E.A.S. Sarma.

Instead of getting bogged down in procedures, the government should ask the industry not only to work to their full capacity but also to the extent possible, divert all its resources to manufacture more masks, ventilators and other material to ensure that COVID-19 campaign will not get constrained by shortages. Appreciating the role played by the Parliamentarians and their support in fighting against the virus, he said the Finance Ministry and the Health Ministry should constitute a team of eminent doctors to place orders on a nomination basis to speed up delivery at this crucial hour. They should be given full freedom to take decisions. The CAG can be kept informed.

In separate mails to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, he said the campaign against COVID-19 is assuming urgency in view of the rapidly increasing rate at which the States have been reporting virus-positive cases.

The Central and the State governments cannot afford to lose even a day in the campaign to contain the spread of the virus, in ramping up the medical infrastructure, in equipping the medical/ paramedical staff to insulate themselves from getting infected, in protecting the lakhs of the sanitation workers who are equally, if not more, exposed to the contagion.

Mr. Sarma said in the coming one or two months, it is likely that the number of COVID-19 positive cases will peak, bringing the infrastructure under an enormous stress and making community transmission of the virus a reality. While the Centre has the overall responsibility to help the States, it is the States that have the cutting edge responsibility for containing the virus spread, he opined.

More testing centres

He said the Union Ministry of Health has the overall responsibility to set up additional coronavirus testing facilities across the country, enable the industry to manufacture coveralls, masks, gloves, hand sanitisers and ventilators and coordinate the Centre and the States’ efforts. Stating that the Healthy Ministry has put in a commendable effort, if need be more budgetary allocations should be made if necessary by diverting funds from other less essential schemes.

The Central and the State governments should intervene and ensure that every worker engaged in anti-Covid-19 work is equipped with safety-certified masks, gloves and sanitisers. Hoarders should be proceeded against. Price controls should be imposed and enforced.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/act-fast-to-contain-covid-19-parties-and-corporates-urged/article31154546.ece

99,2020/03/24,Fear stalks tribal areas in Vizag Agency,"Outsiders declared persona non-grata, awareness very low among tribal people

“The novel coronavirus has denied our livelihood in the form of daily wage work or cultivating our small land holdings. We are offering prayers to our village deities regularly to save us from the virus which has originated from China,” says Madala Butiki, former sarpanch of Iragai gram panchayat in Araku Valley mandal.

She is not the lone opinion leader living under the grip of COVID-19 scare. Fear stalks every panchayat in Visakhapatnam Agency, which has the largest tribal population in the State. The district has 11 mandals with 244 gram panchayats with a total tribal population of six lakh. Paderu is the headquarters of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA).

Tribal people living in the Eastern Ghats are fearing the COVID-19 even as the official machinery has stepped up its efforts to educate them on the steps to be taken to prevent the spread of what they call “China virus”. “We hope that the virus will die soon with the blessings our village deities,” Ms. Butiki told The Hindu.

Lockdown

As the message on lockdown could not reach all the habitations, ITDA announced the decision on public address systems and by tom-tom on Monday evening. Three check-posts were set up at Chilakalagedda in Anantagiri, Garikibanda in Paderu and Downuru in Koyyuru mandal, considered gateways to the Agency.

ITDA Project Officer D.K. Balaji said the situation was under control and the check-posts were manned by the employees of Revenue, Panchayat and Police departments.

Admitting that the awareness level in the interior areas was very low, he said that owing to access to television and government machinery, residents in road-point hamlets were aware of steps to take care of personal hygiene. He said tourists and outsiders were not being allowed at the check-points and the villagers were also being advised not to shelter outsiders.

Only vehicles carrying essential commodities and provisions are being permitted to enter the Agency areas. The Agency has been totally closed to tourists, both domestic and foreigners. Police patrol parties are keeping a tab 24x7 on movement of vehicles and people.

Posters

Mr. Balaji said they had put up posters in every panchayat on measures required prevent the spread of COVID-19 and alert the officials if any outsiders visited their area.

Exclusive teams were being deputed to all panchayats to continue awareness programme. Suspected cases are being referred to Paderu and Araku area hospitals.

The official said as per the government direction, quarantine homes have been provided in each panchayat as part of a contingency plan. Buildings, including schools and Youth Training Kendras, have been taken over at Paderu and Araku to provide quarantine facility for 150 to 200 people at a time.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/fear-stalks-tribal-areas-in-vizag-agency/article31154242.ece
100,2020/03/24,Vizag officials tracking down foreign returnees,"So far, 1,470 foreign returnees have been advised home quarantine

Ever since the first positive COVID-19 case was recorded in the city about a week ago, the challenging task for the district administration has been to track down foreign returnees.

So far, 1,470 foreign returnees have been identified and all of them have undergone two rounds of screening and have been advised home quarantine.

But, according to District Collector V. Vinay Chand, the State government on Monday night released a fresh list of 2,330 foreign returnees. “We are now checking this list, as there may be a duplication. After cross-checking of names is completed, we will monitor those who have been left out and, if required, quarantine them at home or at hospitals, depending on the circumstances,” he said.

Teams in place

To monitor the foreign returnees at the village level, a five-member team has been formed for the 738 village secretariats.

Each team will comprise village volunteers, ANM, beat constable and the panchayat secretary, who will act as the village-level special officer.

At the ward level, five-member teams had been formed for all the 601 ward secretariats. “The teams will check on all the foreign returnees and those who have come in contact with them in the ward. Based on their compliance for home quarantine and health condition, the committee will act. If required, they will be shifted to the quarantine facilities,” said the District Collector.

Both the village-level committee and the ward-level committee would be monitored by the mandal-level committee comprising one sub-inspector, MPDO and tahsildar on a daily basis.

Committees

This apart, 20 committees had been formed comprising experts from various fields and academicians to monitor each task identified to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.

The committees have been given specific tasks such as field surveillance, laboratory surveillance, hospital surveillance and cluster surveillance, said Mr. Chand.

Challenge for the city

Since Visakhapatnam is a city with many essential services, clampdown had become a challenging task. Both the ports such as VPT and Gangavaram had been declared as essential services and this apart there were a number oil refineries, process industries and pharmaceutical industries, and running of each unit is important.

“Thousands of people are employed and the units cannot be stopped. But we have asked them to work with minimum workforce in shifts following the protocol of social distancing,” said the Collector.

“We have also told them to monitor the health conditions and report any suspect cases immediately. Any failure or lacunae in this, the units will be hauled up,” Mr. Chand added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vizag-officials-tracking-down-foreign-returnees/article31154222.ece

102,2020/03/24,Three bridges across Godavari river closed in East Godavari District in A.P.,"The closure also restricts entry into Yanam in the Union Territory of Puducherry

East Godavari police on Monday closed three bridges across the river Godavari, restricting entry of people and vehicles between East and West Godavari districts till March 31. This move will also restrict the entry of people from West Godavari district into Yanam town that comes under the jurisdiction of Union Territory of Puducherry.

To prevent COVID-19 spread

Speaking to The Hindu, Amalapuram Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Sheik Masoon Basha said: “The three bridges across the river Godavari - Dindi-Chinchinada, Siddhantam-Ravulapalem, Yanam (Union Territory) and Edurulanka - have been closed on Tuesday in the wake of lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”

As many as 17 teams of police have been deployed to monitor the situation on the three bridges.

“Vehicles that are required to cross the three bridges for any emergency service, transportation of milk and essential goods, are being allowed to cross the inter-district border through the bridges,” said Mr. Basha.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/three-bridge-across-godavari-river-in-eg-district-closed/article31153405.ece
103,2020/03/24,COVID-19 testing laboratory starts functioning in Anantapur,"Set up in Anantapur Government Medical College, it will become a regional hub for Rayalaseema; more so with Anantapur being a centre of people with foreign travel history

Now, waiting time for the results of throat swabs of COVID-19 suspects will drastically come down in Andhra Pradesh. Thanks to the testing centre - one of the four in the State - set up by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) which began functioning in Anantapur Government Medical College (AGMC) from Tuesday. It had received the first batch of 10 samples from Kurnool, and one taken locally by doctors.

“The centre here had received permission from the ICMR to perform the tests. But every result needs to be validated by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune for the next 20 days so that authenticity of the procedure is established,” AGMC Principal Myreddy Neeraja told The Hindu.

Shorter turnaround time

Here’s how the process works. From the time two throat swabs of a suspect are obtained- one through the nose and other from the mouth - and arrive at the laboratory in a cold chain (maintained at 4 degreesC., to the time the result is known, it will take four hours. However, initially, since the NIV Pune needs to validate the results online for some days, announcement could take a little longer. “After a suspects’s swab is taken, it is put in a 3 ml viral transport medium allowing the virus to grow in a 10 ml tube. Extracting the gene - RNA - of the virus from the sample is important and that needs to be fed into the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) machine,” said Medical Scientist B. Praveena.

The other three testing laboratories in Andhra Pradesh are at Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS), Kakinada and Vijayawada. In fact, the ICMR was keen on making Anantapur as the Regional Hub for COVID19 testing in Rayalaseema region.

Large foreign footfalls

The reason? Anantapur is hotspot of people with foreign travel history as it has KIA Motors India plant, Puttaparthi Sri Sathya Sai Baba ashram that draws a large number of devotees from world over - mainly Italy - and the Rural Development Trust (RDT) frequently visited by Spanish nationals and working extensively with rural communities in Anantapur and Kurnool districts.

The Testing Centre here currently has one Medical Scientist, one non-medical research scientist, along with two lab technicians and a doctor, who have undergone training for COVID-19 testing on the RT-PCR laboratory procedure at SVIMS. The Centre is likely to get two more staff members to take the load in the coming days.

Can be ramped up

“The present set-up can test between 20 and 25 samples a day and can increase the numbers slowly with additional supporting staff joining the current team, which has been tirelessly working for the last 20 days to make this centre operational,” said Microbiology Laboratory Chief G. Swarnalatha.

Initially 10 samples were sent from the NIV, Pune, for the team to get accustomed to the procedure and calibrating the machine. “Currently the laboratory is running on two shifts, and if the need arises it can run on three shifts,” added Dr. Swarnalatha.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/8c8dz1/article31153470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IN24ANANTAPURKIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/covid-19-testing-centre-up-and-running-in-anantapur/article31151923.ece

All modes of transport including buses, trains and autorickshaws were withdrawn. Police personnel were seen persuading those who ventured out of their homes to return for their own good.

Prakasam Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal, who led a posse of police in enforcing the Section 144 of Cr.Pc. in the district, explained thus: “The next one week period is very crucial in the fight against the disease. Every one should voluntarily practise social distancing to check the spread of the viral disease.”

112,2020/03/24,MLA decries public gatherings despite lockdown in Tirupati,"Inspections reveal many shops doing brisk business

Tirupati MLA Bhumana Karunakar Reddy on Monday expressed concern about the huge public gatherings at several places in the city in spite of the State-wide lockdown to combat COVID-19.

Karunakar Reddy, accompanied by the Municipal Commissioner P.S. Girisha, went round several crowded junctions in the pilgrim city and urged people to disperse and cooperate with the lockdown to tackle the dreaded coronavirus. During the inspections, the civic authorities were shocked to find many shops open and several roadside businesses going on briskly.

“It is really alarming to notice more than 40,000 people forming big groups at all public places and business centres, without caring about the precautions to prevent the spread of the virus,” Mr. Reddy told the media.

Quarantine cases

At present, close to 200 COVID-19 suspect cases were under quarantine in Chittoor district, while the presence of about 500 foreign returnees was registered. “At this juncture, as we are passing through the second stage of the virus spread, the public should exercise great caution, but it is badly missing,” Mr. Reddy said.

“Considering the seriousness of the situation, I urge the public to cooperate with the State-wide lockdown and join the mission against COVID-19,” the MLA said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mla-decries-public-gatherings-despite-lockdown-in-tirupati/article31146711.ece
113,2020/03/24,‘Isolation facilities will come up in all 14 constituencies’,"Rayalaseema University hostel will be turned into makeshift ward: Collector

Kurnool has a total of 109 ventilators in place to deal with COVID-19, said District Collector G. Veerapandian. Of the 109, 90 belong to private hospitals and 19 are from the Government General Hospital (GGH).

Addressing mediapersons here, the Collector said that isolation facilities are coming up in all the 14 constituencies of the district, in addition to expanding the existing isolation ward at the GGH.

“So far isolation wards have been allotted to 12 constituencies. We are also converting a hostel in the Rayalaseema University for establishing a 225-bed isolation facility,”he said, adding that non-essential wards of GGH, such as ENT ward, would also be converted into isolation wards.

Mr. Veerapandian iterated that so far no one has been tested positive. “We have tested six people so far, and all of them were negative. Three more are awaiting tests.”

“Two persons from Kasi and one from Rajasthan have been identified and admitted into the GGH. We have taken their samples and sent it to Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences (SVIMS) for testing,” Mr. Veerapandian said.

The Collector said out of the 403 foreign returnees in the district, 83 have completed their 28-day quarantine. “The rest of them are currently either observing home quarantine or are in hospitals,” he added.

The government has recently sent a new list of 605 foreign returnees, and we are currently under the process of doing door-to-door survey, Mr. Veerapandian said, adding that ASHA workers, ANMs or VROs would undertake the job.

An official has been assigned for every ten foreign returnees to interview them on phone. “The Mandal Development Officer, Tehsildar or Municipal authorities would be conducting the interview,” he added.

Meanwhile, 120 autorickshaws were seized for plying after Section 144 was imposed.

114,2020/03/24,Mad rush for vegetables in Chittoor,"Tomato price shoots up, other varieties sold at double the normal rate

A day after the Janata Curfew, it was a mad rush of people at all vegetable markets, grocery and medical shops all over the district right from the early hours of Monday.

The first target of the public was vegetable markets, buying whatever variety they could lay their hands on, unmindful of the sudden jump in the prices. In Chittoor, the vegetable market was flooded with people, leading to exhaustion of stocks by afternoon. In case of essential commodities, several supermarkets saw huge crowds initially, but following assurance that they would be exempted from the lockdown, the crowds gradually thinned.

The immediate impact of the lockdown was felt on tomato, which was sold at ₹40 a kg on Monday, as against ₹15 on Saturday. The price for the second grade variety stood at ₹14 a kg, showing a jump of ₹5. At several markets in the district, tomatoes sold like hotcakes. The price of 4 kg onions jumped to ₹100 from ₹50. The prices of regular vegetables like brinjal, carrot, ladies’ fingers and several gourds doubled. As the ginger stocks started exhausting, consumers competed to have their portion, paying whatever price the vendor demanded.

No takers for fruits

Interestingly, there were no takers for fruits and vendors struggled to dispose them of at throwaway prices. “During March 15-20 period, several vendors across the district procured the first batch of musk melon and hoped for a good price. But our hopes were dashed. We were forced to sell them in haste just to get back our investment. The virus scare reduced the interest among public on fruits. Large stocks with us have perished,” Anwar, a vendor in Nagari, said.

Separate zones

Meanwhile, in order to tackle the problem of public congregations, the municipal authorities decided to create five separate zones for selling vegetables in Chittoor.

115,2020/03/24,Lockdown: retail shops urged to shut in Tirupati,"Following the success of ‘Janata Curfew’, the government extended the same in the form of extended lockdown to gain total control over COVID-19.

Legislator Bhumana Karunakar Reddy, MCT Commissioner P.S. Girisha and Deputy Commissioner D. Haritha came on to the roads on Monday and sought closure of retail outlets, urging their cooperation in ensuring social distancing. Tirupati Urban Police explained the disastrous consequences of the virus spread and asked people to stay indoors.

After letting the denizens come out freely on the roads to stock up essentials, the police ordered closure of retail outlets and eateries by noon. After that, the city was deserted as it was on Sunday.

‘Uninterrupted power supply’

The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams(TTD) management introduced thermal scanners to screen employees and visitors arriving at their administrative building, apart from ensuring hand sanitisers in place at the main entrance. The employees have been allowed to work in shifts till April 4, allowing ‘work from home’ option for 50% of the staff, who will have access to e-office.

Meanwhile, A.P. Southern Power Distribution Company Limited (APSPDCL) Chairman and Managing Director H. Haranatha Rao announced to provide uninterrupted power supply and also arranged to supply gloves and sanitisers to its field staff.

‘Make payments online’

Addressing a tele-conference with engineers, Mr. Harantha Rao directed the district level officials to secure special permission, if required, for the field staff to move across, during the lockdown period. He sought special stickers on department vehicles and asked the employees to prominently sport their identity cards to avoid tiff with the policemen guarding the streets during the lockdown.

Mr. Haranatha Rao also appealed to the public to refrain from visiting the departmental offices and make payments through online mode or the mobile app.

Marketing Minister Mopidevi Venkataramana has brushed aside the rumours that the aqua sector would be closed down due to the coronavirus threat.

At a press conference at the Secretariat on Monday, he said aqua processing units were not being shut down but instructions were given to the officials concerned to see that the farmers working in the units were not be affected by the coronavirus.

The aqua and poultry sectors were reeling under the impact of the coronavirus. The aqua sector has three primary divisions – seed, feed and processing management. India occupies the second place after China in terms of exports to European countries and Andhra Pradesh contributes a major part of it.

Exports from the State commenced 10 days ago. The State government was taking all possible measures to save the aqua sector. The officials concerned were asked to ensure that the aqua farmers did not incur losses due to delay in transportation of the produce.

The District Collectors, police, transport and check-post officials were asked to see that there was no hurdle in the transportation of aqua products. The farmers need not panic, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/aqua-units-will-not-be-shut-says-minister/article31146606.ece
117,2020/03/24,Secretariat staff say ‘no’ to Budget session of Assembly,"‘Take the ordinance route keeping the prevailing situation in mind’

The Andhra Pradesh Secretariat Employees Association has urged the government to take the ordinance route to meet the expenditure for the initial months of the next financial year.

The association felt that an ordinance could be issued in view of the prevailing circumstances — the impact of COVID-19 and thin attendance in the Secretariat. Nearly 25 to 30% of the employees still shuttle between Hyderabad and Vijayawada to attend duties in the Secretariat or the Assembly and hence it might not be possible to conduct the Budget session.

Speaking to reporters at the Secretariat on Monday, its president K. Venkatrami Reddy said that the attendance in Secretariat was about 30% due to lack of public transport and lockdown imposed in the State. Also, the borders of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were sealed.

Donation to CMRF

Mr. Venkatrami Reddy said the executive committee of the association had resolved that the Secretariat employees should donate one day salary to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund (CMRF). Other associations were also contemplating donating to the CMRF. The contribution would come to about ₹90 crore to ₹100 crore if all government employees did the same, he added.

The money thus pooled should be spent on COVID-19 preparedness. He also urged the government to provide masks and other necessary equipment to the personnel involved in sanitation and health works.

The association leader said that the government should not insist that 50-60% of the employees should attend their duties. Instead, they should be allowed to work from home.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/secretariat-staff-say-no-to-budget-session-of-assembly/article31146227.ece
118,2020/03/24,"For a change, the Lord’s curtains reach Tirumala by road!","With lockdown in force, authorities permit tailor Mani to ferry them by car

For a change, the sacred curtains meant for the Lord Venkateswara temple, which is carried every year on the head with great devotion on the trekking route to Tirumala, has been taken by a four-wheeler.

Mani alias M. Subramanyam, a local tailor, presents three sets of the drapery to adorn the ‘Kulasekhara Padi’, ‘Ramulavari Meda’ and ‘Bangaru Vakili’ thresholds in front of the sanctum sanctorum every year.

The curtains are changed after ‘Koil Alwar Tirumanjanam’ (total cleansing of the sanctum sanctorum) performed four times a year ahead of Ugadi, Anivara Asthanam, Deepavali and Vaikuntha Ekadasi, all occurring in a gap of around three months.

It has been the practice for the tailor for over a decade to personally stitch the curtains, carry them by foot to Tirumala and offer the same to the temple authorities a day before the ‘Koil Alwar Tirumanjanam’.

Unique theme

Every year, he chooses a unique theme to be depicted on the main curtain. This year, the curtain bears an image of Goddess Mahalakshmi, seated atop a ‘Poornakumbham’, which again is placed on a lotus, with a ‘Chakra’ and ‘Sankhu’ drawn on either side.

After the COVID-19 scare forced the TTD to close down the Tirumala temple for the devotees, the extended lockdown that followed ‘Janata Curfew’ also drastically reduced human movement.

In the likelihood of the wild animals straying onto the deserted trekking route, the TTD officials were hesitant to grant permission to Mr. Mani to carry the curtains on foot.

As even the two ghat roads are closed down for common people, and only those vehicles on official duty are allowed to ply, the security officials finally decided to accord him special permission to take the curtains by road.

Mr. Mani came all the way up to the Alipiri by foot, paid obeisance to the imposing Tirumala hills, and boarded the car to Tirumala with the holy curtains.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/w6g7lp/article31146201.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24VJPG4-TAILOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/for-a-change-the-lords-curtains-reach-tirumala-by-road/article31146202.ece

All non-essential services, public transport, and shops have been shut down in the city on Monday as the precautionary measures against COVID-19 were intensified. The district authorities have also imposed section 144 to restrict the movement of people.

Despite cautioning, scores of people rushed to their local stores to stock up on essential goods fearing that supplies would not be available for the next few days.

The officials had made it clear that all stores selling essential goods such as kirana stores, milk outlets, pharmacies, hospitals, meat shops, petrol pumps etc. would be kept open. “We are encouraging retail shop owners to door deliver the goods,” said Collector G. Veerapandian.

121,2020/03/24,Each mandal headquarters to have one Telugu medium school,"GO asks official to supply relevant textbooks as per enrolment

After deciding to make English as the medium of instruction from Classes I to VII in all the government schools from the 2020-21 academic year, the State government has accorded permission to the Commissioner of School Education to continue one Telugu medium school at each mandal headquarters for the sake of students who wish to study in that language.

PIL in HC

The government’s decision assumes significance in the wake of the Legislative Council suggesting a few amendments to the relevant Bill bill passed in the Legislative Assembly.

As the ruling YSRCP did not agree to the amendments, the Bill was put to voting. Also, the GO issued by the government in November last was challenged in the High Court questioning the legality of the government’s move.

In response to the PIL, the Court asked the government to stop the printing of new textbooks.

The government, in a GO on Monday, asked the Director (Text Book Press) to to obtain correct indents and ensure supply of Telugu medium textbooks to the schools as per their enrolment well before the start of the academic year.

The government also said that all minor media schools, except unaided ones, would continue with Urdu, Tamil, Kannada, Odiya as medium of instruction.

In spite of the government’s decision, the number of Telugu medium schools will not be more than 670 in the State if the number of mandals are to be considered.

At present, there are 34,000 primary and upper primary schools in the State where Telugu is the medium of instruction. These apart, there are 10,000 high schools in which both English and Telugu are the media of instruction, says MLC K.S. Lakshman Rao.

“It is a face-saving exercise by the government. The High Court may annul the GO issued in November. The government gave assurances to the High Court that it will continue Telugu medium for those who choose to study in that language,” he says.

Transport charges

The government said in the GO that transport charges would be paid to the students travelling from villages beyond the neighbourhood of the school as per the rates and procedure laid down under the AWP&B of Samagra Shiksha.

The total number of confirmed cases is 41, including one death. However, the good news is that two more have recovered and were discharged on Tuesday. One patient was discharged last week.

The discharged are the 47-year-old wife of the first techie who tested positive and the 56-year-old techie, who is the fourth person to test positive in the State. One 26-year-old techie, who had tested positive after returning from Greece, was discharged last week.

The new cases include three women, one of whom is aged 70. They contacts of patients who had tested positive earlier. While one of them is from Kasaragod, the others are from Chickballapur and Bengaluru. The three women had returned from Saudi Arabia.

While Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan on Tuesday said that the State should brace for possible one lakh COVID-19 cases, some pulmonologists and experts in respiratory diseases have said that the need of the hour is to cut transmission and not create panic.

‘Critical week’

One well-known pulmonologist, requesting anonymity, said he was not sure on what basis the estimated numbers were being arrived at. “The next one week is critical for us and our focus should be on cutting transmission and not creating panic,” said a senior government doctor, who is an expert in communicable diseases. “If we pass this month without a surge in numbers, we are confident Karnataka will be able to contain the spread of the infection in the coming days. This is possible if people follow strict home quarantine,” he said.

Tarun Bhatnagar, scientist at Indian Council of Medical Research, said that there is no data yet to make the projections. “But as India started preventive measures at an early stage and has stepped up surveillance, we hope there will be a positive impact on containing the infection,” he said.

Dr. Bhatnagar is one of the authors of the paper titled ‘Prudent public health intervention strategies to control coronavirus disease 2019 transmission in India: A mathemathical model-based approach”, which was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research early this month.

However, Devi Prasad Shetty, chairman of Narayana Health, who cautioned that over 80,000 persons are likely to be infected in Karnataka, told The Hindu that the prediction was based on how the virus behaved in Italy. “In a State like Karnataka with a population of over 6.5 crore, we need to plan for the worst. My projection may lead to panic, but it is important for us to make estimates and preparations for the worst-possible scenario,” he said. “I may be wrong and I wish I am. But what if I am right? The State government is planning in the right direction,” he added. Pointing out that countries like Iran, France, Germany, and Spain took long to contain the infection, he said India clamped down on visitors early on.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vgo0uf/article31159247.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGDEVISHETTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dont-speculate-on-numbers-focus-on-cutting-transmission/article31156725.ece

125,2020/03/24,Poor badly hit by lockdown in Belagavi,"Life was thrown out of gear across Belagavi district following the lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19 on Tuesday.

Authorities enforced the lockdown strictly and used some force to stop people from commuting on roads in some places. The police and city corporation officers evicted streetside vendors. This led to a complete shutdown of markets, industries and offices.

The police put up barricades on various important roads and stopped commuters from further venturing out. At some places, the personnel asked the people why they were leaving home and where were they going to. They asked them why they were not wearing masks.

At least in three places, police lathi-charged commuters. Police Commissioner Lokesh Kumar, however, denied this charge and said that the police may have used mild lathi-charge to disperse travellers who insisted on continuing their journey.

The State borders were sealed. The Public Works Department piled up mud mounds on the roads leading to towns in Maharashtra and Goa. No vehicles, public or private, were allowed to cross the borders.

Working class families suffered inconvenience. Balu Kishore, a bank employee who was stuck in Ranebennur, said that he had to suffer a lot to reach Belagavi where his wife resides. “I had to hitch rides on a milk van and a vegetable truck to reach the city. There was no public transport. Even private vehicles were not allowed to run. There were a lot of people left stranded on the roads,” he said.

The poor were the worst-hit by the complete lockdown enforced in Belagavi and surrounding areas. Stone-cutters who work in make-shift tents and sell their ware on the roadside were forced to go without work or food. A group of families from the Kallu Kutika-Waddar community was sitting on the footpath near the Koti Kere Road.

Hanikeppa, a community elder, told The Hindu that they had no work for three days and that there was almost nothing with them to eat. “We have some rice flour left. My wife is making porridge and feeding it to the children,” he said. They carve mortar and pestle from stone and sell them to passers-by. But they have not been able to work amid the lockdown.

However, some associations are helping the poor by feeding them. The coordination committee of Kannada associations provided biscuits, flour and rotis to the street vendors near the city bus stand.

Manpreet Singh Khanjua, a spokesperson for the Gurdwara Nanak Jhira in Bidar, said that most Gurdwaras in the State were offering langar mass lunch services. “However, the minimum safety and hygiene protocols are being followed,” he said.

Food for Needy, a Belagavi-based NGO, has offered to deliver food to the needy at public places such as bus stands and railway stations and in some other localities.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa said that private hospitals had come forward to spare the services of doctors and clinical staff working in their hospitals. “They have also agreed to spare more than 100 ventilators. While we have decided to create a separate block of 1,200 beds at Victoria Hospital, another 1,200 beds will be pooled in private hospitals,” the Chief Minister said.

“Our only worry is how to quarantine the large number of people who have come in contact with the positive cases. The experts have suggested a complete shut down and we will soon take a final decision on this,” he said.

Fever clinics

Based on suggestions from private doctors, the government will set up 30 fever clinics in the city. Preliminary checks will be done here and primary care for all minor ailments will be provided, he said. Several doctors, who attended the meeting, asserted on the importance of quarantine for affected cases. “People should realise the seriousness of the situation and stay at home to prevent infection,” said C.N. Manjunath, director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences.

Sudarshan Ballal, chairman of Manipal Hospitals, said apart from quarantine centres, there was a need to extensively use telemedicine for medical care and stock up essential personal protection equipment and medicines. “All these measures were discussed and robust public private partnerships in these areas were agreed upon,” he said.

131,2020/03/24,Over 900 Yakshagana scripts go digital,"Teamwork by 100 professionals results in conservation of scripts in less than a year

More than 900 Yakshagana scripts, including the ones printed in 1905 and 1907, have now been digitised and made available online for free, thanks to the voluntary community effort by some Yakshagana lovers who did it under Yakshavahini, a registered trust.

The teamwork by about 100 professionals, including software engineers, has resulted in conservation of 934 scripts in the digital form in less than a year of launching the project. The number of digitised scripts is expected to touch 1,000 by March-end.

The ‘Prahlada Charitre’ printed in 1905 and ‘Ramashwamedha’ printed of 1907, ‘Putrakamesti’ published of 1913, ‘Kanakangi Kalyana’ of 1929, Kumudhwati Kalyana of 1931 and Sampoorna Ramayana printed in 1938 are among the ones digitised.

The concept of digitisation conceived in August last took birth soon after a month and the first set of scripts scanned went online in October, 2019 through a blog, Nataraja Upadhya, a software engineer and a co-ordinator of the project told The Hindu. The scripts sourced from different sources have been scanned, preserved in PDF format in Google drive and made available on www.prasangaprathi sangraha.com and through the ‘Prasanga Prathi Sangraha’ app, Mr. Upadhya said. The collection and digitisation of scripts, both in printed and manuscript forms, is one among the four projects being taken up by the Bengaluru based Yakshavahini, he said.

Among those digitised now are 65 scripts scanned and digitised by the Sristi Foundation of film-maker and director Abhaya Simha and others, he said. “We have given links to those scripts,” he said. Mr. Upadhya said that it is estimated that Karnataka had about 8,000 Yakshagana scripts. Of them, half might have disappeared due to various reasons. The Yakshavahini is making efforts to collect the remaining scripts and digitise at least 3,000 of them.

Ashwini Hodala, another co-ordinator and a pillar of the project, said that the scripts digitised included the ones written by Parthi Subba, considered as the pioneer of Yakshagana, Devidasa, Keerikkadu Vishu Master, Dwajapurada Nagappaiah and contemporary writer D.S. Sridhara. The collections included some different versions of same scripts published at different stages with some omissions and additions, she said.

Lakshminarayana Bhat, a software engineer who developed the app for the project, said 1,045 users have installed it since it was released on December 15, 2019. A user can use the names of the author, the ‘prasanga’ (script) or the publisher in the ‘search’ option to look for a particular script.

M. Krishna, administrator of a Yakshagana WhatsApp group, said that the documentation is a good source for researchers and present generation artistes. The volunteers have preserved them for the future generation at their own cost. “Now a ‘bhagawatha’ (singer and director) needs to take only an iPad to the stage and not the printed book,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mso6ym/article31149253.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGYAKSHAGANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/over-900-yakshagana-scripts-go-digital/article31149254.ece

Deputy Commissioner M. Deepa, who is also the chairperson of the District Disaster Management Authority, said on Monday that Containment Area has been declared in a three-kilometre radius of Hosayellapur after a foreign returnee tested positive for COVID-19.

As per this rule, all shops, business establishments, government offices and courts should be shut down. Even the movement of public has been prohibited.

Atal Janasnehi Kendras, Spandana Kendra, Aadhaar service units, sub-registrar office, RTO and Co-operation Department will stop their services. The RTO will not issue any new licence or register new vehicles. The local and urban local bodies dealing with birth and death certificates, giving permit licence, registration of property or transfer of title deeds have been stopped till further orders. Even though the services are temporarily suspended, the offices will continue to remain open. The employees will continue to come to offices and perform daily work. If any officer goes on unauthorised leave or closes down office, stern legal action will be taken, she cautioned.

Essential services such as banks, post-offices, food and civil supplies, cleanliness, KUWS&DB, HESCOM, grocery shops, vegetable and fruit market, medical shops and hospitalS will continue to function as usual. Sanitisation too is going on in areas such as markets, commercial establishments and others.

Though as of now no positive case of COVID-19 has been reported from Vijayapura district, yet the district administration, which is in no mood to take any chances, has decided to implement tougher measures to prevent the spread of the virus.

As part of it, the decision has been taken to implement Section 144 of Cr.PC in the district till the midnight of March 31, barring the gathering of more than five people at any public place.

Announcing this decision during a media briefing at his office here on Monday, Deputy Commissioner Y.S. Patil said that besides implementing Section 144, another important decision has been taken to seal all borders connecting all neighbouring districts of Vijayapura.

“These include Kalaburagi, Yadgir, Raichur, Bagalkot and Belagavi. All transport buses to Maharashtra have already been stopped,” he said.

He said that while intra-district bus services are also banned, bus services would be resumed on Tuesday based on need.

Mr. Patil said that relaxation has been given to vegetable markets and grocery shops for purchase of essential commodities. However, all hotels, malls, big shopping complexes, bars would remain closed, while takeaways from eateries will be allowed.

Since Section 144 has been imposed, all weddings, public gatherings and religious programmes have been banned. With regard to Muslims gathering at mosques, Mr. Patil said, since Section 144 remains imposed in the district, people of the community have been asked to desist from gathering at mosques.

Meanwhile, cases have been booked against three persons including two for not staying at home for 14 days after returning from a foreign country and one person for holding a wedding by inviting more than 100 people without taking permission from the administration.

Superintendent of Police Anupam Agarwal, who was also at the press conference, said that 23 check-posts have been set up to prevent the entry of inter-district and inter-State vehicles at the borders.

“The check-posts would be managed by officials of the police, revenue and health departments to prevent the entry of outsiders,” he said.

Both officials made it clear that a tough decision has been taken to ensure the safety of the people here.

Meanwhile, Mr. Agarwal said that stringent action would be taken against those who defy the orders.

139,2020/03/24,Online property registration to be extended across Karnataka in phases,"Revenue Minister R. Ashok on Monday told the Legislative Assembly that the system of online registration of properties would be extended to the entire State in a phased manner to mitigate corruption as well as the menace of touts in the offices of sub-registrars.

Replying to BJP member Kumaraswamy M.P. during Question Hour in the Assembly, Mr. Ashok said the online registration system, that has been introduced in some parts of the State, is yet to become popular. Nevertheless, such a system has helped in keeping touts at bay, he said. The online system has also helped in simplifying the process of registration, he said. In addition to this, the officials concerned at the sub-registrar offices have been strictly told to free their offices from touts, the Minister said.

Earlier, Congress member H.K. Patil suggested to the Minister to use the threat of COVID-19, that demands social distancing, to make online transactions mandatory in sub-registrar offices for at least the next three months.

Meanwhile, Mr. Ashok told the Assembly that the government would extend the deadline for submission of applications for regularisation of unauthorised constructions on government lands in rural areas under Section 94-C and 94-CC of the Land Revenue Act.

Responding to a demand from members cutting across party affiliations that the government extend the deadline, which is in about a week, the Minister said a final decision on the new deadline would be taken soon in consultation with the authorities concerned. He pointed out that already, the deadline had been extended nine times. But the legislators said the lockdown on account of COVID-19 had come in the way of people approaching government offices.

Participating in a debate on the Budget in the Assembly, Mr. Deshpande maintained that the Chief Minister, who also holds the Finance portfolio, was unlikely to be successful in mobilising such resources considering the adverse financial condition marked by global recession and the reduction in the State’s share of Central funds.

“The State has already lost out on Central funds to the extent of ₹11,887 crore, both in terms of loss of compensation towards GST and allocation by the 15th Finance Commission. I do not know how the Chief Minister will mobilise resources to take the budget size to such a huge level,” he said.

Pointing out that the economic slowdown had seriously impacted the economy, he predicted that the State was bound to see a shortfall in collection of its own tax revenue such as motor vehicle taxes, stamp paper duty and excise.

Mr. Deshpande also said the future was bleak as the 15th Finance Commission had reduced the State’s share of Central taxes. “In this context, what matters is not the size of the Budget, but its practicality. The Budget should be workable,” he maintained, urging the Chief Minister to come out with details of its implementation.

Expressing concern over the impact of the economic slowdown on small-scale industries and businesses, he urged the government to hold a meeting with nationalised banks as part of efforts to convince them to reschedule their loans from the short term to medium/long term.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/2hniv4/article31146199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGDESPANDEASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappas-budget-is-unrealistic-says-rv-deshpande/article31146200.ece

The trouble began when Speaker Vishveshwar Hegde Kageri, who had asked the JD(S) members to begin their discussion on the issue, remarked that going by the rules, they could not raise the issue under the clause which they had mentioned in their notice.

Referring to this, Law Minister J.C. Madhuswamy raised serious objection and said that in such a case, it would not be proper to allow discussion on the issue. The Speaker went by the advice of the Law Minister and withdrew the permission granted for discussion.

This angered the JD (S) members, who walked into the well of the House and began their dharna.

144,2020/03/24,"Innovation Bill could give protection to banned activities, says S.R. Patil","The Karnataka Innovation Authority Bill, 2020, which was passed in the Legislative Council on Monday, could end up providing greater scope for companies offering online games with money stakes and e-pharmacies that have been banned across India by the Delhi High Court.

Raising the issue, Leader of the Opposition in the Council S.R. Patil asked, “Why do you want to give legal protection to such companies? Families may be destroyed as the companies will be working for their profit.” He cited the example of Dream 11, a fantasy sports startup, which is termed India’s newest unicorn after raising $60 million from Steadview Capital, despite a recent ban on startups offering online games with money stakes. Mr. Patil, who once held the IT and BT portfolio, said that this could prove counter-productive. “There are enough examples of such cases. If you give legal shelter or protection, it is akin to supporting them. We should encourage startups productive to society.”

Citing another example, he said although e-pharmacies have been banned across India by the Delhi High Court, startups such as Netmeds, Medlife, 1mg and PharmEasy have been successful in raising investments ranging between $100 million and $200 million. “Why should the State do those things?

145,2020/03/24,Mysuru gets first full-fledged COVID-19 hospital,"Doctors doing private practice offer to help government in handling the emergency

151,2020/03/24,Vegetable lorries blocked at Walayar,"T.N. authorities refuse to let lorries re-enter State after dropping stock in Kerala

The blocking of trucks and mini lorries used for bringing vegetables to Kerala at the Walayar check-post, near here, on Tuesday caused tension for a few hours. The Tamil Nadu authorities refused to let the lorries re-enter the State after bringing vegetables to different parts of Kerala.

157,2020/03/24,Busting myths on COVID-19,"Social media replete with misinfo on the disease

The fuss about the invisible virus is something that many in the public are not able to understand. That is precisely the reason to be extra careful since one can never know where the virus is, Rajeev Jayadevan, president, Indian Medical Association, Kochi, has said.

Science has given knowledge about the highly contagious nature of the virus and how it is transmitted, but a number of myths about it are being spread through the social media. People often believe what is spread through social media without fact checking.

Starting with how the novel corona virus (SARS-nCOV-2) spreads, the disease (COVID-19) it causes, the prophylactic measures and treatment, social media spread many myths. It was important that the myths were busted continuously, said Dr. Jayadevan.

One of the misinformation circulated through the social media was wearing masks would keep the virus away and gargling would kill it. Hundreds of ‘tips’ on prophylactic measures too are spread, including consumption of Vitamin C tablets and garlic. The idea is to boost immunity. P.K. Sasidharan, Emeritus Professor in Family Medicine, Government Medical College, Kozhikode, says a balanced diet gives people immunity. While Vitamin C is very much part of the balanced diet, just taking these vitamin tablets will not make one immune to any disease and vitamin supplements should be taken as per a doctor’s advice. Including lemon or garlic in the diet was good as it was a mix of all the nutrients that ensured a balanced diet and better immunity, he said.

Doctors never recommended Vitamin C supplements unless there was a suspected or known deficiency of the nutrient, said Dr. Jayadevan.

Another myth among Malayalis was the virus could not harm them as they generally practised cleanliness. Social distancing and hand hygiene were the only ways to keep the virus away, said the medical professionals.

The general public had to behave the way doctors behaved in hospitals, said Dr. Jayadevan. Hand hygiene was a practice in every hospital that intended to keep antimicrobial resistance at the minimum.

The public should understand that virus spread with some reasonable contact with an infected person or when exposed to sneeze or cough by an infected person. Reasonable contact could be any time period when the two could have exchanged touch or touched the same surface when the virus was highly contagious. The contaminated hand became the source of infection when a healthy person touched his/her face without washing it.

Dr. Jayadevan said the use of alcohol should be limited to cleaning hands. Also, hot water baths had not been known to offer any protection from the disease. But drinking 2 to 2.5 litres of water a day was part of a balanced diet, said Dr. Sasidharan.

Newspapers

Getting newspapers at homes or buying commodities have not been known to transmit the virus, according to the Indian Medical Association, Kerala. This had been a major worry of many people who had sought the opinion of experts on virus transmission, said Dr. Jayadevan.

While people have also been anxious about the treatment available, world over there have been only small experiments with hydroxyl chloroquine. But social media is already flooded with the cure. “Since studies are still on, saying anything about it would be rather premature,” said Dr. Jayadevan.

According to a medical bulletin released by the Health Department at 7.45 p.m., a total of 4,105 persons who came from different countries, including the highly infected countries, have been placed under home quarantine in different parts of the district as on Tuesday.

This is besides the home quarantined 399 primary and secondary contacts of the infected persons admitted to the Pathanamthitta General Hospital. District Medical Officer A.L.

159,2020/03/24,14 new COVID-19 cases in State,"New cases include three contacts and one health-care personnel

Kerala reported 14 new COVID-19 cases on Tuesday. Importantly, the new cases reported include three contacts and one health-care personnel, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said.

There has been a steady spike in cases in the State since Friday, with the maximum number of cases being reported from Kasaragod. The total number of patients currently under treatment in the State is 105. One patient had been discharged earlier.

Of the 14 new cases, six are from Kasaragod, two from Kozhikode and one each from Thiruvananthapuram, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Kottayam, Palakkad and Malappuram.

Apart from the healthcare personnel and three contacts, eight persons had come from Dubai and one each from Qatar and the U.K.

Another 8,140 persons were added to the COVID-19 surveillance network in the State, taking the total number under surveillance to 72,460. Of these, 71,994 are under home quarantine, while 466 persons with mild symptoms are isolated in hospitals.

The Chief Minister said the situation in Kasaragod, which has 44 out of the 106 cases, was a matter of grave concern. It is possible that community transmission had happened here even though documented evidence was yet to surface, he said.

He said that given the fact that COVID-19 transmission was quite active in most of the States across the country, persons coming to Kerala from other States would have to undergo the mandatory 14-day quarantine as a precautionary measure. These persons would have to go into the special isolation facilities that the State government had created. Everyone would have to fall in line with the decision of the government, Mr. Vijayan said.

He said that quarantine essentially meant confining oneself, away from everyone, including family members, in a self-contained room, where sanitiser, mask and soap should be ensured.

If those asked to go into quarantine do not have these facilities at their own home, they could opt to move on to the quarantine facilities readied by the State government. Mr. Vijayan, asked the local bodies to engage volunteers at ward-level and ensure that all sections of society were taken care of.

The safety of doctors, nurses, paramedics, field-level health workers and cleaning staff, who had been working hard to care for patients was of paramount importance. The public should remember their sacrifices with gratitude, he said.

More COVID-19 testing facilities are coming up in institutions such as the Central University, NIMS Hospital and IISER.

Exclusive COVID-19 hospitals would be readied in every district. Maternity hospitals would not be disturbed.

Addressing representatives of media houses through videoconferencing here on Tuesday, a day after the government declared a Statewide lockdown, he said various departments were working in close coordination to keep the situation under control. The government machinery was well prepared to tackle an emergency situation, he said, adding that enough doctors, ventilators and ICU units had been mobilised.

The Chief Minister said the print and electronic media had a key role to play in relaying precise information on the status of the COVID-19 infections and creating awareness about the need for control measures.

Mr. Vijayan urged the media to counter fake news about the disease and check efforts to create panic by spreading misinformation. The government, he said, would ensure the smooth functioning of the media and mooted steps to sanitise the newspaper supply chain and the news gathering network to the extent possible.

Media representatives from Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Kozhikode who participated in the videoconference assured the Chief Minister of support in the drive against COVID-19.

They set out for the sea from a bustling harbour, but several deep-sea trawlers that returned to Neendakara on Tuesday had to dock under most unusual circumstances.

With auctions banned and a State-wide lockdown, many of them had to abandon their catch of export-quality shrimp after they failed to find any buyers.

“We waited for long, but no agent turned up. Usually we sell each crate for not less than ₹1,000, but on Tuesday we offered it for ₹100 and ₹200 to local vendors and the rest was dumped back into the sea. We were told about the restrictions on our way back, but we were definitely not prepared for this,” says Marty, a fisher.

Around 200 trawlers from Neendakara usually venture into the deep-sea prawn ground between Kollam and Alappuzha, mostly catering to processing plants and export companies. “There are hundreds of peelings sheds in Alappuzha, Ambalappuzha and Aroor, but Health officials asked to close them in connection with COVID-19 prevention. They are our major clients and it’s not easy for us to find another market,” he adds.

Boat owners say unlike traditional sector, it's not possible for deep-sea trawlers to operate without auctions. “The Fisheries Department now decides the price, but they cannot ensure buyers. We usually net 20 to 25 varieties of fish and most of them are export-oriented types with very limited demand in domestic market,” says Peter, a boat owner.

Equally distressed are the small-scale merchants and fish vendors who cannot make their regular trips to the harbour due to the lockdown. “There is no public transport and it's not possible for us to reach the market or supply it to our regular customers. Also, there are many restrictions for entering harbours and selling fish now,” says Sibi, a fish vendor.

Trawlers return to the harbour after spending several days in the sea at a stretch, each trip costing over ₹2 lakh. Since venturing into the sea during the lockdown can cause huge financial burden for them, the All Kerala Fishing Boat Operators Association has decided to suspend their operations till the crisis is over.

Around 4,000 boats from the mechanised sector in the State will stay off waters in the coming days as it's practically impossible for the boats to continue their trade under the current circumstances.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/severe-shock-to-trawlers-as-exports-slump/article31155670.ece
162,2020/03/24,MSMEs on the brink of a disaster,"COVID-19 leaves its impact on all aspects of business

Small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) engaged in churning out products as diversified as wall putty and paper plates to iron nails and tomato ketchup are tottering on the brink of a disaster.

The trail of devastation being left by the rapid spread of COVID-19 is such that a quick survey of the industry situation said it would take time between six and nine months to achieve some semblance of order once the pandemic is brought under control.

President of Kerala State Small Industries Association (KSSIA) M. Khalid said COVID-19 was leaving its impact on all aspects of business. Employee crunch due to health fears, fall in turnover and low inventory levels give little hope of quick recovery. Supply chain management is difficult, orders are unreliable and cash flow for MSMEs is about 30% of the previous levels, he said.

While KSSIA has a membership of around 9,000 MSMEs, it is estimated that there are around 1,50,000 micro, small and medium units that provide employment to about three million people directly and indirectly.

Considering the centrality of the MSMEs to the economy, the units have appealed for more time to meet their obligations on income-tax, GST, and bank loan repayments.

Joseph Paikada in Kannur, who is in the food processing business, said there was serious shortage of employees as well as raw materials. Both the factors caused by a sudden halt in transport triggered by the pandemic.

These new troubles are brewing quickly on the heels of two years of devastating floods in 2018 and 2019 as well as government ban on plastic products early in January this year, industry sources said.

MSMEs had been resilient and risen from disasters in the past, said Mr. Khalid but he expressed fear that the COVID-19 hit was nothing like before.

The pandemic is entering its second stage and “we appreciate the tremendous efforts” being made by the government and we pray that the government and people succeed in their efforts to contain the virus,” he added.

All the units surveyed showed that sale volumes had come down by about 65% in the wake of the viral disease fears. Acute disruption in activities caused by a near end to movement of goods across the State borders had brought down inventory levels. Units face serious problems in procuring raw materials as well as packaging materials.

Cash flow to the MSMEs is at 30% of the normal levels, a frightening situation for unit owners when considering payment of wages, interest on bank loans, and cost of utilities.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/msmes-on-the-brink-of-a-disaster/article31155332.ece
163,2020/03/24,COVID-19 casts a shadow over North Kuttanad paddy farmers,"Cultivation and procurement of paddy have come to a halt

The panic wave triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak in the State has cast a shadow over not just the trading community but the farmers as well.

With the State entering a lockdown mode this week, the cultivation and procurement of paddy in the North Kuttanad region have come to a halt.

Clueless

Faced with the prospects of a delayed procurement coupled with the threat of unseasonal showers, the farmers appear clueless on whether they will be able to sell their hard-earned produce in time.

A majority of the 150-odd harvesting machines in operation across the region were brought from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and with the lockdown in place, its operators have started returning to their native places.

At the same time, the inability of the farmers in arranging oil and related components due to the partial lockdown over the past one week has affected the operation of the remaining machines as well.

Lockdown

According to the farmers, the lockdown has come at the most inopportune time as cultivators in North Kuttanad are already under duress over a hard bargaining by the rice mills.

While the price fixed per kilo is ₹26.95, the millers are ready to purchase the paddy only with a concession of up to 4-11 kg per qunintal.

“This high volume of concession, sought under the guise of low quality of produce, is bleeding the farmers dry as they also require financing its cost of transportation. The government, at the same time, is not willing to compensate the losses though the farmers were charged an amount towards insuring the seeds at the start of the season,” pointed out Aby Ipe, district general secretary of the Farmers Congress.

The situation is particularly worse in the Kumarakom, Kaduthuruthy and Vaikom region where paddy in several thousand hectares was waiting to be harvested, he added.

As per estimates with the paddy marketing office of the Supplyco, the authorities have procured over 21,000 tonnes of paddy from about 7,000 hectares in Kottayam so far.

The agency has also approved a list of 24,000 farmers for procurement, being carried out through a network of 33 rice millers.

During the season, the farmers in Kottayam had cultivated the crop in about 16,000 hectares, spread across 450 clusters of paddy fields.

“The lockdown has severely affected the movement of men and machines and we are awaiting the instructions from the government to expedite the procurement process. Going by the current rates, we may be able to complete the proceedings only by the May-June period,” said Jijimol P. Kurian, paddy marketing officer, Supplyco Kottayam.

The official attributed the quality issues of the produce during the season to lack of rains during the sowing period.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/covid-19-casts-a-shadow-over-north-kuttanad-paddy-farmers/article31154919.ece
164,2020/03/24,COVID-19 | Kerala leads chorus for Central assistance,"For Central aid to tide over crisis triggered by COVID-19

Kerala is yet again set to take the lead in evolving consensus among Finance Ministers of other States to mount pressure on the Centre for wresting an assistance to tide over the crisis triggered by COVID-19.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac is learnt to have made preliminary arrangements for holding a conference of Finance Ministers for evolving a course of action to compel the Centre to share its available resources with the States that are reeling under an acute resource crunch.

A video conference of Ministers of non-BJP ruled States has been planned as a first step and back channel parleys of tax commissioners have also been mooted to work out the plan. This move is being contemplated in the face of the Centre’s lukewarm response to the repeated pleas for financial assistance.

Though the State government has made calibrated moves to ensure that the situation is not going out of hand, the surge in the number of quarantined families and also daily wage labourers, autorickshaw drivers, domestic workers and legions of such others who have been rendered unemployed following the lockdown is annoying the government.

The government has worked out a system to disburse the welfare pensions through the cooperative banks and provide loans to indigent sections through the Kudumbashree network. Still, there is a crying need to attend to the primary needs of a large number of people who do not figure in any of these networks and they cannot be left in the lurch, sources said.

Kerala is planning to replicate the movement launched at the behest of Dr. Isaac against the terms of reference of the 15th Union Finance Commission. A collective movement of non-BJP ruled States forced the Centre to come out with an explanation. Since all States are battling an acute paucity of funds, even the BJP-ruled States are likely to sympathise with the State’s demand to release the Goods and Services Tax compensation arrears as well as other dues from the Centre. A final picture would emerge within the next three or four days, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ox2ert/article31116736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAKERALAFILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-again-takes-lead-in-forming-pressure-group/article31154686.ece
165,2020/03/24,Bypolls likely to be held in May or June,"COVID-19 outbreak delays schedule

If Kerala succeeds in containing the COVID-19 outbreak in two months, byelections to Kuttanad and Chavara constituencies will be held in May or June.

The original scheme of the Election Commission of India (ECI) was to hold the bypolls in April along with the byelections in States such as Madhya Pradesh. The office of the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) was also prepared for the poll process. However, the outbreak of the pandemic has upset the plans, Teeka Ram Meena, CEO, Kerala, told The Hindu.

The groundwork for holding the two bypolls simultaneously has been completed. The voters' lists have been revised and the polling stations in the two constituencies were all found in good condition. Enough number of Electronic Voting Machines were also available.

However, the plans went awry following the spread of COVID-19. A situation has emerged in Kerala which is not conducive for holding the elections in April. The ECI has accepted the suggestion of the CEO not to hold the bypolls at this stage, he said.

Govt. consulted

Mr. Meena said he had informally consulted the State government before arriving at the decision as most of the senior officials, including the District Electoral Officers and Superintend of Police, are preoccupied with the virus control measures.

The outcome of the two bypolls will not be of much significance to the ruling LDF government as it is well-seated in the 140-member-strong State Assembly. However, the elections, which come at the fag end of the term of the government, will be viewed as the semifinal round of contests and a test dose on the popularity of the LDF government led by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan.

The constituencies

The bypolls were warranted following the deaths of Thomas Chandy and N. Vijayan Pillai, the sitting MLAs of Kuttanad and Chavara respectively.

Election rules mandate that the bypolls shall be conducted within six months of the Assembly seats falling vacant. As Thomas Chandy died on December 20, 2020, election has to be held before June 2020.

In case of Chavara, the MLA passed away on March 8 and elections will have to be held before September 2020. Usually, the Election Commission holds bypolls only when a period of one year is left for the Assembly to complete its five-year term.

If the election in Chavara is held along with Kuttanad in May, it will pass the one-year period test. If delayed, much time would not be left for the legislator as the next round of Assembly polls will have to be conducted before May 2021, Mr. Meena pointed out.

If the election is held in June, only 11 months will be left for the completion of the term of the current Assembly and the new legislator will fall one month short of the statutory one year period. In such a situation, the Election Commission of India will have to take a final call, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bypolls-likely-to-be-held-in-may-or-june/article31154433.ece
166,2020/03/24,Coronavirus | Passenger arrested for noncooperation with health officials at Kochi airport,"He refused to forms undertaking to go on a 14-day mandatory self-quarantine and also declined to wear a mask, said a health official

A 54-year-old man created a ruckus at the domestic arrival terminal of the Cochin International Airport on Monday night after he declined to cooperate with the health officials on duty and verbally abused them.

The Nedumbassery police arrested him on a complaint lodged by a doctor on duty and registered a case invoking IPC Sections 294 (b) (sings, recites or utters any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place) and 506 (criminal intimidation). Later, he was released on bail.

The man, a resident of Elamkulam, had come from Chennai by a Spice Jet flight at 9.25 p.m. “He was asked to fill and sign two forms undertaking to go on a 14-day mandatory home quarantine applicable to those coming from outside the State. He, however, flew off the handle saying that he was fed up off signing affidavits. He also declined to wear the face mask despite the terminal being crowded with arrival of multiple flights. In fact, he threw away the mask given to him and had a go at the health officials. We have no idea why he acted the way he did,” said a health official on duty at that time.

The passenger also declined to maintain the queue creating discomfort for the majority of passengers who were complying with all instructions.

“The team on duty at that time checked in at 2 p.m. and was relieved only today on 10 a.m. We are polite with all the passengers despite the immense stress and risk under which we are working. Such incidents will affect the morale of health officials,” the official said.

The medical team then alerted the police who took him into custody by which time the passenger had calmed down and was even apologetic.

People in home quarantine who fail to comply with protocol will be subjected to penal action and will be shifted to government quarantine facilities.

This was part a 13-point charter of restrictions and regulations that came into force in Ernakulam district since Monday midnight shortly after district Collector S. Suhas clamped Section 144 in the district. Section 144 was imposed as part of the State-wide lockdown declared by the Kerala government till this month-end to check the spread of COVID-19.

Shops dealing in essential items such as groceries, will be functional only between 7 a.m. and 5 p.m. though medical shops have been exempted. All other shops and establishments should remain closed during the period. Banks and other financial institutions will be allowed to function only up to 2 p.m.

Only shops dealing in essential goods will be permitted in malls, which should not switch on the centralised air conditioning system at any cost.

No bus services

Public transport, including KSRTC and private buses, will stay off the road. However, the supply of petrol and cooking gas will continue uninterrupted. Government offices should function with minimum staff strength without affecting their operations.

No public gathering will be permissible in places of worship, and should be restricted to basic unavoidable rituals alone. Hotels can continue takeaway services but at no cost should let people have food inside.

All gatherings in excess of five people remain banned. People should not assemble or venture out unless for unavoidable reasons in which case they should maintain safe social distance. People coming from outside the State should undergo mandatory quarantine and should never break the protocol.

Mandatory 14-day quarantine for travellers

Foreigners and those who have travelled from abroad after March 10 should inform the police. They will be arrested if they do not undergo self quarantine for 14 days or fail to inform the health authorities.

Autorickshaw, taxi and online cabs could be availed only on medical grounds or for transporting essential items alone. Private vehicles should not have more than one person other than the driver and must be used only for transportation of essential goods and for other essential services.

Those found violating the restrictions will be slapped with charges under IPC Section 269, 188 etc.

In view of the severe financial crisis triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak, Jose K Mani, MP, has urged the union government to announce a special package to address the situation .

“An unprecedented situation created by the outbreak warrants a total lockdown of states, giving exclusion to essential services. This will further worsen the financial situation in the country, which has already been passing through one of its worst ever financial crisis,” he said.

According to him, farmers and daily wage workers are the worst affected by the crisis. He also requested the State government to take urgent measures to counter the situation emerging in the wake of a total lockdown. People are wary about an impending scarcity of essential commodities.

“There is no doubt that closing the inter-state borders and bringing restrictions on cross border traffic will definitely affect the arrival of essential commodities. Government should initiate urgent steps to prevent black-marketing and hoarding of essential commodities.

Moreover, the Civil Supplies Department should come up with mobile super markets to avoid the extraordinary rush in super markets and grocery stores. The authorities can also use boats for operating such mobile stores in areas like Kuttanad,” added Mr.Mani.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/special-package-needed-in-view-of-covid-19-outbreak-jose-k-mani/article31148928.ece

Kasaragod MLA N.A. Nellikkunnu, who is on a self-imposed home quarantine after coming into contact with a COVID-19 patient, has written to the Chief Minister, raising various demands in the context of the rise in number of COVID-19 positive cases in the district.

Maintaining that most samples were being sent for testing to the virology lab in Alappuzha, Mr. Nellikunnu demanded that similar facilities be set up in Kannur and Kasaragod district to immediately identify cases. With more COVID-19 cases being reported in Kasaragod, he stressed the need for deploying more doctors and paramedical staff in the district. He also demanded that the authorities provide additional ambulances and convert the General Hospital into a COVID-19 centre. Mr. Nellikkunnu said the government should take over private hospitals for treatment of COVID-19 patients.

The MLA was livid that certain individuals returning from abroad were disinclined to follow government instructions to prevent the spread of the disease. “They should be put under compulsory isolation for 14 days. Hotels and lodges should be taken over for the purpose,” he said. Mr. Nellikkunnu pointed out that the people of Mogral Puthur panchayat were a worried lot after a resident of Eriyal was diagnosed with COVID-19. He demanded that a separate medical team be deployed in the panchayat. He also suggested the establishment of swab collection centres at all community health centres and primary health centres in the district.

175,2020/03/24,Prohibitory Orders bring life to standstill in Kasaragod,"Sufficient supply of food and essential materials; shops to remain open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., says Collector

Life came to a standstill in Kasaragod district on Monday after the District Magistrate imposed prohibition orders invoking Section 144 of the CrPC.

The orders were issued following advice by the Centre to the State government to lockdown districts which had witnessed an outbreak of COVID-19. Since the outbreak of the disease in China, several people returning from the Gulf have tested positive and the district saw a jump in cases with 19 persons undergoing treatment so far. While 825 persons are in home quarantine, 61 are under isolation in hospital and other facilities arranged here.

Following the prohibition imposed from 9 p.m. on Sunday, stringent measures were taken by the district administration. The magistrate prohibited public transport services, opening of institutes, commercial shops, except for those selling essential products, malls, complexes, barber shops, and beauty parlours.

People were prohibited from gathering in one place, unnecessary travel to public places, religious institutions and places, clubs, cinemas, parks, beaches and other entertainment centres.

However, on Monday, defying the orders, a few people came out on to the road in private vehicles. But District Collector D. Sajith Babu, who is also the District Magistrate, reviewed the situation and was on the road warning the people of the consequences of defying the orders. He said there would be no leniency towards anyone who disobeyed the order and strict action would be taken against them.

The Collector said that people need not panic. There would be sufficient supply of food and essential materials, he said, and added that vehicles carrying essential materials would be allowed and shops would remain open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The people should not congregate in one place, he said.

However, the sudden lockdown baffled the people who were seen thronging shops to purchase essentials.

Health department officials, with the support of the police, had to use force to disperse the people as they did not follow the direction to keep the stipulated distance and use sanitisers.

Meanwhile, the Hosdurg police registered a case against two persons on charge of violating the orders and opening shops before the stipulated time. Five autorickshaws were also seized during the day. The district administration also blocked the Kannur-Kasaragod road by putting up barricades at the border area to restrict the entry of people and vehicles. The barricades were placed on the national highway at Kalikadavu in Kasaragod. Except vehicles bringing essential commodities to the district and a few buses to Kannur, no other vehicles were allowed through.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/prohibitory-orders-bring-life-to-standstill-in-kasaragod/article31147131.ece

Following a 55% drop in sales in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the Malabar Regional Milk Producers Union (MRMPU) has decided to consider some temporary regulations in the collection of milk from various dairy cooperative societies in northern Kerala districts.

On Tuesday, the union affiliated to the Kerala Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma) will not collect milk from 1,100 dairy cooperative societies in the Malabar region to temporarily manage the situation. The MRMPU management said the existing stock was enough to meet the demand for the next three days and continuation of collection would not be profitable.

K.S. Mani, chairman, MRMPU, said it would only be a temporary arrangement and was not meant to trouble dairy farmers.

“We will check the possibility of increasing the milk powder production in the days to come with the support of processing plants outside the State. However, it will be successful only with the cooperation of inter-State truck operators and factories,” he told The Hindu.

Mr. Mani said the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in districts such as Kasaragod and Kannur had turned out to be a big challenge to continuing the sales.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dmtjr6/article31147083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24-KI-SMSTREET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/milma-not-to-procure-milk-in-malabar-today/article31147085.ece
177,2020/03/24,Kannur District Panchayat budget lays stress on agriculture,"Income estimated to be ₹144.39 cr., expenditure ₹136.21 cr., and surplus ₹8.18 cr.

The Kannur District Panchayat presented its budget for the year 2020-21 with its focus on the agriculture sector, here on Monday.

District Panchayat Vice President P.P. Divya presented the budget with an estimated income of ₹144.39 crore, an expenditure of ₹136.21 crore and a surplus of ₹8.18 crore.

The budget includes comprehensive plans to modernise agriculture and increase the productivity and quality. Several crores of rupees have been earmarked for agriculture alone, Ms. Divya said.

To directly sell the agriculture produce without any interference by middlemen, the budget has allocated ₹25 lakh for setting a vegetable mall. The budget also envisages setting up weekly markets at district and taluk centres, she said.

The budget has set apart ₹10 lakh for the distribution and protection of fruit tree seedlings and ₹15 lakh for setting up a calf park for providing cows, poultry birds and calves to farmers. The park would help farmers reduce their dependence on other States for purchasing cows for dairy and buffaloes for meat. In addition, ₹10 lakh has been allotted for setting up GoShree Clubs for distributing calves and lambs to students to develop their knowledge and interests in animal husbandry.

For cooperative fish farming societies, ₹30 has been allocated to set up live fish markets. Likewise, ₹10 lakh has been allocated for setting up a duckling nursery in Peringome and Vayakara grama panchayats. Similarly, to raise Kommeri goats under the supervision of farm officers, ₹10 lakh has been allocated for the implementation of the Little Lamp Programme for farmers, she said.

For treating animals, a mobile ambulatory service would be started.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kannur-district-panchayat-budget-lays-stress-on-agriculture/article31147069.ece
178,2020/03/24,Taxis and autos only for essential services,"Total ban on casual travel

The State government has clamped down on travel. Citizens could hail autorickshaws and online taxi services only to pick up essential provisions or medicines or other emergencies.

Chief Secretary Tom Jose said in an order that the State had imposed a total ban on casual travel. The State has banned inter-State, inter-district, and intra-district transport services.

The government has allowed private vehicles to ply as usual. However, only two persons, including the driver, could travel in a car. And those passengers should have pressing reason to take to the roads.

The State has closed down on all commercial establishments except banks and ATMs, print and electronic media, telecom, postal and internet service, supply chain and transport of essential commodities, delivery of essential goods, including food and beverages.

Provision stores, meat and poultry stalls, milk vendors, vegetable, fish and fruit shops could transact business between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. The government has also allowed hotels and clubs to operate food and beverage take-away counters.

Security tightened

The police have announced tight security measures in view of the lockdown announced in the State from Tuesday. The police will be out in force on the streets from 5 a.m., State Police Chief Loknath Behera said.

179,2020/03/24,95 confirmed cases as 28 more test positive,"A public health emergency: Pinarayi

Kerala on Monday reported nearly double the number of COVID-19 cases that it reported yesterday, leading the State government to go in for a total lockdown of the State, to restrict the movement of people and to reduce virus transmissibility.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, briefing the media, said the government was taking unprecedented measures as the State was up against a possible public health emergency, the consequences of which could be unpredictable.

The State is recording confirmed COVID-19 cases in double digits for the past three days, with 15 cases reported on Sunday.

On Monday, 28 new positive cases of COVID-19 surfaced in the State, taking the total number of cases reported in Kerala since January to 95. Mr. Vijayan said of the 28 new cases, 25 were people who had returned from Dubai. Nineteen of the cases were in Kasaragod, five in Kannur, two in Ernakulam, and one each in Pathanamthitta and Thrissur. Unconfirmed reports late in the night said two more had tested positive in Kozhikode.

5,025 under surveillance

On Monday, 5,025 persons more were added to the surveillance network, taking the total number under surveillance to 64,320. Of these, 383 were in isolation in hospitals and the rest on home quarantine.

The number of cases has shown a sudden spike in the past three days, but the authorities were able to link each one of these cases to its source.

Though there has been much hue and cry that the State could go into the next stage of the epidemic, when one should expect community transmission (cases surfacing in the community with no apparent link to any particular source), so far there has been no evidence to either support or discard the theory of community transmission.

With every new case being an imported case, many public health experts expect that the case numbers will soon stabilise, once the international flights are grounded and no more persons are coming from abroad.

Follow quarantine

The Chief Minister said those on home quarantine would not be allowed to violate the quarantine norms and move about freely. The government would seek the help of mobile service providers to track the persons playing truant and the community would be asked to keep an eye on these persons. The government would supply food to those families on home quarantine, who required food.

In every district, separate COVID-19 hospitals would be set up by the Health Department with the assistance of district administration.

Mr. Vijayan said as the domestic flights were also being grounded, anyone now coming into the State would have to go into the separate isolation facilities identified by the Health Department and district administration. People coming to Kerala from other States would also be put on a 14-day quarantine.

He said all those who had come back from abroad or after attending Umra should necessarily inform the district administration.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/95-confirmed-cases-as-28-more-test-positive/article31146861.ece

182,2020/03/24,"Siblings defy home quarantine, fly back to UK","Case against the brother-sister duo

Siblings from the U.K., who were put under home quarantine as per the COVID-19 guidelines, flew back on the sly much to the chagrin of the health officials at North Paravur, Ernakulam.

The police have registered a case against the brother and sister at the directive of the District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural) K. Karthik.

The duo arrived from the U.K. on March 13 and were asked by the health authorities to remain on mandatory quarantine for 14 days at their home at Peruvaram in North Paravur.

They had no apparent symptoms but were asked to be in quarantine in keeping with the prevailing protocol of putting everyone coming from abroad on mandatory 14-day quarantine.

Phone contact

“They gave us a landline number and we were in constant contact with them since then till March 20. However, in between, they could not be contacted for a day. When contact was restored, we asked them where they were and they said they flew to Mumbai for a day for an emergency. But they did not share many details. We promptly informed North Paravur police about the violation of the protocol,” said a health inspector attached to Paravur municipality. However, on Sunday evening health authorities came to know that the duo had left for the U.K. on March 21 morning with three more days left for the quarantine period to end. “Only, an aged woman, a relative of the duo, lives in the house and all she knew was that they had left,” the health inspector said.

North Paravur police said they had contacted the duo on March 13 and 17. The intelligence officials contacted them on March 20 after health authorities alerted them about the violation of the quarantine protocol.

Health officials said that while there were many who were exemplary in their conduct and even volunteered to go on self-quarantine there were some others who kept sabotaging the hard-fought battle to ‘break the chain’ by giving scant regard to the instructions.

North Paravur municipality has 107 people on home quarantine since March 8 and some of them have completed the quarantine period since then.

Coercive measures

“People are aware of their rights but conveniently forget their responsibilities. Some of them keep questioning the need for quarantine without symptoms and break it. We have to employ even coercive measures of threatening to slap cases on them to make them fall in line besides creating awareness of the need to comply with the protocol for the good of society,” said K.S. Jayan, Station House Officer, North Paravur.

False alert

On the other hand, police also receive panic-stricken false alerts about people breaking quarantine like a recent one received by Maradu police. “We were alerted that a fellow put on quarantine was roaming around. But when we checked, it emerged that the poor man has been just to his portico,” said C. Vinod, inspector, Maradu.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/siblings-defy-home-quarantine-fly-back-to-uk/article31146805.ece
183,2020/03/24,"As COVID-19 cases rise, Kerala put under lockdown","Borders sealed, inter-district travel banned

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday put Kerala on lockdown until March 31 following a spike in the COVID-19 caseload.

The State will seal its borders and prevent inter-district travel. It has halted KSRTC and private bus services. Autorickshaws and taxis could ferry one person at a time. There is no restriction on the use of private vehicles.

However, the government urged people to work from home and remain indoors as far as possible. They should travel only if necessary and that too minimally.

The government has empowered district Collectors to prevent more than five persons from assembling in public if required.

In Kasaragod, the epicentre of the outbreak in Kerala, Mr. Vijayan said the police would arrest any person who ventured out of their homes without a pressing reason. The district is on a total shutdown since Saturday following an uptick in COVID-19 infections.

Mr. Vijayan said people in Kasaragod should venture out of their homes only in the event of a dire emergency or to procure essentials.

He suspended most non-essential services and said only vital business should remain open from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. In Kasaragod the timings are between 11 a.m. and 5 p.m.

Essential services

The services deemed essential by the government included medical shops, provision and grocery stores, milk, vegetable and fruit stores, fuel pumps, cooking gas suppliers, restaurants with takeout or delivery services, delivery of newspapers and liquor outlets.

(The government has banned the sale of liquor only in Kasaragod).

The Chief Minister said the government could not ignore social realities and the dangers posed by a total clampdown on liquor. The government would not allow people to socialise inside bars but would permit such businesses to operate takeaway counters to mitigate the rush at Bevco outlets.

Mr. Vijayan said Chief Minister of Punjab Amarinder Singh had included “beverages” in the list of essential items when he locked down his State to contain the outbreak. Mr. Vijayan said he had ordered Bevco to impose social distancing norms at its outlets and premium counters strictly. “There was a heavy rush for buying liquor on Monday due to the close down on Sunday,” he noted.

The Chief Minister said the government was weighing how to reduce queues at liquor outlets as part of its measure to curb the contagion.

The government would set up special camps to provide for migrant labourers who had lost work and wages due to the outbreak. It would strictly monitor persons in isolation, and the police would track their cellphone locations to know if they had jumped quarantine.

There would be no interruption in power or water supply and other essential government services. Only crucial staff need to turn up at government offices. Others should remain on standby at their homes for rapid deployment when required.

The government asked the Reserve Bank of India to sanitise currency notes and coins in widespread circulation.

Mr. Vijayan said agents of micro-financing agencies should desist from collecting debts and bothering defaulters till June.

He had met with traders and urged them to ensure sufficient stocks and not to hike prices or hoard supplies.

The Chief Minister also suggested that traders create online platforms collectively to receive orders from the public and engage persons with personal protective gear and vehicles to deliver the goods to customers at their homes.

He said banks could transact business only till 2 p.m. The government reckoned dissemination of news an essential service. He would confer with heads of media institutions on Tuesday.

He said without forceful intervention, the epidemic situation could worsen and overwhelm the State’s finite health resources. The government was marching in lockstep with the Centre and the people to prevent the community spread of the disease. “The government is in front of you as a shield,” he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/xgi7fk/article31148362.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23KRAKERALA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lockdown-in-state-with-spike-in-covid-19-cases/article31146791.ece
184,2020/03/24,State eyeing liberal Central assistance,"Urgently needs ₹15,000 crore to pay welfare pension, procurement arrears: Isaac

The State government is looking forward to a benevolent Central assistance and permission for more fiscal leeway for mobilising resources to fund the emergency triggered by COVID-19 spread.

The government machinery is being toned up to go on an overdrive in the week ahead for door delivery of rice, grocery, medicines and other essentials on demand.

Cash requirements of those rendered jobless upon being constrained to stay at home to check the community spread of the virus need to be met. Already the government has announced a stimulus package of ₹20,000 crore and is currently mopping up resources from all available sources for implementing the package. Still, the paucity of resources is impeding the government’s welfare measures.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac told The Hindu that the State urgently needed ₹15,000 crore to wipe out the welfare pension arrears and also the dues to be paid for paddy procurement, rubber subsidy and such others.

“While demanding the people to stay at home, we have to meet their basic requirements. The State government has taken the first step and has announced a package, but given the gravity of the crisis, the State needs more funds and the Centre should heed the demands flagged by the government,” Dr. Isaac says.

GST arrears sought

The State has asked the Centre to immediately clear the Goods and Services Tax compensation arrears to the tune of ₹3,000 crore and also enhance the annual borrowing limit from 3 to 3.5% in the current financial year. It would offer a great relief to the government, especially in expediting the welfare measures proposed following the virus outbreak.

Dr. Isaac’s letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman on Tuesday last listing all these requirements has not elicited any response so far. The State was seriously planning to avail 50% of the borrowing limit in April and May to meet the immediate needs, but that would make the going tough in the months ahead. The only option is a Central assistance to cushion the impact of the crisis, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-eyeing-liberal-central-assistance/article31146740.ece
185,2020/03/24,11 held for jumping home quarantine,"Priest arrested for conducting Mass with 100-odd devotees in Chalakudy

The police on Monday registered cases against 11 persons in Wayanad district for skipping the 14-day home quarantine made mandatory for those returning from abroad as part of the precautions against COVID-19. The police seized their passport and served notices after registering cases against them under sections of the Indian Penal Code, Kerala Police Act, and the Kerala Public Health Act.

Among them were two persons from Vengara in Malappuram, who rented a room at a resort at Meppadi in the district after they reached Kozhikode from Qatar on March 15. Though they were asked to go on home quarantine at the airport, they skipped it and stayed at the resort without revealing their identity, the police said. The police quarantined them at the resort along with four others.

Likewise, a five-member team from Kannur stayed at a resort at Ambalavayal in the district on Sunday jumping quarantine. They reached Kozhikode airport on Sunday morning and rented the room by noon.

They told the police that they had stayed with a COVID-19 positive person in Dubai and feared that the disease might be transmitted to their family, if they went home directly.

They were transferred to an isolation facility in Kannur in an ambulance. The police also registered cases against four others, two each under Mananthavady and Panamaram police station limits, for ignoring the directives regarding home quarantine.

Priest arrested

Fr. Pauly Padayatti, who conducted a Mass with 100-odd devotees at the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Koodappuzha, near Chalakudy, was arrested on Monday. A case was registered against the devotees for attending the Mass violating the government instructions to avoid gathering on a large scale.

187,2020/03/24,"Man stabbed to death in Ooty town, possibly due to social distancing quarrel","The victim is said to have asked the perpetrator to stand a safe distance away, as a measure to to prevent the spread of COVID-19, at a tea shop

A 35-year-old man died after he was stabbed with a knife by a 23-year-old man, allegedly in a quarrel over ensuring social distancing to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Police officials identified the deceased as R. Jothimani, 35, a resident of Nondimedu in Udhagamandalam. They said Jothimani, who is married and has two children, worked at the Ooty Municipal Market loading and unload vegetables from vegetable trucks.

On Tuesday afternoon, he had come to have tea at a tea stall located just behind the market complex. People who were at the tea stall when the incident occurred, including the owner of the store, said that Jothimani was eating some snacks at the stall when the accused, identified as N. Devdas, 23, a resident of Palakkad, came to the shop.

They said that Jothimani asked Devdas to stand at a safe distance away from him as he was fearful of the spread of COVID-19, leading to a quarrel between the two men. In the resulting quarrel, Jothimani allegedly tried to slap Devdas, leading to the accused picking up a knife that had been kept at the shop and stabbing Jothimani with it.

Jothimani died on the spot and the entire incident happened along a busy public road in the heart of Udhagamandalam town, leading to huge crowds congregating around the tea stall where the incident occurred.

Police rushed to the spot and managed to apprehend Devdas. A case of murder has been registered.

Nilgiris district superintendent of police, V. Sasi Mohan, said that the quarrel had arisen between the two men resulting in the murder, but said that it was unclear whether a dispute over ensuring social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 had resulted in the murder.

“Preliminary inquiries indicate that Jothimani had taken offence to Devdas standing too close to him at the tea shop resulting in the quarrel, which then led to a fight and the resulting murder,” said Mr. Sasi Mohan.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ecm2ih/article31153597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MARTH--OOOTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/man-stabbed-to-death-in-ooty-town-possibly-due-to-social-distancing-quarrel/article31153598.ece

Theni Collector M. Pallavi Baldev, on Monday, appealed to 73 persons who had returned from abroad to quarantine themselves at home for two to four weeks as a precautionary measure. The list is taken by getting details from airports, the ports of entry in India. The persons have to remain within their homes for the next 14 to 28 days.

On availability of essential commodities in view of the curfew coming into force from 6 p.m. of Tuesday, the Collector said people need not resort to panic buying as all essential commodities such as milk, vegetables and medicines would be available. Only non-essential facilities such as cinema houses, hotels, restaurants and supermarkets would be shut.

Two admitted to GRH

Two persons aged between 21 and 24 years from Sivaganga district, with symptoms of fever and cough for the past two days, have been referred to Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai.

Sivaganga GH authorities said the two had been working in a private firm in Erode and had come home on Saturday. After preliminary diagnosis, they were sent by an ‘108’ ambulance to the Madurai hospital.

Dindigul

Corporation Commissioner Sendil Murugan said that as a precautionary measure, all big textile and electronics outlets and chain stores in Dindigul had been asked to down shutters. Conservancy workers had been disinfecting bus stands, markets and public toilets, besides removing garbage from residential areas.

Madurai

The Public Health department has formed separate teams in the district to track and monitor people who have arrived from COVID-19 affected countries and are currently quarantined at home for 28 days.

Deputy Director of Health P. Priya Raj said that on Monday evening, officials pasted stickers in front of houses where people have been home quarantined. “Every home quarantined person will be monitored by a team of officials from revenue, health and police department every day. They will regularly monitor for 28 days and ensure that they stayed indoors,” she said.

Till Monday, 439 people had been home quarantined in Madurai.

193,2020/03/24,All T.N. courts to function,"Only urgent cases to be taken up

The Madras High Court on Monday decided that its principal seat in Chennai, a Bench in Madurai as well as all trial courts across the State will continue to function despite the proposed imposition of prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure from 6 p.m. on Tuesday to contain the spread of COVID-19.

The decision was taken by the Administrative Committee, comprising Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justices Vineet Kothari, R. Subbiah, M. Sathyanarayanan, N. Kirubakaran, M.M. Sundresh and T.S. Sivagnanam. It was made clear that the proceedings shall be restricted to extremely urgent cases for next three weeks.

According to a circular issued by Registrar General (R-G) C. Kumarappan, the High Court shall function with two Division Benches (one for hearing civil cases and the other for criminal cases) and five Single Benches (three on the criminal side and two on the civil side) from Tuesday, and they would take up cases that require immediate attention.

Appeal to lawyers

A request was made to the lawyers to exercise their discretion and restrict filing of cases as far as possible. They were also asked not to operate from the chambers allotted to them inside the High Court campus and desist from inviting their clients to the court campus unless and otherwise the court concerned had ordered for their appearance in connection with a case. Impressing upon the need for curtailing the presence of the court staff too, the Administrative Committee directed the R-G to take a call on rotating the employees on need basis.

It was ordered that personal secretaries, drivers, residential assistants, office assistants and other personal staff of individual judges should make themselves available. A similar arrangement was ordered in the Madurai Bench too.

As far as the functioning of subordinate courts in the State was concerned, the R-G issued a separate circular stating that they should also confine their functioning to extremely urgent cases. The Principal District Judges and the Chief Judge of Puducherry were instructed to ensure strict compliance.

The Principal District Judges were asked to ensure minimum presence of staff. “All subordinate courts are put on guard that their activities are likely to be viewed and monitored through video conferencing by High Court,” the circular said.

Staff disappointed

Several employees of the High Court expressed disappointment over its decision to continue the functioning of all courts across the State, despite a representation made by Tamil Nadu Advocate Association (TNAA), led by senior counsel S. Prabakaran, to suspend court proceedings until COVID-19 threat abates.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5y2zqh/article31094558.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THMADRASHIGHCOURTVG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/all-tn-courts-to-function/article31146706.ece
194,2020/03/24,Lessons from a pandemic: It’s OK to be smart,"It probably began in the East and crossed borders and oceans, as it devastated several countries till it reached Rome. The only thing that spread faster than the contagion was the fear and the rumours. People were terror-stricken. Doctors were clueless. Government officials vacillated and losses mounted. Travel was crippled. Festivals, gatherings, sporting events—all cancelled. The economy plunged. Bodies piled up. The world was bewildered.

I am, of course, referring to the Antonine Plague of 165 CE, a global pandemic with a mortality rate of 2-3%. It also began with flu-like symptoms until it escalated and became a catastrophe of unbelievable proportions, in which over 15 million people eventually died.

“Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it” – George Santayana

I was confronted with these words as I walked into the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz in 2004 and they have continued to haunt me ever since.

History repeats.

The whole world is in the grip of the coronavirus now. The pandemic started in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and has spread insidiously world over. Coronaviruses have been identified over 60 years ago as one of the agents which cause the annoying common cold. There are 4 types of the beta-coronavirus family which can cause the disease. But, like the influenza virus, it has the uncanny ability to mutate often.

The first such instance of a dangerous mutation was in 2002, the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak from Hong Kong, which afflicted over 8,000 people and resulted in around 800 dead (a mortality of 10%). It is believed to have originated in bats, which are, incidentally, asymptomatic and transmitted via civet cats to humans. The second catastrophe was the mutation resulting in MERS (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome), which originated again from bats, and affected humans through an intermediate host, the dromedary camels, in Saudi Arabia. By last counts, there have been around 2,500 cases with over 750 deaths (a mortality of 35%).

The current outbreak is again due to a mutated coronavirus labelled by WHO as SARS-CoV-2, which is believed to have originated from bats in a live animal and sea-food market in Wuhan, and infected man through an intermediary host (? pangolin). The virus has the ability to infect lung cells through a receptor known as ACE-2, leading to complications of pneumonia and respiratory failure. COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has affected over 150 countries, 3,00,000 people with over 13,000 deaths. In India, 476 infections have been identified with nine deaths.

How does the virus spread?

The virus spreads through respiratory droplets of an infected person. It could directly spread through inhalation of droplets when you are within a metre of a coughing patient, but more often, it is by touching inanimate objects contaminated by these droplets and taking our hands near our nose and mouth. This essentially means that if we are at least a metre away from anyone, and wash our hands frequently, it is highly unlikely that we would be infected. This is the rationale behind the concept of social / physical distancing. Even though the virus can survive for substantial periods on inanimate objects (a day on cardboard and 2-3 days on plastic and steel, under ideal conditions), it dies on drying.

What are the symptoms?

The symptoms of COVID-19, the common cold, and the flu are akin to each other. The symptoms start with a low grade fever followed by a sore throat and body pain. Nausea and diarrhoea may then occur with worsening throat pain, malaise and joint pains. Severe body pain with nausea, high grade fever and diarrhoea may follow. Breathlessness may occur with severe cough after a week. One needs to consider visiting a hospital only when there is high grade fever and difficulty in breathing.

What are the complications of COVID-19?

Almost 80% of people may not require hospitalization. Around 20% may require admission and oxygen support. About 5% of infected people end up in ICU on a ventilator. The risk of complications is higher in the elderly (over 60yrs of age), diabetics and persons with co-morbidities like uncontrolled hypertension, lung disease, liver or kidney disease and an immune-suppressed status. The case fatality rate is around 2%, but can be as high as 15% in persons over the age of 80. This is because of weakening immunity with age. In some situations, the immune system fights back aggressively, goes berserk and causes more damage. This damaging overreaction is called a ‘cytokine storm’ and can lead to multi-organ failure and death.

Experts, however, believe that the mortality may be lower than 1% in the general population. Surprisingly, the infections have been very mild in young children, but they seem to spread the virus for longer. Pregnant women have also not shown features of severe infection.

Will the coming of summer help in stopping the pandemic?

The concept of seasonality for viral infections, especially the flu, is based on evidence and experience from the west. This has been extrapolated to other viruses which may die when exposed to the heat and humidity. The incidence of flu wanes in the summer in the West because most of transmission in winter occurs indoors, where people stay in close quarters to escape from the cold outside. When summer arrives, they start moving out and lack of proximity causes the flu to die down. In tropical countries, the flu is prevalent throughout the year with outbreaks happening even in the peak of summer. In Chennai, people tend to venture out less in summer and the ambient temperature and humidity indoors can cause the infection to be transmitted, even though it may die more readily outside.

Is there a role of Vitamin C or other food supplements in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19?

At present there is no scientific evidence to recommend Vitamin C or any other food supplements specifically to improve immunity or to protect against COVID-19.

What should every citizen of India do to help control this pandemic?

Since this infection spreads by respiratory droplets, the only way to block transmission is by physical distancing. This means all of us have to avoid crowds and stay at home.

Avoid any kind of travel – international or domestic

Avoid visiting any public spaces like schools, gyms, cultural and social centres, swimming pools, theatres and museums

Avoid restaurants, clubs and bars and pubs

Keep all commercial activity at a distance of one metre between customers. Those that cannot guarantee this distance must close. Places of worship can remain open as long as they can guarantee this distance

Limit hospital visits

Postpone work meetings. Encourage work from home

All sports events and competitions, public or private should be cancelled

Any gathering of over 10 persons should be deferred

What do I do if I have sore throat or fever?

Since most infections are mild, the current recommendations are to stay at home under isolation and take only symptomatic treatment with Paracetamol. Contact your doctor or hospital only if the fever is high or if difficulty in breathing ensues.

How do I quarantine myself at home?

Stay in a well-ventilated single-room preferably with an attached / separate toilet. If another family member needs to stay in the same room, it is advisable to maintain a distance of at least 1 meter between the two.

Stay away from elderly people, pregnant women, children and persons with co-morbidities within the household.

Under no circumstances should one attend any social /religious gathering e.g. wedding, condolences, etc.

Wash hands often with soap and water or with alcohol – based hand rub.

Avoid sharing household items e.g. dishes, drinking glasses, cups, eating utensils, towels, bedding, or other items with other people at home.

Wear a disposable surgical mask at all times, if symptomatic. The mask should be changed every 6-8 hours and disposed of. Disposable masks are never to be reused.

Use disposable gloves and surgical mask when cleaning surfaces or handling soiled linen.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces in the isolated person’s room (e.g. bed frames, tables etc.) daily with 1% Sodium Hypochlorite solution.

What is the treatment modality?

At present, there are no recommendations for a specific treatment. Therapy is only symptomatic. A cocktail of drugs including Azithromycin, Chloroquine or HCQS (hydroxychloroquine) and Lopinavir may be tried. There is no scientific evidence to start Chloroquine prophylaxis for healthy persons. It may be over a year before a vaccine is available to combat COVID-19.

“Never let a good crisis go to waste” said Churchill.

The risks of doing nothing are greater at this point, which is why we must use this pandemic as an opportunity to learn. We have to act quickly and decisively. We should revisit our practices of yore and re-educate ourselves. Maybe we should begin with not spitting in public places, washing our hands more often, and improving personal hygiene. We need to instil personal and societal responsibility for our actions.

As a doctor, I would strongly encourage people to place their trust in the science of medicine and put to rest the spreading baseless conspiracy theories and rumours. The media should play a responsible role in presenting facts based on scientific evidence. In my opinion, the government should unite with private healthcare providers and global bodies to ensure optimal healthcare delivery during a crisis of this proportion.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/f9r1ae/article31146630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THRAMSUBRAMANIAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/lessons-from-a-pandemic-its-ok-to-be-smart/article31146631.ece
195,2020/03/24,Tamil Nadu announces lockdown from 6 p.m. today,"District borders to be sealed, prohibitory orders issued

In an all-out effort to battle COVID-19, Tamil Nadu will face a lockdown from 6 p.m. on Tuesday to 6 a.m. on April 1, with prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC in place and all district borders closed. The State invoked provisions of Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 to impose the restrictions.

The Puducherry Cabinet too recommended a lockdown from 9 p.m. on Monday to March 31.

Click here for the detailed notification from Tamil Nadu government

The lockdown announced by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in the Assembly was followed by a detailed notification from Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam in the evening. “People are required to stay at home and come out only for accessing basic and essential services, strictly follow social distancing norms and maintain a distance of 1m or 3 feet. Any congregation of more than five persons in public places is prohibited,” he said.

The Chief Minister said all shops and commercial establishments would remain closed except those selling provisions, milk, vegetables, meat and fish. Pharmacies too were exempt. He said that the Centre had sent out an advisory to combat COVID-19 in many districts of the country. Except essential transport services, public and private transport, omnibuses, autos and taxis would not be allowed to ply. “All transportation, except for essential commute (and transportation of goods), between States and districts has been banned,” he said. There is no bar on the use of personal vehicles.

Mr. Palaniswami said that government offices, other than those dealing with essential services, would not function. The Chief Minister announced that Amma Unavagams would continue to feed thousands of workers. Only takeaway would be allowed in restaurants but delivery services like Swiggy and Zomato would not operate.

“We hope this notification will help control the spread of COVID-19. Police have been instructed to ensure that prohibitory orders are implemented,” the Chief Secretary told The Hindu.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xseffp/article31146571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24PG1Whats-allowedcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-announces-lockdown-from-6-pm-today/article31146572.ece
196,2020/03/24,Assembly all set for a record session today,"It will pass demands for grants to 27 departments, beating 2004 feat

Tuesday’s session of the 15th Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly will create a record of sorts, as the House is expected to pass demands for grants to a total of 27 government departments in a single day.

This will beat the feat it had achieved in 2004, when it passed demands for grants to 24 departments in one day.

Soon after the Business Advisory Committee, chaired by Speaker P. Dhanapal, decided on Monday to wind up the already re-scheduled Assembly session within a day, instructions were swiftly passed on from the Assembly Secretariat to the 27 departments concerned, asking them to submit their respective policy notes before 4 p.m. on Monday.

The Business Advisory Committee decided to wind up the session early, soon after Opposition legislators belonging to the DMK, the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League announced a boycott of the session in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

“So far, policy notes from 20 departments have come in. We will receive policy notes from other departments soon,” an official said on Monday.

As per the Practice and Procedure of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly (Serial number 34 on financial business), “whenever demand is moved by the Minister, he will lay the policy notes before the Assembly”.

Similar routine

Though the demands of 27 departments would be taken up on Tuesday, there wouldn’t be much of a change to the routine.

“The House proceedings would be the same as when three to four departments are clubbed together in one day. Instead of three to four departments, there would be 27 departments,” he said.

Just like during any other day, the Ministers concerned would move their respective demands, and legislators would get to speak on the demands for all 27 departments, which would be passed by voice vote at the end of the day.

Tuesday would mark the first time in over 15 years that demands from a large number of departments are passed in the House.

In one go, the demands of 24 departments were passed by the House on July 31, 2004, during the erstwhile AIADMK regime, when Jayalalithaa was the Chief Minister and C. Ponnaiyan (currently vice-chairperson of the State Planning Commission) was the Finance Minister.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/assembly-all-set-for-a-record-session-today/article31146415.ece
197,2020/03/24,DMK-led Oppn. boycotts Assembly session,"‘Debating now won’t be in public interest when social distancing is key’

Legislators belonging to Opposition parties including the DMK, the Congress and the IUML launched a boycott of the Assembly session on Monday, in protest against the government’s decision to continue the proceedings despite the COVID-19 outbreak.

DMK president M.K. Stalin justified the boycott, saying legislators had to be with the people of their respective constituencies, who were living in constant fear of the pandemic.

Later in the day, it was decided that the session should be concluded by Tuesday instead of March 31.

In a letter to Assembly Speaker P. Dhanapal, Mr. Stalin said the boycott would draw the government’s attention to the need for taking preventive and precautionary measures to tackle COVID-19.

Recalling Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar’s tweet that 9 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu so far, Mr. Stalin said 9 persons had tested positive in 12 days, and 8,950 persons had been quarantined.

""This has created doubts about whether we are wasting the golden hour to combat the disease,” he said.

The DMK leader pointed out that the Centre had already cancelled examinations in schools and had directed only 50% of the B and C category employees to report for work.

Pointing out that three districts — Chennai, Kancheepuram and Erode — in Tamil Nadu had been included in the list of districts to be locked down as per the advisory of the Centre, Mr. Stalin said debating in the Assembly would not be in the interest of the people when the entire world had decided that [social] distancing was very important.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dmk-led-oppn-boycotts-assembly-session/article31146332.ece

199,2020/03/24,‘Foreign returnees who arrived after Mar. 1 must self-quarantine’,"They will be monitored by officials of various departments and the police: govt.

As part of the lockdown in Tamil Nadu to combat COVID-19, the State government on Monday mandated “all suspected cases and foreign returnees who arrived after March 1 to remain under strict home quarantine for such period as decided by local health authorities”. They will be monitored on a daily basis by the officials of the district administration, the revenue department and the local bodies, as well as the police and health authorities.

During the lockdown period – from 6 p.m. on March 24 to 6 a.m. April 1 – the officials of the district administration and departments including the police, fire and rescue services, medical and public health, and jails, courts and local administration, will continue to function.

A government notification said all teachers and staff of educational institutions shall work from home till March 31, 2020, except where conduct of examinations/evaluation is required. “This, however, will not apply to Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University, the Medical Wing of Annamalai University and all (government, private, self-financing and deemed universities) medical, dental and nursing colleges, and these institutions will continue to function,” it added.

The government mandated IT and ITES companies to ensure employees work from home. Where it is not feasible to do so, units dealing with critical and essential services will continue to operate, taking all protective measures, it clarified.

Manufacturing units engaged in the production of essential commodities, agricultural commodities, agricultural inputs and food items, and wholesalers and retailers of such items, would be allowed to function with a limited workforce. As for the construction industry, only those involved in emergent construction work would be allowed to operate. “But salaries of the workers should not be deducted,” the CM said in the Assembly.

A government notification said all industries that are permitted to operate shall work at 50% of their strength on a rotation basis, and the same shall apply to export units and SEZs.

The following categories of transport would be allowed: ambulances; vehicles/cabs owned or contracted by companies under exempted categories for transportation of staff to workplace and back; all goods carriers (trucks, tempos, container trailers etc.); taxis to and fro from airport and from hospitals to home; hearse/funeral service vehicles; and government vehicles engaged in essential services/duties.

“Shops under exempted categories shall ensure there is no crowding at any given time, and that customers maintain social distancing of three feet between each other. The premises shall be cleaned and disinfected three times a day. They shall also ensure that sanitisers are provided at the entrance to all customers,” the government said.

Residents’ welfare associations should take necessary steps for social distancing and maintaining essential services. If any violation is found, the same shall be flagged with local bodies/local health authority by the president/secretary of RWAs. Only marriages already fixed on or before March 16 in wedding halls can be conducted, subject to a maximum of 30 guests. The halls must return the advance paid by the people for all cancelled bookings.

Departments of the Secretariat, key government departments, the police, fire & rescue services, courts, district administration, electricity and metro water, water supply, sewerage, local bodies, hospitals and all health-related establishments, treasuries, ration shops, Aavin and milk unions, and Amma canteens with adequate social distancing, have been exempted from the restrictions.

200,2020/03/24,Textile workers demand leave with pay,"Labour union says many small units had asked employees to come on ‘janata curfew’

Alleging that some of the textile units had asked employees to report for work even on Sunday when the ‘Janata Curfew’ was in place, the Tamil Nadu Textile and Common Labour Union (TTCU) urged the government to ensure that all the units provided leave for employees with pay until March 31.

S. Thivya Rakini, president, TTCU, said that her organisation received reports from Coimbatore, Tirupur, Dindigul and Madurai districts that some garment units, particularly smaller ones, asked their workers to come for work on Sunday.

“A number of such units had told the workers that they had to come for work till March 31 as well,” she said. Though the companies may be forced to close down due to the imposition of Section 144 in the State from Tuesday evening, she said that there was no certainty on whether these workers would be paid during the closure.

S. Selva Gomathi, managing trustee, Justice Shivraj V. Patil Foundation, which works with women garment workers, said that many of the smaller garment units did not even have the concept of paid weekly holidays. “In such a situation it is unlikely that they will be willing to pay during the closure,” she said.

Highlighting that a considerable number of women workers were single mothers, she said that their families will be the worst affected. “The government must also ensure job security of these women as we are looking at a possible economic slowdown,” she said.

Ms. Thivya Rakini said that though major textile associations have announced closure, they have not clearly indicated whether the workers will be paid. “Instead of appealing to the companies, the government must instruct them to provide salaries,” she said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/textile-workers-demand-leave-with-pay/article31146247.ece

In a statement, Dr. Anbumani said while a curfew has to be imposed, the State government has to provide financial package to those would lose their livelihood during the shutdown.

“Kerala government has announced a package of ₹20,000 crore — which includes ration products for a month, two months assistance for destitute and senior citizens and other financial help. In Andhra Pradesh, Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy has announced ₹1,000 to all poor families along with ration products for a month. Even in Tamil Nadu, extra rice should be provided along with free rice that we already provide and ₹3,000 upfront and weekly ₹3,000 to compensate for livelihood loss,” he said.

Mr. Haasan appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to quickly announce a financial package through the ‘Economic Response Task Force’.

“The Economic Response Task Force should take into account the lives of the people in the unorganised sector and act accordingly. Economists are saying that tax breaks, loan waivers and subsidy are necessary in this time. These will help the industrialists and formal sector employees.

202,2020/03/24,A tribute to Visu: How Lakshmi was the moral centre of ‘Samsaram Adhu Minsaram’,"What revisiting ‘Samsaram Adhu Minsaram’ tells us about its protagonist, Uma (played by Lakshmi), and about Visu’s contribution to middle-class narratives

“You cannot choose your family,” says a character in the Academy Award-winning movie Parasite. However, the Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda — who has a fetish for writing heartwarming family dramas — put a fantastic spin on this, steering clear of the perceived ideals of a ‘family’ with his gorgeously-shot Shoplifters, wherein the lead characters were given the liberty to pick and choose their family members, resulting in a spectrum of characters and an affecting drama.

Long before Kore-eda’s Shoplifters, there was Visu’s Samsaram Adhu Minsaram whose individual characters — Ammaiyappan Mudaliar, Godavari, Chidambaram, Uma, Siva and Kannamma — seemed to have been deported from Visu’s own universe, to deliver a larger point on familial values without romanticising the social conditions in which they live. What we got was a heightened drama and an intimate portrait of the family system, in the form of Samsaram Adhu Minsaram.

Any art, if viewed under the purview of today’s modern lenses, may appear stale and ‘problematic’. But what is particularly striking about Samsaram Adhu Minsaram, even after all these years, is the amount of sensitivity that went into fleshing out Lakshmi’s Uma. Now, let us not get into the progressive/regressive debate and analyse the existence of Lakshmi within the film’s context. Samsaram Adhu Minsaram, essentially, is an ego clash between Ammaiyappan and Mr Chidambaram. But the protagonist is neither of them, but Uma. She is the moral centre of the film’s universe and is the binding force that ties the family structure together. She is the nucleus of Samsaram Adhu Minsaram and the rest of the characters are treated as protons and neutrons, orbiting around Uma. Where Visu’s genius as a scriptwriter comes into play is the way he designed Uma’s character, which triggers a cause and effect for other characters.

One great shot

You must have a fair knowledge on the Godavari’s line of control, which was drawn following a dispute between Ammaiyappan and Mr Chidambaram, on the pretext of returning ₹18,000 that the latter borrowed from the former for his daughter’s marriage. Ammaiyappan asked a simple question: “Don’t you know of the Ammaiyappan who pledged his gratuity savings for your security deposit?...” But Chidambaram’s reply was a resounding “no”.

Chidambaram realises his cocky attitude towards his father and the conflict is resolved in the end. But Samsaram Adhu Minsaram, I apologise for saying this, is dead meat without its brilliantly-staged climatic bit, shouldered by a terrific Lakshmi (it is sad that she never got her due and was relegated to playing mother characters). She could have well been awarded ‘fatafat’ Lakshmi for the key takeaways she espouses in the climax.

Also Read Visu, a colossus

Up till this point, Visu’s screenplay plays to the conventions of what Kodambakkam expects. But here is where Samsaram Adhu Minsaram subverts its own tropes and ends up being slightly more than a message-heavy movie. With Uma making loud and uproarious statements, taking on every member of the family, Visu destroyed Tamil cinema’s practice of upholding the sentiments of the joint family. Therefore, in that single sequence, Visu gave one of the greatest lessons on a) the price you pay, if you cross borders and b) that it is important to draw a boundary and give each other their own space, even in a family.

Messiah to the middle-class

This, I guess, was Visu’s biggest achievement — something even the ‘auteur’ directors failed to achieve. Of course, this isn’t to denigrate the works of other filmmakers. Hear me out: nobody spoke to the middle-class like how a Visu movie did. And it is safe to say that no other filmmaker came remotely close to depicting the travails of the working class and their typical ‘middle-class’ mentality the way Visu did — it ain’t limited to Samsaram Adhu Minsaram, but all his creations including the gloriously-underrated Simla Special.

In that sense, Visu did more to the bourgeois than Karl Marx himself. An ideal example of this ‘middle-class’ mentality would be the scene where Ammaiyappan almost demands that Godavari prepare four varieties of bajjis, in addition to kesari and Peaberry coffee. This is casually slipped in as a form of comical relief. But if you dig deeper, it shows the unbearable sadness of the working class — a sect that exploits the matchmaking ceremony as a gateway to rejoice in simple pleasures of life, like drinking Peaberry coffee or asking for an extra scoop of kesari. Having grown up in an extended family himself, Visu understood the dynamics, power structure and politics of a joint family. He brought the bourgeois out of their cocoon and gave them comfort through movies, even if it were for fleeting durations.

There is a LOL stretch in Samsaram Adhu Minsaram where Ammaiyappan describes each of the characters in the opening act. He reserves a cheeky remark for his youngest son, Bharathi, saying, “Ivan 12th ezhuthinan...ezhuthinan...ezhuthirkan and ezhuthuvan (he wrote, has written and will write).”

Who would have thought that this seemingly witty jibe would eventually become Visu’s own legacy with a slight modulation, of course? As long as the middle class exists, Visu will live on.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pong2g/article31154294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ayyappan-4,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/samsaram-adhu-minsaram-tribute-piece/article31154295.ece
203,2020/03/24,This doctor uses Coronavirus quarantine time to make ‘Carantine’ videos,"Dr Jagdish Chaturvedi, an ENT surgeon based in Bengaluru, discusses why he reaches out to the public via comedy and his new medico-humour web series ‘Starting Troubles’

So many good doctors and medical professionals have emerged as frontline warriors in the global effort to push back against the deadly Coronavirus.

Sitting inside a parked car somewhere in one of Bengaluru’s many bylanes, Dr Jagdish Chaturvedi was confident that this war ought to be fought on multiple fronts. In India, one of these fights would be the containment of fake news and misinformation.

As the pandemic situation evolved and death tolls climbed, Jagdish whipped out his mobile phone and recorded short videos from his car, quelling rumours and putting down scientifically incorrect suggestions. He uploads these “Carantine videos” on his YouTube channel for over 1.26 lakh subscribers to watch. From quirky word play spun into a monologue interspersed with abundant comedy to out-of-rhythm rap videos, Jagdish keeps at it.

“There are two types of people in our country. There is the compliant population who are well-read, aware, diligent and interested to make things happen. Then there is the ignorant population who happen to be the larger majority,” says the multi-faceted Jagdish, who wears the many hats of an ENT surgeon, medical device innovator and entrepreneur, author, and stand-up comic.

For Jagdish, the troubling aspect of an explanatory video was that it wouldn’t be shared among the so-called ignorant populace, that routinely forwards ridiculous WhatsApp messages.

“Controversial content gets lot of shares and engagement. If I shoot the content sitting in my hospital chamber and talking about Coronavirus, people won’t share it thinking ‘Why do I need to bore or scare someone or spoil their day?’ When it is comedy, they think ‘I want my friend to look at it’,” he adds.

A new perspective

While he continues to shoot and engage with his subscribers on YouTube, Jagdish also debuted a web series last month. Titled Starting Troubles, the six-episode series stars Renuka Shahane, Kurush Deboo, Parikshit Sahni and others besides Jagdish. It is based off a book he authored Inventing Medical Devices: A Perspective from India.

The brains behind 18 medical devices (a portable ENT endoscope with a digicam attached being one) Jagdish, in his book, details how he was nudged towards medtech by his seniors. “I wrote the book with the purpose to encourage more doctors to become innovators,” he says.

There was, however, one small problem. Much like the WhatsApp populace, younger doctors in this generation need encouragement to pick up a book (aside academics) and read.

“A friend of mine, Dr Shweta Malik, told me that youngsters do not read books. Also the creative types, they are offbeat. They may not be readers and that is where the thought of taking things off the book came about,” he says, adding, “[Shweta] suggested we turn the contents of the book into a short film or web series or a documentary. The moulding and encouragement for doctors to become innovators has to happen in their MBBS days because once their career gets going, it is hard to make that break.”

Starting Troubles features a doctor in training who wants to be an entrepreneur, and balances work with his passion for acting. But his actions get him suspended from his course and banned from the theatre community. What happens thereafter is the plot.

The story is similar to Jagdish’s own experience growing up. He used to be in theatre, and this experience is what he attributes for his effortless ability to deliver monologues in his YouTube content and standup comedy gigs. When he could no longer attend theatre rehearsals, as he was required to be at the hospital where he was training, he was ousted from the community.

He filled this vacuum theatre left in his life with stand up comedy. “What we have shown in the web series are real life anecdotes,” he says.

Convincing senior artistes to come on board, surprisingly, was less of a task for Jagdish. “I wanted someone elegant and powerful to play my boss Dr Ravi Nayar on screen. Now I’m an ’80s kid and I grew up watching Surabhi. I thought what if we reached out to Renuka Shahane. We didn’t have a phone number and only an email. We didn’t really expect a reply, you know, we were amateurs with little budget trying to film something in a few days. But it was courteous of her to read the script and she came on board saying she wanted to support the concept. She was happy to play a doctor which had actual medical terms in the dialogues,” he adds.

Hooking doctors

The six episodes of Starting Troubles stream on HiiiH, a startup medtech portal founded by Jagdish.

He hopes Starting Troubles will draw medical students to the portal, which can then be used as a platform to explore sponsors and services to fund innovation.

“Medtech and health care revolves around doctors. Today, what is happening is that the innovation happens without the involvement of doctors. Our ecosystem is also immature with only a few hundred medical startups in place. It is this core problem we want to address via HiiiH,” says Jagdish.

With a dedicated team of seven people including for marketing and technical sections, HiiiH, in Jagdish’s words, is like a “speed dating platform”. At the moment, there are about 150 consultants signed up on HiiiH offering a range of services to medical innovators in order to successfully help set up a company.

“In India, we still import 80% of our medical devices which is the reason why cost for treatment is high. Ours is a mature import market but we export 60% of what we develop, and so there is less know how of the needs and process,” he adds.

What drives him to explore such solutions, whether it is to mitigate issues around healthcare or making “Carantine videos”, has to do with Jagdish’s own character trait of being impatient. “I’m attracted to things that can be done quickly and which leave an impact. But my perspective as a doctor is different. I’m very patient with my patients,” he concludes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/64n1ca/article31153233.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPJagdish-3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/this-doctor-uses-coronavirus-quarantine-time-to-make-carantine-videos/article31153235.ece
204,2020/03/24,Coronavirus: Netflix India to reduce traffic on telecom networks to manage congestion,"On Monday, Amazon Prime Video also said that it had begun efforts to reduce streaming bitrates in India

Streaming giant Netflix on Tuesday said it will reduce traffic on telecommunications networks by 25 per cent while maintaining the quality of service for users in India, as part of its efforts to help mitigate network congestion amid the coronavirus pandemic.

Companies like Amazon Prime Video are also temporarily lowering bit rates —a measure of how much data is being transferred — to ease pressure on telecom network infrastructure.

Consumption of digital content has gone up manifold as people are forced to stay indoors as almost the entire country is under lockdown to contain the spread of the deadly COVID-19.

“Given the crisis, we’ve developed a way to reduce Netflix’s traffic on telecommunications networks by 25 per cent while also maintaining the quality of our service. So consumers should continue to get the quality that comes with their plan: whether it’s Ultra-High, High or Standard Definition,” Netflix VP Content Delivery Ken Florance said in an emailed statement.

He added this will provide significant relief to congested networks, and the measure will be deployed in India for the next 30 days.

The company, which has over 167 million users globally, has already undertaken similar measures in Europe. It doesn’t provide country-specific subscriber numbers.

Netflix typically has many different streams for a single title within each resolution. This action would result in removal of the highest bandwidth streams, and so, subscribers will continue to have access to the service they have paid for (Ultra-High Definition, High Definition or Standard Definition) depending on the device they use.

In India, Netflix has a significant number of subscribers on the Mobile Plan which is Standard Definition.

Amazon Prime Video on Monday also said it has begun efforts to reduce streaming bitrates in India. Bitrate usually determines the size and quality of video and audio files. Higher bitrate indicates better quality.

The Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI) had written to the government urging issuance of instructions to streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and others to initiate measures that will ease pressure on network infrastructure, which is needed for “critical” functions at this juncture.

“We support the need for careful management of telecom services to ensure they can handle the increased internet demand with so many people now at home full-time due to COVID-19...In India, we’ve already begun the effort to reduce streaming bitrates whilst maintaining a quality streaming experience for our customers,” an Amazon Prime Video spokesperson had said.

A Hotstar spokesperson had said said the company’s video streaming is based on adaptive bitrate streaming, which ensures that it is “lean” in internet consumption. However, the company said it is “prepared to reduce the bitrate for our HD streams, should the need arise”.

205,2020/03/24,Telugu actors urge viewers to break the COVID-19 chain,"Telugu stars step up the COVID-19 awareness drive through brief videos in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Family Welfare and Health, Telangana

The Indian Institute of Family Welfare and Health, Telangana, has come up with a series of COVID-19 awareness videos, to urge citizens to follow precautionary measures with all seriousness.

Telugu film actors Rana Daggubati, Lakshmi Manchu, P Navdeep, Eesha Rebba, Adivi Sesh, Nikhil Siddhartha, Niharika Konidela, Rahul Ravindran and Sudheer Babu are among those who’ve featured in this campaign.

The video messages posted on Twitter by these actors and on Instagram (@IIHFW Telangana) highlight the multiple aspects one needs to follow in the lockdown period — stay at home, step out only if absolutely necessary, and ensure enhanced hygiene.

Navdeep calls this period a test of our compassion, and urges viewers to give their domestic staff paid holidays so that they too can stay home, safe.

Adivi Sesh focuses on why the young, who think they have higher immunity levels and are invincible, should also stay at home and not unwittingly become carriers of COVID-29 and thereby put children and elderly at home at risk.

The IIHFW Instagram account also has suggestions on how to spend the lockdown period creatively, without giving in to boredom — write a poem, learn something new, listen to music, watch movies or read, but definitely stay home to break the chain, and say no to visitors.

Actor, singer and Broadway star Aaron Tveit has tested positive for COVID-19. The 36-year-old actor, who took to social media to share his diagnosis, said he is feeling much better now.

“I’m feeling much better. I consider myself extremely lucky that my symptoms have been very mild —cold like with no fever —as so many are experiencing much more serious symptoms, because this is a very dangerous virus,” Tveit wrote on Instagram.

The actor said he had been quarantined since Broadway shows shut down on March 12 amid the pandemic.

One thing I have been experiencing is the loss of taste and smell, which I think is a big sign for people who are otherwise asymptotic, he added.

Tveit said he was tested earlier last week and found out the results this Monday, but had quarantined himself even before he went through the medical procedure. “This can affect anyone and even if you aren’t feeling sick or showing drastic symptoms — please take heed, stay safe, stay healthy and I hope to see everyone at the theater again soon,” he said.

Tveit is known for the roles of Gabe in Next to Normal, Frank Abagnale Jr. in the stage version of Catch Me If You Can, and as Christian in Moulin Rouge! The Musical on Broadway. He is also known for his recurring role as Tripp van der Bilt on The CW’s teen drama series Gossip Girl, and other shows like Graceland and Grease Live.

Tveit joins a growing list of celebrities that have tested positive for coronavirus, including Idris Elba, Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, Kevin Durant, former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko, “Frozen 2” actor Rachel Matthews, Daniel Dae Kim, “Game of Thrones” star Kristofer Hivju, veteran Opera singer Placido Domingo and celebrated TV host Andy Cohen.

207,2020/03/24,"Survey says that Indian film buffs would still go to cinema theatres, despite coronavirus scare","28% see no reason to stay away; 72% would exercise caution due to pandemic

A section of the Indian population is still not serious about the COVID-19 pandemic despite the growing number of cases each day, according to an ongoing study of the impact of the outbreak on movie hall-going behaviour.

At least 28% of regular film-goers still see no reason to stay away from movie theatres, if they were hypothetically open and a film they wanted to watch was showing, said the study, conducted by Mumbai-based media consulting firm, Ormax Media.

The study, titled 'Impact of COVID-19 Outbreak on Theatre-Going Behaviour in India' is being conducted across 80 cities in the Hindi-Tamil-Telugu film industry zones with a sample size of 1,200 committed film-goers every week. In view of the situation, which is changing each day, Ormax is conducting the study every three days and coming up with the findings twice a week.

The fifth in the series of surveys, conducted between March 19 and 22, shows that 72% of the country’s film buffs would stay away from theatres till the threat of the novel coronavirus reduced.

It does show a rise from 58% in the March 16-18 poll but not as much as one would have expected. The figure stood at 33% in the poll conducted between March 12 and 15, 26% in the one conducted between March 9 and 11 and 23% between March 6 and 8.

At least 75% of viewers in the Hindi-speaking markets have said they will stay away as opposed to 57% in the previous poll and 39%, 28% and 26% in the ones before that.

In the South, the rise was a lot less this time, with 67% saying they will stay away as against 58%, 30%, 21% and 17% in the previous polls.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/59j7j0/article31146980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMCOVID-col,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/survey-says-that-indian-film-buffs-would-still-go-to-cinema-theatres-despite-coronavirus-scare/article31146981.ece
208,2020/03/24,Distribution of rice to white card holders from Thursday,"Adequate funds ensured for Health and Police departments, says CM

The distribution of free rice and release of ₹ 1,500 to white card holders for loss of work on account of lockdown during the current spell of coronavirus will begin on Thursday.

The money will be deposited directly in the bank accounts of card holders to avoid middlemen, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao told a media conference on Tuesday.

He warned slapping of Preventive Detention Act against hoarders of vegetables and essential commodities and seizure and cancellation of their licences if the activity continued. The State had surplus in production of vegetables by 3 lakh tonnes, yet there were reports of increase in their prices.

Mr. Rao also warned that the petrol bunks may have to be closed if people continued to violate restrictions on movement and moved out freely. The government had restricted their movement up to three kms from their houses as all essential commodities and consumer items were available within this range. But, people needlessly travelled longer distances as though they were free.

Insisting that the State ran into a huge financial loss on account of the lockdown, he said it was ensured that there was no dearth of funds to Health and Police departments to enforce the decisions of government on dealing with coronavirus. The firm steps initiated by government will not stop if people tried to put a spanner in the wheels.

He appealed to poets to educate people on the need to strengthen the hands of government through their writings. He expressed regret that public representatives did not join the efforts of government in confining people to their homes or checking the price rise. There were over 10 lakh members of standing committees of rural and urban local bodies who could coordinate with the police.

He also asked all the 150 corporators in Hyderabad, ministers, MPs and MLAs to jump into action.

210,2020/03/24,7 p.m. to 6 a.m. is curfew time in TS: KCR,"Shopkeepers told to wind up by 6 p.m.

Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that it was curfew time in Telangana from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. everyday and no mercy will be shown to anyone coming on to the roads during these hours.

He warned shopkeepers, including vegetable vendors, to wind up sharp by 6 p.m. as a delay of even one minute will not be tolerated. This was an emergency situation to combat coronavirus which required tough measures, Mr. Rao told a media conference after a high-level meeting to review the status of virus in the State. The meeting was followed by a video conference with district Collectors and Superintendents of Police to brief them about the decisions of the meeting.

At the media conference, Mr. Rao said the restrictions on the movement and crowding of people during day time will continue to prevent infections. The permitted activities, however, were agriculture and dairy farming, works under National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme and ongoing irrigation projects. Workers at the camps of project sites will be made to scatter out and the whole area sanitised.

He said agriculture was being permitted without people coming in close contact because there was standing crop over 50 lakh acres. When the harvesting took place, he asked farmers not to bring the produce to agricultural market yards for sale as the government will procure the stocks in villages at minimum support price. The money will be credited to farmers accounts.

He asked people not to invite a situation where the government was forced to impose 24-hour curfew, issue shoot at sight orders or deploy the army if they did not heed to the restrictions.

The government had seized the passports of foreign returnees who were in home quarantine on arrival in the State. They should not face the risk of seeing their passports suspended if they jumped the quarantine. In this context, he referred to a person who escaped from quarantine thrice.

Mr. Rao said the threat of virus spreading in the State through foreign returnees had ceased with the last incoming domestic flight on Tuesday. The focus has now shifted to checking the spread through local transmission.

The State had 35 positive cases of coronavirus which will all ease out by April 7 as none of them were serious. As many as 19,313 persons were under surveillance and there were 114 suspected cases, including 82 foreign returnees. The results of 32 persons who were suspected to have contracted the virus locally will be known on Wednesday.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/7-pm-to-6-am-is-curfew-time-in-ts-kcr/article31156053.ece
211,2020/03/24,Nurses and paramedical staff on way to hospital assaulted by Suryapet police,"At least 25 nurses and paramedical staff of the Suryapet General Hospital protested the high-handedness of the town police, who allegedly resorted to beating up a few of them when they were on their way to duty on Tuesday.

The group of nurses along with their support staff stood outside the hospital, demanding action and solutions to their everyday problems. According to one of the victims, she was being dropped by her husband in the motorcycle for Tuesday morning duty and a police official wielded his baton on them.

Another senior nurse of the hospital Padma, also alleged that a sub-inspector rank official resorted to beating her and the person who was accompanying her to the workplace.

Refuse to listen

“We leave our families behind and the police resort to such violence. They don’t even listen when we produce our identity cards,” one of them said.

The aggrieved persons also said that the police were asking them to go on foot, rather than being dropped by family members. “If they are so concerned about containing the infection, why not the authorities arrange pick & drop facility for health staff?” the paramedic staff said.

Suryapet police, speaking to The Hindu, however said the whole issue was being blown out of proportion. “There were no nurses involved when the incident took place. The husband of a nurse claimed that he belonged to the Health Department, did not produce the identity when demanded and was rude with field police officials,” the police said. Superintendent of Police R. Bhaskaran later held a tele-conference with officials, and instructed officials on guidelines in conducting the lockdown efficiently.

“Proving the identity of personnel involved in essential services is a must, and officials should not behave in a harsh or rude manner.

214,2020/03/24,COVID-19 | Second day of lockdown in Hyerabad peaceful barring sporadic incidents,"Considerable fall in number of private vehicles on the road

The second day of the lockdown imposed in the State to check the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) was peaceful barring stray incidents.

People remained largely indoors and few vehicles were seen on the roads. All the major thoroughfares in the city as well as other major urban centres across the State wore a desolate look throughout the day. Hospitals and related medical establishments as well as medical shops continued to function as usual while closure of major chunk of other establishments continued.

Incidents of some enthusiastic youngsters trying to venture into the streets observed on Monday were reduced considerably on Tuesday. The decision of the police to seize the vehicles including carriers like autorickshaws and private cars and bikes paid off as there was considerable decline in the number of people venturing on to the arterial roads.

An impressive feature of Tuesday’s lockdown was the villages erecting barricades of different forms barring entry of visitors into their places and preventing the residents from going outside.

In Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao’s own words, the situation was largely under control but the government had decided to impose curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. to prevent people from coming out of their houses. Markets in few areas were allowed to open to sell essentials to the people and the residents it appeared realised the importance of maintaining social distance going by the staggered manner in which they came out to purchase the commodities.

The police played an important role in maintaining order in these places cautioning people against forming into congregations and explaining them about the scope of spread of disease through large gatherings.

There were, however, complaints from the people about the vendors charging exorbitant prices at several important markets and there were incidents of people ransacking the shops at places like Erragadda in the city. But the situation is likely to ease from Wednesday as the government had decided to allow the vehicles carrying essentials, including vegetables, stranded on the inter-State borders since close to 48 hours.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/3qx4qm/article31155734.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25LOCKDOWN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-second-day-of-lockdown-in-hyerabad-peaceful-barring-sporadic-incidents/article31155735.ece
215,2020/03/24,Govt urged to supply all essential commodities,"Focus on rural areas where infrastructure is absent, says Congress MLC

Congress MLC T. Jeevan Reddy has urged the government to supply essential commodities to the poor people for whom the government plans to supply rice and extend a financial assistance of ₹1500.

In a statement here, he appealed to Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to ensure supply of edible oil and also pulses as the prices are shooting up in the lockdown period. He said the Congress party welcomes the government’s efforts in dealing with the problem but wants it concentrate on the rural areas where lots of people have come from various countries after the outbreak. Since the medical infrastructure is not up to the expectations in the rural areas it is far more important for the government to concentrate there as well.

Mr. Reddy asked the Chief Minister to shift all the foreign-returned who have been advised self isolation to quarantine centres of the government to ensure that they don’t violate the restrictions imposed on them. They would be better if they stayed under the watchful eyes of the government rather than at home.

He also appealed to the people to take the lockdown seriously and not come on the roads unless it was emergency, and cooperate with the police and other government agencies.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/zdd0qk/article31155661.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25JEEVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/govt-urged-to-supply-all-essential-commodities/article31155662.ece
216,2020/03/24,MAUD for strict implementation of lockdown,"Warns of criminal cases against violators

As the State is bracing up for a sustained campaign against the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19), the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department had given a slew of instructions to its wings with maximum public interface like the Metro Rail, GHMC and Metro Water Board to ensure that the virus is contained effectively.

In the detailed orders issued on Tuesday, the Department wanted the officials concerned to communicate the measures to all their sub-offices and sensitise and orient the functionaries for scrupulous adherence of them in letter and spirit. The offices were asked to arrange for sanitisers/hand washing facilities at their entrances and strictly restrict the entry of visitors. They could instead indicate contact number/e-mail id wherein queries of the people could be attended to.

The Director of Vigilance, Enforcement and Disaster Management of the GHMC should enforce the regulation of all guidelines under the orders issued by the government during the lockdown period. The penal provisions would include closure of establishment/institution/organization and filing of appropriate criminal cases against persons/individuals under the relevant laws, including the IPC, Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the Disaster Management Act, 2005.

In case of essential services, they should opt for decentralized delivery of services to the extent possible to avoid scope for any public gathering at collection/distribution centres. Social distancing norms should be maintained even among the staff ensuring painting of foot marks at a distance of five feet from each other at the service delivery/collection counters besides providing duty chart/work schedule till March 31.

Metro rail

The Hyderabad Metro Rail should close down the operation of train services and prevent access to the metro stations to any visitors. It should close down commercial activity in the metro stations and malls attached to them and ensure that there was proper sanitation around all its precincts. The GHMC Commissioner, on his part, should set up a control room with representation from all departments to receive grievances and monitor the situation.

The contact number of the control room should be publicized to make it a reliable first point of contact to citizens. The control room should be made to function with shift-wise deployment of staff on 24X7 basis while the officials concerned should also make use of social media for their communication needs. They should keep record of the complaints received and grievances redressed and ensure zero response time for redressal of grievances.

Maintain sanitation

The GHMC Commissioner should give top most priority to maintenance of sanitation and public health and instruct all the zonal and deputy commissioners to make necessary arrangements to keep the city environs clean and tidy if need be by hiring additional vehicles and infrastructure. Contingency plans should be prepared for proper upkeep of the city, including house-to-house collection of garbage, lifting and transportation.

The closure of parks should continue and the Transport department had been asked to ensure that no private transport operators like Uber/Ola, autorickshaws plied on the roads except for transport of passengers for accessing emergency medical services. The norm for allowing one person on two-wheeler and two persons in four-wheelers should be strictly adhered to.

The guidelines warned that violation of social distancing norms at business establishments during the lock down period was punishable under Sections 188, 269 and 270 of the IPC. Steps should be taken to continue the functioning of the Annapurna meal kiosks as they were essential and critical in this period.

Religious gatherings

The department had issued detailed guidelines for hotels and shops and establishments warning that stringent measures would be initiated against the violators. Restrictions on congregation of people were also applicable in religious places which were subject to restrictions of “public congregation” and “social distance” norms. It was the responsibility of the management committee of the religious place concerned to ensure that there was no mass gathering, more than five persons at a time, as well as strict observance of social distance protocol among the persons within their precincts.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/3sodxm/article31155849.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25MAUD-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/maud-for-strict-implementation-of-lockdown/article31155601.ece

218,2020/03/24,COVID-19 | Doctors denied houses on rent in Warangal due to virus scare,"Many refuse to give houses on rent or ask them to vacate, fearing spread of coronavirus

At a time when the whole world is lauding the efforts of doctors, some paranoid residents in the city are refusing to give houses on rent to people in the medical profession, fearing the spread of coronavirus.

Scores of house surgeons of a new batch who joined duties on Monday and Tuesday and their seniors, who were located around the MGM Hospital, are facing severe problems due to non-availability of accommodation.

When the issue was brought to the notice of Panchayat Raj Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao and district Collector Rajiv Gandhi Hanmanthu, they said the Kakatiya Medical College (KMC) authorities have allocated a new building to both senior and junior house surgeons. “Even the hostel rooms have been converted into quarantine wards and hence the problem. But it is now addressed,” the Collector said.

Most of these interns who hail from various parts of the State stay in rented houses near the hospital in the surroundings of Bhadrakali temple opposite KMC, Pochamma Maidan and Gopala Swamy temple until they complete their one-year internship in the MGM hospital. In the wake of coronavirus pandemic, the house owners are reportedly asking them to vacate their houses. A house surgeon working in MGM hospital has shared their woes on Facebook. The post is now going viral on social networking sites. The post said that one of the owners called the doctors ‘dirty’ because of work in the hospital. “Our campus hostel rooms are converted into isolation wards by the State government. We are working without any protective equipment during this pandemic, without any holiday, without any stipend since five months while the nation is in lockdown,” the post read.

On condition of anonymity, one of the house surgeons facing this situation described certain house owners as insensitive. “They do not understand the risks we undergo to keep them healthy. It is really demoralising,” he said.

Meanwhile, GWMC Commissioner Pamela Satpathy responded to the viral post on twitter and said “Few similar posts have come to our notice. The issue of accommodation has been resolved already. All Doctors/Medical Fraternity facing any such issue, are kindly requested to contact KMC Principal. Or you can also contact @Collector_WGLU, @MC_GWMC, or DMHO. At your disposal always.”",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/k7t1xk/article31155164.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25DOCTORS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/for-paranoid-house-owners-doctors-are-persona-non-grata/article31155165.ece

221,2020/03/24,90 persons who moved with Indonesians quarantined,"District administration preparing quarantine centres

The 90 people who are suspected to have moved closely with 10 Indonesians COVID-19 positive patients have been quarantined in isolation wards at Chalmeda Ananda Rao Institute of Medical Sciences (CAIMS) and the District Headquarters Hospital in Karimnagar town on Tuesday.

Sources said that 62 persons have been quarantined at CAIMS hospital and another 28 at the District Headquarters Hospital. All the suspected persons quarantined are reported to have been closely associated with the visiting Indonesian preachers during their two-day stay in the Karimnagar town and visit of various mosques.

Already, the police have identified more than 200 persons who are reported to have come in contact with the Indonesians during their visit to Karimnagar town. The police have been shifting the suspected persons to isolation wards after conducting the medical screening through thermal scanners with the help of the Medical Department.

In the meantime, the police in coordination with the district authorities had readied private engineering colleges to be utilised as quarantine centres to admit persons suspected to be infected with coronavirus.

Essentials delivered

On Tuesday, Collector K Shashanka, Commissioner of Police VB Kamalasan Reddy, Municipal Commissioner Valluru Kranthi and others visited the Mukarampura area, which was declared a ‘red zone’ and sealed off from the rest of the town, and inspected the distribution of the vegetables which would be sufficient for four days for a family. They also appealed to the residents to approach the government hospital for their isolation in view of their having come in contact with the visiting Indonesians.

In the meantime, the district police machinery strictly enforced the lockdown throughout the day by forcing the people to remain indoors in Karimnagar. The police presence was felt at every nook and corner and they chased away the people coming on to the roads.

Curfew scenario

The curfew-like situation prevailed in the entire town with people remaining indoors after making purchases of essentials in the morning hours before 9 a.m.

The officials had ensured that the petrol filling stations were closed so that the people do not come on to the roads and roam freely. The banks have also downed their shutters in Karimnagar town.

222,2020/03/24,"Paddy procurement to be done in about 8,000 villages this season","Step planned in the wake of coronavirus spread to prevent movement of farmers with their produce

The scare of coronavirus spread is making several government departments linked to people to come up with new ideas by preventing gathering of people, including communities such as farmers at procurement centres and market yards to dispose of their produce. In one such innovative step, the State government is planning village-wise procurement of maize and paddy this season.

Minister for Agriculture S. Niranjan Reddy, Civil Supplies Minister G. Kamalakar and Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar held a meeting here on Monday to discuss measures for procurement of paddy and maize this rabi/yasangi season. Mr. Niranjan Reddy stated that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has directed the Finance Department to provide bank guarantee to the Civil Supplies Corporation to the tune of ₹25,000 crore for procurement of paddy.

Secretary (Agriculture) B. Janardhan Reddy, Chairman of Civil Supplies Corporation M. Srinivas Reddy, Chairman of TS-Markfed M. Ganga Reddy, Commissioner of Civil Supplies P. Satyanarayan Reddy, Cooperative Commissioner M. Veerabrahmaiah, Director (Marketing) G. Laxmi Bai, Director of Seed Development Corporation K. Keshavulu, Managing Directors of TS-Markfed and TS-Agros V. Bhaskara Chary and A. Ramulu discussed the steps to be taken in the wake of coronavirus spread.

Official sources stated that although the Civil Supplies Department has asked for ₹18,000 crore bank guarantee, the Chief Minister was said to have suggested that it would not be enough to procure paddy produced in about 39.25 lakh acres this season. The Markfed has been told to commence procurement of maize with a support price of ₹1,760 per quintal from Tuesday itself by arranging tokens to farmers in advance.

The Civil Supplies Corporation was planning to procure paddy through 4,000 centre this season against 3,500 during the kharif season. However, the Chief Minister was learnt to have told the officials to ensure than farmers do not come to urban market yards and it was possible only by opening at least 8,000 procurement centres this season, although there were 12,746 gram panchayats for several thandas were upgraded.

Mr. Niranjan Reddy told the officials to assess the village wise production of paddy and make arrangements including procurement of sufficient gunny bags and tarpaulin sheets since unseasonal rains occur sometimes during the rabi harvesting. The officials were told to procure at least 60,000 new tarpaulins to protect the paddy procured and sufficient moisture content measuring instruments.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/t1bvuz/article31154735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy24Paddy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/paddy-procurement-to-be-done-in-about-8000-villages-this-season/article31154736.ece
223,2020/03/24,Revenue employees flay police high-handedness,"Executive magistrates too were victims of police behaviour, say association leaders

Telangana Revenue Employees Services Association (TRESA) has strongly condemned the high-handed behaviour of police towards journalists who were going home after their duty on Monday night.

It was unfortunate that the media persons who were working round-the-clock to create awareness about the spread of COVID-19 and doing their best to overcome the present crisis were targeted by the police.

The TRESA also said that the rude behaviour of police who stopped the vehicles of tahsildars and other Revenue department employees who were working under emergency conditions created anxiety among the employees. The police did not relent even after the journalists and Revenue department employees showed their department and duty identity cards, it said..

TRESA president Vanga Ravinder Reddy and general secretary K.Gautam Kumar in a statement issued here on Tuesday said that the GO issued by the government gave exemption to media persons and employees of essential services to discharge their duties in spite of the lockdown in the State.

Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao himself categorically stated in his address at the media conference that media persons could go anywhere for coverage of news. Yet it was deplorable that some policemen were behaving in an irresponsible and high-handed manner.

At a time when every one should work unitedly at a crisis time and instead of providing safety and security to people, some policemen were behaving as if they were alone working to curb the spread of COVID-19, they said.

The Association leaders requested the government to respond immediately and take action against policemen concerned and ensure that such incidents would not recur.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/revenue-employees-flay-police-high-handedness/article31154287.ece
224,2020/03/24,COVID-19 | Emaikunta residents desert their village fearing infection,"A Uganda-returned fellow resident under the mandatory 14-day home isolation is the cause

Fear of being infected with the dreaded COVID-19 virus has made residents of Emaikunta village in Indervelli mandal of Adilabad district desert their village - albeit temporarily. About 40 of the 120 families have shifted to their respective agriculture fields on Tuesday. The trigger? An Uganda-returned compatriot who has been under home isolation since Monday.

“His home is just a single room where the family of four, including his wife and two children live. The family members move out of their home frequently which has made the villagers scared,” recounted sarpanch Jadhav Lakhan of the piquant situation the village is facing.

Returnee creates flutter

The returnee was working as a mechanic in Uganda and came back by air to Mumbai on March 21, and by train to Adilabad the next day. “We informed the authorities the same day who suggested the person undergo home isolation for 14 days,” the sarpanch pointed out.

Padwal Bhav Singh, head of an eight-member family who was among the villagers who set up a temporary shelter in his field revealed that the entire village wanted the Uganda-returned to stay away from the village. “We asked him to stay elsewhere for the duration, and even offered to put him up in a comfortable tent in a field but the family does not budge,” Mr. Lakhan recalled.

“He is staying with his family in one room. What if he is infected and his children and wife are moving freely in the village?” asked Mr. Bhav Singh as he echoed the villagers’ fear. Meanwhile, more and more families are getting out of the village. “Fortunately, we have many huge trees which offer cool shade in this harsh weather,” he pointed out.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2442vc/article31155789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25EMAIKUNTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-emaikunta-residents-desert-their-village-fearing-infection/article31152769.ece

There was a long line of vehicles stranded at Madnur and Salura check-posts since the last 48 hours.

However, many were checked and allowed if they had all proper documents and complied with the State government guidelines.

“We are following G.O. 45 as per which they are being checked and allowed. In fact, the borders were completely sealed,” said N. Vani, DTC, Kamareddy.

G. Ravikumar, Motor Vehicle Inspector, at Salabathpur in Madnur, said that at present there are over 100 trucks lined up for permission into the State. “From our side there are no vehicles to enter Maharashtra.

We are not allowing even a single two-wheeler as the border was clamped down. I am not sure when the stranded vehicles would be cleared,” he said.

Hundreds of vehicles, including goods trucks and passenger cars were barred from entering Telangana on the State border with Andhra Pradesh, amid COVID-19 lockdown, here on Monday.

Those identified as carrying essential services were allowed to pass through in a phased manner, however, many others were denied entry on to the NH -65 (Hyderabad-Vijayawada) in Suryapet limits. Undivided Nalgonda has three check-posts on the borders, at Nagarjunasagar, Vishnupuram and Kodad.

According to a police estimate, some 400 vehicles at the check-post at Ramapuram junction near Kodad had caused congestion. The vehicles were earlier kept in holding points observing Sunday’s janata curfew, and only tens of them identified to be rendering health services, essentials and emergencies were allowed. Congestion was also reported at the Korlapahad toll plaza.

Heavy bandobust was deployed at Wadapally check-post to restrict entry from outside. And trucks were later moved into open lands on the highwayside. On the other hand, the police also seized a number of vehicles found violating lockdown guidelines mentioned in the government order 45.

About 350 cases, of which 305 pertained to two-wheelers, were made and vehicles seized at Suryapet, Kodad, Tirumalagiri, Huzurnagar and Nereducherla.

The administration has initiated wide-ranging measures to strictly enforce lockdown of the erstwhile composite Khammam district by sealing its borders with neighbouring States and implementing rigorous social distancing norms to stem the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

Police have barred the entry of all vehicles, except those carrying perishable goods and essentials, at all the entry points in Bonakal, Penuballi and Yerrupalem mandals in Khammam district along the inter-State border with Andhra Pradesh.

This has compelled several people of the villages dotting the Telangana-Andhra Pradesh border to walk quite a long distance to reach their destinations on either sides due to lockdown. Police advised them not to venture onto the roads unless extremely urgent to help the administration in the fight against the spread of COVID-19.

In Bhadradri-Kothagudem district, the police deployed additional forces at the inter-State border points in Bhadrachalam, Aswaraopeta and Palvancha mandals to effectively enforce the lockdown.

The main streets in the temple town of Bhadrachalam and the coal towns including Kothagudem and Manuguru wore a deserted look following stringent enforcement of curbs on movement of people and suspension of all modes of transportation, barring those associated with essential services.

Meanwhile, Adivasi Sankshema Parishad (ASP) has sought the intervention of the Bhadrachalam Integrated Tribal Development Agency to spread greater awareness on COVID-19 among Adivasis mainly the migrant tribal people inhabiting border hamlets in Bhadrachalam Agency.

The ASP coordinator Madivi Nehru said the government should extend financial aid to the migrant tribal labourers those returned to their habitations from major cities like Hyderabad in the wake of lockdown of the State.

228,2020/03/24,Big spike in Adilabad internet usage on Janata Curfew day,"Voluntary home stay of people owing to Janata Curfew on Sunday resulted in a huge jump in internet data consumption in the integrated Adilabad district. While BSNL recorded 15% increased consumption of data on the day, other service providers like Jio were estimated to have recorded a jump of at least 25% over its normal consumption of daily data.

There was a spike in consumption of data supplied through cable networks in towns too. Most of it was on account of IT professionals who had returned home earlier to use the ‘work from home’ option, said Saurabh Agarwal of 24X7 Networks.

As the Janata Curfew was a huge success, people staying indoors resorted to watching news and views besides films and other entertainment programmes on TV and on their smartphones. The crew of the few thousand heavy goods vehicles stranded on Penganga inter-State border with Maharashtra in Adilabad district, Wankidi integrated check post (ICP) in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district and Beltharoda ICP) in Nirmal district were also among those who used more internet than usual.

“We have customers using 2 lakh BSNL SIM cards in old composite Adilabad,” said K. Devidas, Assistant General Manager, BSNL-Adilabad. “Through 3G and 4G networks, about 7 terabytes (TB) of data was consumed on the day of Janata Curfew — one TB higher than normal,” he added.

Though Jio officials did not disclose the quantum of jump in data consumption, sources said the number of Jio SIM cards in use is more than 10 lakh. The nnormal consumption of data is also ten times that of BSNL and the increase in consumption on March 22 was by about 2.5TB.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/big-spike-in-adilabad-internet-usage-on-janata-curfew-day/article31145967.ece

230,2020/03/24,"2020 Olympic Games will be postponed, says IOC member Dick Pound","The Games, scheduled for July 24-Aug. 9, are likely to be held in the summer of 2021

The International Olympic Committee has decided to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games because of the coronavirus pandemic, IOC member Dick Pound said on March 23, as a window slowly began to open that would allow the showcase to be staged next year.

Major sporting nations Australia and Canada withdrew on Monday as organisers came under global pressure to postpone the event for the first time in its 124-year modern history.

Pound told Reuters that a one-year postponement looked like the best solution. This would mean the Games, scheduled for July 24-Aug. 9, are likely to be held in the summer of 2021.

“That's my conclusion (there will be a postponement),” Pound said in a telephone interview, after Sunday's IOC statement saying it was stepping up its “scenario planning” for the Tokyo 2020 Games — including a possible postponement. “From reading IOC-speak in the communique, if you are going to cancel you simply cancel because there are no future plans,” added Pound. “But if you are going to carry on with the original objective (to stage the Games) there is no reason to issue a statement because you have already done that over the past several weeks.”

Japan and the IOC have said calling off the Games entirely is not an option. But finding a new date could be complicated as the summer 2021 calendar is already crowded, while 2022 will see the soccer World Cup and the Beijing Winter Olympics.

Pound said a large number of stakeholders from the organising committee, to athletes to broadcasters and sporting federations would all need to be consulted before a plan could be finalised but there were early signs of a willingness to accommodate a 2021 Summer Games.

World Athletics said on Monday they would be willing to move their 2021 world championships scheduled for Aug. 6-15 in Eugene, Oregon to clear a path for a 2021 Olympics.

“World Athletics has already been in discussion with the Oregon 21 Organising Committee regarding the possibility the Olympic Games may move to next year and they in turn have held discussions with their key stakeholders and have reassured us they will work with all of their partners and stakeholders to ensure that Oregon is able to host the World Athletics Championships on alternative dates should that prove necessary, athletics' global governing body said in a statement.

Balance tipping

An Olympics postponement would be a blow for host country Japan, which has pumped in more than $12 billion of investment, and huge sums are also at stake for sponsors and broadcasters.

But a groundswell of concern from athletes — already struggling to train as gyms, stadiums and swimming pools close around the world — appeared to be tipping the balance, along with the cancellation of other major sports events.

More than 337,000 people have been infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 14,600 have died in a pandemic that the World Health Organisation said was accelerating.

The IOC and the Japanese government have both edged back from weeks of insistence that the Games would go ahead, announcing a month-long consultation.

The Olympics have never before been delayed, though they were cancelled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during the two world wars, and major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles Games in 1980 and 1984 respectively.

“The moment the IOC indicates that it is thinking about other solutions, it has already decided to delay the Games,” said French Olympic Committee president Denis Masseglia.

Canada and Australia both bluntly said they would not participate if the Games were not put back to 2021 and Britain may have followed suit.

“We are in the midst of a global health crisis that is far more significant than sport,” Canada's Olympic Committee and Paralympic Committee said in a statement.

The tide turns

Japanese authorities seemed to be bowing to the inevitable, despite the losses and logistics headaches it would entail.

“We may have no option but to consider postponing,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was hoping for a boom in tourism and consumer spending, told parliament.

The organising committee is already scaling back the torch relay to avoid crowds, national broadcaster NHK said.

Japanese sponsors, from Toyota Motor Corp to Panasonic Corp, were watching nervously. But Tokyo stocks sensitive to the success of the Olympics surged on Monday, after sharp falls in prior weeks, thanks to expectations of a delay rather than a cancellation.

Ad agency Dentsu Group's shares jumped 12%.

Pound told Reuters the IOC had tried to hold fire in order to be able to present the hosts, sports federations and sponsors with a clear alternative plan. “Probably what turned the tide in the last couple of days is the curve on the COVID-19 virus. It is getting very, very steep now and this is clearly not something that is going to be under control by June or July and probably not by the end of the year.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g1aied/article31114979.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIXOLYMPICSTOKYO2020TORCHARRIVAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/2020-olympic-games-will-be-postponed-says-ioc-member-dick-pound/article31148711.ece

237,2020/03/24,"After his BJP entry, forgery case against Jyotiraditya Scindia closed","The case relates to Mr. Scindia and his family allegedly indulging in wrongdoing while selling a land in Gwalior in 2009

The Madhya Pradesh Economic Offences Wing (EOW) has closed a case against former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia and his family members, where they were accused of falsifying a property document while selling land, an official said on Tuesday.

Mr. Scindia quit the Congress on March 10 and later joined the BJP. His resignation from the Congress triggered a revolt in the Madhya Pradesh party unit, with 22 MLAs who belong to his camp also tendering their resignations. This led to the collapse of the Kamal Nath-led State government last week.

On March 12, when the Congress was in power in the State, the EOW decided to verify facts afresh into the complaint against Mr. Scindia and his family of allegedly indulging in wrongdoing while selling a land in Gwalior in 2009.

“The complainant, Surendra Shrivastava, approached us for the second time on March 12 seeking a re-look into his complaint against Scindias. We forwarded the complaint to our Gwalior office which, after a re-investigation, closed it,” a top EOW official said.

According to sources in the EOW, it closed the case against Mr. Scindia and his family on Friday.

Incidentally, Mr. Nath also stepped down as chief minister on Friday after his government was reduced to a minority.

On March 12, Mr. Shrivastava filed a fresh complaint against Mr. Scindia and his family, alleging that by falsifying a registry document, they sold him a piece of land at Mahalgaon which was smaller by 6,000 sqft than the original agreement in 2009, the EOW official said.

He initially lodged the complaint on March 26, 2014 against Mr. Scindia, who was then a Congress leader, and his family. But it was investigated and closed in May 2018 (when the BJP was in power in the State), the official said.

Earlier this month, 22 MLAs loyal to Mr. Scindia resigned from the Congress, paving way for the BJP to come to power in the State again.

The Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh secured the trust of 112 MLAs, including the legislators of the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and two Independents, in the Vidhan Sabha on Tuesday to pass the trust vote.

Mr. Chouhan, who took oath as the Chief Minister on Monday, moved a confidence motion in the House, which was unanimously passed. The 92 Congress MLAs were not present at the session, which was adjourned to March 27 after the vote.

“Our entire focus is on tackling the Coronavirus,” Mr. Chouhan said later. “However, it is a constitutional necessity to secure the trust vote, which we did today, so that with full force we can combat the disease now.”

BSP MLAs Rambai Parihar and Sanjeev Kushwah, independents Surendra Singh Shera and Rana Vikram Singh and SP MLA Rajesh Shukla, who had previously backed the Kamal Nath government, also voted in favour of Mr. Chouhan. The remaining two independent MLAs were not present.

Although the SP had issued a whip to its MLA for the March 16 Assembly session, this time it didn’t issue one. Three days ago, SP president Akhilesh Yadav attacked the BJP saying, “The BJP has murdered democracy in Madhya Pradesh.”

On Monday night, Speaker N.P. Prajapati tendered his resignation to the Deputy Speaker. In his resignation letter, he wrote that he was resigning on moral grounds.

Nath questions urgency

Former Chief Minister Kamal Nath questioned the urgency with which the session was called. “On the one hand, several decisions such as imposing a lockdown and curfew have been taken in view of the Coronavirus, and on the other, the decision by the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government around night to flout its own measures to call for a Vidhan Sabha session during a curfew is beyond my understanding,” he wrote on Twitter.

He also wrote that as there was time to secure trust vote, why this urgency. “Why these double standards in tackling the Coronavirus?”

245,2020/03/24,Sena blames PM’s ‘taali bajao’ call for casual approach of people to lockdown,"An editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said citizens will take something seriously if there is a fear or terror about it.

The Shiv Sena on Tuesday said because of Prime Narendra Modi’s appeal to clap and applaud those at the forefront of combating the coronavirus, people are not realising the seriousness of the lockdown being enforced to contain the pandemic.

An editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ said citizens will take something seriously if there is a fear or terror about it.

“When the fear was starting to build up, PM Modi asked people to clap and bang thalis (steel plates) by coming out in their balconies or windows to boost the morale of health workers,” the Marathi daily said.

Responding to the call, people came out in large groups and danced on streets, which gave a “festive look” to the situation, it said.

“Who gave a non-serious approach to the entire issue? Political party workers came out on streets and raised slogans. It is we who violated the prohibitory orders. It is the duty of citizens to obey the lockdown ordered by the state government,” the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has now appealed to people to stay at home and take the lockdown seriously. “But people do not fear the coronavirus after Sunday evening’s event ofclapping and banging of thalis with music,” it said.

What is the use of concern raised by the prime minister or chief minister if people do not feel serious or concerned about the political situation? the Sena asked.

When Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal sealed Delhi borders and said the airport will also be shut, the Civil Aviation Ministry said airports will remain open and international flights will land.

“If there is no coordination between state governments and the Centre, the coronavirus epidemic will not be contained,” it said.

249,2020/03/24,"Jharkhand govt. passes resolution against NPR, NRC in Assembly","People will be asked about date and place of birth of parents. Most of people in Jharkhand will not be able to answer these questions, says Minister Alamgir Khan

The Hemant Soren government in Jharkhand has urged the Centre to conduct the National Population Register (NPR) survey as per the 2010 format and not to implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

A three-line resolution in this regard was passed by the State Assembly amidst opposition from the Bharatiya Janata Party members on Monday.

“In the present format having 15 points, people will be asked about date and place of birth of parents. Most of people in Jharkhand will not be able to answer these questions. In Jharkhand, most people even don’t know their own date of birth,” Alamgir Alam, Jharkhand Rural Development Minister and Parliamentary Affairs Minister, told The Hindu.

He said the government was of the view that the NPR was the first step, it would be followed by the NRC and finally the Citizen (Amendment) Act. (CAA).

“People did not want the NPR to be conducted in the present format. People from different sections of society, MLAs and political parties had been demanding the rejection of the NRC and the NPR. So we have gone for passing this resolution,” said the Minister.

“When the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar, in which the BJP is an alliance partner, passed the resolution rejecting the present NPR format, the saffron party remained silent. But, they are making a hue and cry in Jharkhand,” alleged Mr. Alam.

Recently, Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha (JJM), a forum of different civil society organisations, had demanded that the Jharkhand government should stop all NPR-related activities and pass a resolution in the Assembly against the CAA and the NRC.

Stating that the main purpose of the NPR was to lay the ground for the NRC, the JJM had said the NRC was a “wasteful exercise” that was bound to lead to the exclusion and harassment of large number of people, especially the poor as had already happened in Assam.

“It will wreak havoc on the poor of Jharkhand, especially tribals, Dalits, Muslims and women. The combination of the CAA and the NRC could easily become a weapon to reduce many Muslims to second-class citizens,” it had pointed out.

250,2020/03/24,Berhampur IISER and ITI make hand sanitisers for civic personnel fighting COVID-19,"350 bottles were given free of cost to the local administration

The Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) and the Industrial Training Institute (ITI) in Odisha’s Berhampur have joined hands to make hand sanitisers for government personnel involved in fighting the COVID-19 outbreak. They are provided free of charge to the local administration.

“Realising the extreme scarcity of hand sanitisers in the local market and its importance for government employees and emergency services workers on duty to fight the fast spreading virus, we decided to meet the demand by producing it locally,"" said Rajat Kumar Panigrahy, Principal, ITI-Berhampur.

They initiative has already resulted in the making of 350 pocket-friendly 30 ml bottles. On Monday, the bottles were handed over to the Commissioner, Berhampur Municipal Corporation, and the Ganjam Chief District Medical Officer.

“The Commissioner told us that necessary chemicals will be provided to us for production of more hand sanitiser as the need is going to rise,” said Mr. Panigrahy.

As per guidelines

According to Rakesh Pathak, head, Department of Chemistry, IISER-Berhampur, the hand sanitiser adheres to the guidelines provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

IISER-Berhampur is functioning out of ITI-Berhampur as the former's permanent campus is yet to be constructed. Classes have been suspended at both the institutions in view of the COVID-19 outbreak.

It was produced in the Chemistry lab of IISER-Berhampur by its faculty, Mr. Panigrahy, and three staff members of ITI-Berhampur. “Our hand sanitiser is of better quality than the ones being sold in market at a higher price,” explained Mr. Panigrahy",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/berhampur-iiser-and-iti-make-hand-sanitisers-for-civic-personnel-fighting-covid-19/article31147319.ece
251,2020/03/24,COVID-19 takes sheen off Assam’s silk in Bihu season,"18,000 weavers and allied workers of the State's silk hub in Sualkuchi face uncertainty

The COVID-19 pandemic has taken the sheen off Assam’s silk industry ahead of the mid-April Rongali or Bohag Bihu, the festival that fuels much of its sales.

Facing uncertainties are 18,000 weavers and allied workers of Sualkuchi and 190 wholesale traders, the hub of the State’s silk industry 35 km west of Guwahati. The loom owners are close to stopping production, staring at a “long recovery period” if the pandemic-induced situation continues for a month or more.

“We could have absorbed the impact had it been the lean season from May to September. But the virus struck during the peak sale season between the (mid-January) Bhogali Bihu and Bohag Bihu,” said Nihar Ranjan Kalita, secretary of Sualkuchi Tat Silpa Unnanyan Samiti.

Unique varieties

The average annual turnover bandwidth of Assam’s silk industry comprising three unique varieties — the golden Muga, the white Paat and the warm Eri — is ₹80 crore. The Bihu season accounts for ₹30 crore.

“Sales generally, pick up from October and peak in April. The protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December and January braked the momentum, and now this,” Dr. Kalita said.

The State’s Handloom, Textiles and Sericulture Minister Ranjit Dutta said the combined silk production in Assam has increased since the 2011-12 fiscal to touch 2,552.75 metric tonnes during 2015-16. But the local production is inadequate, forcing weavers to buy yarns from China.

China stopped the export a month ago because of COVID-19. This resulted in yarn dealers increasing existing stock prices by 40%, impacting the prices of the finished products.

“Marriages have been put off along with Bihu celebrations. There are no buyers even at discounted prices. Business is down by 70-75% and I don’t know how I can pay the 20 weavers I employ,” said Meghali Das, who runs a silk outlet in Guwahati.

Relief needed

Silk weavers and traders’ bodies said the government might have to provide fiscal relief for bailing them out if the situation does not improve soon. Officials said the impact of the pandemic on the business would be assessed.

The gloom has also enveloped musicians and others associated with Bihu. “People’s health is of utmost importance at this time, so representatives of 26 Bihu committees in Guwahati decided to cancel all cultural programmes to avoid mass gatherings,” Bihu organiser Kailash Sarma said.

Nooruddin Ahmed, an art director, said the issue was bigger than business or entertainment. “It hurts, but keeping the virus away will help us live for festivals and programmes later,” he added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-takes-sheen-off-assams-silk-in-bihu-season/article31147289.ece
252,2020/03/24,12 students from Tripura asked to vacate hostels in Punjab,"The Tripura government on Monday requested its counterpart in Punjab to provide logistics and food to 12 students from the State who were asked to vacate their hostels in Punjab.

The Tripura government swung into action after a student in a tweet made an appeal to Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb.

Shubhanjan Das, one of the students, said that 12 students, including a few girl students, were asked to vacate their hostels in Punjab in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak in the State. Their flight to Delhi was scheduled for March 25. But with domestic flights set to cease operations from March 24, the journey seemed uncertain, he said.

In his reply, Mr. Deb asked them not to panic. “We will definitely bring you and your friends to Tripura from Punjab. Stay calm and safe,” he tweeted.

Sanjay Mishra, OSD to the Tripura Chief Minister, said that senior State government officials have spoken to the officials in Punjab and have made requests to accommodate the students in a safe place, and provide them with food and essentials.

Meanwhile, the Tripura government has decided to rotate the presence of employees from non-essential services in government offices to minimise their strength to 50% amid the outbreak. A meeting chaired by Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb also decided to reduce public transport to 50%.

The decisions were taken to maintain social distancing which was essential to prevent the spread of COVID-19, an official said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/12-students-from-tripura-asked-to-vacate-hostels-in-punjab/article31147236.ece
253,2020/03/24,Kolkata teachers manufacture hand sanitisers to fight COVID-19,"Made with materials stocked for college science labs, they are distributed to workers who need them most

With hand-sanitisers — one of the most effective weapons against COVID-19 — running out in shops, science teachers at several colleges of Kolkata have manufactured the disinfectant in their labs and distributed it among those at high risk.

“The practical exams for chemistry students were to go on for nine days, but they had to be postponed three days after they began. Now, I cannot walk out of the college just like that. It’s my job to ensure safekeeping of the chemicals, so I kept returning to the college even after it shut. That’s when it struck me, why not use the stock of alcohol to make hand sanitisers,” Dr. Hari Shankar Biswas, head of the Chemistry Department at Surendranath College, told The Hindu.

Sanitisers require pure alcohol — not what is sold in liquor shops — which only licence-holders can purchase. Luckily Dr. Biswas, who holds the licence on behalf of the college, had purchased sufficient amount of it shortly after Durga Puja.

“With the permission of the principal and the help of colleagues, I took 30 litres of alcohol from the stock to make hand sanitiser. As per the WHO (World Health Organisation) guidelines, 100 ml of sanitiser must have 70 ml of alcohol — the remaining 30ml usually consists of water, glycerine and a dash of hydrogen peroxide,” Dr. Biswas said.

He used rose water to give his product a fragrance, and also added a few drops of the dye methylene blue to impart a blue colour to it. Naming it Sparsha, he distributed some 500 bottles of 60 ml each among those who really needed it: non-teaching staff, policemen on duty outside the college, shops giving photocopies and printouts.

Similar initiatives

Dr. Biswas isn’t alone. Dr. Aparna Sen, head of the Microbiology Department at the Lady Brabourne College, also undertook a similar initiative. “I must thank our principal Prof. Siuli Sarkar. She gave us the go-ahead in spite of our limited resources. We managed to make 200 bottles of about 100 ml each. We used rose fragrance and gave the sanitiser a pink colour,” Dr. Sen said.

She distributed some of the bottles among the non-teaching staff — “who travel in buses and trams and need them the most” — and on Monday, representatives from the local police station and the SSKM Hospital also came to the college to collect the product for use by their staff.

Dr. Amrita Kar, Associate Professor in the Chemistry Department of Bethune College, also managed to make some 50 bottles of 60-70 ml each, using ethanol and distilled water. Most of the bottles were distributed among the non-teaching staff. “This is not rocket science, we are merely doing our duty in the time of a crisis,” Dr. Kar told The Hindu.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kolkata-teachers-manufacture-hand-sanitisers-to-fight-covid-19/article31147226.ece

The Tripura government declared lock down in the State from 2 pm on Tuesday to prevent the spread of the deadly novel coronavirus.

At a hastily convened press conference on Monday evening, Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb said the lock down would continue till March 3. He urged the people to stay indoors saying Section 144 and other prohibitory orders are already in place to enforce it.

The decision was taken after receiving an advisory from the Central government, sources said.

“The law enforcing agencies would oversee that no vehicular movement takes place and people do not come out unnecessarily,” the Chief Minister said.

He however said essential and emergency services as well as grocery and vegetable shops would remain open. The government would act tough against those found involved in hoarding and black marketing of essential and edible commodities.

Mr. Deb warned that anyone found giving shelter to Bangladeshis or helping them cross over to India would face harsh action. He said night curfew was already in force in the bordering villages.

In a major decision, the Congress government in Rajasthan on Monday announced a package worth ₹2,000 crore for supporting the poor, disadvantaged and marginalised people who have been deprived of their livelihood during the lockdown enforced in the State to contain the spread of coronavirus. About 1.41 crore families will benefit from the package.

Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

The State government also banned all private vehicles on roads during the lockdown till March 31. Only the vehicles related to essential services and those in the exempted categories will be allowed from Tuesday, while the State highway toll booths will be closed from midnight.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot gave instructions after a high-level meeting here to immediately release social security pensions for two months to 78 lakh beneficiaries. A cash assistance of ₹1,000 each will be given to 36 lakh families covered in the below poverty line (BPL) and Antyodaya Yojana as well as 25 lakh construction workers and registered street vendors not covered in social security schemes.

“With the cash in their hands, the poor people will be able to meet their daily needs when they are unable to earn,” Mr. Gehlot said. The State government had earlier announced the release of foodgrains free of cost for the next two months to the families covered in the National Food Security Act (NFSA).

The State government will also supply ration packets to the needy people not covered in the NFSA either with the help of donors and philanthropists or by utilising untied funds available with the District Collectors. “There will be no shortage of money and resources for helping out the poor... Nobody will go to bed hungry,” Mr. Gehlot said.

Mr. Gehlot asked the people to consider the lockdown seriously as a “self-imposed curfew” in order to protect their lives. “Behave as you do in a curfew and stay in your homes strictly. Either people understand the seriousness, remain in their homes or else we will have to impose curfew in the State,” he warned in a message posted on twitter.

The vehicles of essential services, allowed on roads, will include those of police, health care, water and power supply, disaster management and civil supplies. The exempted categories include the vehicles carrying vegetables, fruits, medicines, milk, petrol, LPG cylinders and newspapers.

The State government also decided to prepare 1 lakh quarantine beds where the COVID-19 positive patients could be shifted in an emergency situation. The beds will be situated in the hotels, hospitals, houses, hostels of recently closed educational institutions and other appropriately located buildings.

Each district was asked to prepare quarantine beds, while the highest number of 10,000 beds will be arranged in Jaipur. While asking the district administration to take the help of Army, paramilitary forces, home guards and civil defence in tackling the crisis, the State government also created a fund of ₹25 crore for doctors and paramedical staff engaged in the fight against the dreaded virus.

Medical & Health Minister Raghu Sharma said the prohibitory orders in force in the State during the lockdown would restrict the assembly of people to five or less. Earlier, there was a ban on the assembly of 20 or more people. Those found violating the order will be booked under Section 188 (disobedience of order) of Indian Penal Code.

Mr. Sharma said 29 persons had been arrested in different towns on charges of flouting prohibitory orders and spreading rumours on social media. Besides, strict action was being taken to prevent hoarding and black marketing of masks, sanitiser and foodgrains.

The number of COVID-19 positive cases in the State was 32 on Monday, with four new cases detected in Jodhpur and Pratapgarh. Additional Chief Secretary (Medical & Health) Rohit Kumar Singh said a total of 1,227 samples were tested so far, out of which 1,112 were found negative and 83 were being processed. Three coronavirus patients were cured, though one of them - an Italian tourist - later died of heart failure.

A COVID-19 Relief Fund has been established in the State to receive donations from public. Mr. Gehlot decided that all Ministers would contribute ₹1 lakh each and the Congress MLAs would give their one-month salary to the fund to combat coronavirus. A statement from Raj Bhawan said that the Governor, Kalraj Mishra, would donate his one-month salary to the fund.

Mr. Gehlot also wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the request for a relief package for the unorganised sector workers and to ensure food and social security for the weaker sections. He also sought concessions for tourism industry, hotels and micro, small and medium enterprises affected by the COVID-19 crisis.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cwkope/article30569953.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AshokGehlot-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rajasthan-announces-2000-crore-package-for-poor-during-lockdown/article31145419.ece
256,2020/03/24,Punjab imposes Statewide curfew after COVID-19 cases touch 23,"Relaxation only in urgent cases with permission from DCs

As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Punjab touched 23, with two new cases being reported, the government imposed a Statewide curfew on Monday.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh announced “full curfew with no relaxation” after reviewing the situation with senior government officials here. “The DCs have been asked to issue orders accordingly. Any person required to be given relaxation will be so allowed specifically for given period & purpose,” he said in a tweet.

Capt. Amarinder warned of strict action against any violation of the curfew, which, he said, was imposed “in the larger interest of the State”.

In a video message, he said the State government was forced to take this extreme step after receiving reports that people were moving around normally in towns, mohallas and cities despite the curbs that came into force on Monday morning.

Violation ‘unacceptable’

The Chief Minister said the violation of the restrictions by the people was “unacceptable” and it was the responsibility of his government, and his duty as its head, to “save Punjab”.

Making it clear that the curfew would continue 24 hours a day, he said only those with urgent needs would be allowed to go out after taking due permission from their respective DCs, whose mobile numbers would be shared with the public.

The State government also announced a slew of relief measures to support the affected masses as a result of the unprecedented restrictions.

According to an official statement, free food, shelter and medicines will be provided to those in need, for which ₹20 crore have been sanctioned from the CM’s relief fund. Officials concerned have been asked to extend all assistance to people in need.

According to the State’s health department, two new cases of COVID-19 were reported in Punjab on Monday. One patient is from Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district and is a family member of a positive case reported last week. The other patient is an 80-year-old woman of Mohali in Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar district.

257,2020/03/24,"With no GR, shortage at fair price shops","State had assured to provide advance food stock for April and May last week

The Maharashtra government’s delay in issuing orders to make advance food stocks available at fair price shops is leading to shortages at several locations.

The government had announced last week that in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, it would provide two months’ advance stock to the shops so that poor and needy do not suffer. However, 48 hours later, the distribution for the grain stocks for April and May had not begun, which would lead to hundreds going hungry, social activists said on Monday.

Last week, senior officials had said Maharashtra’s food security was not under threat, with reserve stocks lasting up to seven months. At any given time, the government is prepared to provide two months’ grain stocks to fair price shops, while the reserves can last up to seven months if the lockdown persists, officials had said after participating in a meeting to discuss possibilities of hoarding and black marketing in the wake of a lockdown.

“We are prepared at all levels and have already provided stocks in advance for April and May to fair price shops. In order to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which could also infect the beneficiaries of the public distribution system (PDS), we have directed shopkeepers not to carry out the beneficiaries’ biometric verification,” Minister for Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Chhagan Bhujbal had announced last week.

But many of the 5,200 fair price shops in Mumbai and Thane regions were falling short of stock. Worst affected were wage earners, who were not covered both by the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and the Antyodaya Anna Yojana.

“Today we received hundreds of complaints from Mumbai, especially parts of Thane and Chembur, where the poor were not able to get their daily ration from the shops. We fail to understand what has taken the Maharastra government 48 hours to issue a government resolution (GR) since it announced advance stocks will be made available,” said city-based food security activist Gorakh Avhad. “The worst hit are those living on the footpath, who are neither covered by the NFSA or Antyodaya,” he said.

Senior officials on Monday held meetings to cover those beneficiaries who are left out of NFSA and Antyodaya. “Today’s meeting was to ensure those left out of the two schemes are covered in our measures. We are concerned about the fate of wage earners and will issue the GR earliest,” said a senior official. The State has promised to provide ₹1,500 cash for daily wage-earning families, along with rice for a month, officials said.

258,2020/03/24,12 Mumbai patients on the way to recovery,"Pune couple’s 14th-day sample negative, Maharashtra count now 97

In a positive development, a repeat test of Maharashtra’s index patients — the Pune couple — came negative on Monday. Civic officials in Pune said that samples of the couple will be sent for testing again on Tuesday and if they are negative, the husband and wife will be discharged from the hospital.

The couple, who had travelled to Dubai and Abu Dhabi in a group of 40, was the first to test positive for COVID-19 on March 9. Chief Medical Officer of Pune Municipal Corporation, Dr. Ramchandra Hankare, said that the husband and wife have no symptoms. “If their second samples come negative, we will discharge them as per protocol and they will remain under home quarantine for another 14 days,” said Dr. Hankare. The couple was ecstatic when they were told about the negative reports by their doctors. “I can’t wait to go home. I don’t mind being home quarantined but I want to be at home,” the 42-year-old lady told The Hindu over phone.

Twelve COVID-19 patients admitted in Mumbai have tested negative in their two consecutive samples. “This a very good development as it means that the patients are on their way to recovery,” deputy executive health office Dr. Daksha Shah told The Hindu.

On Monday, 23 new cases of COVID-19 were reported from the State taking the total number to 97. The highest number of 13 cases was reported from Mumbai of whom 10 patients were contacts of the previous positive patients. According to Dr. Shah, 60% of the patients have mild symptoms. In Mumbai, a 37-year-old man who had a travel history to the U.S. remains on ventilator in a critical condition at Jaslok Hospital.

Sugar heartland

Meanwhile, the sugar heartland reported fresh cases on Monday with five people in Satara and Sangli districts testing positive.

Officials said a 45-year-old woman, hailing from Khandala in Satara, with a travel history to Dubai tested positive. The other four cases are members from one family — three male and one female — from Islampur tehsil in Sangli. All had a history of travel to Saudi Arabia. Additionally, one person each from Mumbai, Thane and Kalyan Dombivli also tested positive.

Earlier, another COVID-19 positive case was recorded in Pune city in the past 24 hours taking the total number of patients in Pune district, including Pimpri-Chinchwad, to 28.

According to district authorities, the new case is apparently another close contact of the 41-year-old city-based anganwadi worker with no history of foreign travel who had tested positive for the virus last week and is presently on ventilator support at the city’s Bharti hospital.

On Sunday, the four new cases which tested positive in Pune were close kin of this lady, one of whom is reportedly an IT professional, said authorities.

The lady, in her early 20s, is an employee of an IT major sited in Hinjewadi’s Rajiv Gandhi Infotech Park.

On Sunday, an internal communication sent to that company’s employees said that the offices would be shut till Tuesday evening as a precautionary measure.

The company’s premises are being sanitised and fumigated.

The communication sent to employees by the company’s senior officials said, “We are writing to let you know that a positive case of COVID-19 was detected among one of our employees in Pune, today. While we are providing all support to the concerned employee, we are also working with the health authorities on contact tracing as well as subsequent actions needed.”

The e-mail further said that to avoid unnecessary panic, only those who had been identified as potential contacts had been communicated with and advised of next steps they need to take (administering self-quarantine for 14 days at home) and other measures communicated by the govt health advisory.

Meanwhile, the district health officials have also started tracking those who came in contact with the anganwadi worker during her various trips across the State.

The lady had travelled to Vashi in Navi Mumbai on March 3 to attend a wedding and returned to Pune in the same cab the following day.

Sources said that a few days later, she attended a Zilla Parishad function at a village in Velhe tehsil, around 50 km from Pune city.

After displaying virus-like symptoms like a sore throat and dry cough, she visited a general practitioner and despite remaining home for a brief period, ventured out again to Varasgaon, 60 km from Pune.

She was finally admitted to Bharti hospital on March 16 and her samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) to test for the H1N1 virus (swine flu). Instead, she tested positive for COVID-19 on March 20.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uaq8fe/article31146273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BM--MULUNDNAKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/12-mumbai-patients-on-the-way-to-recovery/article31146274.ece
259,2020/03/24,"Borders sealed, complete lockdown in Maharashtra","Compelled to take action, people are still not serious: Uddhav Thackeray

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday announced a lockdown of the State beginning midnight on Monday to curb the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). He also announced the sealing of borders of all districts to prevent the movement of private vehicles, except those carrying essential and perishable supplies.

In his daily address to the State on Monday evening, the Chief Minister said, “I am compelled to announce a State-wide lockdown. While a majority of people are responding to the call to not come out on streets, there are many who aren’t doing this.”

“Yesterday we sealed the State borders and today we are sealing district borders. We will not allow it to spread to the districts which are unaffected as of now,” he said.

The next few days would be crucial as the fight against coronavirus has reached a “turning point”, said the Chief Minister.

An official notification issued after Mr. Thackeray’s address said the lockdown till March 31 is under section 2 of Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 read with all other enabling provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005.

All public transport services including inter-city buses and Metro will be stopped. Taxis with not more than two persons plus the driver, and autos with not more than one person will be allowed only for emergencies. Plying of private vehicles shall be restricted only to the extent of procuring essential commodities, health services etc. The inter-district movement of vehicles has also been cancelled.

Any congregation of more than five persons in public places stands prohibited. “All religious places of any denomination shall be closed,” the notification said. The government has also asked divisional commissioners, municipal commissioner and collectors to identify vacant places near hospitals to house health staff, if necessary.

Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi on Monday allowed railway staff to be ferried by suburban locals and private security staff to also use public transport. The State had allowed staff providing essential services to use State or BEST buses.

Further to that, the commissioner’s order issued on Sunday said, “In view of total shutdown of local train services in Mumbai, in view of running essential services, I have come to the conclusion that in addition to the earlier order, the train services of the railway will also be needed for providing transport for emergency service providers and since all the offices/establishments are closed, there will be a need for private security services to them to help the police maintain law and order.”

Railway staff and private security staff will be allowed to use MSRTC, BEST buses and local trains.

Uber suspends services

Uber will be suspending its services across key cities in the country in compliance with the government’s directives to limit movement in the wake of the rising number of cases of the novel coronavirus across the country including key cities such as Mumbai, Pune, Nagpur, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru.

“Uber is complying with all Central and State Government directives related to its services for containing the spread of Coronavirus. We are communicating the status of specific cities with riders through our app,’’ an Uber spokesperson said.

In a blog published on the company’s website, Uber said that services across India had been affected after the government decided to seal off 80 districts which had reported positive cases of novel coronavirus. “This means that, while we will continue to offer services to meet the essential and urgent travel needs of many communities we serve, some or all of Uber’s rides services will not be available till further notice in the following cities,” the blog stated.

Other cities where Uber services have been suspended include Tirupati, Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh; National Capital Region; Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Rajkot in Gujarat; Dhanbad, Jamshedpur, Ranchi in Jharkhand; Bengalure, Mysuru and Mangaluru in Karnataka; Amritsar, Chandigarh, Jalandhar, Ludhiana in Punjab; Ajmer, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Kota, Udaipur in Rajasthan; Hyderabad in Telangana; Agra, Bareilly, Kanpur, Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh; and Asansol, Durgapur, and Siliguri in West Bengal.

260,2020/03/24,Life always comes first: Mary Kom,"Indian stars concur that well-being of athletes is paramount

Life comes first, sport can wait. This was the collective view of India’s top Olympic-bound athletes, including M.C. Mary Kom and Saina Nehwal, as they lauded the Games’ postponement on Tuesday.

“The situation right now is not good. Life always comes first, everything else can wait. Players’ safety is paramount. Everyone who took this decision factored this in. I think it’s good,” said boxer Mary Kom.

Saina, who was racing against time to qualify for Tokyo, said, “happy that it’s postponed even though some of us haven’t qualified. We are eager to know what the qualification (process) would be like going ahead.”

India’s only individual Olympic champion Abhinav Bindra welcomed the decision and stressed on the need to immediately suspend training camps and guard the athletes in the wake of the pandemic.

Wrestler Bajrang Punia said training had been thrown haywire and the postponement is welcome.

“It’s a good decision because everyone is disturbed. Athletes’ health is paramount. No one is training properly. We first have to save people from this epidemic,” said Punia.

“We were prepared for Olympics. We were ready but what do you do when something like this happens. It’s beyond control,” grappler Ravi Dahiya said.

“Whatever happens, happens for a good reason. Now we have more time to prepare. It’s good for my performance. I will continue training,” said champion weightlifter Mirabai Chanu.

Shooter Rahi Sarnobat, who has qualified in the 25m air pistol event, said with her training hampered by a nationwide lockdown, she is feeling relieved.

“...since training had stopped, we would have needed another three-four months time to prepare. So, we wanted postponement. Now we can refresh ourselves and restart the competitions (training),” she said.

Hockey coaches’ view

Indian men’s hockey coach Graham Reid said the team is gutted by the postponement but understands the gravity of the health crisis.

“It is very disappointing that the Olympics will not go ahead, but given the unprecedented circumstances facing the world at present it is totally understandable and expected,” Reid said.

261,2020/03/24,Janaki Sabesh tells stories for children online,"Golpo – Tales Unlimited and Lil Trails will host online storytelling sessions at 5 pm every day till March 31

Do you feel like you need a tight hug? Your friendly neighbourhood elephant, Gajapati Kulapati, is right here to give you one. The character from Tulika’s books, is an all-time favourite; listening to actor and storyteller Janaki Sabesh enact his story online, feels exactly like a warm hug from the elephant himself.

The session, that Janaki did live on Instagram on March 17, was the first one that is part of the Online Storytelling Event by Lil Trails and Golpo – Tales Unlimited. Lil Trails is an initiative that young parents Avanti Natarajan and Rajavel Sundar started, to share their parenting journey, while Golpo is Janaki’s organisation that holds storytelling sessions and workshops. Together, they plan to host online storytelling sessions at 5 pm every day till March 31.

Lending the sessions plenty of good cheer with her trademark singsong way of narrating stories, is Janaki, who has also written a book for children with Tulika, called The Jungle Storytelling Festival. “Avanti and I decided to do something online for children at home due to the Corona situation,” she says, speaking over phone from Chennai. For Janaki, who is used to telling stories in front of eager, smiling faces, and the “instant gratification” that she received, getting comfortable with the online space took some time. “I was shying away from it for quite a while,” she admits.

But the response to their first session featuring the star elephant was “overwhelming”, and Janaki decided to plunge right in. “My sessions online too have songs and action thrown in,” she says, and adds that she has found a “whole new audience”.

Janaki and Avanti, the latter an artist herself, decided to add to the storytelling sessions — at the end of each of them, is an art tutorial by Lil Trails. “For this, Avanti and Raj will be joining me from Salem,” adds Janaki. Her narration of West African folktale Anansi The Spider, for instance, was followed by a two-minute art session during which Avanti showed children how to draw a simple spider. Children were encouraged to send photos of their version of the spider too and Janaki and team were thrilled to see their submissions. “Our inboxes were flooded with Anansi the spider,” she laughs.

The team is trying to come up with new ideas for every session. Yesterday, they featured a Make Your Golpo craft activity. Avanti showed parents and children how to make Four Cups with a piece of paper with words written on each side. She then encouraged them to come up with their own stories using the words and also share videos and photos of the activity.

While Janaki agrees that “nothing can take away from face-to-face interaction with children”, she adds that she finds it encouraging to see heart-warming messages from parents, and even grandparents. “It’s nice that everyone is joining in,” she says, adding that ultimately, all she wants to do at the moment, is “spread smiles”.

The Online Storytelling Event is at 5 pm every day, till March 31. Join the team live by following @maajanaki and @liltrails. The videos will also be uploaded on the Facebook page of Golpo Tales and LilTales’ IGTV.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/88zwkn/article31153029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Janaki-Sabesh,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/janaki-sabesh-tells-stories-for-children-online/article31153030.ece
262,2020/03/24,"Over 50,000 small units stop production","Nearly 50,000 micro, small and medium-scale enterprises (MSMEs) in Coimbatore, employing over five lakh workers, have stopped operations since Tuesday evening.

A couple of large-scale industries here declared on Monday that they were stopping production at its plants in the district.

Heads of 14 industrial associations met the District Collector K. Rajamani here on Tuesday and based on his appeal, decided to shutdown during the lock down period.

Though industries can operate with 50 % workforce, considering the safety of the district, which is one of the those with COVID-19 cases, the Collector urged the industries to down shutters, said J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Tiny Enterprises. The micro units started closing since Tuesday afternoon. Many workers have left for their homes in nearby towns, taking an advance amount with them, he said.

Workers who wanted to leave for their hometown have left and for those who are staying back, arrangements have been made for their food. Those who left have been paid advance money, according to president of Coimbatore Tiruppur District Micro and Tiny Enterprises Association president C. Sivakumar. “Our members will keep the units closed. If there are non-member units that still operate and it comes to our notice, we will advise them to shut shop,” he said.

At the SIDCO Industrial Estate at Kurichi, units that want to can stop voluntarily. However, there are issues such as raw material availability and cannot sell the materials. Some units may operate for one or two days, says P. Nallathambi, president of Coimbatore SIDCO Industrial Estate Manufacturers Welfare Association.

President of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association R. Ramamurthy said the delegation pointed out to the Collector that the units cannot pay the interest for bank loans during the lock down period. “The Collector has asked the District Lead Manager to write to the banks in this regard,” he said.

Some of the demands of the industry here are: banks should not have any transaction during the lock down period, when the industries will be shut down, Governments should support the MSMEs in paying wages to the workers during this period, financial institutions should extend ad hoc additional 25 % working capital, banks should not declare any MSME account as NPA till March next year, local bodies should help disinfect the MSMEs, and the minimum demand and average electricity charges should be waived off.

Mr. Ramamurthy added that he has written to all the banks requesting that interest amount for working capital and term loans should be postponed till end of June. “No interest should be charged for working capital, term loans and EMIs on March 31, 2020,” the Association said.

A day after a 25-year-old woman, who returned from Spain, tested positive for COVID-19 in Coimbatore, Health Department was in the efforts to gather details of persons who travelled with here on flight and train.

Though a Health Department official claimed that they traced the train and flight on which she travelled, details were not shared. Health Department sought the help of Southern Railway to track the co-passengers in train on which she travelled from Bengaluru to Coimbatore.

“It is very important to trace the entire travel history of a person tested positive for COVID-19. Co-passengers in flight and train should be identified and they need to be kept under observation. If required, tests should be done.

These co-passengers will interact with several other people including family members and friends without knowing the fact that they travelled in close proximity with a person who contracted the virus,” said a public health expert who did not want to be named.

While her father and sister were in quarantine at hospital from Sunday, driver of a taxi in which she travelled from Coimbatore railway station to her house near Saibaba Colony, two of her friends, doctors and medical team, who attended to her while collecting swab sample and in quarantine, were under observation.

“The woman refused to remain in hospital quarantine and left for home despite knowing the fact that her friend in Spain contracted COVID-19. Then we contacted her father and advised the risks involved in staying at house or roaming freely.

268,2020/03/24,State’s border closure order violated at Athibelle,"Two days after the State government ordered closure of inter-state borders, with exceptions to movement of essential commodities and emergency travels such as bereavement, the directive was lost on the teams that were stationed at the border to block the movement of public and screen commuters who had compulsions of an emergency travel.

On Monday, in what appeared to be holiday travel to their native places, hundreds of residents from Bengaluru and other small towns in Karnataka entered into Tamil Nadu, nullifying the government’s orders to close the border to prevent potential community transmission from a floating population from the neighbouring States that saw a spike in the number of COVID-19 cases.

The safety protocols that emphasise on physical distancing was completely lost, as a steady stream of commuters dropped off by Karnataka State Transport Corporation buses at Athibelle, hopped on to and jostled for space in any tempo and truck passing into Tamil Nadu. The health and sanitation teams stationed with four thermal scanners were faced with an overload of commuters. As a result, random thermal scanning became the norm.

While a team of Hosur Corporation sanitised vehicles with disinfectant solution (that consisted of eight litres of water with 100 ml of the solution) commuters huddled together in the vehicles were not screened. According to a health team worker, the commuters were asked if they have any symptoms and if they claimed none, they were not tested.

The Karnataka State Transport Corporation buses continued to pick up and drop hundreds of passengers at Tamil Nadu border.

According to Giri, Sanitation Inspector of Hosur Corporation, leading the sanitisation teams for incoming vehicles, the “border is not closed”. “Only Karnataka buses were not allowed into our border and our buses are not allowed into Karnataka. But people are allowed,” he said. As of Monday noon, an exodus of Tamil residents continued, rendering infructuous the intentions and immediacy of sealing the inter-state border. District Collector S.Prabhakar said that was the reason a request was made for Section 144, because movement of people could not be controlled.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/40bndz/article31146186.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KA24BORDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/states-border-closure-order-violated-at-athibelle/article31146187.ece

The market is also not accepting the goods. The District Administration has also given orders to stop all trading activities in the district, he added. It is estimated that the goods worth ₹750 crore will not be produced from Tuesday for eight days.

M. Nachimuthu, president of Karur Exporters’ Association, said about 500 exporting units that employ nearly two lakh workers in Karur have decided to stop production from March 24 to 31. The units will pay wages to the workers for these days. The annual export turnover of Karur is nearly ₹5,000 crore. Just 20 % of the buyers are willing to take the orders placed. However, exporters face challenges in sending these goods too, he said.

The Southern India Mills’ Association has communicated to its members, who are mainly textile mills, that many industries have suspended their operations and shut down the units till March 31 or till normalcy is restored to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Those units that are not in a position to operate the mills are advised to provide lay off to the workers. But, in the case of lay off, 50 % of the wages need to be paid, till suspension is revoked.

M. Senthil Kumar, head of the Palladam Hi-Tech Weaving Park, said several weaving units in the State have already stopped production. But the units will need to pay wages to the workers. And, continue to pay fixed charges and taxes. So the Government should come out with announcements on supporting the industry financially.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/n3tcuv/article31146021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB24KPRMILL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/textile-units-in-tamil-nadu-to-stop-production-from-today/article31146022.ece

273,2020/03/24,Districts brace for Section 144,"Inter-State borders closed, but essential commodities will be available

With prohibitory orders coming into effect from 6 p.m. on Tuesday, officials have started taking necessary precautionary measures. Erode Collector C. Kathiravan said inter-State borders were already closed, but essential commodities would be available.

He warned traders against creating artificial demands for essential commodities and increasing the prices.

Mr. Kathiravan said people who had returned to Erode district from foreign countries after March 1 should report to the administration so that they could be monitored by health officials.

In Namakkal, Collector K. Megraj said discussions were held with traders on enforcing the prohibitory orders. “Only shops selling essential goods will be allowed to function. Taluk-level supply officers have been asked to look into overpricing. Door deliveries will be encouraged. Shop owners have been asked to strictly follow social distancing”, he said.

Namakkal Superintendent of Police Ara.Arularasu said all seven check posts would be locked down and only essential vehicles would be allowed. “Social distancing must be practised and tea shops in rural areas will have to be closed. We have asked public to avoid unnecessary social gatherings”, he said.

Salem Superintendent of Police S. Deepa Ganiger said “There are 23 check posts including an inter-State check post near Kolathur. Only vehicles carrying essential goods will be allowed to cross the border”. Mr. Kathiravan said two persons in T.N.

Indumathi, a regular customer at Thyagi Kumaran Market in the city, had to struggle to come out of the market on Monday evening after her purchases.

“Prices have doubled for all the vegetables,” she said. As the State government announced complete lockdown from 6 p.m., March 24, people rushed to super markets and vegetable markets in the city to buy their requirements.

Surya and his friends were also at the market. They are from West Bengal and working at a gold smithy in the city. “We cannot go back home as there are no trains or buses. We usually buy vegetables at a shop nearby. Since we need to buy more vegetables, we came to the market,” he said.

“They have told us that we can keep the shops open till tomorrow evening. We do not know what will happen after that,” said an onion vendor at the market.

At the Pazhamudir Nilayam supermarket on Avinashi Road, customers waited in queues as only 50 people can be inside the market at any given time. There were repeated announcements asking customers to finish buying their needs soon so that others can come in. “We cannot run the air conditioner and cannot have a crowd inside. So we are allowing customers only in batches,” said the manager of the market.

“People are scared. We plan to keep all shops in the wholesale markets open till specific orders from the Government as vegetables are essential commodities. We will continue to receive vegetables from other States,” said M. Rajendran, president of the Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association.

There was absolutely no movement of vegetables on Sunday. Hence, there was slight shortage, he said.

Meanwhile, officials of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India inspected vegetable and fruit stalls to regulate the crowd as people rushed to them in large numbers for shopping ahead of the curfew. Food safety officials inspected stalls at Peelamedu and Arts College Road and advised management to avoid gathering of people as a precaution against possible spread of COVID-19.

275,2020/03/24,Vegetable prices up due to panic buying,"Panic buying by people, both after the ‘Janata Curfew’ in the morning and lockdown announcement across the State in the evening, has increased the price of vegetables by over 30% here on Monday. Consumers complained of non-availability of essential commodities, including vegetables and milk.

After the curfew ended at 5 a.m., traders and consumers thronged the Nethaji Vegetable Daily Market where the arrival of vegetables was very less due to curfew on Sunday. Tomato that was sold at ₹ 5 to ₹ 10 a kg last week was sold at ₹ 30 to ₹ 40 while the price of other vegetables had also gone up by 30% to 60%.

“As the lockdown was expected, shops may be closed for another one week and hence we are purchasing more,” said a group of consumers from Moolapalayam. They said that availability of vegetable was also less and the price had also gone up. Since Uzhavar Sandhais were closed, people thronged the temporary shops that functioned outside the shandy.

As many of the retail vegetable shops were closed due to non-arrival of vegetables, the consumers had to depend on the few shops that had stocks. Also, departmental stores and provisional stores drew more customers as people bought essentials for at least a week.

The Federation of All Trade and Industry Associations of Erode District has urged the traders to declare holidays for their establishments till March 31. Its general secretary C. Balakrishnan has urged the traders to extend their cooperation to the government.

Special Correspondent adds from Krishnagiri

Scurried buyers, inadequate month-end stocks in stores and a general sense of panic caused chaos in grocery stores here.

278,2020/03/24,District administration to paste sticker on houses of people under home quarantine,"Official sources say there are more than 375 persons under such watch

Starting Tuesday, Coimbatore district administration will start pasting stickers on houses of people under watch and quarantined at home.

According to sources, the decision was taken after a video conference meet senior district, Health Department officials and others had with their seniors in Chennai.

The sources said that there are more than 375 persons under such watch and on their houses, Health Department officials with support from their Revenue Department counterparts would paste the stickers.

At the Coimbatore airport, the doctors at mobile medical team would stamp on the wrists of persons showing fever symptoms for providing further medical assistance.

The sources said at the meeting a suggestion was made for posting police personnel outside the houses of those under medical observation but it was decided against doing so to not cause panic among people and draw adverse comments.

Earlier in the day, Collector K. Rajamani told reporters that the district administration continuously monitored the situation at the inter-State border.

It permitted movement of only vehicles that carried essential commodities and restricted movement of people.

Within the district too it was keeping tab on developments, including the health of a woman who had tested COVID-19 positive after returning from Spain.

She was at the ESI hospital and responding well to treatment.

With the closure of education institutions, malls, department stores and other places of entertainment and people voluntarily staying indoors on Sunday to confirm to the Janata Curfew call, the district administration enjoyed the people’s support and there was no need for panic.

Appeal to foreginers

Mr. Rajamani appealed to foreigners residing in the district and Indians with a travel history to foreign countries or other states in the recent past to report to staff from the Revenue Department or Health and Family Welfare Department or police or local body so that the administration could keep tab on their health.

The Government of India and Government of Tamil Nadu seriously viewed the pandemic and was taking all steps possible to contain the spread of the virus.

The people had been cooperating and would do well to extend further cooperation.

279,2020/03/24,"Teaching, non-teaching faculty continue to work","Even as the State government imposed restrictions on people’s movement under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code in its efforts to combat the spread Covid-19, teaching and non-teaching faculty continued to work.

The faculty and administrative staff reported for work even though the government had a fortnight ago closed colleges for students.

Sources in the Department of Collegiate Education said that faculty and non-teaching staff in the 14 government-run and 18 government-aided colleges in the Coimbatore region continued to work as there was no communication from the Department.

The Coimbatore region comprised Coimbatore, the Nilgiris, Tiruppur and Erode districts.

Commenting on the issue, former general secretary, Association of University Teachers, C. Pichandy said the Government should have long ago taken a stand saying colleges were closed for teaching and administrative staff as well.

Just as the health of students was important, so was that of faculty.

What was the use of faculty reporting for work in the absence of students, asked N. Pasupathy, State president of the Association.

There was nothing that the faculty could do in the absence of students. And, the government not issuing directions and thereby asking the faculty and administrative staff to work had no meaning.

Instead of treating the faculty and staff like any other government employee, the government would do well to issue instructions asking them to not report for work.

It could ask the faculty and administrative staff to return to work when it reopened colleges so that they worked together to complete the academic year.

It was all the more important that the government did so as it had imposed restriction of people’s movement and stopped inter-district transport.

The Department sources said the Government was yet to issue any directions on faculty and staff reporting for duty. The teaching and non-teaching staff associations had submitted representations which the Department had taken to the notice of senior officials.

They hoped to get a clarification soon, the sources added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/teaching-non-teaching-faculty-continue-to-work/article31145941.ece

281,2020/03/24,Michael Holding weighs in on Sandpapergate,"March 24, 2018, a dark day for Australian cricket

“Faf is being held together by... I was going to say by sticky tape, but that’s probably not the right thing.” So began the announcement, nearly four days after the Newlands incident in 2018, of the then South Africa coach Ottis Gibson, who had a dig at Australia’s ball-tampering weapon of choice.

Australia had its moments when it was exceptionally good, but this was one of its lowest points. Eventually, the players would come good and they would be strong again. It was just one of those things, but March 24 marked two years since Australian cricket was thrown into turmoil by the Cape Town Sandpapergate scandal.

Steven Smith and David Warner, formerly captain and vice-captain of Australia, were banned from playing international and domestic cricket for 12 months by Cricket Australia for their roles in the scandal while Cameron Bancroft, the player caught tampering the ball, was banned from playing for nine months.

Michael Holding.

The reception Australia has got since that fateful Test against South Africa has usually oscillated between disgust and awe. Michael Holding, West Indies fast-bowling great who was part of the commentary team during the Test, dismisses the notion that the fallout was over the top.

Comparison

“I don’t think so,” said Holding, “considering the level of punishments meted out to individuals and teams whose crime was to not bowl enough overs in a day. And I think the bigger crime was to try and cover up what took place instead of just taking it on the chin and apologising.”

Holding did not see the incident live. He had just come off commentary when a broadcasting colleague brought it to his attention. “I went outside the Supersports commentary box only to be asked by a commentator from another network if I had seen what happened,” Holding recalled. “I went back and watched all the replays from various angles. My immediate reaction was dismay. I couldn’t believe anyone could be so naïve to do what he [Bancroft] did in today’s world.”

Holding said he never felt disrespected by the Australians during his playing days. “When playing against Australia, I always considered them tough opponents who took no prisoners on the field, but that’s where the ‘war’ ended,” he said.

“I can honestly say I was never the subject of any racial or personal abuse, and never heard any either. I played against some tough guys. That said, sometimes what you hear through stump microphones these days, it seems times have changed and not for the better.”

Holding has “no idea” whether Smith and Warner are better for their experience. “I remember seeing an advertisement that Smith did while under suspension, referring to his involvement in the scandal which, in my opinion, was in poor taste. It didn’t suggest to me that there was any remorse. I don’t know either gentleman, so can only go by what I see.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/dfcsrq/article31156527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25BANC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/holding-weighs-in-on-sandpapergate/article31156531.ece
282,2020/03/24,The day Grant Elliot lit up Eden Park,"The New Zealand batsman relives the wonderful run of the Kiwis in 2105 World Cup

More often than not, things fall into place by design. Grant Elliott should know. On the night of March 24, 2015, in Auckland, he sent a rapturous Eden Park into delirium, when with five needed off two balls, he clubbed Dale Steyn over wide long-on to power New Zealand to its maiden World Cup final.

In a chat with a Sportstar, the 41-year-old former all-rounder relives the final two overs of the run-chase.

Q: The last over, with 12 to get, what were you and Dan Vettori discussing?

I felt like the game was missed once I hit a full toss straight to extra cover, but Dan’s shot down to wide third man gave us the edge again. With two balls to go, Dan said it was up to me to finish the game. I was the man in, on 70 odd. It is the most satisfying job in the world when you manage to be there not out and hit the winning runs.

Q: With five runs required off two and Dale Steyn steaming in, what was going through your head?

The first thing that went through my head is “don’t f%^& this up!” There was also the issue of my sister's wedding, which I told her to book (On the day of the final). If I hit the winning runs I wouldn’t be able to go. What relaxed me was finding her in the crowd. So I looked towards where she was sitting and I didn’t want to be remembered as the guy who couldn’t get the team over the line in a semifinal.

Q: Looking back on that campaign, how does it feel now?

There were so many special performances which helped us get to the final. Tim Southee's 7 wickets, Martin Guptill's 200, Dan Vettori’s leadership and catch against West Indies, Brendon McCullum's amazing cameos at the top, Kane Williamson six against Australia, Trent Boult's whole tournament, Adam Milne's pace, Taylor's experience ….. the list goes on. Everyone stepped up when we needed to.

Q: Brendon McCullum’s influence on that campaign?

Brendon is someone who leads by actions He was in the trenches with us and demanded full effort. If he got that, he was happy and if he didn’t he would let you know.

Q: Last year, it must have been hard watching the final against England?

Quite frankly I can’t watch that game again! I felt for the players but the way they carried themselves was something which all aspiring future cricket stars can follow.

Q: How much has New Zealand cricket changed in the last five years?

I don’t think too much has changed. The 3-0 win in the ODI’s against India and then 2-0 in Test victories show what a world-class squad we have.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/the-day-grant-elliot-lit-up-eden-park/article31155193.ece

Supreme Court interlocutors Sanjay Hegde and Sadhana Ramachandran on Tuesday issued a statement urging both the authorities and the Shaheen Bagh protesters to not do anything that may exacerbate the situation at a time when the nation is focusing its resources to fight the Coronavirus scare.

The statement was issued after the authorities cleared the Shaheen Bagh protest site.

“We request everyone to see the issue not as a question of win or lose. The country has a grave pandemic threatening it and currently that must receive priority in terms of everyone's attention.

The National Restaurant Association of India, which sent out an advisory to all restaurants to shutdown operations till March 31 due to the Coronavirus pandemic, appealed to the Finance Ministry on Monday for financial relief so that the industry may survive.

Anurag Katriar, President of NRAI, in a letter to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that while preventing loss of direct jobs was the association’s prime concern, it was also concerned about the dreams of many young entrepreneurs in the sector getting shattered due to the calamity.

“We, as an industry, operate with a very high proportion of fixed operating expenses which makes our business high-risk even in case of moderate revenue fluctuations. Now we are staring at almost zero revenue in the immediate term and at least 50% drop for months thereafter. We are therefore seeking support from everyone in the ecosystem in mitigating these fixed operating costs so that our losses are contained to manageable levels,” Mr. Katriar said.

Some of the demands made are deferment of all statutory dues at the Central and State level, moratorium on bank loans, restoration of input tax credit on GST for the sector and a general invocation of force majeure clause in view of te global pandemic.

“We are staring at unmeasurable losses, prospect of several businesses closing down and most importantly, a scary spectre of job loss to millions in the sector employing more than seven million people,” the NRAI said.

The NRAI had advised its members on March 20 to keep their restaurants shut.

With the COVID-19 cases escalating, people from Northeastern States in the city are getting racially taunted. At least two women from Manipur have registered complaints in the last couple of days.

On Sunday night, a 26-year-old MPhil Scholar from the University of Delhi, was allegedly spat on by a man on his scooty, who called her “Coronavirus” before fleeing in a “dark alley” near Baccha Park in Mukherjee Nagar area. The woman, from Manipur, said that she and her friend were returning to their paying guest accommodation after buying vegetables when the incident happened.

“One man, aged around 50 years, slowed down his scooty and spat paan on my face and called us ‘Coronavirus’ and drove away,” she said.

As soon they reached their accommodation, they called the police and lodged a complaint. “This is not the only incident we have faced. We have been called names and now they are spitting on us. We are not the ones who brought the virus to Delhi. We came here to study and with a hope of a better future. We are also Indians. Why should we be discriminated in our own land?” she asked.

The police have registered a First Information Report. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North West) Vijyanta Arya said that a case under section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC has been registered and CCTV footage is being scanned to identify the man on scooty.

Online abuse

In another incident, a 28-year-old political activist, Angellica Aribam from Manipur, was racially attacked online. She has lodged a complaint with Delhi Police Cyber Cell and the Northeast Cell Nodal Officer via email. Ms. Aribam told The Hindu that she had urged a Minister to take steps regarding COVID-19 on Twitter, after which she was hurled with racial slurs, besides copping threats on Facebook.

“The trolling turned racist and a graphic image was posted by a user. That’s when I decided that I’ll not take this. I also called the Northeast helpline and they offered to send a police official but I thought it wasn’t required,” she said.

Subsequently, she wrote to Delhi Police, and on Monday afternoon received a call from Cyber Crime Unit, who promised legal action. Ms. Aribam said that people from the Northeast have been facing racism regularly. “The reason is that we don’t have an anti-racism or discrimination law. People think they can comment and get away with it. No leader talks about it. There is a lack of political will,” she said.

General Secretary of Manipur Students Association Thokchom Veewon said that because of COVID-19 outbreak, a lot of students have left for their hometown. “Because of the features of the people from Northeast, they are being ridiculed as ‘Coronavirus’. They are being teased by calling “corona” at sight, treated differently at shops, convenience stores, etc. for which videos have been shared on social media. This is a total act of blatant ignorance and racial discrimination,” he said.

He also said that a lot of students have shared similar experiences.

300,2020/03/24,"Decided to decongest jails to contain virus, govt. tells HC","Convicts to be given emergency parole, special furlough options

The AAP government told the Delhi High Court on Monday that it has decided to decongest Capital’s prisons by providing convicts with the options of emergency parole and special furlough to contain the spread of COVID-19 among inmates.

A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad, taking note of the submission, directed the Delhi government to take necessary steps within two days to implement its decisions.

Amendment proposed

The Delhi government submitted that it is proposing to amend its prison rules to provide the options of emergency parole and special furlough in emergency situation, threats of epidemic, natural disaster or other situations which warrants immediate easing of the population of the inmates.

“However, the mechanism in respect of the same is yet to be formalised by the authorities concerned,” the government counsel said.

The government’s submission came while responding to a plea moved by two lawyers seeking to bring down the occupancy rate in the prisons in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The petitioners submitted that prisoners who can be released on furlough, parole and emergency parole may be released at the earliest.

Separate petition

A separate petition on the issue has also been moved before the High Court seeking direction to the Delhi government and prison authorities to immediately provide masks and hand sanitisers to all the inmates in Tihar jail and other jails of Delhi.

The petition filed by advocate Vikas Padora has also sought directions to spray disinfectants or quarantine the jail premises. Mr. Padora also sought to set up isolation wards in the jail premises where the infected inmate or inmate having symptoms can be lodged safely.

It has urged the court to give directions so that the spread of Coronavirus disease can be contained as much as possible in the jails across India.

“As per the data available, Tihar jail has a capacity of 5,200 inmates, but more than 12,100 inmates are currently lodged in the jail, which clearly shows that the Tihar jail is excessively overcrowded and functioning beyond its capacity,” the petition said.

“The same is the situation with most of the jails in India,” Mr. Padora added.

The Delhi High Court on Monday ordered the AAP government to set up health facility at the Idgah in Old Mustafabad, which houses over 600 riot victims, particularly in light of the Coronavirus pandemic.

A Bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that health facility equipped with doctors, public health officials, equipment etc. for emergency medication must be set up at the camp site within 48 hours.

“Further, adequate sanitation workers with equipment shall be deputed at the camp site, if not already deputed, for maintaining hygiene in the area and keeping the surrounding areas clean to avoid infection and contagious diseases,” the Bench ordered.

The High Court’s direction came on two petitions filed by residents of the Idgah camp seeking directions to the government to deploy a team of qualified doctors and public health officials for screening and testing and treating the residents of the camp in light of the pandemic.

The petitioners submitted that they and their families have been housed in the camp since March 2 after riots broke out in north-east Delhi. They submitted that the camp currently has 600 victims.

‘Poor conditions’

They contended that they have been compelled to move the High Court in view of the poor health and sanitation conditions prevailing in the camp. This, the petitioners said, is likely to result in the spread of Coronavirus disease, besides other communicable diseases, fungal infections and adversely impact the health of the residents.

Earlier, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, under whose jurisdiction the area falls, had assured the High Court that it would take steps for maintenance and upkeep of cleanliness and sanitation in the camp.

Amid the COVID-19 outbreak, riot victims at the Idgah relief camp in north-east Delhi’s Mustafabad allege that they are being asked to vacate the premises at the earliest. Without their own place, they stare at an uncertain future.

At the camp, which was set up by Delhi Waqf Board in the last week of February, inhabitants claimed that three tents were removed while the volunteers “rudely” told them to vacate.

“For the last two days, the volunteers have been asking us to leave the camp. They claim that people living close to the camp are complaining because of the public toilet vans on the street. They removed one camp on Saturday afternoon, another on Sunday night and one more on Monday evening,” said Imran Khan (32), a resident of Shiv Vihar, who left his rented house on February 25 out of fear after the violence. When he returned, he found it looted and vandalised.

He also alleged that most camp-residents haven’t received any government compensation. “Where are we supposed to go? We have our own house in Shiv Vihar but we are five brothers, besides the parents. There is no space. Therefore, my wife and I are staying here. I have not received any compensation from the government despite submitting documents. If I get the money, I could start my work and rent a place,” Khan said.

Vulnerable to disease

Sharing his inability to move out of the camp, Khan said he can’t go to any relative’s house because no one is ready to take any extra person in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak. “We had kept the beds at a distance because of Coronavirus. But as they have removed three camps, people will have to bring the beds closer, which make them vulnerable to the disease,” he said.

Another inhabitant, Kamruddin, is disgruntled at the local leaders, who he says barely visit the premises. “At least, they can solve the issues of hygiene raised by locals,” he said. He also alleged that food quality has deteriorated and several medicines are not available at the camp. “We are glad that we are getting food but earlier, we were getting food of better quality. Now they’re giving the same dish twice a day,” he said.

‘Volunteers rude’

Salma, a 38-year-old resident of Shiv Vihar, alleged that the inhabitants have been asked to fend for themselves. “We are being asked to do everything ourselves. As of now, we have started washing the utensils. The volunteers have started speaking so rudely,” she said, adding that when advocates come to check on them, the volunteers lie and claim they are not asking them to leave.

The inhabitants claimed they were not provided with hand sanitisers and hand wash, indispensables during the outbreak. “It was the first day of the lockdown and people were moving in and out as they pleased. However, those living here are taking precautions themselves. The officials here have not provided any sanitisers or even hand wash,” said Imran Khan.

Responding to the allegations, Mohammed Imran, media coordinator [Idgah relief camp] and Nodal Officer of Delhi Waqf Board, said that sanitisers and masks were provided but “they don’t know where they went”.

He said that people at the camp have been asked to go “only if they are willing to”. “Given the situation of an epidemic, those who have rented places have been asked to leave in case they can. No one has been forced. People should think about others where lives are at risk,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/i0vn12/article31146995.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL24-IDGAH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/riot-victims-at-relief-camp-asked-to-leave-stare-at-uncertain-future/article31146996.ece

Delhi Police said people associated with essential services will be issued “curfew passes” and that all border pickets will be sealed with “immediate effect” as the execution of the prohibitory orders in the national capital was “not up to the mark today”.

Workers’ woes

At the Kapashera border, several workers could be seen crossing into Delhi by foot trying to make their way to railway stations and bus stops to find some means of transport home. Many private vehicles were seen trying to persuade the police to let them cross the border but were sent back if they did not have a valid reason.

Arvind Pal, who works at an MNC in Noida, said that after the announcement of the “lockdown”, he had not received any message from his office regarding a work-from-home option, so he decided to venture out but was sent back. “Monday was a little chaotic as most offices did not give instructions and many people tried to cross the border, causing traffic jams. Once the public knows that it is being enforced strictly, I am sure that nobody will defy the curbs,” said Mr. Pal.

Shops selling groceries and medicines were open but markets continued to sport a deserted look.

Various residents' welfare associations in the Capital tried to strictly implement the shutdown, granting no entry to house helps, drivers and newspaper vendors on the society premises. While common areas like swimming pool, clubs and gym were already shut since the past few weeks to avoid COVID-19 spread, society associations have now locked the children parks along with restrictions on assembly of more than four people.

Munish Jain, president of the Aditya Mega City Residents' Welfare Association in Indirapuram, said that social distancing is necessary and they wre implementing it in the most efficient way possible, and that people largely followed them.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/4g6mmo/article31146960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE23PASSENGERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/curbs-in-the-capital-get-off-to-a-stuttering-start/article31146961.ece
304,2020/03/24,COVID-19 | Private labs in Delhi could start coronavirus testing this week,"Several diagnostic laboratories waiting for licences, registration numbers from govt. to carry out tests

Private diagnostics laboratories here may be ready to conduct tests for COVID-19 in under a week, heads of some laboratories said on Monday.

Diagnostic laboratories, accredited with by the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) and with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) capabilities would be allowed to carry out such tests said, Ravi Gaur, CEO of Oncquest laboratories in Safdarjung, one such laboratory in Delhi.

To this end, Dr. Gaur said, his laboratory, just as several others was waiting to receive a licence or registration number for testing, from the government. The license number is crucial said, Dr. Arjun Dang, of Dang labs, another facility which is said to have the capacity to test for COVID-19. The number will be a proof of authenticity of any test report put out by the laboratory.

However, after the labs receive the licences, they are required to follow some steps till the testing can be started. Among these, include ICMR-NIV, validating which, test kits can be used to carry out the test. While only two such test kits were initially being allowed, which had been approved by the US FDA or by the EU CE, use of more test kits is also being validated, doctors said.

Once these kits are approved by the ICMR, they will be procured by laboratories depending on their requirement and then have to go through another set of “validation tests”, they said. This would involve procuring a positive control sample of the virus, to use on the test kits to make sure that they work, said Dr. Dang. Procuring of such a sample would have to be done either through government hospitals or via vendors, he added. If the kits procured by the lab produces the same result as that produced by the ICMR and passed any other validation test as required by the lab, they would be ready for use.

150 tests in a day

Oncquest labs has already procured kits approved by the ICMR, said Dr. Gaur, addin that it would be ready for conducting tests within two to three days after they received their registration number. About 150 such tests could be carried out in one day he added.

In the meantime, laboratories are undertaking training and re-training of their staff to ensure all safety precautions are undertaken. These relate to use of protective gear, disposal, sample collection and related activities. At at least these two laboratories, doctors said, samples would only be collected at home or be given from hospitals.

While many believe there was a need to start the conduction of tests soon, Dr. Dang said that they would begin operations only when they were absolutely sure of safety precautions and quality of the tests. Any sort of lack in these terms could mean reports turning out as false negatives or false positives, which could put more people at risk, he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/trj1z/article31148860.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24LABS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/covid-19-private-labs-in-delhi-could-start-coronavirus-testing-this-week/article31146948.ece

source. The BJP is in power at each of the three civic bodies in Delhi.

“Given their budgetary constraints, the civic bodies are not in a position to do so. It is imperative that the Delhi government release the funds due to the three civic bodies so provisions can be made in this regard failing which, the representatives of safai karamcharis have said they may strike work,” the source also said. Welcoming an increase in budget allocation to the three civic bodies “from ₹6,380 crore in 2019-20 to ₹6,828 crore for the ﬁnancial year 2020-21”, leader of house for the SDMC, Kamaljeet Sherawat said that the government was however not following the assurances made in the Assembly.

She also highlighted that the SDMC was facing a funds crunch due to a reduction in its share by the government and non-release of various funds.

She called for the release of funds of up to ₹294.08 crore under the Basic Rax Assignment as approved by the government and for the release of an additional ₹905 crore to help bring the city back to normalcy, she wrote.

We came to know about it only when the notice was pasted outside his flat,” said an angry resident, stating that such reckless behaviour endangered the lives of others.

The anxious neighbours approached the person, who confirmed that he had visited Nepal and on his return was screened at the airport and advised to approach the authorities concerned if he developed any symptoms of the COVID-19 infection.

A member of the residents’ welfare association said another person had recently visited Australia, while two others worked as air hostesses. “We will request the families to observe self-quarantine, as per the government’s directions. If necessary, we will provide them all the help to ensure that they don’t go out during the quarantine period,” he said.

The development came on a day when the association members stopped the entry of “outsiders” and made arrangements for sanitisers for those entering the gated residential complex. “The residents have been requested to pick up all the deliveries at the entrance gate itself,” said the member.

Work related to phase-II, in relation to an additional 1.40 lakh CCTV cameras, he said, had also been started and would be completed in 2020-21 for which he proposed an outlay of ₹250 crore in addition to ₹150 crore provided in the revised estimates of 2019-20.

The Delhi government, he said, will also replace all the street lights on Public Works Department roads with energy efficient LED lights which would reduce the running cost of electricity bills for street lights from ₹6 crore per month to ₹3 crore per month.

Wi-Fi facility

“This project’s cost shall be ₹100 crore and the work will be taken up in the year 2020-21…Our government is committed to provide the facility of free use of Wi-Fi to the general public by installing about 11000 Wi-Fi hotspots. The work has been started and about 2000 Wi-Fi Hotspots have been installed,” he said.

“Construction of three new projects: a slip road bridge on Kondli Bridge and additional bridge over Ghazipur drain to widen the road from Hindon Canal to Dharmashila and work to the new Ashok Nagar Metro Station will be started during the year 2020-21. All three projects will save people’s valuable time and will also save their energy and money,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/zg4y5i/article31146768.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23DELPRIYAFLYOVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/coming-fiscal-capital-to-get-improved-roads-wider-bridges-and-new-flyovers/article31146769.ece
317,2020/03/24,People associated with essential services to get curfew passes,"‘Execution of prohibitory orders not up to the mark on Monday’

The Delhi police on Monday said people associated with essential services will be issued curfew passes and that all border pickets will be sealed with “immediate effect” as the execution of the prohibitory orders in the national capital was “not up to the mark today”.

On Sunday, the police imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in the national capital till March 31 in view of the outbreak of COVID-19, banning protests and other gatherings.

Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code bans assembly of four or more people in one place.

An order issued by the Delhi Police Commissioner S.N. Srivastava stated that all border pickets be sealed with “immediate effect”. The essential goods be permitted without any hindrance, it said.

According to the order, for people employed in private organisations, who are engaged in essential services in the city, the respective organisations shall seek curfew passes from the office of Deputy Commissioner of Police of the area where the office is located. Additional DCP of the district concerned will issue the passes after assessing if the requirements are genuine.

Those private organisations which are located outside the national capital, in the neighbouring districts, may similarly seek curfew passes for the employees who commute from Delhi to those districts from the office of DCP of South-West, South-East, Shahdara, East, Outer-North or Outer districts of the Delhi Police.

Government officials who are engaged in essential services will have to produce their identity cards. For employees of private companies to whom the essential service is outsourced by the government, the movement shall be permitted on the basis of identity cards and authorisation issues by the government organisation concerned, the order stated.

The police said taht strict legal action would be taken against those violating the prohibitory orders.

“Strict checking shall be done at the border pickets and internal pickets within the city in every police station area to ensure that no gathering or movement takes place in contravention of the prohibitory orders,” the order said.

To ensure compliance of the prohibitory order, the police said, mobile patrolling by four-wheelers and motorcycles will be done. Announcements will be made in the areas seeking cooperation of people and informing them about legal actions that will be taken against those found to be violating the law.

The traffic police, police control rooms, Station House Officers and their supervisory officers shall move around to inspect the arrangement and ensure compliance of the order, the police said, adding that local officers will maintain close liaison with the neighbouring districts of adjoining States.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/people-associated-with-essential-services-to-get-curfew-passes/article31146767.ece
318,2020/03/24,"Capital to get 2,485 buses by next fiscal","Transport sector gets ₹5,941-cr. funds

The Capital’s transport sector has been allocated ₹5,941 crore in the 2020-21 budget, the second-highest allocation for the coming fiscal, with an aim to fulfil Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s guarantee of providing “the largest and cheapest public transport system” in India, Finance Minister Manish Sisodia said, adding that the government had set a target of bringing the total fleet of State-run buses to 11,000, and laying 500 km of Delhi Metro lines.

After a decade

“After a gap of about 10 years, new buses have been added in Delhi’s public transport system…buses with modern CCTV and ‘disabled-friendly lift’ have been included in the fleet for the first time in the country. New low-floor buses have been inducted for the first time since the Commonwealth Games. Altogether 2,485 new buses – 1,300 DTC and 1,185 cluster buses, including 685 electric buses – will be added to the fleet during 2020-21,” Mr. Sisodia added.

As many as 1,880 buses – 444 DTC and 1,436 cluster buses – will be purchased beginning 2021-22. He added that the government will continue providing free travel aboard buses. “I propose an outlay of ₹250 crore for the purchase of buses by DTC and ₹1,100 crore for gap funding of cluster buses…four depots, in Okhla, Harinagar, Vasant Vihar and Hasanpur. These will probably be the first multilevel depots of their kind in the country,” he said.

Work on additional corridors of Metro Phase III and NCR extensions of 158-km length, he said, had already been commissioned and the remaining work of about 2 kilometres will be completed during this financial year. The government, he said, had approved all six corridors of the metro phase – IV project.

“I propose an outlay of ₹900 crore for Metro Phase-IV project in 2020-21, in addition to ₹1,324 crore in revised estimates for 2019-20 and ₹200 crore released to the DMRC in 2018-19,” Mr. Sisodia said, adding that an outlay of ₹50 crore for the State Electricity Vehicle Fund had also been proposed.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/capital-to-get-2485-buses-by-next-fiscal/article31146761.ece
319,2020/03/24,"COVID-19 | Follow directions of AAP government or face strict action, warns Kejriwal","‘Govt. does not wish to make lives of people difficult but crisis must be tackled’

Strict action will be taken against those violating the Delhi government’s directions to adhere to a lockdown, which is aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 epidemic, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said here on Monday.

Citing Italy’s example in this regard, the Chief Minister stressed on the need for strict implementation of the lockdown even as he urged landlords to relax payment deadlines for tenants and appealed to people to help each other and try to ensure no one around them was forced to sleep hungry.

“The Delhi government has ordered a lockdown in Delhi from 6 a.m. today [Monday] till March 31 midnight, keeping in mind the outbreak of COVID-19. Today, a majority of people were following the rules and some violated them. It is important to understand the situation. The Delhi government does not wish to make the lives of people difficult but we are doing this to tackle the crisis,” he said.

“We have decided to impose the lockdown for the welfare of the residents of Delhi... The situation of first-world countries, like Italy and America is also alarming. We are fortunate that we got enough time to prepare in advance...The situation in Delhi is under control, but this is not the time to congratulate ourselves but follow the restrictions because if we do not take action today and the disease spreads to a large number of people then it is going to be tough,” he said.

From Tuesday, he said, if anybody was found violating the lockdown orders, the government would be forced to take strict action.

The restrictions put in place, however, were causing a financial burden on the poor and daily-wage labourers and steps had been taken to alleviate the same, he said. These, Mr. Kejriwal said, included the provision of 7.5 kg free ration to 72 lakh beneficiaries for one month and doubling pension under the widow pension scheme for 2.5 lakh beneficiaries, the old-age pension scheme for 5 lakh beneficiaries and the disability pension scheme for 1 lakh beneficiaries.

“The beneficiaries will get the pension amount for March and April, by April 7. We hope that all these measures will bring a little relief to these people and their families. In addition to this, we are also arranging for free lunch and dinner in 220 night shelters,” he said.

“Many people have asked me how they can help and contribute to combating this pandemic… I want people who are working from home to get full salary… I also want to tell the landlords that if the tenants say they are unable to pay the rent, then please do not force them,” he said.

Citing complaints from people who work in essential services, he said, the government had decided to allow 50% of the total State-run buses to ply on Tuesday instead of just 25% as had been decided for Monday.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cwelok/article31148820.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE24CM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/coronavirus-follow-directions-of-aap-govt-or-face-strict-action-warns-kejriwal/article31146760.ece
320,2020/03/24,"AAP govt. presents ₹65,000-cr. budget amid virus outbreak","2020-21 budget contains allocation to handle COVID-19 pandemic and recent riots; Opposition calls it ‘directionless and a juggling of statistics’

Finance Minister Manish Sisodia presented a ₹65,000-crore budget at the Delhi Assembly here on Monday with continuing focus on education, transport and health sectors. The Opposition BJP, however, termed it “directionless, disappointing and a juggling of statistics”.

Mr. Sisodia said the 2020-21 budget contained an allocation of ₹50 crore to confront the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in the city in addition to the necessary financial arrangements needed for the setting up of a ‘Campaign for Communal Harmony’ in the wake of the recent communal riots which ripped across north-east Delhi last month.

“This is the first budget of the government formed in Delhi for the third time under the leadership of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and I feel privileged that I have the opportunity to present the budget proposal in this House for the sixth consecutive time as the Finance Minister…The citizens of Delhi, under the leadership of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, have expressed their unwavering faith in the ‘Kejriwal model of governance’ over the last five years,” Mr. Sisodia said.

The proposed budget of ₹65,000 crore, he said, would be financed from tax revenue of ₹44,100 crore, non-tax revenue of ₹800 crore, capital receipts of ₹1,100 crore and compensation of ₹7,800 crore under GST among other sources and was 18.50% higher than the revised estimates of ₹54,800 crore in 2019-20.

Focus on education

“The basic foundation of the Kejriwal model of governance is guaranteeing the best possible education to every child in Delhi…There has been work on education in the past, but the drawback was that only 5% of children were provided with excellent education and 95% of children were left with ordinary education. We have transformed this,” he said.

Mr. Sisodia proposed to spend ₹15,815 crore for the education sector, which is 24.33% of the total budget including, ₹443 crore for education-related schemes and an amount of ₹7031 crore for the implementation of various programmes, schemes and projects related to the sector.

Health sector

For the health sector, Mr. Sisodia said he proposed a budget provision of ₹7,704 crore which included an amount of ₹3,952 crore for the implementation of various schemes, programmes and projects under the sector which was 55% higher than the revised estimate of ₹2,551 crore for 2019-20. This also included an immediate provision of ₹3 crore in the current fiscal’s revised estimates and ₹50 crore for the coming financial year to confront the COVID-19 epidemic.

“These are initial allocations and more will be made to tackle the epidemic as and when required. I assure you the government will leave no stone unturned in this regard,” he said.

Transport sector

A budgetary allocation of ₹5,941 crore was made for the public transport sector of which ₹2,678 crore has been allocated for various programmes and schemes including, an outlay of ₹₹250 crore for the purchase of buses by the DTC and ₹1,100 crore for the viability gap funding of cluster buses.

While an outlay of ₹1,700 crore was made for development work in unauthorised colonies, ₹400 crore was pledged for the development of rural areas, ₹193 crore was proposed for the improvement of road infrastructure and ₹40 crore was dedicated to promote startups.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari alleged the budget was “directionless, disappointing and a juggling of statistics”. The people of Delhi, he said, had “high expectations” from the budget, but once again, the Kejriwal government had shown “step-motherly behaviour” towards them.

“Like last year, this time too, the Delhi government has shown only dreams to the people of Delhi and no new plan has been introduced through this budget… the development of Delhi was never a priority for the Delhi government. New schools, colleges, hospitals, buses have been talked about for the last five years but till date nothing has been done at the ground level,” he alleged.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/wmzjzl/article31146722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/budget-delhi-revcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-govt-presents-65000-cr-budget-amid-virus-outbreak/article31146725.ece

Residents of Thirumalayapalem in Khammam district, nearly 180 km from State capital, are setting an example in checking COVID-19 by adhering to social distancing principle during grief and loss. Like many other villages and communities in the State that voluntarily barricaded main and internal roads to ensure people don’t move around idly spurting incidence of coronavirus, Thirumalayapalem villagers also swung into action.

They didn’t stop at blocking roads barring entry of others into their village, which is the mandal headquarters with close to 5,500 population. Realising that even a small gathering of five persons too would help coronavirus unleash terror, the villagers decided that there should not be any crowds even during mourning.

Thirumalayapalem sarpanch Kondabala Venkatesh said that when the body was taken out in procession from the house, they ensured minimum number of villagers participated in the procession. “We convinced everyone to observe social distancing while taking out the body to the graveyard,” he said.

323,2020/03/24,Daily wagers from AP on the verge of starvation,"Unable to find work or go home due to lockdown

About 300 daily wage labourers from Andhra Pradesh have been stranded in the city owing to State-wide lockdown, and desperately waiting for help.

The labourers from Visakhapatnam and Srikakulam districts worked at construction sites and eked out a living, while staying in hutments beside a drain near Road No.3, Banjara Hills.

Due to the lockdown imposed by the State government to arrest the spread of COVID-19, they are unable to get any work and likely to face starvation owing to penury. “We have been in the city for the past eight years, but our ration cards are at our respective native villages where our elders and children stay. We keep shuttling between our village and the city, earning our livelihood here,” said Nitta Balaraju, a labourer from Rolugunta village of Visakhapatnam.

“We went to Nandi Nagar market on Monday to buy vegetables, but found that rotten stocks were being sold at ₹80 per kg. Tomatoes were priced at ₹100 per kg. At this rate, the money with us won’t last long, and we will be on the verge of starvation,” Sunkara Ramana, another labourer, said.

While the inability to buy provisions owing to lack of work and wages is one reason, several mothers are also troubled by separation from their children back home during these troubling times, he said.

Owing to the lockdown and absence of any kind of transport, they cannot leave the city now.

“It will be of great help if the Andhra Pradesh government can arrange some kind of transport with permission from the Telangana government to take us back home,” said Ramana.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/daily-wagers-from-ap-on-the-verge-of-starvation/article31156703.ece
324,2020/03/24,Closure of Annapurna canteens leaves the poor in the lurch,"No instructions on suspending the facility, says official

Annapurna canteens, which were providing subsidised lunch at ₹5 per plate for the poor and urchins, remained shut at several locations in the city since the current lockdown, leaving the homeless, poor people and beggars high and dry on city roads.

The Annapurna scheme was the brain child of Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar who had launched it while serving as GHMC Commissioner six years ago, in partnership with the Akshaya Patra Foundation of Hare Krishna Movement.

There are 150 Annapurna canteens in the city, one for each division, serving simple vegetarian meals near busy locations where the turnout of daily wage labourers is high. Canteens were also set up near government hospitals such as Niloufer and Gandhi so that patients’ attendants can have affordable meals.

Only recently, the scheme celebrated six years, and completed serving of 4 crore meals.

However, since the Janata Curfew, for the last two days, the canteens had remained shut, despite assurances by the GHMC officials that they were functional.

An official of the GHMC said no instructions were issued for closure of the canteens, and hence, by default they were considered open. The ground situation, however, is different.

On Tuesday, a few canteens were found open, such as those near Niloufer Hospital, Nallakunta Fever Hospital, and Ramantapur. There were no large crowds at the canteens, hence no fear of contamination.

The canteens at Gandhi Hospital and near Keyes junction in Secunderabad were found shut on the day, as was the one at Kothapet fruit market.

“The least the government can do is to keep running these canteens if they cannot scale them up to more localities. There are several homeless persons, beggars, patients’ attendants, stranded travellers, and daily wage labourers without work who need the canteens during the lockdown period,” says A.

While the whole nation applauded the services of medical professionals during the recent Janata Curfew, a shocking incident of a police officer allegedly behaving in a rude manner with a woman doctor on her way to a hospital on Monday night came to light.

Hima Bindu, the aggrieved young doctor, alleged that she was stopped while on her way to a hospital by some police personnel led by a senior police officer near the two-town police station on Monday night.

“I had shown my ID card and requested the officer to allow me to proceed to the hospital along with another woman colleague,” she said, adding that the officer ‘verbally abused’ her and ‘seized’ her ID cards. “The police personnel literally dragged me to the police station in the absence of women cops,” she charged.

“I have decided not to file any complaint as all of us, including police, medical professionals and authorities, are engaged in the collective fight against COVID-19 to protect public health,” she added.

Police sources said the incident happened in the course of ‘strict enforcement’ of the lockdown and denied charges of manhandling any medical professional.

“People from different areas are entering our village and passing through. We do not know whether they have caronavirus. Hence we are not allowing people to come to our village or let our people to go out unless an emergency is there,” said Arju Naik, sapranch of the tanda.

The auto with gas cylinder was allowed into village only after persuasion by media persons who were around. Similarly, a vehicle carrying patient was sent away to go to another village. Another auto carrying groceries was allowed only after shop owner came all the way to convince the people guarding the borders.

South Central Railway (SCR) has shut down passenger trains services from Saturday midnight, about 744 of them in all originating from its stations. Since the services have been cancelled at different places, top officials are huddled on bringing the empty rakes to the nearest station or yard and on running the critical freight trains on Tuesday.

The zone has about 85,000 employees on its rolls, of which at least 50,000 are rail maintenance staff, including loco-pilots, engineers, sanitation workers and so on who take turns at keeping the rakes in good shape so that they can start rolling at a short notice when the green signal is given. ""Passenger trains were stopped at various places and field staff are involved in keeping the trains in a fit condition; the rest of the 20% administrative and clerical staff have been advised to work on alternate days,"" said senior officials.

While 744 passenger trains in the zone and 13,000 across the country have been halted, the zone is continuing to run about 200 freight trains to move essential commodities for meeting the needs of the nation round the clock so the track/train maintenance staff, those belonging to engineering/signalling/telecom/commercial staff are working. Commodities are being transported by coal to various thermal plants to ensure uninterrupted power supply in the region, petroleum products to meet the needs of industry and other users; foodgrains, milk etc. to meet the basic needs of people during this period.

""Our staff are deployed at the goods sheds, stations, and control offices other than field offices with the involvement of security personnel even while practising protocol of cleanliness, sanitation and sterlisation. The passenger trains too are getting a cleanup as also the stations and other premises,"" they explained. There are 8,000 freight trains running across the country in the 16 railway zones and about 250 of them criss-cross SCR area too.

Close coordination is being maintained with the State governments so that rakes of essential commodities are handled smoothly without delay. Demurrage and wharfage rates for goods and parcels have been slashed at half of the prescribed rates till March 31. Free time for loading/unloading of wagons and free time for removal of consignment from railway premises has been increased to double the prescribed free time with General Manager Gajanan Mallya monitoring all the activities from the headquarters, said Chief PRO Ch.

Despite meetings chaired by ministers, Chief Secretary and other Secretaries and committees formed by the departments concerned to monitor the prices of essentials such as vegetables, fruits and groceries in the wake of lockdown being enforced to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the prices of all such items, including perishable and durables, is on the rise, quietly.

Although the prices of vegetables and fruits in the supermarkets have gone up compared to the price during the week-end, their prices have gone up sharply in the street-corner shops and at other street vendors after the Janata Curfew on Sunday. Even the villages are not spared from the steep price rise of vegetables.

The price of green chilli even in the street-corner shops which was in the range of ₹30 to ₹40 per kg against ₹20 in rythu bazaars last week, has gone up to around ₹100 a kg at street vendors. Even the price of tomatoes which was less than ₹10 a kg in rythu bazaars has gone up in the street-corner shops to around ₹60 to ₹80 a kg, although it is around ₹20 in some super markets.

“Except tomatoes and onions, prices of all other vegetables even in the super markets is nothing less than ₹80 a kg now,” an IT employee J. Manohar said when asked about his experience on price rise following the COVID-19 lockdown. Another IT employee G. Siva Darshan said the price of tomato in the Erragadda Rythu Bazaar was ₹30 a kg on Tuesday but that of green chilli was ₹80.

Three more COVID-19 positive cases in Telangana were confirmed on Tuesday (till early afternoon). With this, the total number of cases in the State has gone up to 36. Now, the government is exploring the possibility of taking up fever surveillance in the entire State.

Till Monday night, 33 cases were reported. The patient (P) number 34 is a 49-year-old man, resident of Kokapet, Rangareddy district, and has a travel history from London. P35 is a 39-year-old woman from Chandanagar, Rangareddy, who has a travel history from Germany. P36 is a 61-year-old woman from Begumpet, Hyderabad, who has a travel history from Saudi Arabia.

332,2020/03/24,Vegetable prices go through the roof across the city,"People made purchases with the intent of hoarding for the next 10 days

With three to four times rise in prices, Rythu Bazaars across the city still proved to be the haven for vegetable buyers who thronged the markets like there is no tomorrow, here on Monday.

Outside the Rythu Bazaar, veggie prices competed with chicken price, which has meanwhile recovered to ₹ 150 per kilogram from the earlier ₹80 to ₹100 per kg., thanks to the unusual demand.

Despite the lock down and restrictions on the number of persons who can go out from each household, people travelled in twos and threes to the markets, and purchased with the intent of hoarding for the next 10 days. At a few Rythu Bazaars, buyers were not allowed to enter without masks, and a few more supplied hand sanitisers to all who entered the markets.

“We have been working since 5 a.m., fielding enquiries from farmers, higher officials and customers. The crowd was mind boggling when I came to market. I had to push myself through to reach my office. Any number of appeals would not deter people from panic buying,” said an Estate Officer of a renowned Rythu Bazaar in the city. The officer attributed the high prices at Rythu Bazaars to Janata Curfew on Sunday, when vegetables could not reach markets.

As per the price table at the market, tomatoes, which were sold at throw away price of ₹9 per kg. till March 21, cost ₹40 per kg. on Monday. Green chillis, which were available for ₹25 per kg. cost a whopping ₹90 per kg. Price of cabbage which hovered at ₹7 per kg. a few days ago, spiralled up to ₹15 per kg. as per the boards put up at Rythu Bazaars, while the vendors sold each cabbage at up to ₹30 apiece irrespective of the weight. Bitter gourd which bore a price of ₹13 per kg. on Friday, was much pricier at ₹50 a kg. on Monday.

Beans cost ₹90 per kg., carrot ₹55, lady fingers, capsicum and ridge gourd ₹44, brinjal ₹38, and potato ₹33 per kg., all indicating drastic rise in prices. This high were the prices fixed by the government for Rythu Bazaars, but they were much lower than the prices outside. Traders everywhere took advantage of the customers’ anxiety and jacked up the prices unimaginably high. “I bought green chillis at ₹120 per kg. near a market in Vanasthalipuram. Lady fingers were ₹85 per kg. At this rate, commoners cannot survive this lockdown. Government should take up the responsibility of supplying vegetables at affordable prices by organising mobile markets in all colonies, and also should fix a limit on the quantity carried by each person every day. Otherwise, poor and the aged will have to bear the brunt of this situation,” said Ram Kumar, a 60-year old buyer.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bd04u3/article31146587.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY24VEGGIES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/vegetable-prices-go-through-the-roof-across-the-city/article31146588.ece
333,2020/03/24,"Lockdown, work from home to fuel LPG usage","Geared to meet any demand, say oil company officials, distributors

An increase in cooking gas consumption by households is something oil marketing companies are not ruling out, with the lockdown to contain spread of Covid-19 in place in Telangana.

While the lockdown is recent, wider and effective tool to ensure people stay put, the work from home option many IT workforce had gone with, seem to be igniting demand for more liquefied petroleum gas in kitchens.

The logic extended by distributors as well as officials in oil industry is simple, more people at home and reducing options of either eating out or ordering food is a recipe to prepare own food. Telangana LPG Distributor’s Association general secretary K. Jagan Mohan Reddy says a trend of enhanced LPG consumption is indicative over the last few days.

While senior officials of national oil marketing companies do not discount possibility of a spike, they would prefer to wait for the pattern to emerge stronger even while gearing up in anticipation.

“We are pushing stocks to our distributors” says R. Sravan S.Rao, Executive Director and State Head of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) for Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. This is to ensure less backlog or the time taken to the supply. It currently is 1.3 days, he adds.

Though a significant increase in consumption is not evident now, even if there were to be one later, IOC is geared to handle the demand, he says.

A senior official of Bharat Petroleum Corporation said LPG offtake, either by way of customers ordering refills at shorter intervals or consuming more from the pipeline, an utility available at several gated communities, could not be ruled out when family members spend more time home. BPCL, he adds, is ready to meet such demand.

In Telangana, IOC, BPCL and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) cater to around 1.7 crore LPG households through over 700 distributors, who in turn have more than 10,000 delivery and auxiliary staff. About 1.8 lakh cylinders are supplied every day, Mr.Reddy says, requesting customers to opt for digital payment modes and minimise visits to LPG showrooms.

“We request the customers to show empathy towards our delivery force who are working under these dangerous conditions extending home delivery service,” he says, adding to ensure social distancing cylinders were being delivered at the main gate. Refills bookings on Monday were 20-25% higher, he says.

Preventive measures

As much as on the ability to scale up supplies, oil companies and distributors are focused on measures that help contain spread of the virus. From instructing delivery staff to maintain distance from customers and wear masks, the oil companies are also asking them to wipe shrouds of filled refills ahead of delivery as well as that of empty refills while accepting.

Explaining the procedure in place at bottling plants, the IOC and BPCL officials said as part of the cleaning as well as leak detection processes, the refills get a good water wash. Plans to add disinfectant in the water is under consideration.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lockdown-work-from-home-to-fuel-lpg-usage/article31146268.ece
334,2020/03/24,Scribes returning home assaulted by police,"Journalists are exempted from lockdown curbs under essential services

Media personnel returning home after duty hours had a bitter taste of the high-handedness of the Hyderabad City Police on Monday night. Journalists exempted from lockdown restrictions were roughed up by some men in uniform despite showing their identity papers.

The ghastly incident occurred at the end of Begumpet old flyover which runs over Fathenagar nala. Chief of Bureau (Telangana) of The Hindu Ravi Reddy was abused and assaulted by two sub-inspectors and three constables of Begumpet police station, even after identifying himself as a journalist. Mr. Reddy was on his way home after his duty, when the incident took place around 10.15 p.m.

The issue was brought to the notice of DGP M Mahender Reddy, Hyderabad Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar, DCP (North) Kalmeshwar Shingenavar and other officials, who spoke to Mr. Reddy and inquired about the incident.

According to Government Order number 45 issued on Sunday night, print and electronic media are marked as essential services during the lockdown for containment of spread of COVID-19 in Telangana.

At least a dozen journalists including a woman were waiting for the barricades to be removed. As some others were also waiting, media personnel went to the police, showed their identity cards and requested that they be allowed to go as they were part of essential services. The pleas did not yield any result and the police personnel thrashed the journalists with their batons. The policemen even vent their ire on the vehicles of journalists.

Not stopping at that, they verbally abused in the filthiest language and picked up heated argument with them. The police forced everyone to take some other route which deviates from their regular route.

Amid the barrage of lathi-charge and verbal abuse, reporters alerted the top brass in the police department about violation of exemptions to the media granted by the State government.

The incident happened on the first day of lockdown, which makes one wonder how the police would conduct themselves in the days to come.

Similar incidents of high-handedness by police were reported by journalists of various newspapers and channels across the three commissonerates of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda, throughout Monday.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/scribes-returning-home-assaulted-by-police/article31146126.ece
335,2020/03/24,At least 70 foreign returnees violated quarantine conditions,"Police checking twice every day to ensure compliance

Utter disregard for home quarantine orders has come into focus with officials stating that there have been 70 to 80 violations since the State government decided to stamp the date of arrival on the hands of foreign returnees.

Appealing to all foreign returnees to stick to the 14-day quarantine period, Health Minister Eatala Rajender said every day, the police are checking twice to ensure compliance.

While sharing details on the steps being taken in this regard, Mr Rajender sought to reprimand those violating the guidelines. “Why should the police or doctors even have to monitor them? Why should I, as a Health Minister, appeal to them? Don’t they have a conscience? Aren’t they seeing the situation in other countries,” the Minister questioned at a press conference held at the State Medical and Health Campus in Koti, adding that they will take action against those who violate the quarantine condition.

Before the international arrivals at RGIA was shut down, thousands of people coming from various foreign countries were screened using thermal scanners. If high body temperature was detected, the passenger was isolated at designated hospitals and samples were collected for tests.

If an air passenger was asymptomatic, he/she was accommodated in various quarantine centres for 14 days in and around the city. The incubation period for COVID-19 is one to 14 days and symptoms might appear any time during this duration.

However, after the foreign returnees assured the government that they will confine themselves to their homes which have better facilities, they were allowed self-quarantine. A few who wanted to stay at government facilities were allowed to use that option.

However, some of those who were supposed to be under home quarantine stepped out, took public transportation and even attended functions.

Mr Rajender has requested parents and family members to ensure that the foreign returnees comply with the quarantine orders. Pointing out that some have violated the quarantine, he said that cases would be booked against those not adhering to the guidelines. “It is a matter of safety of all the people across the State,” the Minister said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lis4lr/article31146031.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23-AIRPORTJANATACURFEW,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/at-least-70-foreign-returnees-violated-quarantine-conditions/article31146026.ece
336,2020/03/24,Several logistics issues confront IT/ITES firms,"Caught unawares by order for daily curfew between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m.

The sudden government order on late Monday afternoon imposing curfew from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. every day has created severe logistics issues for IT and ITES companies in the city.

As a precaution against COVID-19, many IT and ITES companies have already asked a bulk of their employees to work from home.

Since the IT and ITES are declared essential services, a small percentage of employees have been asked to come to work to handle some critical business functions and to support global services as the financial markets around the world are still functioning.

‘Little time to prepare’

“The sudden announcement of curfew from 7 p.m. today has not given enough time for companies to respond and make alternative arrangements. It also makes it difficult for employees to go back home during the curfew time,” said IT sector sources.

There is some confusion because the policemen on the road implementing the government orders may not be fully aware of the exemptions given to the IT sector, said an MNC representative.

While most MNCs have been proactive in ensuring close to 95% of employees work from home as a matter of their global policy, the government decision on short notice is putting the companies to further stress.

However, IT company sources have said they were doing their best to ensure both the employees and their business operations are protected while complying with the government orders. “In a quickly evolving situation, decisions are taken on the move and orders issued. But the information is not getting conveyed to all the impacted stakeholders and they are not getting enough time to comply with the orders and make appropriate arrangements to reach home before the curfew begins,” said another MNC official.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/several-logistics-issues-confront-itites-firms/article31146017.ece
337,2020/03/24,Chess champion Harika goes into self-quarantine,"She returned from Switzerland on March 15

Following the government’s guidelines for those returning from COVID-19-affected countries, Chess Grandmaster Dronavalli Harika is on self-quarantine for two weeks.

The three-time World championship bronze medallist returned from Switzerland in mid-March and since then has ensured zero interaction with anyone.

In fact, she joins the list of sports stars from the city such as P.V. Sindhu, Sania Mirza, Saina Nehwal and P. Gopi Chand, who also isolated themselves upon arrival from abroad in the past few days.

“When I was playing in the FIDE Swiss Grand Prix in the second week of this month, I didn’t realise the gravity of the situation in Switzerland even as my mother cautioned me to be very careful. At that time, there were very few suspected cases there,” Harika told The Hindu.

The first thing that the 29-year-old did was inform the authorities as she confined herself to home and avoided meeting anyone, hoping for things to improve soon.

Interestingly, Harika, who was supposed to fly straight to Kolkata for the PSPB chess tournament (which was subsequently cancelled) changed the international sector travel plan, even though it meant extra cost. She had a quiet arrival at the Hyderabad airport on March 15, when things weren’t as serious as now, completing formalities of filling up the requisite forms before reaching home.

“It is terrific that the State officials are keeping track of our health status. Now, I can realise the gravity of the siatuation in Switzerland and in Europe. Luckily, I took all the precautions like having breakfast in the room itself, not moving out of the hotel or the competition room for the fear of this virus,” Harika said, adding that all citizens should strictly follow guidelines of the Central and State governments which are taking unprecedented measures to arrest the spread of COVID-19.

“Frankly, given the current situation, I am not in the mood even to think of playing in any tournament in the immediate future unless there is a drastic improvement across the world,” she signed off, reminding that the Olympiad in August is the next major assignment for her.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/qazygf/article31145998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy23harika,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/chess-champion-harika-goes-into-self-quarantine/article31145984.ece
338,2020/03/24,‘Work from home’ slows down internet,"Business of service providers up by 30 to 40% as subscribers opt for packages with high speed bandwidth

Internet and cable TV services have gone for a toss in view of ‘work from home’ option given to employees of IT companies, corporates and other major establishments in view of COVID-19 outbreak.

With people sticking to their laptops for long hours while working from home, servers of internet service providers (ISPs) are unable to take the load for domestic connections, leading to interrupted services in thousands of houses. Before this, they were used to uninterrupted functioning at their offices where the bandwidth of servers was far high.

Consequently, cable services offered by Multi-System Operators (MSOs) have also been affected — their services were pre-paid and got deactivated on the day of expiry. The MSOs were required to go to their respective portals to activate the accounts but slow internet speed on account of heavy usage delayed the process for each customer by 30 to 60 minutes.

Lingala Hari Gowd, president of Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy Cable Operators Association, said nearly 60% of their customers renewed subscriptions with online payment before the expiry of due date. Hence, they were assured of uninterrupted cable TV viewing. But, the problem was with the remaining 40% subscribers who paid cash invariably after expiry date and required reconnection in these difficult times of net usage. There were hundreds of complaints from people to MSOs about not being able to renew connections in the past few days, particularly on Sunday due to Janata Curfew and Monday when the State-wide lockdown commenced.

As children and adults were mainly confined to homes due to closure of schools and colleges and ‘work from home’ option implemented by employers, the usage of Internet Protocol TV to view on-demand video streaming websites like Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube and Zee 5 also went up considerably. The business of ISPs has gone up by 30 to 40% in the past four days as subscribers opted for packages with high speed bandwidth. The speed was limited to 5 to 10 mega bits per second (MBPS) earlier but now they are demanding minimum of 50 to 100 MBPS, said Pottabathini Naveen, technical manager of an ISP.

The ISPs were charged with neglecting old customers who pay on a monthly basis. On the other hand, they gave priority to new customers as it was more remunerative to them due to long-term packages on offer. P. Arvind Kumar, general secretary, Federation of Cable Aerial Operators Association of Telangana, said he had given 90 new connections in the past four days in his service area.

339,2020/03/24,Lockdown leaves Hyderabad streets nearly desolate,"City adapts to slower pace, residents find time for creative projects

An eerie quiet prevails on the streets of Hyderabad. If the mornings are filled with bird calls, the day progresses with an occasional vehicle zipping past and a long night begins.

As the city adapts to a different slower rhythm and pace, citizens are learning, preparing and understanding what it is to live in the time of a fearsome pandemic that is killing thousands and upending millions of lives across the world.

Sidharth Mahajan has started what he calls ‘Project Parenthood’ where he is creating a time-lapse of a pair of doves sharing duties to hatch a pair of eggs. Today was the third day of the story on Instagram unfolding slowly.

“It’s a slow process… one of them came for shift at 4 p.m. yesterday and was there till 9 a.m. If there was no lockdown, I would not have been able to do the project. Even if I did, it would have been a short project,” says the resident of Hafeezpet.

In other households, scotching wild rumours spread on WhatsApp is a full-time family project.

“My parents are into reading and are digging out old books and sitting down to share their discoveries. I am making use of Insta stories or WhatsApp statuses to keep them aware of reliable information rather than getting carried away by WhatsApp University,” says Pingali Praveen Reddy, an architect, as he finds ways to keep his two-year-old niece and seven-year-old nephew engaged.

Family bonding

The ‘work from home’ involves motivation to sit and work without getting distracted.

“The biggest trouble is keeping an eye on my kids as they came to know candy and munchies are stored. While I was taking a nap, half the candy got cleaned up,” says Haseeb Jafferi who lives in Shaikpet area. “Otherwise most of our dining table conversations now revolve around half-baked information on COVID-19 being spread and dos and don’ts. That has given the family time to call up many relatives abroad and in the city to check on them,” says Mr. Jafferi.

“Ee video maa amma kosam (this video is for my mother). Share if your mom is thinking you have changed for good in this pandemic,” shared actor Kamal Kamaraju as he took on another project in the kitchen.

Ajay Gandhi of Manthan is curating a bunch of online resources to handle what he calls “difficult, challenging and could be traumatic time”. “To deal with the epidemic and the trying times ahead, let us get together and be a source of information and support.

340,2020/03/24,Police start seizing vehicles for leisure ride during lockdown,"2,480 vehicles, including 1,058 two-wheelrs and 948 autorickshaws, seized at 73 check posts across city

In complete contrast to the Janata Curfew on Sunday, vehicular traffic was back on the roads of Hyderabad, albeit on a lesser volume.

Soon after the joint press conference of Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and DGP M. Mahender Reddy concluded on Monday noon, police fanned onto the main road. The first thing that they did was to put barricades across the main roads. At least half a dozen police personnel were deployed at every major junction.

Motorists had a tough time passing through the barricades as the men in khaki advised them to turn back. Police also sealed the approach roads to the twin cities.

Barricades put up

Due to setting up of barricades, the motorists were initially taken aback and had to plead with the police to let them through.

The road leading from Suchitra Junction to Paradise was barricaded at Military Dairy Farm, New Bowenpally Crossroads, Paradise CTO junction. Barricades were also put up at Rasoolpura junction and Begumpet flyover. Vehicular traffic from Paradise to Punjagutta moved at a snail’s pace till late in the afternoon.

At several places, traffic police stopped the vehicles for more than 20 minutes as ‘punishment’ for violating the government orders on not venturing out on the roads, which led to traffic bottlenecks in certain areas.

Police staff were seen questioning the motorists about the purpose and urgency of coming out of their houses and their destination. If their answers were not satisfactory, their vehicles were seized and the owners asked to go home.

The DGP said that those with private vehicles are not allowed to drive for long distances and permitted to move only within their localities for purchase of groceries and other essential commodities. He warned against violations and said the vehicles would be seized and released only after the lockdown period gets over.

Meanwhile, Hyderabad traffic police seized 2,480 vehicles, including 1,058 two-wheelrs and 948 autorickshaws at 73 check posts across the city. “At night, we will be very strict about the lockdown. No movement on the roads will be allowed. All vehicles will be seized,” police said, advising citizens to remain indoors from 6.30 p.m. to 6 a.m.

‘Break the chain’

Cyberabad Commissioner of Police V.C. Sajjanar said stringent action will be taken against those who violate the government orders on lockdown.

“The order has been issued for the safety of the people. One has to understand that we need to break the chain to curb the spread of COVID-19,” he said.

All firms in the area, which includes banks and software companies, are allowed to function. However, the employees have to maintain a distance of three to six feet from each other, he said.

“A lot of vehicles are moving in the area without any reason. We will seize them,” he said.

Further, Mr. Sajjanar said that as many as 3,671 foreign returnees are living in Cyberabad and have been asked to undergo home quarantine for a period of 14 days. Criminal cases will be booked against people who violate the guidelines, he added.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/5t312z/article31145928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23-VEHICLELOCKDOWN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/police-start-seizing-vehicles-for-leisure-ride-during-lockdown/article31145930.ece
341,2020/03/24,Chennai’s Carnatic musicians plan a live digital concert,"Home and the World features TM Krishna, Akkarai Subhalakshmi and other well-known names, and will be streamed on shaale.com

Of course, balcony antakshari is fun. But, just like in a karaoke bar, there comes a breaking point. And for your neighbour, it may just be caused by your 12th performance of Prince’s ‘Purple Rain’.

Fortunately, this weekend, you can sit back and let the professionals take over. With Covid shutting down live concerts and performances all over the world, singers and musicians are finding innovative ways to connect with listeners and each other.

In Chennai, Carnatic musicians TM Krishna, Akkarai Subhalakshmi, B Sivaraman and N Guruprasad are now putting together the ‘Home and the World’, a digital Carnatic live concert. The concert, which will be live streamed on March 29 at 7.30 pm IST (10 am EST, 7 am PST, 2 pm GMT), aims to raise funds for artistes who have been displaced financially by the Coronavirus pandemic.

“A lot of artistes, from different fields, have had all performances cancelled,” says Krishna, adding, “Just in the Carnatic world, it has already led to the cancellation of hundreds of concerts. Theatre productions are being cancelled, dance performances… this is affecting all performing arts.” He adds that the uncertainty around the pandemic means that alternative dates cannot be set either. “Everyone is saying, we will just wait.”

While discussing how they could help, Krishna, Subhalakshmi, Sivaraman and Guruprasad came up with the idea of this concert. “Most of the people who work in the performing arts are not economically well off. And with no performances, they will need help to tide over these days.”

The artistes are also hoping this will cheer up audiences. “Right now, most people are in isolation at home, across the world. They are pretty much looking at the Internet constantly, getting information on Corona. Audiences also need to relax,” he says, adding with a laugh, “This total uncertainty we are going through now is stressful. I sneezed this morning, and got worried!”

While the team is still working on the format of the concert, Krishna is clear that they will follow all the current social distancing rules. “There will be no audience, and only essential people needed for the performance and audio will be present,” he says.

The main perk of watching remotely? They are taking requests. “Just put it on our social media posts a couple of days ahead.”

342,2020/03/24,Old Bollywood hits get a jazz treatment,"This vocalist-flautist duo of Bollyjazz is pulling out all the stops with its orchestra, that is already going overseas

Familiar, foot-tapping tunes of ‘Aaj Kal Tere Mere Pyaar Ke Charche’ from the 1968 film Brahmachari resound, under a star-studded sky in the Blue City. There is a slight nip in the air as the iconic Bollywood number hits the crowd, only this time, in a delightful jazzy disguise. This version is a tad more pacy than Shankar Jaikishan’s original, with generous saxophone interludes that inevitably lead one to groove. Performing it are one of the headliners in Colour Me Pink, a recently held curtain-raiser event for the first edition of Jodhpur Jazz Safari, scheduled for 2021, for a taste of world music amid the vast desert lining the city.

Bollyjazz as a concept for live music came up when Nikhil Mawkin (lead vocalist) often came across old time hits being remixed to club beats. This was not done in a “sophisticated EDM kind of way” but rather in a way that DJs at the time wanted, to make the songs more relatable and dance-able. “I did not agree with this particular approach of treating such beautiful melodies. Having spent some time around Jazz musicians in Boston, an idea of setting up Bollyjazz came about,” says Nikhil.

This was back in 2011. Though in the beginning, 1950s and 1960s Indian cinema music was what they tapped into, on popular demand they have moved to 1970s and 1980s Hindi music. “Initially, we were limiting ourselves to the 50s and 60s, mainly because jazz music and musicians had a major role to play in the music being created for films during those decades. One could easily spot an upright bass (traditional to Jazz music back then) being used even during the filming of a song,” continues Nikhil.

The first Bollywood song that struck him was AR Rahman’s ‘Khuda Hafiz’ from the movie Yuva: in the third section of the song, the composer moves completely to a jazz quartet that lasts for only about 10 seconds. “But it has been most intelligently used and sounds pretty real. The song itself moves from many sounds and intermingles genres, including electronic. And that is when it hit me. If something that pretty could be done to one tune in so many ways, then imagine what can be done with the great tunes that were being lost within extremely repetitive and squared up beats,” continues Nikhil. The arrangements are usually written in one go, by elaborating parts for all the instruments, by Nikhil and flautist Nathalie Ramirez Tovar, both digitally and on score. Though most of the arrangements are pre-written, performances are not devoid of improvisation.

“There are a few myths that are often related with Jazz as a genre, one among which is that it is supposed to be danceable or really fast and complex. Most of the feedback is based on that myth, and so unfortunately, we have had to limit listening to feedback,” says Nikhil, reflecting on how, for some, working on Bollywood music is almost always associated with “being a sellout”.

In the summer of 2019, Bollyjazz was finally able to achieve the sound that they had been aiming for, during their trip to Mexico. For that performance, the duo had the advantage of collaborating with musicians from around the globe. “We performed as an 18-piece jazz orchestra at the Casino Xalapeño (a ballroom, in the city of Xalapa, Veracruz, also where Nathalie is originally from). Our dream is to set up Bollyjazz as a ‘Big Band orchestra’, a title that is often referred to as horns orchestra,” says Nikhil.

343,2020/03/24,Traders in Kochi put brakes on overstocking of products by customers,"A section of the wholesale dealers of essential items has placed curbs on overstocking of products by customers fearing that supplies may dry up in view of the lockdown announced in the State.

“People had started stocking essential items like rice at least one week before the government announced measures to check the spread of COVID-19. Regular customers who used to take a maximum of five kilos of rice had left with 10 kg and 20 kg bags of rice anticipating a dip in supplies,” said a wholesale dealer in Aluva.

“I had stopped giving rice and other essentials in such large quantities as it would dry up the stocks and deny others a chance to buy essentials. A person who had asked for 20 kg of rice was given only 5 kg today. We cannot permit the overstocking of items done by a few,” he said.

Retailers were under pressure as they were not able to meet the increased demand and wholesale dealers were not meeting the additional demand that emerged over the past one week. Many were also eager to cash in on the spike in demand for essential items.

However, the district administration has warned of stringent action against those hoarding essential items or jacking up prices under the guise of shortage of supplies. It has also assured that regular supply of such items will be ensured through various government outlets.

Supplyco has informed that it has adequate stocks of essential and other items under its various outlets. Customers should abide by safety guidelines issued by the Health Department while visiting outlets. Supplyco outlets will be functioning as per the timings fixed by the government, according to officials.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/traders-in-kochi-put-brakes-on-overstocking-of-products-by-customers/article31155616.ece
344,2020/03/24,Veggie prices go through the roof in Ernakulam,"Curbs on supply trucks on inter-State borders, panic-buying cited as reasons

Vegetable prices have shot up here amidst a dip in supplies owing to the restrictions on vehicular movement imposed on inter-State borders and panic-buying by people in view of the COVID-19 situation.

A sudden spike has been reported mainly for carrots, beans, cowpea (achinga), ladies’ finger etc. “Cowpea that was sold in the wholesale rate of ₹25 to ₹30 a kilo earlier is now being given at ₹80 retail rate. The rates of carrot and French beans have also gone through the roof. Carrot is now sold in the range of ₹70 to ₹80 in the retail market against the earlier price that varied between ₹50 and ₹60,” said a vegetable vendor.

A wholesale merchant in Aluva said that the prices of green chillies, small onion, tomato and garlic have also gone up over the past one week. “Small onions were sold at ₹50 to ₹60. Its retail price have now jumped to ₹90. The rate of big onions has increased to ₹35 a kilo from the earlier ₹25. The wholesale rate of tomatoes has gone up to ₹35 from the earlier ₹25 a kilo while the retail rate is now ₹50,” he said.

Regular customers reported a shortage in the availability of carrots, French beans and beetroot. Wholesale dealers attributed the spurt in prices to reduced supplies from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. “Movement of trucks has slowed down because of the confusion prevailing at borders. A lorry that usually reaches at 6 a.m. at the main markets in Ernakulam is now delayed by over six to seven hours, creating a gap in demand and supply,” they said.

Vegetable vendors like Joby in Kadungalloor, who depended on daily supplies from wholesale dealers, are the most hit as they get less than half of the required stock. “Wholesale dealers who used to give five loads are now giving one or two loads. They have also increased the rates saying that supplies have fallen,” he said.

Traders said that the suspension of inter-State private buses, which used to be a regular mode of transport for supplying vegetables in small quantities, had also affected the availability here. “The situation may turn worse in the next two days. We request the authorities to ensure free flow of trucks carrying essential items on borders,” they said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/4ekl4/article31159412.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25KIVEG1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/veggie-prices-go-through-the-roof-in-ernakulam/article31155493.ece

Vyttila and M.G. Road used to record AQI levels in the range between 95 and 100 on busy days while the corresponding figure at Eloor had often crossed the 100 mark. Reduced emissions from vehicles and particulate matter helped achieve the good index on March 22, said board officials here.

An index value between 0 and 50 is deemed good with minimal impact on health, 51 to 100 is satisfactory with health implications such as minor breathing discomfort to sensitive people, 101 to 200 is considered moderate, and the possible health impact is breathing discomfort to people with lung diseases and discomfort to people with heart disease, children and adults.

On M.G. Road, the carbon monoxide level was recorded as 0.6 against the previous day reading of 1.06 while the PM (particulate matter) 2.5 level was 17.59 against the 27.78 reading recorded on March 21. The PM10 level was 39.1 against the 55.09 level recorded the previous day.

The PM2.5 and PM10 levels at Vyttila on Sunday were 20.1 and 43.31 respectively against the corresponding values of 34.68 and 81.45 recorded the previous day. The nitrous oxide level was 75.4 against the 87.6 recorded on Saturday. The carbon monoxide level was 0.02 against the 0.07 recorded the previous day.

350,2020/03/24,Fake news over COVID-19 sends panchayat into a tizzy,"Audio clip on person returned from Dubai goes viral

Fake news that a man in home quarantine tested positive for COVID-19 sent Keezhmad panchayat in Vazhakkulam block along the eastern suburbs of the district into a tizzy for good part of the day on Monday.

The news was triggered by an alarmist audio clip that went viral on social media asking people to stay away and shops to down shutters. Ironically, the man, a resident near Thottumukham along the Aluva-Munnar Road, was not even in the district but was actually at his wife’s house in Alappuzha even as the fake news was being circulated.

As the fake news gained considerable traction, Abhilash Ashokan, chairman of the panchayat health standing committee, clarified that there was no such positive case, and that the news was indeed fake. He warned of police action against those responsible for spreading the rumour.

“He had come from Bahrain via Abu Dhabi on March 18 and was taken to Government Medical College, Kalamasserry, the next day. And from there he was taken to his wife’s house at Alappuzha in an ambulance where he has been in quarantine since then,” said Mr. Ashokan.

On Monday morning, he complained of throat discomfort following which he was taken to the Alappuzha Medical College. However, after finding that it was an allergy, he was given medicines and sent back home.

“I was informed by the Special Branch police about the person after some people reportedly complained that he was roaming around. I enquired about it and came to know that the man was not even here,” Kunjumuhammad Saidali, member of the ward where the person lives, said.

Interestingly, the panchayat was yet to lodge a police complaint till evening.

When asked about it, Mr. Ashokan said they were planning to hand over the audio clip to the police.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/fake-news-over-covid-19-sends-panchayat-into-a-tizzy/article31147208.ece

District Collector S. Suhas on Monday held a videoconference with panchayat secretaries and asked them to intensify preventive measures against COVID-19 and enforce quarantine norms as per the State government’s orders.

A ward-level list had to be prepared on the number of people under observation, he said.

A review meeting should be held to take stock of the situation. ASHA workers, ward members, Kudumbashree activists, volunteers, and anganwadi employees can form a committee to ensure that people under quarantine are following norms.

Those who have returned from countries abroad and those who were found to be in contact with COVID-19 patients have to be strictly under observation for 14 days. He said the names of those who were reluctant to follow norms should be given to the police.

He also told officials to ensure that food was available to those in quarantine. For this, panchayats could utilise own funds or could find a sponsor, he added.

The Collector also asked officials to get a list of people who had other medical needs. Ward-level squads should be directed to get these details.

In case of any COVID-19 symptoms, the first consultation should be with the doctor at the primary health centre over telephone. A person with COVID-19 symptoms should not directly go to any hospital, the Collector said.

In case the patient gets critical, the Health Department will send an ambulance to take the patient to the treatment centre.

It needed to be ensured that those under observation were not under mental stress, the Collector said. For this, counsellors’ services should be made available.

He asked panchayat secretaries to regulate the use of mask among the public.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ensure-compliance-with-quarantine-norms-local-body-officials-told/article31147197.ece

In a first of its kind, the Kerala High Court on Monday turned a court hall into a virtual court room and held proceedings via video conferencing in eight bail petitions and passed orders on some of them.

The video-conferencing was arranged in view of the COVID-19 threat.

Justice Raja Vijayaraghavan conducted the video conferencing, sitting in his chamber and hearing the arguments of the lawyers and the government pleader from the court hall.

The conferencing was done through Zoom video conference app, which linked the judge with the lawyers sitting in the court hall. Once the lawyers requested the court officer to begin the proceedings, the app got connected with the judge and the proceedings began.

According to T.A. Unnikrishnan, lawyer in one of the cases who participated in the video conferencing hearing, it was a good option in these trying circumstances. It could make social distancing easier for lawyers.

In one of the cases, the virtual court granted bail to Vasu and Anilkumar, accused in a case registered in the Thenmala police station in Kollam district in connection with an acid attack case. They were charged with offences under Sections 341 (Wrongful restraint), 323 (Voluntarily causing hurt) and 326 (A) (Acid attack) of the Indian Penal Code.

Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Ernakulam, is slowly turning into the State’s first COVID-19 treatment centre.

The hospital on Monday shifted other seriously-ill patients to different hospitals to cater exclusively for COVID-19 patients. Already, 90% of the other patients had either been shifted to new hospitals or discharged.

Cleaning of wards was also done simultaneously at the 500-bed hospital.

With the number of COVID-19 patients at the institution going up, chances of other patients getting infected also go up.

There are also a number of suspected COVID-19 cases at the hospital. In view of the situation, District Collector S. Suhas invoked Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 to make the MCH an exclusive COVID-19 treatment facility for the time being.

Emergency OP

Only the dialysis unit will be functioning at the medical college along with an emergency OP.

No other emergency services will be available at the hospital.

Modern facilities

Meanwhile, isolation facilities in the district have been augmented. Modern facilities are being put in place for observation.

So far, there have been 30 isolation beds at MCH and 13 at the Muvattupuzha General Hospital. If required, the number of isolation beds will be increased to 40 and 39 respectively.

Doctors, nurses and attenders have also been appointed for isolation rooms.

They will work in six shifts as it is difficult to continue on duty with personal protection equipment for more than four hours.

In one shift, a doctor will be supported by two staff nurses, one attender, one cleaning staff, and one X-ray technician. Rooms will be cleaned and sanitised after every shift.

Directions have been given to cleaning staff to carefully handle utensils, bedsheets and clothes used by patients. For every person who takes up the shift duty, there will be personnel to help wear personal protection equipment and also to remove them when they end the duty.

Isolation rooms have been kept ready at taluk hospitals at Karuvelipady (18 beds), Thripunithura (20), Perumbavoor (24) and Paravur (26) and at Aluva district hospital (25 beds).

356,2020/03/24,New ro-ro ferry service mooted,"₹700-crore development projects for West Kochi proposed in budget

The Kochi Corporation has mooted a new roll-on roll-off (ro-ro) ferry service between the boat jetty near the High Court and Fort Kochi in its budget for the coming financial year. A ₹700-crore worth development project for West Kochi is also on the cards.

The civic body’s budget was presented by Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar on Monday at a hurried meeting that concluded in less than an hour to adhere to protocols in the wake of the COVID-19 spread.

₹8 crore has been set aside to make preparations for the new ro-ro service. The budget also proposes to make the existing service between Fort Kochi and Vypeen operational for 24 hours, besides offering free rides to the elderly, children below the age of six and differently abled persons. The service brought the corporation a profit of nearly ₹28 lakh in the previous financial year.

Break the Chain

A sum of ₹50 lakh has also been set aside to contribute to the Break the Chain campaign and develop a plan to deal with disease outbreaks in collaboration with residents’ associations, hospitals and Kudumbashree groups.

The only fresh big-ticket project in the year’s budget is a development plan for the 28 wards in West Kochi.

The project, which could cost ₹700 crore over multiple years, would involve dividing the area into two development zones and preparing detailed development plans considering the geographical and demographic features of each zone.

The plans, which will be drawn up by January next year, could cost ₹17.5 crore. Besides ensuring that basic services are provided to the area proportionate to its population, the project also envisages improving the standard of living of residents and offering opportunities for financial growth. Technical expertise and financial aid will be sought from the Central government and from international organisations.

Budget slammed

Opposition leaders lambasted the budget as old wine in a new bottle. “The corporation has failed in collecting taxes to increase its own income.

The budget does not contain any concrete measures to increase income and does not specify how oustanding debt will be resolved,” said LDF councillor V.P. Chandran. Several projects dealing with waste management at Brahmapuram, like setting up plastic shredding machines and aerobic composting, had merely been repeated in this year’s budget, he said.

The idea of floating municipal bonds as a way to augment funds at hand, which found a repeat mention in this year’s budget, would be put into action immediately, Mr. Premakumar said. Collection of entertainment tax, professional tax and service charges from Central government institutions in the city would also be intensified, he added.

The budget anticipates an increase in income of ₹15 crore through municipal bonds and strict collection of taxes. The prices for marriage registration and to obtain marriage and building ownership certificates would be hiked.

Income of over ₹988.88 crore and expenditure of a little over ₹955.83 crore were estimated.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/new-ro-ro-ferry-service-mooted/article31147076.ece

358,2020/03/24,Residents’ associations in district join battle against COVID-19,"EDRAAC asks members to ensure lockdown compliance

The Ernakulam District Residents Associations’ Apex Council (EDRAAC) has exhorted member associations and other bodies to prevail upon people to confine themselves to their homes and to prevent venturing out unnecessarily.

Care must also be taken to ensure hygiene. Every person was duty-bound to adhere to regulations and guidelines issued by the State government to contain the spread of COVID-19. They included curbs on meetings and people grouping together. It was all for the common good. The spread of the viral infection was a serious issue, and people must be aware that it could be at their doorstep, said P. Rangadasa Prabhu, president of EDRAAC.

Many villa and apartment associations have engaged people to coordinate with supermarkets and grocery shops to purchase food items and other commodities in bulk and distribute them among members. Online purchases too have picked up, in sync with government curbs on moving out. This is being done to prevent people from households visiting shops and queuing up to purchase. Curbs have also been imposed at playgrounds and swimming pools.

The association of Kent Nalukettu, which has 21 villas and 18 apartments, is among the gated communities which have installed sanitisers at the entrance, club house and other key areas. “Taking a cue from apartments in other metro cities, we also have My Gate app. which restricts entry of salespeople and others to the premises. Only people who are authorised by residents can enter,” said George Ninan, secretary of the association.

“On their part, most residents’ associations have established kiosks, where soap, hand sanitiser and water are available, to usher in hygiene and to contain the viral spread. We have established a kiosk in our neighbourhood,” said Jayamohan P.G., district committee member of EDRAAC and an office bearer of Lal Salam Road Residents’ Association, Vyttila.

Such kiosks were visible at many points, including on service roads of NH Bypass.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/residents-associations-in-district-join-battle-against-covid-19/article31147045.ece
359,2020/03/24,"Pandemic, labour shortage may hold up road work by PWD","The COVID-19 crisis and subsequent exit from the State of a good share of migrant workers have cast uncertainty on the timely completion of pipe and cable-laying and subsequent work to restore and resurface the dug-up roads.

The virus outbreak has come right at the onset of the summer season, when a major chunk of civil works like road and drainage construction are taken up in the State. “Faced with paucity of labour, curbs in connection with efforts to contain the virus spread and in some cases non-availability of raw materials, we may lose the most crucial months of the November-May working season,” said a PWD official.

“We were banking on commencing resurfacing work of Civil Line Road and Vennala-Palachuvadu-Thuthiyoor Road as per BMBC standard, when the crisis struck. The KSEB had dug up many parts of these stretches for laying cables. We had given them a deadline of March 31 to complete their work. Just as in 2019, many road resurfacing works suffered delay due to KSEB and KWA not completing their projects,” the official said.

The pandemic has also hit the GCDA’s works to resurface the Kaloor-Kadavanthra Road, renovate footpaths on either side and to spruce up the Marine Drive walkway. “Contracts for both the works had been awarded earlier this year,” said V Salim, Chairman of the agency.

Acute paucity of funds has added to the Kochi Corporation’s woes, casting doubts on timely completion of critical road and drain works.

“Contractors are frequently going on strikes, since they have not been paid for even works done under plan funds. Luckily for us, metro agencies have fully resurfaced Sahodaran Ayyappan Road, while Subhash Bose Road was recarpeted using restoration funds given by the KWA,” sources in the civic body said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/t5j5tt/article31147023.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KALOORKADAVANTHRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pandemic-labour-shortage-may-hold-up-road-work-by-pwd/article31147024.ece
360,2020/03/24,Police arrest chain snatchers living in disguise as mahouts,"Two persons accused in a chain snatching case and who were working as aides to mahouts while in hiding were tracked down and arrested by the Mulanthuruthy police thanks to a lookout notice issued in the media through the Information and Public Relations Department.

The arrested were identified as Jobin Jose, 23, of Velloor in Kottayam, and Prashanth, 32, of Thalayolaparambu. One K.N. Ratheesh, 32, of Vaikom was also arrested on the charge of selling the chain in a private financial institution despite knowing that it was stolen and also for selling ganja sourced by the accused from Cumbum in Tamil Nadu while in hiding there.

The accused had snatched the chain belonging to an aged woman living alone at Arakkunnam in Mulanthuruthy by dropping at her house in the guise of guests on January 3. They then fled the scene in a motorcycle. By the time the police identified the accused and launched a hunt for them with the help of CCTV footage, the accused had left the State.

They were in hiding in Tamil Nadu for a while before returning to the State. Since then, Jobin had been working as an assistant to a mahout in Paravur in Kollam and Prasanth at Haripad.

A resident of Paravur who happened to see the lookout notice in the media, identified Jobin and alerted Mulanthuruthy sub inspector M.P. Aby who, with the help of the Paravur police, took the accused into custody. His accomplice was picked up from Haripad based on his statement.

The accused reportedly confessed to have stolen two motorcycles from Thodupuzha and Thalayolaparambu in November and January and snatched another chain weighing around 2.50 sovereigns in Kaduthuruthy in January.

They also had non-bailable charges slapped on them in a case registered by the Thalayolaparambu police for attacking a DYFI activist in January.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/police-arrest-chain-snatchers-living-in-disguise-as-mahouts/article31147016.ece

362,2020/03/24,Mixed response to lockdown,"District administration to take stringent steps

The State-wide lockdown enforced by the government from Monday night to counter the spread of COVID-19 evoked mixed reactions in Kozhikode district.

Private vehicles including two-wheelers are seen in large numbers on the city roads as well as State and national highways from Tuesday morning.

Law enforcers were struggling to convince people who are freely coming out into the streets for minor reasons. Restricting the movement of people has become difficult even as the government adopted unprecedented measures. This was even after Section 144 of Cr.PC was clamped on the district from Monday.

Public transport except autorikshaws and taxis remained off the road. Provision stores, vegetable and fruits vendors and pharmaceutical stores, petrol stations were opened from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Long queues of vehicles are seen at bunks in the morning. Major markets were abuzz with activity.

Supermarkets, which had downed their shutters at 6 p.m. on Monday, reopened in full swing. But most of them were taking protective measures unlike the chicken and meat stalls and fish market.

Meanwhile, the district administration has warned of tightening the clampdown on people roaming the city.

On Tuesday, more police personnel were deployed at retail liquor outlets after an unpleasant incident at a Vadakaka shop where the police had to chase away an unrest mob.

364,2020/03/24,Case against former Mayor,"Alleged obstruction of duty of health officials

The Medical College police on Tuesday slapped a case on CPI(M) leader and former Kozhikode Mayor A.K. Premajam for reportedly misbehaving and obstructing the duty of health officials who had reached her house to inquire about the details of her home- quarantined son and family who flew down from Australia in the first week of March.

The case, the police said, was registered based on a complaint by health circle inspector K.P. Beena and joint health inspector K. Sinoj who had gone to the house of Prof. Premajam after the Health Department received complaints that the family was violating the home quarantine norms and indulging in risky behaviour in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.

Prof. Premjam, also a former MP from Vadakara, was charged with Sections 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public public functions), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 294 (B) (sings, recites or utters any obscene songs, ballads, or words in or near any public place) of the Indian Penal Code.

Allegation denied

However, Prof. Premajam dismissed the allegations that she had verbally abused the health officials. “The health officials came to my house without observing any protective measures such as wearing masks and gloves,” she told The Hindu, and added they had visited at least a dozen houses where people were quarantined. She would submit a complaint against the heath officials to the Chief Minister and State Police Chief, she said.

Her son, his pregnant wife and their three-year-old son had reached Kozhikode from Australia on March 8. They were advised home quarantine for 14 days. “However, on Monday, my son had to go out to get medicines for my daughter-in-law. It was an emergency. We have orally informed the district police chief about the situation,” Prof. Premajam said.

Her daughter-in-law said she had faced the orgy of a health official video-graphing a pregnant woman in night dress. “Our home quarantine period was over. My husband went out to get medicines after I develop uneasiness,” she said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/case-against-former-mayor/article31154534.ece

367,2020/03/24,More curbs at harbours amid pandemic fears,"Restrictions imposed on entry of public for purchase at harbours; conventional auctioning procedures too suspended

More restrictions have been put in place at fishing harbours in Kozhikode district as part of the Fisheries Department’s efforts to minimise the possibility of COVID-19 infection among fishers and coastal families.

There will also be restrictions on the entry of the public for purchase at harbours until further orders. Besides, the conventional auctioning procedures have been suspended.

Matsyafed and Fisheries Department officials will be responsible for conducting safe auctioning with the approval of the district administration. The district administration will review the wholesale prices every week and display them at harbours for fair trade.

Harbour management committees in consultation with the Fisheries Department can implement a total lock-down in case of an emergency.

Such a voluntary regulation is now in place at the Chombal harbour, which has been been approved by the Fisheries Department.

According to members of the Chombal Harbour management committee, restrictions will be on till March 31. “It is likely to leave around 2,000 fishers and allied workers jobless, but we have no other option to meet the challenge,” they said.

There is also a plan to prevent the entry of children and elderly persons to harbours. Awareness boards will be put up near harbour gates.

Police patrol will be intensified to prevent the entry of quarantined individuals to the harbour area. Labour Department officials have been asked to collect details of migrant workers engaged in fishing activities and adopt proper measures for their safety at work.

In line with the safety guidelines under the Break the Chain campaign, hand washing facilities have been made available at all harbours. Similarly, merchants engaged in retail sales will also have to follow safety instructions and wear masks.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/tp2z0s/article31147298.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24-KI-FISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/more-curbs-at-harbours-amid-pandemic-fears/article31147300.ece

Prohibitory orders issued by District Collector Seeram Sambasiva Rao in view of COVID-19 pandemic were thrown to the wind on the first day itself by people who queued up in large numbers in front of various Bevco (Kerala State beverages Corporation Limited) outlets in Kozhikode district.

From Mahe

In Vadakara, the police used canes to disperse the crowd that defied prohibitory orders and thronged a local Bevco outlet.

There were also customers from Mahe where liquor shops were shut.

Indiscipline

The Vadakara police said they had chased away more than 200 persons who had unlawfully assembled in front of the beverages outlet. We used canes as customers were hesitant to leave the spot even after frequent requests, they added.

The situation was almost similar in two major sales outlets of Bevco in Kozhikode city.

Supermarkets in Kozhikode district will no longer entertain home delivery of goods and will stick to WhatsApp orders. Customers will be informed once the ordered goods are packed, after which they can collect them. A decision in this regard was taken by the district unit of Supermarkets say no to online home delivery on Sunday.

The method will be replicated across the State, said association district joint secretary K.M. Haneefa. Customers who wish to shop themselves will be issued tokens wherein only five persons will be allowed to enter a shop at a time.

Timings changed

Also, the timing of supermarkets has been restricted from 10 a.m to 7 p.m.

“We are facing scarcity of commodities such as sugar, chilly, and vegetables, which come from other States. Other than that, there is no shortage. Local produce is being delivered at supermarkets as usual,” Mr. Haneefa said, adding that the association would request the authorities to replenish stock so that the public would get the necessary things. However, the lack of protection for supermarket staff is a matter of concern for the association.

“Our boys have no safety unlike nurses or policemen, even though they too are at a heavy risk. Many of them have dropped out,” Mr. Haneefa said. The association has decided to supply supermarket staff with masks and gloves and to keep sanitisers at each counter.

371,2020/03/24,How liquor ban in Mahe impacts Vadakara,"Influx of people from Gulf leads to rush

A combination of factors such as closure of bar hotels and outlets at Mahe and the return of large number of Non Resident Indians (NRIs) may have led to the unpleasant scenes at a liquor outlet at Edodi in Vadakara on Monday morning.

More than 200 persons had gathered at the Bevco outlet even before liquor retail outlets opened at 10 a.m. despite the District Collector imposing Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).

“It is quite possible that the closure of the outlets at Mahe from Sunday could have led to the mad scramble at the Vakadara shop,” said P.C. Jyothish, a resident of the area.

But in all likelihood, he said, the large influx of returnees from the Gulf, especially at Villiyappaly, Vadakkara, Ayyancherry, and Kuttiyadi, had led to such a situation.

“This is an NRI belt. People are in a celebratory mood, unfazed by the threat posed by COVID-19,” he added.

Owing to the Janata Curfew, all liquor shops and bar hotels remained closed on Sunday.

That could be another reason for the rush at retail outlets as was witnessed in other places in the district such as the Bevco outlet near Sarovaram Biopark on the Kozhikode Bypass.

But then, the police did not resort to lathi charge to chase the crowd away on Monday.

Mahe, a destination of tipplers in the Vadakara and Thalassery regions, has around 60 liquor shops and bars.

The closure of 32 outlets along the national highway passing through the municipal area in the wake of a Supreme Court order in December 2016 had resulted in a similar predicament for drinkers.

For the people of Vadakara, the nearest outlet is at Kuttiyadi, which is more than 20 km away.

But Mahe is just 14 km from Vadakara. And, for the people of Thalassery, it is just 8 km away.

Quarantined people

Besides, people react differently to stressful situations following the COVID-19 outbreak. Even those who have been advised home quarantine are venturing out.

“Most people are not aware of the consequences of the stealth killer,” said K.V. Mohammed, a resident.

Those in isolation for suspected COVID-19 infection or those who are at higher risk are not positively responding to warnings from healthcare workers.

“Of course, isolation is stressful. But a possible spread of the disease is another factor that is causing fear and anxiety among people,” he said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/how-liquor-ban-in-mahe-impacts-vadakara/article31147247.ece

Justice G.R. Swaminathan observed that the petitioner’s relationship with the university was not all that smooth. It was the comment on the management of the university that triggered the institution to lodge a complaint against him, the court said.

375,2020/03/24,96 kg of ganja seized from Danushkodi,"A special team of police seized 96 kg of ganja from Mukundarayar chatram near Dhanushkodi on Tuesday.

It received a call through the Helpline (9489919722) that a huge packet was floating in the sea near a coastal village since Monday evening. The team visited the spot and found narcotics. It found 96 packets inside a bundle. Discreet checks revealed that ganja was stashed in each packet weighing two kg. “Probably, it may be intended to be smuggled to Sri Lanka,” an officer said.

Utilising the Covid-19 situation, smugglers may have dropped the narcotics in the sea and planned to smuggle it in the coming days when the police may be focused on the curfew.

SP Varun Kumar, who visited the spot, directed the police to register a case. He appealed to the public to make use of the Helpline and assured that both information and caller’s identity would be kept confidential.

Meanwhile, the Coastal Security personnel said that a similar racket was busted last month and close to 145 kg of ganja was seized. After patrol/ surveillance teams spotted smugglers, they ran under the cover of darkness in the Sri Lankan waters.

A week after the Supreme Court suo motu took cognisance of overcrowding of prisons in the wake of the spread of COVID-19, a public interest litigation petition was filed before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking a direction to the State to take necessary steps in this regard.

Representing Prisoners Reform Intervention Support Mission (PRISM), its coordinator P. Thangaraj said the World Health Organisation had declared COVID-19 a pandemic and guidelines had been issued to the public to take precautionary measures.

People had been asked to maintain social distance and avoid mass gathering. Under these circumstances, overcrowding of prisons had turned out to be a major concern. The Central prisons in the State at Puzhal and Madurai were witnessing overcrowding.

The petitioner said steps must be taken to address this issue urgently. In order to ease the situation, arrest and remand of petty offenders could be reduced to a minimum and such prisoners could be enlarged on bail on own bond.

Conducting prison adalats would reduce the risk of contagion and they could be held through video conferencing. In the case of parole, the leave period could be extended. Pleas for parole and leave must be considered leniently, he said.

The petitioner further said preventive measures were of paramount importance. Therefore, there should be periodic sanitisation of prison cells, hand sanitisers and masks should be made available to jail staff, and special check-up of the health condition of all prison inmates and new admissions should be done.

Quarantine and isolation wards must be provided at the prisons and new admissions must be quarantined for 14 days. Testing kits should be made available at prison hospitals, he said.

The petitioner also sought a direction to ban entry of family members, visitors and outsiders into prison premises. Instead, the prisoners should be allowed frequent use of phones to contact their family members. Also, trial could be held through video conferencing, he suggested.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/covid-19-fear-pil-plea-deplores-overcrowding-of-prisons-madurai-high-court/article31155989.ece

Sources said the patient was so far “stable” and hoped that he would start responding to the treatment shortly. As of now, three persons – a couple from Nanguneri, aged 67 and 62, and a 72-year-old male from Alangulam – are in the isolation ward of TVMCH with symptoms of COVID-19. Their blood and the swab samples have been sent for analysis.

“The couple recently returned from Australia after visiting their son. As they were suffering from fever, they have been admitted to the isolation ward,” sources said.

Meanwhile, 157 remand prisoners, who had been lodged in the jails in Tirunelveli, Thoothukudi, Tenkasi and Kanniyakumari districts following their arrest in connection with trivial cases, were released from the prisons on their own bail on Tuesday in a bid to avert crowding in jails in the wake of COVID – 19 scare.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/covid-19-positive-patient-stable/article31155973.ece

379,2020/03/24,"210 who returned from other States, countries under scanner","Government Hospitals and 8,000 beds in hostels of colleges have been kept ready to treat patients

A prohibitory order under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure promulgated by Collector R. Kannan that came into effect at 6 p.m. has prohibited gathering of more than five persons to control spread of COVID-19. The order for lockdown would be in force till 6 a.m. of April 1.

He said that penal action would be taken against those who violate the order promulgated under the Indian Penal Code, Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 and Disaster Management Act 2005.

A total of 210 persons, who had come from other States and foreign countries to Virudhunagar district have been asked to undergo home quarantine under monitoring by officials. Though the monitoring has been suspended for 59 persons who have successfully completed home quarantine, they have been asked to remain indoors as a precautionary measure.

Government Hospitals and 8,000 beds in hostels of colleges have been kept ready to treat patients in the event of an outbreak of COVID-19.

The Collector urged the people to cooperate with the district administration to make the district free from COVID-19. All shops selling essential goods like groceries, vegetables, milk would remain open as usual without any interruption. Taluk, municipal and block development offices would serve food to those who dwell on streets to ensure that no one goes without food during the lockdown period.

He appealed to the people to maintain social distancing while going to grocery shops, tea stalls, bakery, meat or fish markets. Lines would be drawn to enable people follow social distance at these places and police personnel would effectively implement it. Those who are found to be hoarding essential items or selling them at exorbitant prices would be punished under the provisions of Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act.

Cautioning people against the practice self medication, he said that some drugs recommended for COVID-19 were of higher power, he said that such drugs without proper prescription by qualified doctors could lead to side-effects. People should approach doctors for symptoms like cold, cough and fever.

Movement of vehicles into and out of Virudhunagar district has been banned through 16 check-posts.

Stating that vehicles carrying essentials like foodgrains, medicines and milk would not be stopped, he said government employees who were residing in nearby districts can get special vehicle pass to cross the district borders, he added.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/210-who-returned-from-other-states-countries-under-scanner/article31155591.ece
380,2020/03/24,Warning stickers pasted on homes of foreign returnees,"Hotel where COVID-19 positive patient stayed for a few days on his return from Dubai was sealed

The district administration started pasting ‘COVID – 19 warning announcement’ in front of homes on Tuesday after identifying foreign returnees and those who have returned from other States since March 1.

When a person from Samooharengapuram was tested positive for COVID-19 on his return from Dubai, Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish appealed to the public to inform them about foreign returnees so as to screen them for the dreaded virus infection in a bid to check ‘community transmission.’

With the ‘community transmission’ posing a serious threat to take the number of COVID-19 positive cases to alarming number, the district administration, in a bid to caution the public to keep themselves away from these returnees, has started pasting the ‘COVID-19 warning announcement’ in front of their houses.

Though Ms. Shilpa had appealed to the returnees from foreign countries and other States to their native places here to inform their presence here to the Medical Officer of the nearest Primary Health Centre or the Block Development Officer for instant medical screening, only a handful have volunteered to do so.

So, the district administration has appealed to the public to alert Village Administrative Officers, Revenue Inspectors, Medical Officers of PHCs, BDOs or the nearest police station about foreign returnees or those who had returned from other States to their native places so that they can be screened for possible infection at the earliest to prevent community transmission.

After identifying and screening them, they are ‘house quarantined’ to avert community transmission. To intensify it further in the absence of cooperation from returnees, neighbours and villagers of returnees are being encouraged to inform officials for appropriate action.

“So far, 584 foreign returnees and those who have returned to Tirunelveli district from other States have been ‘house quarantined.’ This exercise is being closely monitored by the District Revenue Officer, Sub-Collectors of Tirunelveli and Cheranmahadevi and Project Director, District Rural Development Agency,” Ms. Shilpa told reporters here on Tuesday.

She urged the public to stay safe in their houses during the next fortnight following all precautionary measures.

Meanwhile, the hotel at Vannarpet, in which the COVID-19 positive patient stayed for a few days on his return from Dubai on March 17, was sealed on Tuesday for disinfecting it completely. Following instructions from officials, the hotel staff, who served him during his stay in the hotel, have been isolated and asked to remain in a room under observation.

“Blood and swab samples taken from 7 hotel staff have been sent to Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital for analysis. Based on the outcome of the result, we’ll decide on the nature of medical assistance to be extended to them,” said the officials.

Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project’s ongoing construction of 3rd and 4th reactors has been slowed down by going ahead with only essential construction activities by involving around 500 workers.

“Non-essential construction activities have been stopped while the essential activities are going on with 500 workers. All the workers being involved in the construction activities of KKNPP have been asked to remain inside the campus and they will not be allowed to go out at least for next 15 days. Moreover, their health parameters are being monitored even as they are in the workers’ sheds,” a senior KKNPP official said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/warning-stickers-pasted-on-homes-of-foreign-returnees/article31155531.ece
381,2020/03/24,CoP expresses concern over crowds,"‘This can lead to infection of COVID-19 among the people’

Madurai

Though the lockdown of the district borders in southern districts came into effect, Madurai City Commissioner of Police S. Davidson Devasirvatham has expressed concern over continuation of crowding of people in public places.

“People continue to travel in two-wheelers and four-wheelers and crowded in autorickshaws. This could lead to infection of COVID-19 spreading among the people,” he said.

Stating that the lockdown was meant only to protect people from getting infected by the virus, Mr. Davidson said that people should realise that it was only in their and their family members’ interest.

“No one should be complacent that Corona Virus would not infect them. The viral infection could be confirmed only after 14 days. Hence, people without knowing this fact could lead to community spreading by going out into crowded places,” he said.

He advised people to not visit their friends and relatives and also not allow others to visit their houses, the Commissioner warned.

Inspector General of Police, South Zone, K.P. Shanmuga Rajeswaran, said that movement of vehicles from one district to another has been banned at police check posts in southern districts.

Besides enforcing the lockdown, the police officials and personnel were educating the members of public through public address system on the need to stay indoors and not come out of their house unnecessarily.

“We are promoting social distancing while coming out to buy essential items,” the IG said.

Scores of people, including women and children, were found stranded at the MGR Integrated bus stand at Mattuthavani after 6 p.m. when all the bus services were withdrawn fully.

Most of the buses that left the bus stand were fully crowded as scores of people preferred to travel standing instead of getting stranded in Madurai.

Officials of transport department said that the bus services to other districts and neighbouring towns were withdrawn slowly since 5.30 p.m. Only a handful number of city buses were seen plying from one bus stand to another in the city.

A private bus operator who parked the vehicle outside MGR Bus stand charged ₹600 per passenger to ferry desperate passengers going to Tirunelveli at the last minute. A staff was heard telling an aged man who could not afford the fare that it was the last bus and that too an air-conditioned vehicle.

Police personnel were asking people not to gather inside the bus stand and outside it as all bus services had been withdrawn.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/cop-expresses-concern-over-crowds/article31155520.ece
382,2020/03/24,Remain indoors to avoid transmission of virus,"Essential services and goods will be available in adequate quantity at right price

While assuring that there will be no dearth of emergency services and supply of essentials to the public in adequate quantity at the right price, Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish urged the public to cooperate with the official machinery by understanding the real meaning behind the prohibitory orders promulgated in the best interest of the public.

“Since community transmission of viral infection is a very serious issue, the State government has clamped prohibitory orders from 6 p.m. on Tuesday. After appealing to the public repeatedly for several days to stay indoors to be safe, the government has now ordered the public to remain indoors. So please cooperate with us to ensure your and your children’s safety by keeping away from community transmission of viral infection. As essential services and goods will be available in adequate quantity at the right price, there is no need for panic. But stay at home to the maximum extent possible to keep community transmission at bay,” she said while speaking to reporters here on Tuesday evening.

On prohibitory orders clamped under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, she said there would be no public transport while those who were on the move on emergency would be allowed to move further. Though there was no permission for any social gathering, marriages fixed before March 16 would be allowed to be held with minimum of guests. While business establishments would be closed as per the order, export oriented units would be allowed to function with 50% manpower. The Information Technology and Information Technology Enabled Services personnel had been instructed to work from home. While hotels would not serve food on their premises, there was no bar on ‘take aways.’

“Amma canteens will function to prevent starvation of the homeless during this period. Even then, visitors will be allowed to enter to get the food in restricted fashion after their hands are sanitised,” Ms. Shilpa said.

She urged people, who have sufficient stock of essential goods, to remain indoors.

“When a pharmacy in Palayamkottai was found to be selling masks and sanitisers at inflated price, it was closed on Tuesday. Similar action will be taken against hoarders and traders who dare to sell commodities at inflated price,” she said.

The police closed the district’s border with Thoothukudi at Vasavappapuram on the eastern side, with Kanniyakumari at Kaavalkinaru Junction, Karumpuliyooththu near Alangulam with Tenkasi district and with Thoothukudi district at Sannathuputhkkudui near Gangaikondan on the northern side by putting barricades across the four-lane national highway.

383,2020/03/24,Collector invokes Section 144,"He says there is no need to engage in panic buying

Collector T. G. Vinay invoked Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), here on Tuesday at 6 p.m. in the wake of the spread of COVID-19.

The Collector said that people must not gather in groups of over five people in a public place unless in case purchasing essential commodities. He added that residents practise social distancing and ensure at least three feet distance between each other even at their respective homes.

He added that there was no need to engage in panic buying as essential commodities such as milk, vegetables, groceries, meat and fish would be available. “There is quite a rush in shops which can be avoided as all essential commodities will be allowed to enter through the border. Essential commodities will be available to the public,” he said.

Only the district administration, police, fire and rescue, electricity, water supply, prisons, public health, judiciary, local body and treasury will function, he said and added that all other government departments will be closed. Teachers, professors and those in private companies can be allowed to work from home and those manufacturing essential goods can ply with minimum labour, the Collector added.

Those violating the prohibitory orders under relevant provisions of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005 will be heavily penalised, he said.

Addressing the press at a briefing before its imposition, he said that a total of eight members are currently at the Government Rajaji Hospital’s (GRH’s) isolation ward and only one has tested positive for COVID-19.

“We have taken samples from the seven others and are awaiting results. There are a total of 439 people within the district who are quarantined at their respective homes as they have a travel history to the notified countries. Houses where persons have been quarantined have been marked by stickers,” he said.

He added that officials from the Health, Revenue and Police departments are regularly checking on these persons to see if they show any symptoms.

The Collector reiterated that there was no need to crowd in front of shops selling essential commodities as they would function as usual.

He added that there are a total of 20 check posts that are being monitored by police personnel to ensure that vehicles do not cross district borders unless absolutely essential.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/r83mvd/article31155234.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA25CITY-COLLECTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/collector-invokes-section-144/article31155235.ece
384,2020/03/24,Delivering posts through pandemic,"Postal employees put their lives at risk

Postmen from different parts of the city gathered at Gandhi Nagar post office on Tuesday morning for their daily briefing. Here, they were told by a superior officer, “Keep your masks on at all times and wear the gloves. We want to avoid any incidents. Remember that your health comes first,” he said.

The postmen mumbled “yes” and began dispersing to ensure that they collected their delivery for the day.

For postmen and other employees of the postal department, mail delivery has been as usual despite COVID-19. Postmen like S. Murugan* said that they continued to visit banks, houses and commercial establishments as usual on their cycles and bikes.

“The only thing that is different are the ink blue gloves on our hands and the masks on our face,” he said.

Mr. Murugan said that postmen cannot afford to take long leaves during this time because many people’s old age pensions and money orders continue to be delivered by post.

When asked if it is concerning to work on the frontlines and meet people day to day, Mr. Murugan said that all postmen were apprehensive and scared.

“We earn meagre incomes and support our small families. With COVID-19 looming over our head, we are scared of venturing into areas where there are reported cases. A colleague who covers around five km of area in Anna Nagar says that he is concerned whether there may have been some transmission of the virus to him. We can never know about these things and only take precautions,” he said.

Echoing Mr. Murugan's concern, South Zone Regional Secretary of the National Federation of Postal Employees, R. Krishnamoorthy, said that expecting mail to be delivered during these dire times and expecting postal offices to be filled up was a concerning move by the Centre.

“Considering that bus and train services have been stopped, very important mail is not coming to the department. Many other forms of communication have taken precedence. Why should we put the lives of our workers at risk and continue work now?” he asked.

He added that there were at least 600 postmen in the city and the rural areas were working and making themselves susceptible to the virus. Even employees in the department did not have any major work.

“We can certainly attend to it in case of emergency and can make ourselves available at our offices,” he said.

At the moment, employees at Tallakulam, Arasaradi and West Veli Street have asked employees to place sanitisers on their tables, wear disposable gloves and masks on their face. In Tallakulakam, they even have tied neem leaves inside their offices to ensure they can prevent COVID-19. An official from the post office on Collector Office Road says that the Centre must swiftly take steps to ensure that no major local transmission takes place through postal employees as they are vulnerable.

“When the railways department has shut shop, they should think of us too,” he says.

385,2020/03/24,Class 12 students complete board exams amidst COVID-19 fear,"MADURAI

Amidst the COVID-19 outbreak, students of Class 12 completed their board exams here on Tuesday and breathed a sigh of relief.

A total of 34,869 students wrote their Accountancy, Chemistry and Geography exams at 120 centres across Madurai district. There were a total of 1,616 absentees. Members of the Education Department said they were unclear if many students abstained because of COVID-19.

A number of students were seen walking out of their examination centres wearing masks to prevent transmission.

K. Yuvaraaj, a student of M. Ramachandran-Radha Ammal MAVMM. Matriculation Higher Secondary School, said that students were asked to wash their hands using soap before entering the exam hall and later also given sanitizer before they began writing the exam. He added that starting the examination at 10.45 a.m. also helped many students who usually travel by public transport to find a way and make it to the exam hall.

K. Yuvarani, his twin sister, said that both the Accountancy paper and the Chemistry paper were easy to tackle. Yuvaraaj said, “In all of the exams, only the Physics paper seems to have been difficult.”

S. Sundararajan, a parent, said that it was completely unnecessary for students to have written the exam amidst the crisis as it endangered the young lives.

“It is merely an exam. Why put pressure on students to risk lives when there is so much panic,” he asked.

“We ensured that the students maintained a minimum of five feet distance between each other to ensure social distancing and prevention of malpractices. Teachers, hall monitors and supervisors too washed their hands and used sanitisers. This is the last exam students from State Board will be writing for now as Class 11 exams have been postponed,” said District Chief Education Officer R. Swaminathan.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/6oz8bb/article31154785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA25CITY-CLASS12,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/class-12-students-complete-board-exams-amidst-covid-19-fear/article31154787.ece
386,2020/03/24,How clean are buses and private cabs?,"Public transport vehicles, including TNSTC buses, omni buses, autorickshaws, minibuses, private and tourist cabs, have been regularly cleaned and disinfectant sprays are being used to mitigate Covid-19 fear since March 15, according to Collector T.G. Vinay.

He told The Hindu that on an average, close to 80,000 commuters used the city buses and other modes of transports operated by the government and private operators.

Apart from this, mofusil operations to neighbouring districts transported about a lakh people to different destinations such as Karaikudi, Dindigul, Theni, Ramanathapuram, Paramakudi, Tirunelveli and others.

Considering the need to keep the vehicles clean and tidy in the wake of the pandemic, the State government had instructed the officials to take stock and keep them in hygienic way, he said and added that for the number of passenger movement daily (except on March 22, which was declared as janata curfew), all other days, the operations were normal.

Four days ago, a meeting was convened by the Transport Department with the TNSTC officials, private mofusil bus operators and the officials. The Collector urged the officials to sensitise the bus crew to keep themselves clean. Handwashing and social distancing were mandatory and that over-crowding should not be permitted under any circumstances.

Autorickshaw drivers and cab operators were also told to adhere to the guidelines, else they have to face the consequences. Everyone should be socially responsible at this time of crisis. The pandemic can be overcome only if the public understand the gravity of the Covid-19, officials said.

Transport Department officials said that the Regional Transport Offices were equipped with handwash liquid. The RTOs continued to function as they had to register the BS-1V model vehicles before March 31, as per the Central government notification.

Hence, the rush is high, the RTOs from Madurai North, Central and South said. “We are taking adequate precautions in the offices and also educating the drivers and conductors to follow the instructions,” they added.

For the last one week, cleaning and spraying disinfectant materials had become a routine exercise. Right from handlebars, holders, seats in buses are fumigated in the morning and evening. In between, the crew is provided with herbal soaps. There are also handmasks issued for the conservancy workers and staff at the maintenance department.

An RTO said in the MGR bus stand at Maatuthavani alone, the staff have cleaned up and fumigated 1,290 vehicles, including 443 autorickshaws, 33 minibuses, 130 omnibuses and tourist taxis.

“The exercise has been strenuous, but has led to safe travel for the commuters...” the RTO noted.

For the volume of passengers handled since March 15 (except for March 22, which was declared as janata curfew), there has not been any major issues so far, a Health officer from Madurai Corporation said.

A bus crew at Periyar bus stand said that many commuters continued to spit in the open while travelling, despite sensitisation and awareness being given. The law-enforcement officers should tighten and impose fines, they opined.

The TNSTC General Manager S. Rajeswaran in a press release said that all their drivers, conductors and maintenance staff, were sensitised by students of CSI College of Nursing.

“We have adequate stock of soaps, handwash materials and others....” he added. Another official said that they had received funds from the government for procuring materials for handwash in the wake of Covid-19.

The railways, which had suspended its operations and the premises is closed to public entry, had utilised the opportunity to clean the platforms, fumigate open spaces and keep them clean, officials said.

Except for the essential services, which include Aavin, TANGEDCO, media, civic authorities engaged in health and garbage disposal, it is a shutdown for movement of general public. The police have already taken positions across the city’s vantage points to ensure that the curfew is total from 6 p.m. on Tuesday.

387,2020/03/24,COVID-19: Those in contact with 54-year-old Madurai patient are being screened,"Hospital authorities said the patient is currently in stable condition

Officials from the Health Department of the Madurai Corporation and the Public Health Department will be screening a total of 45 people who were in contact with the 54 year-old patient who has tested positive for COVID-19 at the Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH), said District Collector T. G. Vinay, here on Tuesday.

The 54 year-old who had no travel history and had contacted the virus through local transmission, had unstable vitals on Monday night and doctors at the GRH contemplated putting him on ventilator support. However, the patient recovered and is currently in stable condition, said a source at the hospital.

On Friday, when the patient began to have symptoms, he had visited a local clinic. He later went to a private hospital on Saturday where a CT scan of his chest was taken, said a source from the Public Health department. The private hospital referred the patient to the GRH for isolation.

The Collector said to The Hindu that the patient was a building contractor and the vice president of the board of a mosque committee. He had offered prayers and had attended a get-together which had a minimum of 20 people last week.

Another officer said that they were segregating the initial list of people the patient met into three categories -- close contact, primary contact and secondary contact based on the proximity to the patient.

“We obtained a list of people who have been in touch with the patient through his son. We have also isolated the patient’s wife and son at the moment. Based on the initial list we have drawn up, we will be checking the co-morbidity and associated risks and then will recommend isolation at the GRH or strict home quarantine,” the Collector said.

‘Need not be community transmission’

“This need not be a case of community transmission. Madurai being a pilgrimage centre, he could have come in contact with a traveller from abroad. We are looking at all possibilities from the places he visited. The patient visited mosques and attended a wedding. There may be a chance of contact in these places,” a health official said. The patient has co-morbidities including uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension.

The department has also received information that a group of foreign nationals were visiting pilgrimage spots in Madurai and efforts are on to track them. “Some of the patients, who had returned from abroad, had come here out of fear of COVID-19 in that country.

Officials have so far traced and quarantined 14 contacts of the State’s ninth COVID-19 patient, a 64-year-old woman who returned from the USA via Singapore. This included her husband and domestic help, while the remaining were visitors. For the eighth patient, a 43-year-old man who is undergoing treatment in Tirunelveli, who had returned from Dubai to Madurai airport, the department has traced and quarantined 51 of his contacts including co-passengers in the flight, and place of stay - a hotel.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/nzodyf/article31149888.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MARTH--CORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/covid-19-those-in-contact-with-54-year-old-madurai-patient-are-being-screened/article31149889.ece
388,2020/03/24,"Anxious, people swarm supermarkets and empty shelves in Madurai","They are in no mood to a rely on assurance from authorities that shops selling milk, vegetables and groceries will be open

Following the announcement of Chief Minister on the state-wide promulgation of prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure till March 31, people thronged supermarkets across the city for stocking groceries and other essential commodities.

However, there is no need to indulge in panic buying urged the officials from the district administration. They said that all essential commodities will be available and shops selling milk, vegetables, provisions, meat and fish will remain open. The Corporation officials even made public announcements to this effect on Monday evening.

But within two hours of the announcement, long, serpentine queues had formed in front of a few supermarkets in the city. Triggered by COVID-19 fear, people hurried through department stores, carrying large trolleys and baskets.

Aruna, a resident of Narayanapuram, said she saw the announcement on television and immediately rushed to the nearest supermarket. “Though it is said grocery shops will be open, there is no clarity. Also, we don’t know how we can leave home during curfew,” she said. By evening, many people also rushed to stores to buy vegetables, especially those which had longer shelf life. “Following the observance of Janata curfew on Sunday, there was two-fold increase in prices of vegetables on Monday. Despite the high prices, people rushed after them. By, evening the entire stock was over and many returned home dejected,” said S. Selvaraj, owner of a vegetable shop, said.

P. Selvin, branch manager of Shri Kannan Departmental Store at Teppakulam, said that for the past few days there had been a rush at the shop. “But, within an hour of the announcement, around 150 people rushed in. And they were engaged in panicky large-scale shopping,” he said.

R.U. Sreekuttan filled his entire trolley with huge quantities of different types of pulses. “There is a fear that the prohibitory order can be extended. So we thought that we will hurry and buy as much as we can,” he said.

A branch manager of a leading supermarket chain in K.K.

389,2020/03/24,"Economic package soon, says FM","Task force still not constituted, but FM speaks of multilayered sub-groups holding consultation

An economic package to deal with COVID-19 situation will be announced soon, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman promised on Tuesday afternoon, adding that the government and regulators are constantly monitoring the state of the economy, markets and rupee depreciation.

However, she still offered little clarity on the composition of an economic task force announced by the PM last week, and explained the delay in announcing an economic package by saying extensive consultations were needed, and till yesterday, Parliament was in session and the Finance Bill had to be cleared.

“Work is going on and we are very close to coming out with an economic package, which will be announced sooner rather than later,” she said, adding that the Centre, the Reserve Bank and the regulators have been jointly monitoring the volatility in the stock markets thrice daily. “Every attention is being given to the economy. The Prime Minister himself is closely monitoring the situation. A multi-layered composition of the task force is already working.”

As The Hindu had reported on Tuesday morning, the economic task force announced in the PM’s address to the nation on March 19 has still not been constituted, with the Finance Ministry saying the PM’s Office or the Cabinet Secretariat would be responsible for issuing an order to create it. On Tuesday evening, after the FM’s press conference, a Finance Ministry spokesperson once again confirmed to The Hindu that no order has yet been issued to set up the task force.

Ms. Sitharaman was more ambiguous about the status of the task force, saying that sub-groups of MPs, academics and industry leaders were already generating ideas for the task force, but refused to elaborate on its composition or specific mandate. “The Finance Ministry is working intensively on all these suggestions which are coming in from the various sub groups within the multi-layered task force that exists,” she said. “So the work of the task force which is multi-layered is already almost nearing a conclusion. So the task force and the task force based report and the action following the task force’s report are almost at its peak and that is why I have said we will announce the economic package sooner rather than later.”

She did not respond to specific queries on how the economic package would provide relief for millions of informal sector and daily wage workers who have been hit the hardest by the shutdown.

Ms. Sitharaman attributed the delay in announcing an economic package to the need for extensive consultations and to first pass the Finance Bill. “I appreciate that you would have liked the package to be announced last week. But most things which are as big as an economic package for this kind of unusual situation requires a lot of consultation to get it right,” she told journalists.

‘No intention to delay’

“We had no intention to delay, we don’t want to delay, but then but let us be realistic. Till yesterday, the Parliament was in session and the Finance Bill had to be cleared,” she said adding that she would have been happy to announce the package in the House if it was ready and the Finance Bill had been passed. “And once the Finance Bill got cleared, it was important for the MPs to recognise there is a lockdown in this country, so everyone had to go where they had to go and serve and be of use for their own constituents. So the Parliament adjourned sine die.”

In the final hours of the Lok Sabha session on Monday, a number of opposition MPs had been pressing the Finance Minister to make a statement on the COVID-19 situation and the government’s package before the Finance Bill was passed.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/iry9o5/article31156605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THBUFM,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/economic-package-soon-says-fm/article31156606.ece

Rajan Wadhera, president, SIAM said, “The series of announcements made by the Finance Minister will lower the challenges for companies in the immediate term.”

Extending deadline

However, K.E. Raghunathan, past president, All India Manufacturers Association, said, “The deadline for February GST returns, which was due to be filed on March 20, should have also been extended as many MSMEs have not filed the returns for February as yet.”

Colin Shah, vice-chairman, Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council of India, said, “These measures will give some relief to a lot of very worried entrepreneurs. Exporters welcome the announcement that customs will now function as an essential service and will be working 24X7 till June 30, 2020.”

“The FM’s announcement that companies with an annual turnover of less than ₹5 crore will not be levied any interest, penalty or late fee with respect to GST till June 30, 2020 will help MSMEs in the gem and jewellery sector,” Mr. Shah said. Kamal Khetan, CMD, Sunteck Realty Ltd., said “In the light of the economic slowdown due to COVID-19 pandemic, the government is moving positively to support India Inc. “The announcement by the FM on relaxation of rules for TDS, GST and corporate compliances come as a much-needed respite.”",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ycp6rn/article31156243.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THBURAJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/fms-announcements-welcomed/article31156244.ece
391,2020/03/24,RBI advances variable rate term repo auction,"Central bank bid to meet liquidity needs

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to to advance the first of the two variable rate term repo auctions to March 26 from March 30.

The central bank had announced two such auctions of ₹25,000 crore each on March 30 and March 31 to address the additional demand for liquidity.

“On a review of the rapidly evolving financial conditions and taking into account the impact of disruptions caused by COVID-19, it has been decided to advance the first auction scheduled for March 30, 2020 to March 26, 2020” the RBI said in a statement.

There is no change in the auction scheduled for March 31, 2020.

“As a special case, standalone primary dealers (SPDs) were also allowed to participate in these auctions along with other eligible participants,” the central bank said in the statement.

It has been decided to temporarily enhance liquidity available to SPDs under the Reserve Bank’s Standing Liquidity Facility (SLF) from ₹2,800 crore to ₹10,000 crore with immediate effect, in order to facilitate year-end liquidity management by SPDs.

392,2020/03/24,Aramco capex cut may hurt BPCL divestment,"Company’s move amid declining oil demand is likely to affect Reliance Industries’ stake sale as well

The world’s largest oil firm Saudi Aramco’s decision to cut its capital expenditure (capex) by $10 billion is likely to hurt the divestment of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and also the oil giant’s plans to buy a 20% stake in Reliance Industries Ltd.’s oil-to-chemicals business, according to analysts.

Saudi Aramco is planning to cut its 2020 capex to $25- 30 billion from the original $35-40 billion amid concerns over oil demand owing to the outbreak of COVID-19.

The oil major’s capex stood at $32.8 billion in 2019.

Saudi Aramco’s decision may have a direct bearing on the government’s plan to divest its 52.98% stake in BPCL as Saudi Aramco was seen as one of the front runners to buy the stake.

According to Saudi Aramco’s annual report, the company will focus on downstream in high-growth markets, including India.

BPCL’s market capitalisation has dropped by more than half to ₹56,910 crore as on Tuesday compared to almost ₹1,20,000 crore in November 2019.

BPCL shares on Tuesday closed down 2.62% to ₹262.35, valuing the company at ₹56,910.35 crore. At current price, governments 52.98% stake will be valued at ₹30,151 crore.

“It will be very difficult for the government to sell BPCL at this valuation,” said a Mumbai- based oil analyst.

Aramco’s focus now is to increase oil production up to 12.3 million barrels per day (mbpd) compared with its average production of 9.7 mbpd amid an oil price war.

Even as Aramco’s management is confident of meeting investors’ 2020FY earnings / dividend expectations even if oil price remains at about $30, the company will consider modifying 2021FY capex plan.

Stock price correction

Nomura, while raising its weight on Reliance Industries (RIL) due to lower oil prices, said the recent correction in stock price (down 33% vs. Nifty down 28%) factors in potential failure to close the Saudi Aramco deal and lower refining and petrochem margins.

Saudi Aramco, in a conference call, stated that it was still conducting due diligence on a potential investment in RIL’s oil-to-chemicals operations.

Once the evaluation was complete, it would move to the next stage of the approval process.

RIL management, in its Q3 earnings briefing, reiterated that its March 2021 deleveraging target remained unchanged and was not conditional on any transaction (such as Aramco).

“We note that the RIL stock price is down 34% from its peak (in December 2019) and below the price at which they had announced stake sale to Aramco — implying the market is not factoring in this transaction,” said BofA Securities in research note to its clients.

“Aramco has the capability to close both the deals simultaneously as they believe their oil will last till eternity. They want long term buyers for Saudi oil.

“However, given the market conditions, the valuations of the both the deals could change to a great extent,” an official of an oil PSU told The Hindu.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/agv34y/article31156250.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THBUARAMCO,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/aramco-capex-cut-may-hurt-bpcl-divestment/article31156251.ece

Ramco Fabrics, a Ramco Group company and a division of Rajapalayam Mills Ltd., has commenced the commercial production of its yarn dyeing and weaving plant at Rajapalayam in Tamil Nadu to produce dyed Greige fabric.

The new unit was established as part of the forward integration plan. It entailed an investment of ₹250 crore and it will have an initial production capacity of 10 million metres of Greige yarn-dyed fabrics per annum, said a top official of the group.

Besides, it would also cater to the fibre-dyeing needs of Ramco Melange products, said A.V. Dharmakrishnan, director, Rajapalayam Mills.

Earlier, Ramco’s customers purchased high count yarn from the mill and gave it to a third party for weaving. Later, it was used for making fabrics. “To forego all the trouble, our customers asked us to provide value-added product to them so that they can get woven yarn of consistent quality. For us, it is a value-added step towards forward integration and the customers got consistent quality of weaved yarn,” he said.

Ramco’s textile division comprises Rajapalayam Mills Ltd. and eight other manufacturing units. It boasts of a revenue of ₹1,300 crore.

Carborundum Universal Ltd. (CUMI, a Murugappa Group company, has doubled its installed capacity of its abrasives division at Sriperumbudur, near here, at an investment of ₹48 crore.

CUMI, which manufactures coated abrasives, has an existing installed capacity of 15 million sq. metre per annum.

Since the existing facility had a capacity utilisation of over 90%, the company felt it necessary to double the installed capacity to 30 million sq.metre per annum. The new facility went into commercial production on Saturday.

The fresh investment of ₹48 crore was funded from internal accruals.

The capacity addition was undertaken to augment the existing coated abrasives facility that would cater to the growing market demand for coated products for domestic and international markets, the company said in a regulatory filing.

396,2020/03/24,Moody’s downgrades Indiabulls,"The rating agency said an extended period without access to funding could result in significant damage to Indiabulls’ franchise.

Moody’s Investors Service has downgraded the corporate family rating (CFR) and foreign-currency senior secured rating of Indiabulls Housing Finance Limited (Indiabulls) to B3 from B2.

In addition, Moody’s has downgraded Indiabulls’ foreign and local currency senior secured MTN programme ratings to (P)B3 from (P)B2. The outlook on all ratings remains negative, it said, adding, “The downgrade and negative outlook reflect Moody’s expectation that Indiabulls’ access to funding will remain challenging for longer than expected. This is because wholesale funding markets remain largely closed to many financial institutions following the imposition of a moratorium on Yes Bank as well as the broader risk aversion currently prevalent in financial markets globally,” Moody’s said.

The rating agency further said that there is significant uncertainty around when Indiabulls will regain access to market funding which will result in an increase of Indiabulls’ reliance on asset sales as the primary source of liquidity to repay maturing obligations.

“Prima facie, expected cash inflows (customer loan repayments) are sufficient to meet outflows (debt repayments). However, loan repayment rates and debt prepayments are volatile, increasing the risk of a missed payment and as result the risk to creditors. Highlighting these risks, debt repayments over the last nine months ending December 31, 2019 were much higher than the company expected,” it said.

The rating agency said an extended period without access to funding could result in significant damage to Indiabulls’ franchise. The mortgage lender’s loan book has been contracting since December 2018, and new disbursements have reduced significantly. This could lead to reduction in profitability because of lower net interest margins and higher cost-to-income ratios.

Moody’s also expects the company’s asset quality will continue to weaken. “Real estate developers are among the most stressed borrowers in India and are facing the brunt of risk aversion by way of tight access to funding. With the operating environment in India remaining challenging, Moody’s expects the home loans and LAP portfolios will also continue to deteriorate,” it added.

397,2020/03/24,Sensex recovers 693 points amid govt measures to aid coronavirus-hit economy,"NSE Nifty settled 190.80 points down.

A day after the historic rout, equity benchmark Sensex bounced back to close 693 points higher on Tuesday as investors noted governments across the world taking prompt economic measures to offset the financial damage from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Indian equities followed an improved investor sentiment in Asia after the Federal Reserve announced limitless bond-buying programme to support the U.S. economy.

Meanwhile, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said an economic package to help through the coronavirus lockdown was in works even as fresh cases of virus spread reported from various parts of the country.

After gyrating 1,823.97 points, the BSE barometer gave up some gains to end 692.79 points or 2.67% higher at 26,674.03. It hit an intra-day high of 27,462.87 and a low of 25,638.90.

Similarly, the NSE Nifty settled 190.80 points, or 2.51%, down at 7,801.05.

Top gainers in the Sensex pack included Infosys, Bajaj Finance, Maruti, HUL, HCL Tech and Reliance Industries, while M&M, IndusInd Bank, ITC, PowerGrid and L&T were among the losers.

According to experts, a major package from the government of India and the Reserve Bank is expected shortly, and the market is likely to remain hugely volatile with rising possibility of V shaped recovery occasionally.

The US Fed is now leading from the front with its historic package which includes open-ended purchase of securities, direct loans to companies, purchase of corporate bonds, lending against student loans and credit card loans, they said.

The Federal Reserve on Monday announced it will buy unlimited amounts of US Treasury debt – essentially printing money for the economy – as well as new steps to lend directly to small- and medium-sized companies that have been among the hardest-hit as economic activity dries up.

Other central banks are also expected to follow suit with bold measures to ease the severely strained credit and financial markets, experts noted.

Traders said extreme lockdown measures taken by the government of India and authorities across the world still weigh on global investor sentiment.

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul rallied up to 8%. Exchanges in Europe too rallied up to 6%.

Meanwhile, the rupee appreciated marginally against the US dollar to 76.17 (intra-day).

Global crude benchmark, Brent crude futures rose 5.22% to USD 28.44 per barrel.

Hey there, and welcome back to Clued In!

Well, as the novel coronavirus threat forces us all into lockdown mode, we have all the more time to luxuriate in crossword puzzles! No but seriously, we need to be all the more vigilant, careful and hope we come through this crucial period with our mental and physical well-being intact.

Here’s a timely clue from a The Hindu Cryptic puzzle by Arden that packed all these elements into one telling phrase whose surface meaning and solution we’d all do well to take to heart at this juncture.

The Hindu Cryptic #12891 | Arden | (13 Down) Clue surface : Stand and watch with alertness (7,3) Answer : WEATHER EYE Definition: with alertness Clue type : charade Annotation : WEATHER (‘stand’) followed by (‘and’) EYE (‘watch’)

Keeping a weather eye on something means being sensitive to external changes and agile when it comes to adjusting one’s strategy or approach accordingly. For the most part, this probably translates to having a keen ear to the news and developments in the ongoing situation. In the present case, the message is clear. If humanity is to weather the storm that is currently swirling across the globe, we need to be collectively and consciously watchful and respond effectively.

weather eye noun pronounciation: sounds like ‘whether I’ common usage/idiom: keep a weather eye on something — steady watchfulness, especially alertness to change eg: “Keep your weather eye open; that means pay attention and be careful.”

So keep a weather eye on The Hindu’s reportage during the coming days!

401,2020/03/24,Long live the nation-state,"The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that the nation-state is not only alive but absolutely essential

Paradoxical as it may sound, COVID-19, a global menace, has demonstrated the resilience of the nation-state often portrayed as antediluvian by the advocates of globalisation. It has ended up strengthening the relevance of national boundaries as the major instrument for the control of the spread of the virus. One of the first things that governments have done is to close borders and stop international travel. Even some members of the European Union have imposed entry restrictions on citizens of fellow members with a high number of infections. The precept “the nation state is dead” has been turned on its head and replaced with “long live the nation state”.

The principal barriers

The COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated that national boundaries are seen as the principal barriers to the spread of the disease. Air traffic across most state boundaries has either been halted or drastically curtailed and foreign citizens have been denied entry into national space. Even the search for a COVID-19 vaccine has become a matter of international competition. For the U.S., Europe and China, national pride is at stake in this race. Accusations have been made that the U.S. is attempting to poach European, especially German, advances towards finding a vaccine in an effort to outdo its competitors.

Self-perceived great powers such as the U.S. and China are especially worried that their inability to control the virus and find antidotes to it could not only lead to loss of face but also in the long run irretrievably erode their image as great powers with the capacity to set the international security and economic agendas. American commentators and policymakers are especially concerned that their failure to act quickly and lead the world in finding a solution to the crisis could even result in a reversal in the global pecking order with the U.S. losing its pre-eminent position to China. National pride and national security issues have thus become irretrievably intertwined with the search to combat COVID-19.

All this is happening while simultaneously political leaders and pundits are making statements daily about the urgent need for international cooperation to prevent the spread of the disease. It is obvious that practice in the time of the pandemic is exactly the opposite of the orations about the need for global cooperation to combat it. Moves such as closures of borders and bans on commercial international flights make sense for the simple reason that the effective structure of governance is largely circumscribed by national boundaries. Laws are made and enforced by state authorities. Despite all the talk of global governance, supra-national bodies, whether regional or global, have very limited capacities to control the day-to-day lives of human beings. And a pandemic such as this needs effective methods of ordering the lives of citizens. Only the state and its representatives can perform this role.

Identifying with governments

Moreover, human beings obey orders not simply because they are issued but because they consider the issuing authority legitimate and, even more, identify with it at an emotional level. No matter how ineffective or bumbling national governments may be, their legitimacy as authoritative institutions is far greater than that of any competing institutions. People’s emotional identification with them because of the sense of national identity drilled into their consciousness from an early age also make them comparatively far more effective institutions for the enforcement of orders especially in times of crisis.

It is no wonder therefore that the pandemic has also become a major source of resuscitation for the nation-state that for the last few decades has been facing challenges from advocates of globalisation. It has demonstrated that the nation-state is not only alive and well but absolutely essential particularly in times of crisis and that the rhetoric about its imminent demise is vastly exaggerated.

402,2020/03/24,COVID-19: Many tasks at hand,"India has a formidable challenge ahead as it needs to control the disease, combat misinformation and protect civil liberties

As COVID-19 continues its global rampage, India has taken drastic steps to stem its spread. It has banned incoming international commercial flights till March 31, established rules of quarantine for those returning from abroad, and put its healthcare system on high alert. All this is justifiable given that its high population density makes ‘social distancing’ difficult. Also, a vast number of people depend on public healthcare, so tracking the spread of the disease is a formidable challenge. But to truly contain this pandemic, we need to make a distinction between scientific information that can support a balanced epidemiological response and misinformation that will adversely affect our efforts.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Access to healthcare

From an epidemiological perspective, the weakest links during a pandemic are testing, control, and engaged community participation. So, the first step is to shore up the healthcare system and, as the World Health Organization has recommended, create capacity in hospitals (public and private) for everyone who shows symptoms to access testing facilities. Providing full and free testing to all who need it is critical for effectively controlling the spread. The variable (or differing) experiences of Italy, France, Switzerland and the U.S. highlight that COVID-19 tests and treatment should particularly be available and accessible to people in high-risk groups (those suffering from HIV/AIDS, drug-resistant tuberculosis, or have underlying medical conditions) and from low-income backgrounds. In this regard, although access to healthcare has improved to a large extent in India, the polarisation of healthcare facilities between the private and public sector does not provide the right framework to channel timely medical services during a pandemic. In the short-run, public healthcare services will be hard-pressed to provide the requisite support to low-income groups. In the absence of clear and targeted actions to replenish their capacity, they will not be able to cope with the pressures in the longer run. This needs to be urgently addressed, in the absence of which the poor — whom privatisation and the market economy have systematically excluded — will now be the weakest link in any effort to contain the virus.

The inexorable rise of fake news is a big threat to engaged community participation and public morale. COVID-19 is already deeply affecting economic activity, and fake videos linking its spread to the meat and poultry sector have led to a low demand for these products and, consequently, large-scale losses. Advocating particular cures or linking the virus to factors such as stress without underlying scientific evidence can cause a lot of damage as such misinformation creates confusion and prevents communities from following instructions from authorities and being united against the threat. Fake news also diverts attention from grim realities. The truth is that the economy will suffer drastically, and we need a clear plan of how we will tackle this over months. The poor will be the worst affected, including informal workers, workers in the gig economy, or those running small businesses, and social safety nets are not adequately in place. Sharing information on how we can address these issues and promoting democratic deliberations should become a policy and social priority. A crucial role of the government at this time is to offset panic, and to promote a sense of solidarity, stability and confidence. There can be no room for empty political statements and no space for errors.

Civil liberties

There is also the risk that in the guise of disease tracking and control, we will fall into the trap of eroding more civil liberties. Lockdowns, curfews and travel bans are already a suppression of civil rights. We need to be clear of what measures we are embarking on, and how that affects all of us. For example, is it logical to suspend rights of our own people to return in case of absolute necessity, and does the epidemiological reason justify separating people from their families for any amount of time?

As we move ahead, we need to employ mechanisms that tackle the pandemic no doubt, but do so while protecting civil and personal rights of citizens. The Chinese have massively re-purposed their surveillance system for epidemiological control to reduce infection rates, and the U.S. government has announced that it is in talks with tech companies to access phone location data to map the spread of the virus. The U.S., a democracy, has many checks and balances in place to ensure that this kind of data is not misused, but India does not. Indians therefore need guarantees that the use of surveillance in the name of disease control does not end up serving other purposes, now or in the future.

403,2020/03/24,For a new generation of heroes in court,"It is because of their righteous conduct and commitment to the Constitution that some judges stand out

Shortly after Justice S. Muralidhar rose on his last day as a judge of the Delhi High Court, there was a snaking queue of lawyers waiting to not just bid farewell to him but to also say thank you. Justice Muralidhar is one of the rare few who is erudite, incisive, disciplined and yet self-effacing. His tenure on the bench was marked by a no-nonsense approach to finish cases, thereby making severe dents in the pendency figures at the court. His penultimate day in Delhi saw him doing what he does best — speak truth to power and soundly rebuff every attempt by the government to avoid affixing responsibility for the recent riots, all the while knowing that he would pay a price for his expedition. Sure enough, his transfer orders were issued overnight, depriving him of any further role.

Any person in those circumstances would have felt vexed and despondent. However, we found him welcoming us all with affection, unfazed by the drama. “I have my task cut out for me,” he said, alluding to the large pendency of cases at Chandigarh. The moment was deeply emotional. As we were leaving, one of our companions (who had given consent to be appointed as a judge) said with a wry smile, “At least I found my role model, what about you?”

Need for a beau idéal

We are now at a time where we need heroes so that our institutions survive. It is not that the present epoch is exceptionally challenging for the higher judiciary. The last 50 years have seen the political playbook take a clear form — appoint a sympathiser, allow them to feel obliged, and then try to redeem the debt at an opportune time. It is merely that the manual has a new master, but the tricks remain the same. It is precisely to guide one through this morass that a beau idéal is necessary.

If one were to merely glance at the great judges over the ages — Vivian Bose, Hidayatullah, H.R. Khanna, M.N. Venkatachaliah, Ruma Pal, R.M. Lodha, and many more — it was not merely their learning and innate brilliance that set them apart. Nor was it the fact that they were flawless — they would be the first to admit to their failings. What made them unique was their ability to inspire their peers by simple, righteous conduct. They were wedded to the judicial institution and through it, aligned with the constitutional fabric. In every decision they made, they were solemnly aware of the hopes of millions, and that any weakness of purpose would weaken the edifice.

As of this month, 395 out of 1,079 High Court posts are lying unoccupied. The venerable Lord Hailsham had referred to judicial office as “a privilege, a pleasure and a duty”, but it appears that this aphorism is lost on the many able young women and men who have declined offers.

A primer

The travails of judicial life have been well catalogued, particularly withdrawal from society and the financial handicaps that accrue, but there are several who have sacrificed thriving litigation practices in order to offer their services to the public. These and others form the majority of the judges in our courts, and the few who are found to be otherwise need not discourage new candidates. What the new candidates do need, however, is a gentle primer on what pitfalls to avoid while they tread the path with gavel in hand.

The first is to eschew ambition. Lord Denning said, “Once a man becomes a judge, he has nothing to gain from further promotion”. Such is the regard attached to the station, and for it to remain so, the attractions of Chief Justiceship or post-retirement sinecures ought to be cast aside. It is true that from the early years of Independence, judges have been nominated or elected to Parliament, appointed to gubernatorial office, and accepted diplomatic postings, none of which reflects the values that the court was to uphold. But then, it would be unfair to overlook the hundreds of others who have slogged for the judiciary with no other motive than to do justice, and who have overcome personal and professional challenges in doing so.

The second is to banish sycophancy. Flattery is often found to be a useful tool, either to toady up to judges in the collegium or to be at the receiving end of obsequious attention. As Burke said, it corrupts both the receiver and the giver. The reward is the office itself, and any puffery is utterly inconsequential.

All judges should exercise independence. Even a puisne judge is a high constitutional officer in his own right. There ought to be no hesitation in disagreeing with a colleague’s unjust opinion no matter the gap in experience or reputation. Where the position becomes untenable, there is always the softer option of recusing oneself from the Bench. Recusals are indeed utilised for less palatable purposes by less agreeable individuals, but those are aberrations not to be emulated.

It is important to be innovative. Digital screens and online databases have become integral tools to dispensing justice. Timetables are being set, costs imposed for tardiness, and adjournments are no longer de rigueur. Even set patterns of conduct are being questioned, reviewed and rebooted if they are broken or inefficient. For example, many younger presiding judges in the Supreme Court have broken with the tradition of finishing work on admission days before lunch, and have decided to stay on and dispose of cases finally.

They must show character. The Uncle Judge syndrome continues unabated. Even if many colleagues have relatives practising profitably in the same court without demur or receiving empanelments from corporations and governments, it does not create a new normal. As Charles Marshall said, “Integrity is doing the right thing when you don’t have to — when no one else is looking or will ever know — when there will be no congratulations or recognition for having done so.” Justice A.K. Patnaik and his son did precisely that, by ensuring that the latter did not commence practice at his home High Court and then shifted abruptly from the Supreme Court upon his father’s arrival, thereby happily paying a price that must have been substantial.

Power and responsibility

Judges need fear nothing. With security of tenure and constitutional protections, a judge can remain undaunted by external influence, least of all by the executive. They can soar to unimaginable heights with the wide power that is theirs. And this power, as the New Testament tells us, must be used wisely, “to admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all.” [1 Thessalonians 5:14]

The true stars of India’s justice system are the thousands of judges who toil over dusty briefs. It is they who will never make headlines and never seek it, but take a clear conscience and a straight spine to their well-earned rests. For their sake, and for the sake of this nation, the time has come to induct a new generation of heroes.

404,2020/03/24,The age of the neoliberal virus,"In their response to the pandemic, countries have hardly evinced concern about the health and well-being of workers

The coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease is the first neoliberal virus in the world. To say so is not to reduce its dangers — particularly to the already vulnerable, such as the old, the ill or the poor (who cannot isolate without starving) — but to criticise how it has been confronted by most governments across the world. This even applies to the better social welfare capitalist States of Europe — such as Denmark, where I live.

Hits and misses

On March 12, Denmark largely shut down for at least two weeks, as did many other European nations, with the exception of the United Kingdom and some others. There were about 500 known cases in Denmark then, out of a population of six million. This shutdown was necessary, and could have been implemented a few days earlier.

However, other necessary things were not and, at the moment I write this essay (17th March), are still not being implemented.

One of the most crucial is testing. Denmark, like many other European nations, is testing only acute cases. If you have mild symptoms — and at least a hundred other diseases give you the same symptoms — you are simply expected to self-isolate (in doubt). At the same time, Denmark has sealed its borders — a political gesture in the absence of widespread internal testing. It is also surprising that while it takes two to four days for test results to become available in rich western nations, it takes only four hours in the afflicted regions of China.

So, what do we make of this? Evidently, it is a neoliberal response, despite the structure of social welfare and a very good health system in countries such as Denmark. A major burden of stopping the virus has been passed on to ordinary citizens, who now have to isolate themselves even if they just have the common cold, while the government issues directives but spends as little as possible. This is not surprising. For the past two decades, whenever corporations or significant banks have stumbled, national governments have pumped public money into them, while cutting public services (including health and research) to raise the money. This has happened everywhere. It is happening again.

any days ago, Denmark provided $50-billion to its businesses to cope with the economic downturn caused by the virus crisis. Even before accepting that it was a threat, Trump’s U.S. provided $1.5-trillion to its businesses and financial sectors. After finally declaring a national emergency, Mr. Trump added another $700-billion for American corporations. The U.K., which is still partly in denial, is sanctioning $900-billion for its businesses. As have other nations.

Such buffering of the national economy is necessary. But there are two major problems. Most of this money is not being strictly earmarked to preserve jobs, and the lowest wage earners are particularly ignored. Scandinavian Airlines has already suspended 10,000 jobs. Many other workers have been fired by corporations in different countries. But Bernie Sanders seems to be the only western politician who is insisting that handouts should be tied to preserving jobs for the bottom 95%, not to buffering share values for the top 5%. The other problem is that almost no country has put in comparable amounts into the health, social and educational aspects of combating the pandemic.

Advantage China

There are rumours that the virus scare in China, added to the subterranean racism of the West when anything bad is reported in non-white nations, sent American and European investors on a panicked selling spree. They got rid of their controlling shares in significant Chinese sectors at a pittance, and these were bought up by the Chinese government or Chinese investors. Now, with China seemingly in control of the virus, it might be that it has also regained more control over its own economy and sectors. On the other side, American Congress and Senate representatives sold off their shares, based on confidential briefings, just before the U.S. market fell. Once again, a neoliberal virus: a process that will continue in areas like digitalisation and robotisation, with effects on working rights.

The U.K. was the first country to openly concede that many people will need to die before the virus is controlled. Critics pointed out that, given the lack of sufficient action to control the spread of the virus, what politicians were saying was this: “The virus mostly kills the old, the ill and the undernourished poor, and we do not really care whether such economically unproductive people live or die.” Politicians immediately backtracked and said they were just doing their duty by not lying to the people.

But were they? Or were they being influenced by neoliberal logic: financial value is the only value that matters? The fact that 8,000 children die per day from the virus of hunger, whose vaccine (food) is available, is part of this neoliberal equation. Inevitably, the fight against other deadly diseases will suffer, as we scramble to protect ourselves from the coronavirus.

A lot still needs to be done to combat this pandemic. Xenophobia and nationalism will not help. A lot also needs to be done to prepare for similar pandemics that will undoubtedly occur in the future: just a century back, in 1918, the ‘Spanish flu’ (which started among British or allied soldiers) killed 50 million. But nothing much will be done unless we see this as the first neoliberal virus pandemic in the world, and act accordingly.

405,2020/03/24,Lockdown and beyond: On India's response to coronavirus,"Governments must aid people during this difficult phase and prepare for wider testing

India has responded to the spectre of large-scale transmission of the novel coronavirus and the unprecedented public health catastrophe it may bring by ordering a full national lockdown. The goal is to flatten the transmission curve and help a frayed health system cope with a large number of cases. Physical distancing of people, ensured through a suspension of rail and inter-State bus services, closure of public places, cessation of all non-essential activity and street-level monitoring, is the first order priority during a pandemic and the lockdown can ensure that. The options being used by States to enforce this are Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897 and the Indian Penal Code. What must follow is the galvanising of governmental machinery to address essential requirements. This was certainly not in evidence on Sunday during the janata curfew, which saw near-total compliance, but culminated in noisy public celebrations. It was also marked by a last-minute scramble among migrant labour stuffing themselves into trains to return home ahead of the shutdown. Many hundreds more remained stranded in several cities, crowding termini, as train services were withdrawn. These hapless people, who must largely fend for themselves, have been potentially exposed to the pathogen; some may have unwittingly infected others. The week-long lockdown ahead cannot become a similar exercise in chaos, confusion and misery. As a war-like moment in the country’s history, it calls for massive preparation with all hands on deck to mitigate the impact on people, and to formulate a public health response for the period beyond the shutdown.

Governments have a duty to ensure that the most vulnerable classes, economically and socially, including the elderly, have access to essential articles including medicines, close to where they live. It should not be difficult to provide to them a package of staples to last a week using civil supplies departments, civic workers, and non-governmental organisations. Considering that about 37% of households depend on casual labour as their major source of income for rural and urban India, and nearly 55% have tenuous regular employment, as per Periodic Labour Force Survey data for 2017-18, it is essential for governments to ensure that they get subsistence wages for as long as restrictions last. Some States have already moved in that direction. Funds transfers during the containment phase of the pandemic, followed by a stimulus to sustain employment are necessary. But a bigger challenge stares India in the face: can it get a universally accessible testing system in place to prevent transmission when the lockdown is lifted? China, South Korea and Singapore, as WHO points out, adopted a strict shutdown, but used the breather to get a grip on infections by testing at the population level. This is the hard work that lies ahead, and it will test the mettle of India’s national and State governments.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lockdown-and-beyond-on-indias-response-to-coronavirus/article31145442.ece
406,2020/03/24,The Maoist trap: On killing of security personnel in Sukma,"In difficult terrain, security personnel end up second best despite the training

The attack by Maoist extremists in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district on Saturday, that killed 17 security personnel and injured 15, including two critically, presents a grim picture on how poorly India continues to fare on this front. There was intelligence that Maoists were going to assemble at Elmagunda village, which is dominated by the Peoples’ Liberation Guerrilla Army Battalion 1. Accordingly, security forces, comprising District Reserve Guards, Special Task Force, numbering 500, were dispatched into the forests to deal with the emergent situation. In retrospect, despite the intelligence, they did not encounter even one Maoist and began their journey back, in two groups, to their camps at Chintagufa and Burkapal, not more than six kilometres apart as the crow flies. The smaller contingent, numbering 100, headed to Burkapal, encountered fire six kilometres from the base camp and they duly returned it. The Maoists retreated and fired again and the security forces fired and followed till they had been lured into an open area in hilly terrain where the Maoists, some 350 of them, had the advantage of numbers, line of fire as well as height, a classic ambush. The Maoists then picked off their targets. The other much larger group, not more than three kilometres away, also came under diversionary fire that kept them pinned down.

Also read: A fake encounter in Chhattisgarh

The real story is still to emerge, but it is odd that in the battle that began about noon and lasted five-and-a-half daylight hours, reinforcements could not be sent to hapless personnel. It can be surmised that at the very least those who got ambushed did not know the terrain or the tactics enough, although that should not be the case considering the composition of the DRG. It is yet to be convincingly explained how as many as 400 personnel so near did not rush to aid their uniformed brethren. Was it a leadership or assessment issue? Was there a communication breakdown? Was the initial intelligence properly vetted or was it bait? Was this entire operation properly supervised? It is remarkable, too, that helicopters were able to evacuate the wounded afterwards. So complete was the rout that even though the security forces said they took down some Maoists, there is not much physical evidence to support this claim. It is also significant that as many as 13 of the dead security forces were locals from Sukma district, many of them surrendered Maoists. And unfortunate that many of them bled to death waiting for assistance. There is a lot to answer for but it seems that despite dedicated training the security forces get for just these eventualities, the Maoists are able to improvise and come out on top, smarter, nimbler, and many steps ahead.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-maoist-trap-on-killing-of-security-personnel-in-sukma/article31145444.ece
407,2020/03/24,COVID-19: A mad rush out of Bengaluru just before the 21-day lockdown,"Chief Minister announced that people can travel back to home towns before midnight to celebrate Ugadi

Hours before the 21-day national lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa allowed a final window till midnight for people wishing to travel to their home towns by lifting the ban on inter-district movement that had been enforced since Monday.

This led to a sudden rush, with many people trying to return to their home towns. With buses and other vehicles off the road, people could be seen desperately trying to find means of transportation. This rush threw the idea of social distancing – mandatory to avoid spread of COVID-19 – to the winds.

Surprise move

The announcement by the Chief Minister, soon after inaugurating the war room for COVID-19, came as a a surprise. Earlier in the day. he had told police to strictly enforce a “curfew-like” situation.

Stating that the government will enforce “complete nakabandhi” from Wednesday, he justified the window as “several people who took the highway to their home towns were stuck in traffic jams that led to police being directed to let these vehicles pass”. The measure, the Chief Minister explained in a statement, was taken to enable people to be home to celebrate Ugadi.

Sources in the Chief Minister's office said that the decision was taken as several thousand people were stuck at various toll booths across the State, and that it would have caused other problems. “This was a one-time decision taken to enable people to reach their destinations. They cannot, however, return or take to the road from Wednesday morning when the total shutdown will be in place,” said a source.

CM’s assurance

In a statement after the Prime Minister’s address to the nation, Mr. Yediyurappa said, “I fully assure the people that our government will take care of people during this hour of crisis. At this juncture, I warn hoarders and blackmailers not to exploit the situation and the predicament of the people, particularly the poor.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/sx1hxg/article31156779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGPEOPLELEAVING-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-a-mad-rush-out-of-the-city-just-before-the-21-day-lockdown/article31156781.ece
408,2020/03/24,COVID-19: BBMP budget put off,"According to Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, the budget has to be presented by March-end

The 2020-21 budget of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), which was to be presented later this month, has been put off indefinitely owing to the lockdown announced by the State government until March 31.

L. Srinivas, chairperson of the BBMP’s Standing Committee for Taxation and Finance, confirmed the development and told The Hindu that though the budget is almost ready, the committee had taken a call to put it off until the COVID-19 situation is under control.

The committee has held several consultations with city MLAs, former mayors, senior councillors, senior citizens, non-governmental organisations and media personnel. “We were almost ready with the budget. But given the current situation, public health takes precedence over everything else,” he said.

According to the Karnataka Municipal Corporations Act, 1976, the BBMP budget has to be presented by March. However, there have been instances in the past when the budget has been presented in August.

A senior councillor, who spoke to The Hindu, said that the term of the council will come to an end in a few months.

409,2020/03/24,"Coronavirus | Construction stalled, homebuyers brace for further delay","Real estate sector stares at cost overrun

Thousands of homebuyers, who have been fighting a battle to get possession of houses, are bracing for further delay with the COVID-19 lockdown bringing construction to a standstill.

According to private property consultants, lakhs of units are under construction in major cities, and a delay in delivery is inevitable.

Of over 15.62 lakh units launched between 2013 and 2019 in the top seven cities, Pune has nearly 2.62 lakh units under construction, followed by Bengaluru with 2.02 lakh units and Kolkata with approximately 90,670 units, as per estimates of Anarock Property Consultants. Mumbai Metropolitan Region and the National Capital Region account for 57% of the total units.

Among the three southern cities, Bengaluru has the maximum under construction stock as on 2019-end with nearly 2.02 lakh units compared to Hyderabad and Chennai, they added.

With the lockdown coming into effect in the midst of major festivals such as Ugadi, housing sales are also expected to be hit.

CREDAI chairman Suresh Hari said the present situation was “unexpected and catastrophic”.

“All sectors have taken a beating, particularly real estate. The sector is now bound by timelines due to the introduction of RERA. We are talking to the government to reset our deadlines,” he said.

The sector's other major challenges are fund flow and labour mobilisation. “The existing labour is without work. They are either in labour camps or have gone back to their native places. The government is looking at options to help them. In addition, we are looking at the total cost overrun, particularly when the world economy has taken a big beating. People are not going to be looking at real estate as an investment option as they have to reset their own lives. The government has a lot to do once the health issue is sorted out. Hopefully then, it will be able to look at the economy,” Mr. Hari added.

M.S. Shankar from the Forum for People's Collective Efforts, Karnataka Chapter (formerly Fight for Rera) said as it is homebuyers are going through a tough situation, but this crisis will be adding fuel to the fire.

“Developers and builders are approaching the government for a force majeure, and for relief in delay compensation and project extension. Homebuyers will again suffer. We have appealed to the Centre to defer EMIs for three months to offer some relief for homebuyers,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/gybtd5/article31159229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Construction-stGHN79KJPB3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/construction-stalled-homebuyers-brace-for-further-delay/article31156353.ece
410,2020/03/24,COVID-19: Indira Canteens will be closed,"No free food for the poor to prevent crowding near the canteens

The State government made a U-turn on its decision to provide free food at Indira Canteens. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, on Tuesday, announced that all Indira Canteens will be closed during the lockdown to prevent people from gathering in large numbers. Earlier on March 23, the government had announced that Indira Canteens would provide food free of cost for the benefit of daily wage workers and the poor.

When asked about alternatives, Mr. Yediyurappa said, “The closure of canteens is needed to avoid rush near the canteens as it may lead to problems.”

The decision caught contractors by surprise.

A contractor supplying food to Indira Canteens in the city said, “On Monday, as per the directions of the authorities, we supplied 10% more food when compared to normal days.”

On Monday, the canteens served breakfast, lunch and dinner for free.

At some of the Indira Canteens, including the one in Radhakrishna Temple ward, marshals were seen managing the crowd and forcing people to maintain distance. However, this was not the case in Majestic area.

Mr. Yediyurappa further said the police will take action against those who unnecessarily come out of their houses and ply their vehicles. “The general public should understand the seriousness of the situation. The police will take action against those who unnecessarily come out of the house. This is the last warning to people of the State, especially Bengalureans,” said the CM.

He also appealed to the people to celebrate Ugadi in a simple manner.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ig647c/article31156262.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGINDIRACANTEEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-indira-canteens-will-be-closed/article31156263.ece
411,2020/03/24,COVID-19: Ramanavami concerts put on hold,"According to organisers, artistes too are not committing to programmes

Around this time of the year, Bengaluru is usually gearing up for month-long Ramanavami concerts. But in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many sabhas have either cancelled performances or put them on hold. Ramanavami is on April 2. Nearly 25 organisations hosting as many as 300 concerts ranging from classical music to dance performances had been planned as part of the celebrations.

One of the biggest organisers, the 82-year old Chamarajpet Ramaseva Mandali, which was scheduled to hold its first performance on April 2, has postponed its programme. A revised 31-day programme will be announced in April.

“Pandal work is progressing as our near-70 concerts in the 31-day programme were fixed two months in advance. But if the situation demands that we don’t go ahead, we will follow the rules as human safety is our priority,” said S.N. Varadaraj, general secretary of Chamarajpet Ramaseva Mandali. The mandali’s mammoth pandal, which can hold 4,000 people, is spread 300 feet by 150 feet. It will have an imported sanitiser machine for use after each concert.

Rama Bhaktha Bhajana Sabha, the oldest in the city, has put off Ramanavami celebrations that were scheduled to start on March 25. “Never has it been cancelled in over hundred years. We will have a puja, which will be restricted to our family,” said C.V. Venkatesh of the sabha.

Many organisers said that artiste cancellations have already begun. “As of now, the N.R. Colony Rama Mandira Trust has put off the cultural programme due to the prevailing uncertainty. Many artistes may find it difficult to come to the city due to the precautionary measures that the government has put in place,” said R.K. Padmanabha, senior vocalist who is one of the advisers to the Trust.

The Kaaranji Ramaseva Samithi Trust in Basavanagudi has called off their Ramothsava, and the Shankarapuram Sreerama Seva Mandali too will announce their decision to skip their cultural offerings this year .

Seshadripuram Ramaseva Samithi Trust has decided to postpone its Ramanavami programme that was scheduled for April 2 to 23. “We have informed all the artistes. But as the Ramothsava runs on sponsorship, it would be our duty to hold the same at a later date,” said Ramakrishnan, secretary of the Trust.

Jayaram Seva Mandali in Jayanagar will also take a decision soon “that will not inconvenience the artistes and the public.”

According to organisers, artistes too are not committing to programmes.

“It is as uncertain as it can be. Many State governments have issued advisories asking people not to travel, and a lot of artistes hail from neighbouring States Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala,” said violinist H.K. Venkatram, senior advisor to Vani Kala Kendra in Basaveshwara Nagar. The Kendra has already cancelled the first 15 days of concerts scheduled to begin on March 25. “It’s not just the concerts that have taken a back seat, most sabhas carrying on with just their puja too have done away with Kosambri and Panaka, given the fact that distribution is out of the question,” said Mr. Venkatram.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/sc35et/article31159238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGRAMOTSAVAPANDAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-ramanavami-concerts-put-on-hold/article31156205.ece

Employees working in crucial departments at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) had a tough time reaching their workplace on Tuesday as residents of villages near the airport blocked the buses and private vehicles that they were travelling in. People affected included those working in air traffic control, immigration, and technology support. According to officials, their vehicles were blocked on Ballari Road that connects the airport.

After this development, BIAL managing director and CEO Hari Marar requested the villagers as well as the community around the airport to work with law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety of employees.

“BIAL has taken every preventive measure to contain the spread of the virus, including regular screening of all the staff both before and after their shift, the provision of safety equipment like face masks, gloves and access to hand sanitiser. We are working closely with the health department and Airport Health Organisation, and have done everything in our capacity to safeguard our surroundings,” said Mr. Marar in his appeal.

As per government orders, KIA will remain closed from 11.59 p.m. on March 24 till March 31. There is no clarity yet on whether this lockdown on air traffic will extend for 21 days following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement on Tuesday.

The pandemic has had an impact on ongoing construction work at KIA, which was halted on March 23. This includes upgrading road infrastructure and construction of terminal 2.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/villagers-stop-staff-heading-to-kia/article31156152.ece
413,2020/03/24,BBMP Bill referred to joint panel of legislature,"Bill aims at comprehensive changes in administration and governance of the BBMP, which functions under the KMC Act, 1976

Following strong opposition from members of the ruling BJP, the State government on Tuesday referred the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Bill 2020, which will enable the civic body to come out of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation Act, 1976, to the Joint Select Committee comprising members of both houses of the State legislature.

The Bill is aimed at comprehensive changes in the administration and governance of the BBMP, which functions under the KMC Act, 1976.

Revenue Minister R. Ashok explained that the BBMP elections and functions have been largely governed by the KMC Act of 1976, which was enacted more than four decades ago. The new bill is aimed at mobilising more taxes, changes in the functioning of the civic body since it covers an area of 714 sq.km.

The Bill, the Minister said, is aimed at dislodging the garbage lobby and bringing better coordination among various civic authorities, such as BDA, BWSSB, BESCOM, and the BBMP.

The Bill says that the KMC Act is inadequate in administrative and structural matters to govern Bengaluru as it provides limited flexibility and was a common legislation catering to nine smaller city corporations in the State.

The Bill states “that there is urgent need to formulate an independent legislation for the working of BBMP for the purposes of improving decentralisation, integration of public participation at various levels of municipal governance and ensuring efficient decision-making by the municipal authorities”.

Senior member Aravind Limbavali strongly objected to discussion of the Bill on the last day of the session in the absence of the Opposition Congress and JD(S) members. More than 170 rules have been framed in the new Bill, which necessitate a detailed discussion and consultation with city organisations and members of the opposition. He asked the government and the Speaker to refer the Bill to the Joint Select Committee of the legislature.

Satish Reddy, Uday B. Garudachar, L.A. Ravi Subramanya and K. Poornima (all BJP), Sharat Bachhe Gowda (independent), R. Manjunath (JD-S) opposed the passage of the Bill in a hurry. They asked the Speaker to refer the Bill to the committee.

They argued that a detailed debate was necessary to bring Electronics City under the jurisdiction of the BBMP and increase tax collection. As of now, Electronics City, which is contributing a huge amount of revenue to the State exchequer, is under panchayat limits, they said.

Mr. Ashok and Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy then asked the Speaker to refer the Bill to the Joint Select Committee of the legislature.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bbmp-bill-referred-to-joint-panel-of-legislature/article31155889.ece
414,2020/03/24,"Classes go online to tide over closure of schools, coaching classes","Students can login through their mobile phones

Although schools and coaching classes have been shut, students, particularly those who are preparing for competitive examinations, continue to have a gruelling schedule through the day as many of their classes are being conducted online.

While some have audio classes, many coaching centres are offering video classes as well. This is to ensure that both teachers and students are able to continue their academics from the comfort of their homes in view of the lockdown to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.

Modali Venkat Hari Kishan, Head Media PR South, ALLEN Career Institute Bengaluru, said that there are around 12,000 students in Bengaluru for various classes, including competitive examinations. “All the classes were cancelled a week ago. We are developing videos and sending them on our app. It is currently a one-way communication, but the students can ask questions on WhatsApp,” he said. He said that the students are also made to take test and assignments through the app.

Aakash Chaudhry, director and CEO of Aakash Educational Services Limited (AESL), said that they have started online classes through their subsidiary Meritnation to mitigate the impact that closure of schools and institutes may have on students’ learning process.

Pavan Chauhan, founder and CEO of Meritnation, said, “Our sessions will be interactive allowing students to clear doubts, ask questions, and address their queries and anxieties. We hope that students and educators will take advantage of our initiative.”

Sushmita S., a second pre-university student, said after their examination, they will have to prepare for the competitive examinations and will be solely dependent on these online classes.

Many colleges and international schools too are livestreaming their classes.

“PESU Live” is an initiative of PES University. Classes are being conducted for all students pursuing undergraduate and post-graduate courses. The respective subject teachers will come to college and conduct classes, which are live-streamed to students.

In case students have any doubts in the subject or the lesson, they can ask questions on live chat to which teachers will respond immediately. To address any kind of technical issues during live classes, the university has set up a command room.

J. Surya Prakash, vice chancellor of the university, said that each class is of 40 minutes. Students can login through their mobile phones. “Examinations will begin in May. We need to complete portions by April. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct online classes,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/pyb5i0/article31179213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGONLINECLASSES1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/classes-go-online-to-tide-over-closure-of-schools-coaching-classes/article31155774.ece
415,2020/03/24,School admission process for next academic year put off,"Department of Public Instruction warns schools of strict action if order is ignored

Private unaided schools across the State have been instructed not to carry out the admission process for the next academic year until the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) issues further orders. This order has been issued as a precautionary measure against the transmission of COVID-19, said officials. It applies to government and aided schools as well.

The DPI has warned of strict action against school managements that ignore the order.

Many parents had complained that private unaided schools were conducting the admission process. Some schools had also reportedly set March 31 as the deadline for payment of fees to confirm enrolment. They alleged that while some schools are demanding that payments be made online, others are insisting the fees be paid in person.

“When everything is shut, how can schools expect us to withdraw money and pay the fees? Our priority now is just limited to managing our day-to-day expenditure,” said Mahima Rao, whose daughter is set to move to Class I in the 2020-21 academic year.

If schools are found functioning, the department will file a case under the Epidemic Diseases Act. Local-level officials have been asked to send the circular to school managements through WhatsApp and email.

In the circular, the department state: “To avoid the spread of COVID-19, the department has postponed the entire process for admission under the RTE Act, and a fresh timetable for admissions will be issued after March 31.”

Some school managements in the city claim to have completed the admission process for the 2020-21 academic year in December 2019.

416,2020/03/24,Police use lathis to disperse crowds at markets,"Claim many grocery shops had set up eateries to make a quick buck, which attracted customers

The police on Tuesday cracked the whip on citizens who had ignored the government order on the lockdown. However, in several cases, people who had stepped out of their homes to pick up essential items and groceries were also pulled up.

As people gathered at K.R. Market, the police resorted to caning to disperse the crowd. This happened at several places across the city, even outside grocery stores.

“Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao had exempted essential services, like grocery shops and vegetable markets, from the lockdown. However, people were using this as an excuse to gather outside markets and shops, which defeated the very purpose of lockdown. Hence, we resorted to caning,” said a police officer.

Many grocery shops had allegedly set up eateries to make a quick buck and were forced to shut down. “Many people who are part of essential services are found misusing the exemption and moving around freely,” said another police officer, defending the decision to cane people.

Over 15,000 policemen along with 50 battalions of reserve police force have been deployed for patrolling duty, and to guard the entry and exit point of the city.

“The guidelines for the lockdown are clear. If people are performing essential duties as per the order, then they need travel with proper ID proof with a company vehicle and logo along with the ID card,” said Mr. Rao.

In their diligence to enforce the lockdown, the police stopped a vehicle that MLC C.M. Lingappa was travelling in on Mysuru Road. According to sources, the officers on duty asked him for identification. When Mr. Lingappa reportedly informed them that he was heading for the legislature session, the police asked him, “Which council?”

In the afternoon, police personnel carrying food packets in vehicles for their colleagues on duty were seen feeding homeless people on pavements. “This is part of the job to ensure that everyone is safe and sound,” a police officer said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/police-use-lathis-to-disperse-crowds-at-markets/article31155589.ece
417,2020/03/24,Scramble for groceries as supermarkets close and police crack down on vegetable vendors,"Some shops and supermarkets claimed to have run out of stock

Despite the government’s assurances that essential goods and grocery items would be available, several supermarkets were closed. In many instances, the police were allegedly instructing roadside vegetable vendors to pack up and leave.

In Basaveshwara Nagar, even essential items like vegetables and milk were not available. Many of the vendors The Hindu spoke to said that they were being forced to close their businesses.

“The police came in the morning and told us nothing should be open. If I don't sell this today, I will not have enough money to buy food for tomorrow,” said a vegetable vendor.

The normally busy Hutchens Cross in Fraser Town was silent on Tuesday morning with only a few motorists and pedestrians on the road. The silence was broken by the sudden wail of a siren after which people could be seen running shouting, “The police are coming”.

Four policemen on two motorcycles were patrolling the road; but they did not shut down the few grocery stores that were open.

They used a loudspeaker to tell people not to gather at supermarkets and chased people who were simply idling away their time on the roadside. They stopped pedestrians who weren’t wearing masks and asked them to cover their face.

While almost all the grocery stores had kept hand sanitizers, smaller stores had set up counters at the entrance and fresh stock outside on the pavement. This led to people crowding at entrances. The moment the police left the area, shoppers returned.

Bread, eggs and milk were selling out quickly though retailers were doing their best to prevent people from buying in bulk. Fresh fruits and vegetables were available in all stores but there was no supply of pulses.

Though there was no restriction on the functioning of supermarkets, several had downed their shutters. A few that were open in Vidyaranyapura Main Road claimed to have run out of staples, such as pulses, cereals, ready-to-eat and packaged food, and even biscuits.

“We were supposed to receive stock today. But with the prohibitory orders in place, we don’t know if the supply will return to normal or when we will receive stock,” said a manager of a supermarket on Tuesday.

Anticipating such a situation, citizens seemed to have stocked up on not just essentials, but also items needed for the Ugadi festival.

A resident of Chandra Layout, Vijayanagar, said that his family had decided to stock up for the festival. “Just as well, as even the shops that were open this morning were asked to be closed by the local police,” the resident said.

Two retailers claimed that there was no supply in godowns, but wholesalers at an APMC yard said otherwise.

“There's enough stock of all pulses in the APMC yard for at least 10 days. Around 200 lorries were loaded on Tuesday morning at Yeshwantpur. There's panic buying at retail stores. At the same time, police are stopping vehicles disrupting the wholesale-retail supply chain,” said one wholesaler.

‘Movement of fresh fruits and vegetables has been hit’

The movement of essential commodities such as fresh fruits and vegetables by organised supply chains has been hit due to lack of clarity among officials manning the borders in the five south Indian States as part of the lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19, according to a fresh produce supply chain firm.

Lawrencedale Agro Processing India (LEAF), one of the prominent fresh produce supply chain firms that has been working across southern States with the involvement of small and marginal farmers under the Integrated Horticultural Development Scheme, has maintained that the present lockdown imposed by various State governments is to restrict movement of people.

The government notifications clearly mention that movement of essential commodities, including fresh fruits and vegetables, should not be hampered. But, the authorities at the Check Posts at the five Southern States are imposing restrictions.

Entry and exit points to the city will be closed effective Monday night till March 31 as the city police will enforce prohibitory orders under Section 144.

As part of a complete lockdown, City Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao has ordered shutting down 12 entry and exit points around the city. Public gathering of five or more persons has been prohibited and strict action under various provisions will be invoked against anyone defying the order, he said.

No vehicles will be allowed to enter or exit the city. Except goods vehicles carrying essential goods, no other vehicles will be allowed to ply, officials said, adding that this is applicable to KSRTC and BMTC buses, private carriers, cabs and autorickshaws.

All flyovers in and around the city will be shut down and the jurisdictional police have been asked to barricade the entry and exit points to manage the traffic. Police staff have been provided with transportation.

Mr. Rao reiterated that no paying guests facilities should shut down and the management has to arrange food for the inmates.

The prohibitory orders will mean that barring essential services, businesses, private transport and commercial establishments will have to remain closed. Police will initiate strict action if people step out unnecessarily, Mr. Rao said.

The decision was taken after the situation on Sunday evening when a large number of people were found moving around in the city soon after the Janata curfew came to an end.

“We are going to enforce strict action against people who come out on streets unnecessarily. We have provision under IPC section 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) sections and also KP Act 30 (L) and government also brought epidemic act to initiate action against them.

422,2020/03/24,‘Curfew-like’ restrictions enforced across State,"All activities barring essential services prohibited

Scaling up the precautionary measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the Karnataka government on Monday enforced “curfew-like” restrictions across the State from Tuesday and will be in force till March 31.

All public and private transport including Uber, Ola and autos will be off the road, while only essential services will be available across the State.

The government, which had initially announced restrictions only in nine districts that had reported COVID-19 cases, later revised the order to cover the entire State. The government has enforced this under Epidemic Disease Act, 1981, making more stringent the guidelines put in place earlier.

Late on Monday night, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa tweeted: “After assessing the situation of #covid_19, we have decided to lockdown not just 9 districts but the whole State of Karnataka starting tomorrow till March 31st. I request all citizens to cooperate and please stay indoors.”

Earlier in the day, Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar had expressed concern that despite declaration of lockdown, people were not completely confining themselves indoors. This would increase the chances of the spread of the virus, he observed, while pointing out that so far the State had reported 33 positive cases of COVID-19. Only services and activities related to health, medicine, agriculture, and grocery would be allowed to operate in these districts, the Minister said. Similarly, industries would be asked to ensure that only 50% of their workforce were deployed for work. Government and private offices would be classified as “essential” and “non-essential” services depending upon the nature of operation and only those in the essential sector would be allowed to operate, the Minister said.

Tests

The government had decided to strictly quarantine and test all those who had come in contact with the COVID-19 patients. It had been decided to test at least 200 people for a population of 10 lakh, he said. To facilitate this, licences would be granted to more number of government and private labs, he said.

While a testing lab was already set up in Kalaburagi, a similar facility was about to commence in Ballari, Belagavi, Mangaluru, and Hubballi and at NIMHANS in Bengaluru, he said.

The government would obtain the services of police in keeping a vigil on the C-category international travellers who have been home quarantined. The family members of such persons would also be quarantined and the police would be instructed to paste notices on their houses and also inform locals about it, he said.

A vigilance team comprising senior IAS officers had been formed to monitor the situation, he said.

The Minister was responding to various demands made by All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) and also concerns raised by industry bodies including CII, Kassia, FKCCI and PIA, on behalf of employees and employers, respectively.

“The government can’t keep everyone fully happy. Everyone has to work united and in tandem. May be corporates should see if some of their CSR funds could be used to pay wages on productivity days,” he said.

AITUC has submitted a memorandum to the Minister listing out demands on behalf of over 8 million people employed at malls, pubs, cinema-halls in the city. Most of these employees are paid a minimum wage of ₹12,000 a month. Any long-term disruption of work will impact the financial health of these workers and their families.

Therefore, AITUC demands that the State government should mandate the payment of full wages in the wake of the shutdown of services in order to ensure that the workers are protected, as per the memorandum.

AITUC has also demanded that the government should ask factories to shut down and pay all their employees wages during the lockout period.

“The Labour Minster was non-committal to our demands. But responsible employers have declared leave with wages for all categories of workmen until March 31,” said D.A.

425,2020/03/24,Rush to leave city amidst lockdown,"While some wanted to go to their native places, others were headed home for Ugadi

Packed private buses and long queues at toll booths were common sights on Monday as hundreds of people made desperate attempts to leave the city. This, even as the government, after efforts to urge citizens to practise social distancing and not venture out, finally announced a complete lockdown of the State by evening.

On Tumakuru Road, people were seen leaving the city by sitting on top of private buses, more than three people on a bike, and some even taking other private vehicles passing by to leave the city. This led to traffic pile-up between Gorguntepalya and the toll gate. “I saw people travelling on top of the bus risking their lives. Though the police were around, no one was stopped the bus. Even on the flyover, traffic piled up,” said Krishna P., who passed Jalahalli on his way to M.G. Road.

While many wanted to leave for their native places as a lockdown had been announced for several districts, including Bengaluru, others were headed to their native places to celebrate Ugadi. Even at Sadahalli Gate, there was a large number of vehicles moving out. A toll executive at Sadahalli toll gate said: “After the outbreak of COVID-19, the number of vehicles passing through the toll gate had reduced. However, on Monday, the number increased considerably. People may be going to celebrate Ugadi or to be with their family during the lockdown,” he said.

As the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) had stopped operating inter-state and intra-state bus services and the South Western Railways had stopped train services to curb the spread of the virus, hundreds of people used private vehicles to leave.

At Bagepalli, the police did not allow private and other vehicles from Karnataka to enter Andhra Pradesh. Videos of the A.P. police restricting entry of vehicles were doing the rounds on social media.

In Tumakuru though, people said many had returned from cities such as Bengaluru out of fear. Software engineer Navyashree T.R. said: “We came in our car to Tavarekere (Sira taluk) from Bengaluru last Friday to celebrate Ugadi with the family. Our company has asked us to work from home. We have decided to stay in our village till March 31.”

426,2020/03/24,Private bus operators take passengers for a ride,"Passengers to Ballari, Chitradurga had to pay more than ₹1,000

With trains and State-run bus services suspended, passengers, left to the mercy of private bus operators, had to cough up huge amounts to get to their destinations on Monday.

Some of these passengers had come to Majestic bus stand in the hope that the KSRTC services would resume after the Janata Curfew on Sunday. Since the services didn’t resume, some bus operators functioned from Dhanvatari Road located near KSRTC and BMTC bus stand.

Passengers heading to Ballari and Chitradurga had to pay more than ₹1,000 per person. The bus operators also risked the lives of passengers without taking precautionary measures to contain COVID-19.

Only a few passengers were seen wearing masks and some buses where plying packed with passengers. Images of buses carrying passengers on the roof were widely circulated. As media started reporting this, Deputy Chief Minister and Transport Minister Laxman Savadi warned private operators of action.

Transport Commissioner N. Shivkumar said at six locations, check posts have been established to monitor the movement of the vehicles and private buses. Some of the places where the check posts have come up are Kunigal Road, Dobbaspet, Attibele and Dodballapura Road.

The transport department officials also seized some private buses that operated on Monday. An RTO official said, “We seized two buses that were illegally plying on Monday afternoon. Buses were seized after dropping passengers at K.R. Puram bus station.”

Passengers also complained about autorickshaw drivers demanding hefty fares in the wake of the curtailed BMTC bus services.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/private-bus-operators-take-passengers-for-a-ride/article31146401.ece
427,2020/03/24,COVID-19 waters down Ugadi celebrations,"Sale of fruits and flowers affected by restrictions

Ahead of Ugadi, the city usually wears a festive look with raw mangoes, neem leaves, strings of mango leaves, jaggery and other typical essentials filling the markets and people thronging to them. But the outbreak of COVID - 19 has cast a shadow on the festivities this time.

With an atmosphere of fear around the pandemic, the subsequent lockdown, and the prohibitory orders imposed till the end of this month, Ugadi, which will be celebrated on Wednesday, is expected to be watered down this year.

Fruits and flowers merchants and growers are the worst hit. G.M. Diwakar, president, K.R. Market Flower Merchants’ Association, said that markets across the city were reeling under huge losses owing to COVID-19.

“Kanakambara and mallige which usually costs around ₹400 to ₹450 per kg during Ugadi is now being sold for ₹120 to ₹150. If not for the festival season, they would cost around ₹200,” he said.

Mr. Diwakar added that walk-in customers have rarely been found for a week now. “There has a been a dip in regular customers who buy for business as well. Even that business has been hit by at least 50%,” he said.

As the government has ordered temples to ensure minimum crowds, the festival celebrations will be restricted to traditions and rituals within the temples.

Owing to this, the flower business catering to temples has also been hit, he said.

To welcome the new year, people in the city order sweets, especially holige, from caterers and restaurants specialising in the delicacy.

However, this year, all the orders have been cancelled. Shivaram D., a city-based caterer, said that they started cancelling orders from the last week itself owing to various reasons.

“There is a shortage of staff and commodities and restrictions on travelling. Also, apart from us cancelling orders, even orders have drastically dipped,” he said, adding that people just want to stay at home safely and cook whatever they can.

Apart from the lull in vegetable and fruit markets, handloom and silk sales that mark the festival are also conspicuous by their absence owing to the prevailing restrictions.

Dip in business

Prakash Prigal, president of The Bangalore Wholesale Cloth Merchants’ Association, said that there was around a 70% dip in business owing to COVID-19.

“During the festival season, wholesale clothes from the city have a great demand in south India. Our silk market also has a demand across the city. But the demand has come down. We have postponed all current orders and there has also been a drastic dip in both orders and sales from the second week of March,” he said.

Sajjan Raj Mehta, former president, Karnataka Hosiery And Garments’ Association, said that as Ugadi was the beginning of the new year and it fell at the beginning of the summer vacations, the festival atmosphere would usually start at least a week ahead of the festival. “However, this year, due to self imposed restrictions and directions by the government, the business has hit a kind of an all-time low,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/uhns7q/article31146375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGUGADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-waters-down-ugadi-celebrations/article31146376.ece
428,2020/03/24,Indira Canteens to serve food for free to daily wage labourers from today,"Caterers running canteens directed to provide soaps and sanitisers

In the wake of the complete lockdown of districts affected by COVID-19, the State government, on Monday, decided to provide free food at Indira Canteens from Tuesday to those who are dependent on daily wages for their livelihood.

Free breakfast will be provided from 7.30 a.m. to 10 a.m.; lunch from 12.30 p.m. to 3 p.m., and dinner from 7.30 a.m. to 9 p.m. on all days. The menu at the canteens will remain the same. Currently, Indira Canteens are providing breakfast at ₹5 and lunch and dinner at ₹10.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has directed the caterers running Indira Canteens to also provide soaps and sanitisers at the canteens.

It has also asked them to ensure that people keep at least 1-metre distance while collecting coupons and that canteen staff wear gloves and masks. The food will also be tested by the Health Department officials.

Venkatesh S., Special Commissioner (finance), BBMP, and in charge of Indira Canteens, said that at the beginning there will be 10% more indent on the number of plates. “Within one or two days, we will get a picture of how many plates are used and how many people visit each canteens on an average,” he said, adding that there will be revised indents on a day-to-day, time-to-time basis, depending on the response.

He also said that they were expecting at least 30% increase in footfall over the next few days.

Mr. Venkatesh pointed out that after the COVID-19 related restrictions, the civic body had witnessed reduction in the number of footfall in certain areas and increase in certain areas. “For example, the Indira Canteen at Majestic had seen a 15 to 20% dip as it is dependent on the floating population. In some residential areas there was an increase by 15 to 20% in the footfall,” he said.

Speaking to The Hindu, an administrative officer of Rewards, one of the two contractors serving Indira Canteen, said that they had all the infrastructure and resources to feed the urban poor. “It will take a day or two to get to know the pattern of consumption. Once we get a clear picture, it will become easy for us serve food, without wastage,” the office-bearer said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/a5bpia/article31146353.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGINDIRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/indira-canteens-to-serve-food-for-free-to-daily-wage-labourers-from-today/article31146355.ece

According to an interim report by a few unions and organisations, the income levels of daily and weekly wage workers has fallen by 50 to 70% from the pre-COVID-19 time.

The All-India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU), the Karnataka Domestic Workers’ Union, The Garment and Textile Workers’ Union (GATWU), with a few organisations, have prepared an interim report on the health awareness, livelihood security and food security among workers in the city.

According to the report, based on a detailed interview of more than 60 daily wage workers across the city, there was “a pressing need” for dissemination of information regarding prevention and spread of COVID-19 among workers and shutdowns have “affected their ability to survive”.

The report also states that thought there was fear about contracting the virus while at work or during travel to work, most of them were forced to work owing to the fear of losing income and jobs.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ee6mrs/article31146343.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGWAGERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/income-levels-of-daily-wagers-down-by-50-70/article31146344.ece

432,2020/03/24,Airline staff allege harassment by landlords,"Amidst misinformation and misconceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been complaints about alleged harassment of several airline crew members by landlords, and even the local police and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) personnel.

According to a senior crew member of an airline, the police and BBMP personnel have visited the homes of several crew members living in the city. He alleged that this, in some instances, has been at the behest of landlords/house owners/society members.

“Without verifying if the crew members have indeed travelled abroad or if they have been in contact with anyone who has been tested positive, the personnel have just stamped the hands of these crew members and their families,” he claimed. Once stamped, the person will have to be under home quarantine for at least 14 days.

Vacate homes

The crew member also alleged that three of his colleagues were asked to vacate their homes immediately. “While some have taken leave to go back to their hometowns, others are sharing accommodation with their colleagues,” he claimed.

Several airlines have responded to this alleged harassment of their crew members. In a press release, Air India has reiterated that it has taken adequate precautions and followed all safety measures prescribed to provide protection to its crew members.

Guidelines followed

Similarly, IndiGo, in a statement, claimed to have provided precaution to ensure its crew is protected from infection while discharging their duties. They claimed that all advisories and guidelines issued by the Union government were being followed. They have also appealed to all, especially the law enforcement agencies, to ensure that the crew are treated with courtesy and respect.

Meanwhile, the BBMP and police personnel said they have completed stamping of 10,000 passengers under home quarantine by deploying 600 teams in two days. On Tuesday, 500 teams will stamp another 10,000.

Responding to the allegations, senior police officials said the special teams were visiting people based on the information provided by the government. BBMP officials too stated that allegations of forced stamping were unsubstantiated, and claimed that they had not received such complaints.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/airline-staff-allege-harassment-by-landlords/article31146303.ece
433,2020/03/24,Equipping Victoria Hospital for COVID-19 fight a challenge,"‘It may not be possible to disturb Vani Vilas and Burns Ward’

The State government’s decision to convert Victoria Hospital complex into a dedicated COVID-19 facility is turning out to be a logistical challenge for the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI). All the hospitals located on Victoria Hospital premises are affiliated to BMCRI.

Victoria Hospital, which is a referral tertiary public healthcare facility, houses the Emergency and Trauma Care Centre, PMSSY Superspeciality Hospital, Institute of Nephro Urology, Minto Ophthalmic Hospital, and Vani Vilas Hospital. The 50-bed Mahabodhi Burns Ward, which is the only such facility in the State, is also located on this campus.

While the government intends to utilise all the beds (nearly 1,200) in these facilities for COVID patients, sources in the hospital said it may not be possible to disturb the functioning of Vani Vilas and Burns Ward as there is no alternative facility for poor patients. While nearly 250 deliveries, including high risk pregnancies, are attended to at Vani Vilas, the Burns Ward also has the State’s only skin bank.

That apart, the Institute of Nephro-Urology caters to renal immuno-compromised patients, who are most vulnerable and catch infections.

With nearly 150 patients availing free dialysis here, it will be difficult to relocate them to other hospitals immediately. “The functioning of this institute may also not be disturbed for the time being. However, if the need arises, we will have to shift them to other facilities,” said a senior official in the Medical Education Department.

Meanwhile, some BMCRI doctors are apprehensive that the decision may affect the in-patients badly.

“We have 117 in-patients and 31 critical cases in the ICU. Where do we shift them if our hospital is converted into a COVID-19 facility?” asked a senior doctor from Emergency and Trauma Care Centre.

All put together, the hospital has nearly 100 ventilators and around 80 anaesthetists and intensivists. “Will this be adequate to handle an influx of patients, if the hospital becomes a dedicated facility?” asked another doctor.

Sources also said the number of beds will be lesser than what the Chief Minister announced. “The beds will have to spaced adequately in COVID-19 wards. There will have to be a gap of six metres between each bed and this will reduce the actual bed capacity. It may take at least four-five days for all the logistical issues to be sorted out before COVID-19 admission begins here,” sources said.

However, P.G. Girish, Director of Medical Education, who is also the Special Officer in charge of PMSSY Hospital, said the load on these hospitals is being gradually reduced.

“We have stopped all planned surgeries and are only seeing emergency out patients, emergency admission and emergency Operation Theatre cases. The load will be reduced gradually and COVID-19 wards will be readied,” he said.

On the inadequate number of ventilators and specialists to handle the rush, if the need arises, he said specialists including anaesthetists and intensivists will be re-deployed from other hospitals to Victoria.

C.N. Manjunath, Director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Chest Diseases, who is a member of the State COVID-19 taskforce, said the government was aware of the issues. “All cardiac patients will be shifted to Jayadeva Hospital and neuro and stroke patients will be shifted to NIMHANS. Logistical issues will be sorted out soon. The government will procure 1,000 ventilators. A dedicated facility under one roof will help,” he added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/wk93gk/article31146292.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGVICTORIAHOSPITALPREMISES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/equipping-victoria-hospital-for-covid-19-fight-a-challenge/article31146293.ece
434,2020/03/24,Shops forced to close on first day of lockdown,"Around 10.30 a.m., several people were found standing on the pavement of the usually bustling 8th Cross in Malleswaram.

Most of them were employees of various apparel, hosiery and jewellery shops that dot the area. It was just a few minutes after the local police came around asking all the shops to down their shutters. Across the city, similar scenes played out as the police were seen asking many shops that had opened on Monday to close. As per government direction, only provision/ grocery shops, medical shops and pharmacies, milk booths can function.

Early in the day, many shops and commercial establishments had opened defying the government directions. Lokesh Gowda, who has an automobile spare parts shop in Kempegowda Nagar in Dasarahalli, said he came back from his village in Tumakuru early on Monday and opened his shop.

“Several other shops in the area were also open. The police came around 11 a.m. and forced us to down the shutters,” he said.

Employees of several commercial establishments in the busy Gandhinagar, B.V.K. Iyengar Road and surrounding areas were also found standing near the closed shops, wondering what to do next. “After the Janata Curfew, we assumed that it will be a normal working day and reported for work. With the police and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials closing down all shops, we may just have to go back home,” said one of them.

However, in many areas, bakeries that sell tea and cigarettes were found open. On Ring Road, near Jalahalli, a bakery with two shutters, had closed one shutter facing the main road, while the other one towards an inner lane was open. People were seen gathering around, drinking tea and smoking.

Meanwhile, Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) buses were plying. Many buses were packed, what with BMTC operating only 50% of its fleet.

435,2020/03/24,Police inspector shoots suspect in the knee for alleged assault,"The suspect is undergoing treatment at Government Stanley Hospital and is said to be out of danger

A police inspector fired in the knee of a suspect held for an attempt to murder, after the suspect allegedly assaulted a policeman who had gone to arrest him in the Mappedu police station limits in Tiruvallur district early on Tuesday. The suspect is recuperating at the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital.

According to police, a man called Babu runs a fast food joint in Tiruvallur district. Two days ago, another man, Aakash and his friends went to have food there and in an argument that ensued, Aakash assaulted Babu and fled. Based on a complaint, the Tiruvallur town police registered a case and started investigation.

The police nabbed three persons who were involved in the assault and from them, got the address of Aakash. “Around 5 a.m., police inspector Ravikumar and driver Kalaivanan went to arrest Aakash from Mettu Kandigai in Mappedu police station limits. Upon seeing the police, he started attacking Kalaivanan with a log. Suddenly, probably to rescue the driver and prevent Aakash from escaping, the inspector shot the suspect in the knee using a 9 mm pistol,” said a police source.

The bullet hit Aakash’s right knee and he collapsed in pain. The police took him to the Tiruvallur government hospital and from there he was taken to Government Stanley Hospital. He is said to be out of danger. A senior police officer claimed that the accused was shot as he tried to escape after assaulting the driver.

436,2020/03/24,COVID-19: Barely any public transport available for Chennai commuters on Monday,"Bus services were severely curtailed in some localities including Sithalapakkam, Kovilancheri, Mambakkam and West Velachery

Commuters dependent on public transport buses had a taste of the lockdown that is due to begin on Tuesday evening, on Tuesday morning itself, as limited bus services were operated. Though the lockdown is to fully come into effect only from 6 p.m. onwards, commuters, particularly those in the southern and western suburbs, faced severe hardships because of limited services. On some routes, buses were not operated at all.

Bus services were severely curtailed in some localities, which are already poorly connected, such as Sithalapakkam, Kovilancheri, Mambakkam, West Velachery, Pattabhiram, Valasaravakkam, and Mogappair.

T. Kumar, a resident of Sithalapakkam, said he found it difficult to reach Medavakkam as there were no MTC buses and finally had to pay double the cost by travelling in a share autorickshaw.

A senior official of MTC, denying that bus services were not adequate, said buses were operated normally except that buses started in a delayed manner. As most of the drivers and conductors do not have personal transport, the buses were started late, he said.

The official said that despite more than 1,000 buses operating on the roads, most buses had very few commuters.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hs3msy/article31151957.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MARTH--BUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/covid-19-barely-any-public-transport-available-for-chennai-commuters-on-monday/article31151958.ece
437,2020/03/24,Commuters run to Koyambedu bus terminus to escape lockdown,"Minister assures that more buses will be operated till 6 p.m. today

As the State government prepares for a lockdown from Tuesday evening, thousands of people are rushing to the Dr. MGR bus terminus in Koyambedu to return to their native places.

With the train services fully cancelled from Sunday and not to resume till March 31, the only silver lining for the commuters was the bus transport which would also be stopped from Tuesday evening.

As a result the Koyambedu bus terminus is crowded with anxious commuters wanting to reach their hometown within the State. The sudden surge in commuter population is causing difficulties for the transport department authorities to operate long distance buses in a short span of time.

S. Janani, who stays in a women’s hostel, found it difficult to catch a direct bus to reach her native place in Pudukottai. She said it took more than an hour for her to board a bus at the Koyambedu bus terminus. She also rued that the private buses were charging exorbitant fares.

However, Transport Minister M.R. Vijayabhaskar, in a recorded message, said that adequate arrangements are being made to operate long distance buses to various parts of the State. To compensate for shortage of long distance buses, which were operated minimally on Monday, the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) buses were operated to several destinations including Villupuram, Tindivanam and Tiruchi. More than 100 buses have already been operated for transporting the commuters, he said.

Requesting the commuters not to panic by rushing to the Koyambedu bus terminus, the Transport Minister assured the public that more buses would be operated on Tuesday till 6 p.m.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/esoa1l/article31148169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THPTIKOYAMBEDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/commuters-run-to-koyambedu-bus-terminus-to-escape-lockdown/article31148170.ece
438,2020/03/24,People in home quarantine to be identified,"Corpn. to paste stickers bearing crucial details on doors

The Chennai Corporation has started pasting stickers on the doors of people who have been asked to remain in strict home quarantine. Local Administration Minister Velumani also tweeted a picture of the sticker, which contains the name and address of those who were asked to be under quarantine, and the period for which they will have to be home-bound.

“We have issued strict instructions not to stigmatise anyone. With an increasing number of cases, we have to do this to prevent the progress towards community spread,” Health Secretary Beela Rajesh explained.

“We are also monitoring 3,000 houses where persons have been home quarantined. Officials will identify the houses using coloured stickers. It is not to stigmatise or discriminate against such residents. It is to help them,” Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash added.

Starting Tuesday, Chennai Corporation will carry out disinfection of all streets in the city, to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Mr. Prakash held a meeting with private tanker operators to deploy 500 tanker lorries to disinfect all the 33,000 streets and 471 bus route roads. On the mass disinfection drive, Mr. Prakash said, “The officials will start the drive on Tuesday, covering all streets in the city. This will be the largest drive to disinfect the entire city.”

On Tuesday, 500 vehicles will start from all the 15 zonal offices in the city, cleaning footpaths, bus shelters, railings, bollards and street furniture along the roads. Some of the private tanker lorry owners have been reluctant to send their vehicles, owing to the delayed payment of the bills during earlier occasions.

Corporation officials have assured them that the payment will be made promptly as the government order to use such services has been issued. The civic body is expected to spend ₹150 crore for prevention of COVID-19.

The civic officials have been instructed to mix 300 kg of bleaching powder with 10,000 litres of water in each tanker lorry to carry out disinfection operations across the city.

Essential commodities

The Corporation Commissioner also met with NGOs who will start supplying essential commodities to city residents who are living in the low income neighbourhoods and slums.

“Over 35% of the city residents are residing in low income neighbourhoods. They will get essential commodities including rice, dal, cooking oil and soap for 15 days with support from NGOs. The NGOs who want to supply commodities have been asked to contact the officials at the control room in Ripon Buildings,” said Mr. Prakash.

Many NGOs were found visiting Ripon Buildings on Monday to support the civic body with materials and volunteers. The Corporation has already started distributing food in relief centres in areas such as Chintadripet.

Directive to hospitals

“All private hospitals, biggest to the smallest, who fail to disinfect their premises will be severely dealt with. The joint commissioners, deputy commissioners, chief engineers and zonal officers will visit the hospitals. Hospitals could become potential centres of spread of COVID-19. Medical professionals have to understand and cooperate,” the Commissioner said.

The Commissioner will inspect all major government hospitals and private hospitals. Chennai Corporation has also asked residents not to visit corporation offices for civic services or to register complaints. “Residents are requested to call 1913,” said an official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nwmcx5/article31147188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/stickers,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/people-in-home-quarantine-to-be-identified/article31147189.ece
439,2020/03/24,HC permits drinking water bottling units to function sans licence,"‘Crackdown will lead to water shortage’

The Madras High Court on Monday permitted drinking water bottling units in the State to function even without valid licences till July 31 because otherwise it might lead to shortage of water at a crucial stage when the State is battling the pandemic COVID-19.

Justices Vineet Kothari and R. Suresh Kumar took the extraordinary decision at the request of Advocate General Vijay Narayan representing the State and senior counsel G. Masilamani appearing for some of the private drinking water bottling units in the State.

The judges in their previous interim orders, passed last month and even early this month, had come down heavily against illegal bottling units that were functioning either without obtaining any licence from the government or without renewing their expired licences.

They had further directed the illegal units to deposit ₹50,000 each for renewal or issuance of fresh licences and decided to monitor the functioning of all such units in the State through appointment of two advocate commissioners for each and every district.

However, in view of the present threat of COVID-19 looming large, the senior counsel made a mention before the High Court to permit the bottling units to carry on their functions for sometime since there would be considerable delay in granting licences to them.

The A-G also expressed the willingness of the State government to permit the units to function temporarily. After recording his submission, the judges permitted the interim arrangement to continue with a condition that the units should give 15% of their daily output to the government so that the water could be distributed for free to the needy.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-permits-drinking-water-bottling-units-to-function-sans-licence/article31147147.ece
440,2020/03/24,Koyambedu functions with limited arrivals; foodgrain market to function only till noon,"Prices of some vegetables rise, but traders expect them to stabilise in a few days

A day after people’s curfew, Koyambedu wholesale market complex started functioning on Monday, but with limited arrivals. However, traders noted that this would not hamper the availability of essential goods in the city.

With the restrictions in place for inter-State transport, the Koyambedu market received only 70% of its daily stock, particularly from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.

On an average, the market gets up to 450 truck loads of vegetables alone daily, traders said.

The dip in the arrivals had escalated the price of a few vegetables on Monday. But, traders said the cost would stabilise in the next few days with increase in arrivals.

P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association said beans and broad beans were priced at ₹75 and ₹65 a kg respectively. These vegetables were sold for up to ₹45 last week.

Similarly, brinjal and green chillies were priced up to ₹30 and ₹40 a kg respectively due to lower arrivals. It may be recalled these were some of the cheap vegetables last week priced up to ₹20 a kg. Most of the other vegetables cost ₹20 - ₹25 a kg in the market.

According to wholesale merchants, the sales had also dipped by 20% as many retail customers bought more quantity than usual last week.

But, the market has started getting customers and small traders from neighbouring places such as Arakkonam and Kancheepuram.

“We are continuing to provide gloves and sanitisers for the safety of labourers. There are nearly 10,000 labourers in the market. Many of them are finding it tough to get food at nominal cost. The Amma canteen in the locality is not enough.

The State government must make alternate arrangements for the daily wage labourers,” said Mr. Sukumar.

Meanwhile, members of the Koyambedu Food Grains Traders Association have decided to operate the food grain market only between 3 a.m. and noon from Tuesday for the safety of traders and labourers due to COVID-19 threat and imposition of Section 144 in the city.

This arrangement would be continued till further notice, members said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/43gjvr/article31147139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THKOYEMBEDUMARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/koyambedu-functions-with-limited-arrivals-foodgrain-market-to-function-only-till-noon/article31147140.ece
441,2020/03/24,Crime drops in city as people stay home,"Fewer crimes were reported to city police stations between Saturday night and Monday morning as residents stayed at home in view of ‘Janata Curfew’.

The curfew was observed in the city which has more than a one crore population to contain the spread of COVID-19.

It was a total shutdown and most people stayed indoors.

People skipped their early morning and evening strolls, late night outtings and shopping.

An inspector of police at St. Thomas Mount police district said his station did not receive any petition or complaint of any nature for the past two days as most of the people stayed at home.

“Otherwise, our police station used to receive many complaints of a frivolous nature and petty cases. Since the Tasmac outlets were also closed, there was no complaint or petty quarrel as well,” he added.

A similar situation prevailed in more than 134 police stations in the city. Another officer in Adyar police district said, “There was no complaint of chain or mobile snatching too. Normally we receive a couple of such complaints.”

“Compared to previous days, there was zero crime reported in two days,” said another senior police officer.

Most of the deputy commissioners in the city reported no offence such as theft, dacoity or burglary or attention diversion reported except a few petty quarrels, nuisance and missing persons.

City Police Commissioner A.K.Viswanathan said, “Compared to other days, these days saw fewer crimes as residents stayed at home and patrolling was tight.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/crime-drops-in-city-as-people-stay-home/article31147127.ece
442,2020/03/24,Washbasins installed in parts of city,"Corporation staff to clean the basins regularly and ensure soap and water

Washbasins with running water and soap have come up in parts of the city, thanks to an initiative of the Greater Chennai Corporation.

The civic body has been installing them at junctions, near tea stalls, bus stands, vegetable markets, slum board settlements and at places where people gather in large numbers.

At least 30 have come up in the south zone. While residents welcome such initiatives, the civic officials said the idea is to encourage hand-washing and ensure hygiene among the public to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“If there is running water at a location, we just connect a tap to the supply. Our conservancy staff clean the basins regularly and ensure soap and water. These are temporary installations,” said an official. Each zone has been provided a sum of ₹1 lakh to install the basins with water supply and drainage and provide soap.

Harsha Koda, coordinator, Federation of OMR Residents Associations, said that it was nice to see the washbasins functioning.

“The civic body should ensure that there is regular water supply at these installations. Many gated communities too have installed taps with soap at their gates,” he said.

Palavakkam resident K. Sakthivel suggested that the washbasins could be made permanent fixtures to encourage cleanliness.

“I saw the basins at Palavakkam bus stand.

For senior citizens living by themselves and hesitant to step outdoors owing to concerns regarding COVID-19, a group of volunteers has come together to offer assistance.

Bhuvana Seshan, a singer, put out a Facebook post on Sunday evening, asking if people would be interested in helping senior citizens purchase groceries and other essentials. “Several people came forward and said that they would be ready to volunteer and help out senior citizens in their areas. We have created a WhatsApp group for better coordination and have been sending out messages with the numbers of our volunteers on social media so that they can be contacted,” she explained.

A volunteer is assigned based on the area the senior citizen is from, and the former takes down the list of groceries, accepts payment and delivers the essentials.

Keeping in mind the importance of social distancing, Ms. Bhuvana said that all the volunteers have been instructed to drop off the groceries at the doorstep of the senior citizens as well as follow adequate precautions by way of wearing masks, gloves and using hand sanitiser.

Advaith Shivram, a Class XII student who is volunteering in Valasaravakkam, said that on being contacted, he asks the senior citizen for the list of essentials needed and takes the money for the same.

“We do the shopping for them and leave it at their homes. We have got several requests from elderly couples and senior citizens who are living by themselves to help them stock up groceries and medicines,” he said.

A resident of Kolathur, Priscilda Nancy, who has also volunteered, said that she helped arrange breakfast for an elderly couple living alone on Monday morning. “Another senior citizen wanted us to help her buy groceries, coffee powder, milk and a few other essentials.”

The volunteer group is also focusing on arranging food packets for senior citizens who might need them in the coming weeks. “Many senior citizens get meals delivered to their houses through specific providers and if these services are not available during the curfew, we can help them with this as well,” she said.

The Madras High Court on Monday directed the School Education Department to conduct the last of the Class XII examinations, scheduled to be held on Tuesday, from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. instead of 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in view of the minimal number of government buses being operated in the State due to threat of COVID-19.

Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy ordered that the examination should be started 30 minutes late so that the children get some breathing time to reach the examination centres.

They also directed the officials concerned to ensure that the children do not face any difficulties in finding transportation.

Though similar orders were passed with respect to the Class XI examination scheduled to be held on Thursday, the State government ended up ordering postponement of that examination due to the proposed promulgation of prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure from 6 pm on Tuesday.

The judges had taken up the issue of examinations during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition filed in the court regarding alleged non availability of masks and hand sanitisers.

Stating that his government was not prepared to lose even a single life, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Monday announced that ₹500 crore will be allocated to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

He informed the Assembly that 9,266 beds in government hospitals had been converted into quarantine beds in the first phase, and the arrangements would be expanded depending on the requirement.

“Newly constructed buildings will soon have beds, and additional beds will be readied even in government hospitals, where emergency measures are not required,” he said.

The Chief Minister added that the government had held discussions with private hospitals and advised them to create 750 beds for the treatment of COVID-19.

Mr. Palaniswami said the houses of those who had returned from abroad in recent times would be identified and marked as ‘house quarantined’. The details of quarantined persons should be shared with police and local body officials and field workers.

“Those who have visited foreign countries and those who have been in contact with such people should be identified and monitored to prevent them from coming into contact with others,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wavf20/article31146976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24TAMILNADUCHIEFMINISTERAIADMKEDAPPADIPALANISWAMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/cm-announces-500-crore-fund-to-combat-outbreak/article31146977.ece

448,2020/03/24,"Three more COVID-19 cases in State, one with no travel history","Labs at CMC, Apollo Hospitals can test for virus

Tamil Nadu reported three more positive cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on Monday, taking the total number of patients to 12. However, one of three persons — a 54-year-old resident of Anna Nagar in Madurai — has no history of travel to an affected country or other States, according to Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar

The man, who is admitted to the isolation ward of Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, has co-morbidities including cardiac disease, uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension, he said. “While two patients have history of travel to an affected country, patient 12 (as the department refers to him), the 54-year-old man, has no history of travel. Co-morbidity is a risk. We will now examine if he had any contact with travellers from affected countries or affected State,” he told reporters.

The two other patients who tested positive are — a 25-year-old man from Purasawalkam in Chennai who had returned from London and is in the isolation ward of Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and a 48-year-old man from Tiruppur who had returned from London and is in the isolation ward of ESI Hospital, Coimbatore.

Quarantine is an order

The Minister said that 12,519 persons — who had travelled from affected countries and States — were under home quarantine in the State. “As per the Chief Minister’s order, we are posting home quarantine stickers on their houses. This is because many of them were ignoring the home quarantine instructions, and we had received information that they were moving outside. Home quarantine is not a request, it is an order from the government. They have to obey it,” he stated. Such persons should stay at home to prevent community spread of COVID-19. The CM has announced promulgation of prohibitive orders under Section 144 of CrPC to prevent community spread, he said. The Collectors, Superintendents of Police, public health and revenue officials were involved in putting up the stickers, he added.

On reports that an armed reserve policeman was admitted for COVID-19, he said, “He was admitted for fever in Virudhunagar. As he had symptoms, he was referred to GRH, Madurai. We are lifting samples for testing.”

The number of patients admitted to isolation wards in government medical college hospitals across the State increased from 54 to 89.

The number of persons placed under home quarantine also soared from 9,424 to 12,519 — Chennai alone accounting for 3,600 persons followed by 1,044 persons in Kanniyakumari, according to details in the bulletin issued by the Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine on Monday.

Of the 89 persons admitted, 18 were in Salem Medical College, 10 each in Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and Thanjavur Medical College and eight each in IRT, Perundurai, Erode, Government Kilpauk Medical College, medical colleges in Tiruchi and Coimbatore. Currently, 21 asymptomatic passengers from highly-affected countries are being quarantined in facilities near airport.

As for samples lifted for testing, the number increased by 109; the largest increase till now. Of the total 552 samples lifted for testing, 37 samples are under process. On Monday, Indian Council of Medical Research permitted two private laboratories in the State — Department of Clinical Virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore and Department of Laboratory Services, Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited, Chennai — to test samples.

The Health department, in its daily bulletin on COVID-19, provided travel details of all nine patients, who had tested positive for COVID-19 in the State.

451,2020/03/24,Prolonged lockdown to have cascading effect on students,"Extension not enough to complete syllabus, say professors

The All India Council for Technical Education extended the deadline for approval process by a week on Sunday.

The annual exercise to arrive at increase / decrease in the number is a precursor to the start of admission process for colleges under the council.

A week ago, Anna University issued an advisory to shut down colleges in view of COVID-19 infection for a fortnight. The university had informed colleges that it would provide an additional two weeks to complete the syllabus before announcing the dates for exams.

Several professors said the extension for the semester would not be sufficient to complete the subjects. K. Manivannan, chief executive officer, Mohammed Sathak Group of Institutions, said the first year students were the most affected as their semester began late.

Final year students who had applied for higher studies abroad would also be affected as the admission process for fall semester begins in March-April.

Several colleges have taken to online teaching and learning process to prepare the students. P.S. Srinivasan, principal, Knowledge Institute of Technology, Salem, said the students have been given a timetable to keep them engaged.

The institution has almost completed the course work for second, third and final year students who have been provided a set of question papers to solve and send to the teachers either by e-mail or social media options, he said. D. Saravanan, dean, academics, Kumaraguru College of Technology, said students had been provided the unfinished portion as online material. “It cannot be a replacement for a regular class but only supplement it,” he said.

The director of a college in Chennai said: “We have encouraged faculty to provide classes online. We have asked for a system to place accountability for the faculty so that we will know what the students have done. This system will go on till March 31. We are trying to provide online exams for the students.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/prolonged-lockdown-to-have-cascading-effect-on-students/article31146195.ece

India has just finished a day of curfew and clapping to practise ‘social distancing’ and to express gratitude to the millions of health and essential services workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. It was a laudable initiative by the Prime Minister to rally the nation together. The nation is truly at war, as he alluded to, and it can be won only by everyone coming together in this ‘tragedy of the commons’.

Also read: Janata Curfew: You created festival-like conditions in an atmosphere of fear and concern, Sanjay Raut tells PM Modi

India lags

But just two days before our clapping, the Indian-origin Finance Minister of the United Kingdom unveiled the U.K.’s biggest economic recovery package in its history, as an antidote to the crisis; there is no fixed cost to it. The United States is finalising a trillion-dollar economic recovery package, while Germany is going ahead with ‘unlimited government financing’ for the disruptions due to the outbreak. France, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands have all launched a half-a-trillion dollars combined in recovery measures. If this reads like panic, consider this one data point — the number of people who lost their jobs, in just the last two weeks in America is the highest ever weekly job losses recorded in its history. These large, developed economies are expected to not merely slow down, but to contract and experience negative growth. The economic devastation will be much more painful and longer than the health impact.

While the rest of the world has sprung into action, India has merely announced the setting up of a task force under the Finance Minister to explore economic recovery options. This lackadaisical approach is unconscionable. Contrary to rhetoric, neither will India be immune to this imminent economic crisis nor will some ‘preternatural force’ insulate us from this epidemic. It is prudent to swing into action right away to soften the inevitable economic blow.

There are already reports that a third of all restaurants could shut down in the formal sector alone and shed more than 20 lakh jobs, in the coming months. The entire automotive sector is shutting down its factories, putting at risk the incomes of a million people employed in this sector. When people lose their jobs, entire families suffer, consumption drops and overall demand collapses. When businesses close down, then they default on their commercial obligations down the chain and to their financiers. This freezes up credit flow in the economy and halts production. Since this is a global crisis, it is not even possible for India to import and export its way to recovery. Under such painful conditions, India needs a comprehensive recovery package that will first cushion the shock and then help the economy recover.

A three-step plan

In my discussions with former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram and economists, there was near unanimity that the package should rest on four pillars: providing a safety net for the affected; addressing disruptions in the real economy; unclogging the impending liquidity squeeze in the financial system, and incentivising the external sector of trade and commerce. So here is a broad plan for a ‘COVID-19 Economic Recovery Package for India’.

The destruction of jobs, incomes and consumption can be addressed through a direct cash transfer of ₹3,000 a month, for six months, to the 12 crore, bottom half of all Indian households. This will cost nearly ₹2.2-lakh crore and reach 60 crore beneficiaries, covering agricultural labourers, farmers, daily wage earners, informal sector workers and others. It is important that this is not just a one-month income boost but, instead, a sustained income stream for at least six months for the millions who have lost their incomes, to provide them a safety net and a sense of confidence. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM KISAN) programme with a budget of ₹75,000 crore can be subsumed into this programme.

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) must be expanded and retooled into a public works programme, to build much-needed hospitals, clinics, rural roads and other infrastructure. This can be achieved by integrating MGNREGA with the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and the roads and bridges programme. These three programmes together have a budget of nearly ₹1.5 lakh crore. This must be doubled to ₹3 lakh crore and serve as a true ‘Right to Work’ scheme for every Indian who needs it.

In addition, the Food Corporation of India is overflowing with excess rice, wheat and unmilled paddy stocks — enough excess stock to provide 10kg rice and wheat to every Indian family, free of cost, through the Public Distribution System.

This combination, of a basic income of ₹3,000 a month, a right to work and food grains, will provide a secure safety net.

COVID-19 testing, treatment, medical equipment and supplies capacity can be expanded through the private sector and be reimbursed directly for patient care. This will need a budget of ₹1.5- lakh crore for testing and treating at least 20 crore Indians through the private sector. This will help create a large number of jobs in the private health-care sector, with trickle-down benefits.

Steps for the central bank

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a ₹1.5-lakh crore liquidity and credit backstop facility on Monday, which is a very welcome move. Further, the RBI should show regulatory forbearance and also set up a credit guarantee fund for distressed borrowers for credit rollover and deferred loan obligation.

The central bank must also immediately reduce interest rates drastically to spur business activity. A two-year tax holiday and an appropriate incentive scheme must be designed for exports and service sectors that have been devastated (airlines, tourism, hospitality, entertainment, logistics, textiles, leather). This could cost the exchequer between ₹1-lakh crore and ₹2-lakh crore.

Finding the money

In sum, the total incremental expenditure for the recovery package will be between ₹5-lakh crore to ₹6-lakh crore for FY2021. The next obvious question is: Where is the money for this?

The ₹5-lakh crore to ₹6-lakh crore recovery package can be funded largely thorough three sources — reallocation of some of the budgeted capital expenditure, expenditure rationalisation, and the oil bonanza.

Given the extraordinary situation the world is facing, it is important to reprioritise our expenditure plan in the near term. The government had budgeted more than ₹4-lakh crore in capital expenditure for FY2021. This will, unfortunately, have to be reworked and some part of it allocated to the COVID-19 recovery package. For example, there is a budget of ₹40,000 crore for the revival of the telecom public sector units which can be delayed and the amount reallocated.

Similarly, the budget of nearly ₹1-lakh crore for national highways, roads and bridges can be rationalised to reallocate this to the recovery package. It is possible to extract a total of ₹1-lakh crore for the package out of the ₹4-lakhcrore budgeted capital expenditure for FY2021.

Fifty-four ministries in the Union government of India made a demand for grants and a total of ₹30-lakh crore has been budgeted as total expenditure for FY2021. Of these, 13 large ministries account for as much of the Budget expenditure as the remaining 41 ministries combined. There is ample scope to rationalise expenditure in these 41 ministries to extract ₹2-lakh crore for the recovery package.

The blessing in disguise for India is the dramatic fall in global crude oil prices —from $40 a barrel to an estimated $20 a barrel — which can help save nearly ₹2-lakh crore; this can be used to fund the recovery package or make up for shortfall of tax revenues.

To be sure, there will be a fiscal implication of this stimulus package and the fiscal deficit will rise driven both by increased expenditure and shortfall of revenues from the slowing economy. But now is not the time for fiscal conservatism.

Helping States

It is often asked why the States cannot embark on an economic stimulus plan. The States combined incur an expenditure of ₹40 lakh crore. There can be some sharing of expenditure of the recovery package of ₹1-2 lakh crore by the States. But after Goods and Services Tax (GST), States do not have the fiscal freedom to raise tax revenues on their own. They are largely dependent on the Centre for their tax revenues through direct taxes and GST.

In summary, India needs an immediate relief package of ₹5-lakh crore to ₹6-lakh crore targeted across all sections of society and sectors of the economy. Though daunting, the money for this can be found through detailed analysis and some bold thinking. The global economy is headed for a dark phase and it is our duty to rise to the challenge to secure the future of all Indians.

It is time to think big, bold and radical to pull our economy out of this crisis. This is India’s moment for the equivalent of the “New Deal” that U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt launched in America after the Great Depression of 1929.

There is no doubt that the poor people will find it difficult to stay afloat during the pandemic (Editorial page, “The perils of an all-out lockdown”, March 23), but one should not forget that to survive in this double crisis, the government has chosen the lesser evil. If an all-out lockdown was not imposed then the situation would have been too serious to control. One can imagine the gravity of situation just by looking at what is happening in Italy and Iran. Of course, it is the responsibility of government to ensure that the poor do not struggle, but others can help too — the rich, the industrialist class and religious institutions should come forward to help at this crucial juncture.

There is no denying the fact that as the country is veering towards total lockdowns as a strategy, the not-so-privileged sections who need a daily income are going to face an uphill task to eke out a living. It was expected that when the Prime Minister sought the cooperation of the people for a janata curfew, he would also spell out the ways and means of taking care of the downtrodden who constitute the majority. Now that the people had risen to the occasion and made the curfew a resounding success, it is also time for the government to reciprocate and utilise existing social security schemes to extend the required economic assistance. Along with the scare of a virus, the poor people should not be left to stare at the prospect of living on an empty stomach. The corporate industry may cry out for bailout packages, but the priority should be to look after the interests of daily-wage earners who have no one else but the government to look to for relief.

Change and how

The ugliness of the Congress government being toppled in Madhya Pradesh and a BJP government being installed in its place is nothing but stealing the mandate of the people. That the party is expanding its power base State by State, but by adopting all crooked manoeuvres possible and with utter disregard for democratic norms is distressing.

Do not the tall leaders in the party have any shame or conscience by openly indulging in very questionable methods to meet political ends? When will the Election Commission of India put an end to this? And when the higher judiciary call out this misuse of power? If such political absurdities continue unchecked, why hold elections at all? It may not be far-fetched to say that the government of the day aims to have absolute majority in the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha to enjoy authoritarian rule. It is for the judiciary to uphold constitutional values and save the country.

The petition filed by social activist Ketan Tirodkar through advocate Aparna Vhatkar said the economy of the State and the country had been severely hit in view of the mandatory restrictions on all businesses and commercial activities.

“Those who run businesses and are involved in commercial activities are not in a position to pay their loans and taxes that are outstanding. Even the State is not in a position to pay instalments of loans to the Centre,” the PIL said, adding it will take some time to recover and for the situation to normalise after the COVID-19 scare.

457,2020/03/24,COVID-19 | I-T department seeks extension of limitation date,"Department writes to CBDT chairman saying only 2% officers attending office

The Mumbai income tax department has written to the CBDT chairman seeking an extension of the date of limitation in the wake of the COVID-19 scare. The limitation was due on March 31.

Senior officials said while 10% attendance in income tax offices is mandatory, less than 2% of officers are coming to work. In such a situation, and keeping in mind the cancellation of local trains, the city’s lifeline, the date of limitation of March 31 should be extended, the letter from Satish Gupta, principal chief commissioner, income tax, Mumbai, to the CBDT chairman said.

Under the Income Tax Act, 1962, there is a limit of completion of assessment, reassessment and recomputation. This could be two years from the end of the assessment year in which the income was first assessable, or one year from the end of the financial year. The time-barring period applies to other schemes and functions as well.

“We have less than 2% of officials turning up for duty in these unprecedented circumstances. There is no way we will be able to complete time-barring matters and implement other schemes on before the date of limitation. Therefore, we have sent a proposal, but it is ultimately the government’s call,” said an I-T official.

The letter has said with just 10% of the staff strength, it would be difficult to process a lot of functions including the Vivad se Vishwas or the direct tax dispute tax resolution scheme, besides resolving cases under the Black Money Act. “We had requested major corporate houses to volunteer to settle the assessment disputes before March 31 or pay 10% extra after the due date. These can of course wait since several of our offices are taken over by the local corporation for COVID duty,” said an official.

Among other functions, the letter said, the processing of returns, reopening of assessment, and measures like revision and setting aside of assessment orders are affected. “The travel of our officers will not only risk their personal safety but also safety of the community,” the proposal said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4dw5qg/article31147207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMCSMT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/coronavirus-i-t-dept-seeks-extension-of-limitation-date/article31147203.ece
458,2020/03/24,COVID-19 | Filipino Islamic scholar who tested positive dies in Powai,"BMC officials reviewing if death could be attributed to virus

A 68-year-old Islamic scholar from the Philippines, who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus, succumbed on Sunday night at Powai’s Hiranandani Hospital.

The patient developed respiratory distress and went into renal failure. Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials said his two repeat tests were negative and they were reviewing if his death could be termed as a COVID-19 death.

The patient was first admitted to Kasturba Hospital. Given that he had underlying conditions like diabetes and asthma, his condition remained critical throughout. He was shifted to Hiranandani Hospital on Sunday and he died a few hours later.

State government officials and members of the embassy are in contact with the family members of the senior citizen to discuss the last rites. Officials said the burial would be carried out after following the infection control protocol.

The victim had arrived in Mumbai on March 3 in a group of 10 to visit several mosques in the country. They had then travelled to Delhi and returned to Mumbai on March 10.

The group was staying at a mosque in Navi Mumbai. After he developed symptoms, the patient first visited a local doctor who referred him to Kasturba where he tested positive on March 13. Two other members from his group have also tested positive and are currently admitted to Kasturba.

A doctor, who did not wish to be named, said the patient should have been shifted to a well-equipped hospital much earlier. The patient was on non-invasive ventilator support while at Kasturba and he was also put on dialysis. The hospital had to get dialysis machine from another civic hospital. “By the time he was shifted, chances of his revival were extremely slim,” the doctor said.

BMC’s deputy executive health officer Dr. Daksha Shah said the death review committee would look into this case but as of now it could not be termed a COVID-19 death.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tbyo4n/article31147193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMFUMIGATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-filipino-islamic-scholar-who-tested-positive-dies-in-powai/article31147178.ece
459,2020/03/24,COVID-19 | 39 booked in Navi Mumbai for violations,"Real estate agent, café owner kept businesses running, others gathered for ritual

The Navi Mumbai Police have registered a first information report on Saturday and at least three more on Sunday against people violating government orders given in the wake of the spread of novel coronavirus.

On Saturday night, the Kharghar police registered a case against a real estate agent for keeping his office open even after orders by the Panvel City Municipal Corporation to keep offices shut.

Meanwhile, the APMC police registered a case against Nikunj Savale during the wee hours of Sunday for keeping his café, Arabian Nights, in Satra Plaza, Vashi, open. “He was booked as he did not comply with the orders and risked the lives of others by giving others an opportunity to gather at one place,” a police officer from APMC police station said. He was booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) relating to disobedience to orders and negligence, as well as the Disaster Management Act.

Meanwhile, the Panvel City and Kalamboli police on Sunday booked 37 people including a religious head who had gathered to conduct rituals. While Panvel City police booked 34 people, Kalamboli police booked three people under sections of the IPC along with sections of Maharashtra Police Act, Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 and Maharashtra Covid-19 rules 2020.

The Panvel City Municipal Corporation (PCMC) has quarantined 14 people at Gram Vikas Bhawan while 205 others are home-quarantined.

On Sunday, around 1,200 sanitary workers of PCMC were on call. “For the first time ever, all the roads were deep-cleaned by the workers. Usually, due to continuous traffic, the workers are not able to clean the roads properly, but were able to do so due to the Janata Curfew,” said Deputy Municipal Commissioner Sanjay Shinde.

The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) on its part has quarantined 58 people in a Sector 14 building while 227 are home-quarantined.

On Saturday night, NMMC had sanitised all important chowks in the city as well as railway stations and the areas around them. As a symbolic gesture, NMMC put a mask on the statue of a lion outside its headquarters. “It is a symbolic gesture to remind people to take care. Many of them are fond of taking selfies with the statue, and hence, it was the best place to make the symbolic gesture,” said NMMC PRO Mahendra Konde.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/4og8nb/article31147144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMPOLICEMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-39-booked-in-navi-mumbai-for-violations/article31147100.ece
460,2020/03/24,COVID-19 | Mumbai’s homeless pushed to the edge in crisis,"Activists have asked government to take immediate steps to help them out

For Nasim Mohammed Shaikh, who lives on the footpath outside JJ Hospital, Sunday was harrowing. With the city shutting down on account of the Janata Curfew, she, along with over 40 families who live on the pavement, were left scrounging for food and water. “We have been cooking and eating whatever we have. Stocks from the local ration shop were over long ago and vegetable prices have hit the roof,” said Mr. Shaikh.

With the city in lockdown, homeless citizens have been left in the lurch, and city activists have urged the State government to take quick action to mitigate a threat to their survival.

Brijesh Arya, convener of the Homeless Collective, said the community mostly survives on daily wages. “When Mumbai is in a lockdown situation, local shops are closing one by one, street food shops will be shut and the homeless will suffer unimaginably,” he said.

The situation, he said, was getting dire as activists could not reach them with supplies of food and water due to the lockdown.

Sitaram Shelar of the Pani Haq Samiti, said the lack of water was among the key issues they were faced with at this hour. “They are among the most vulnerable population in the city and the majority don’t have access to the public distribution system. It is imperative that the government do something for them immediately,” he said.

According to the 2011 census, there were 57,415 homeless people in Mumbai. Mr. Shelar said that some estimates peg it at close to a lakh. “The ones living alone who could leave the city have gone, but nearly 75% of the homeless live here with their families. Where will they go?” Mr. Arya said.

The government, he said, should look at temporarily shifting the homeless into empty municipal buildings or schools, where basic provisions such as electricity, safe drinking water and sanitation are available.

Mr. Shaikh said that with the lockdown in place, many were also worried about their jobs and whether they will even be paid for the days they have worked so far.

“We don’t know what the future holds for us. Some of us continue to work in people’s homes, but we don’t know how long that will last,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6jaahx/article31147043.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMHOMELESS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/citys-homeless-pushed-to-the-edge-in-crisis/article31147044.ece
461,2020/03/24,APMC market to be shut from March 25 to 31,"Traders take step to reduce crowds

The APMC on Monday decided to shut its Vashi market from March 25 to 31.

Considering that thousands of people enter and exit the market each day, traders have unanimously decided to keep it shut.

The market will be open on Tuesday, but owing to a shortage in mathadi labourers, the traders are not sure how much of the stock will reach the retail market. “Most of the mathadi workers have gone back to their hometowns fearing the spread of the virus. They are the most vulnerable. Because of lack of labourers we are facing a challenge of transportation,” said Ramdas Pavle, a vegetable market trader. “In the vegetable market, at least 1,000 vehicles bring in supplies from farmers each day. Another 1,000 vehicles belonging to customers also come in. At least 10,000 people are in the market at any given time,” he said. With Section 144 of the Indian Penal Code being invoked in the State, “it is wise to shut down the market for a while,” Mr. Pavle said.

Along with the vegetables market, the fruit and onion-potato market will also be shut for the week. “For the first time ever, I have a lock on my office. Usually, I have two-three labourers sleeping there. People should stock up on the required vegetables and fruits for a week on Tuesday and then sit at home. Only then can we fight the virus,” said Sanjay Pansare, a trader in the fruit market.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Branch) Suresh Mengade, however, said all essential shops will remain open and transportation of essential goods will be allowed. “The district borders will be closed so a person from Navi Mumbai won’t be allowed to travel to Mumbai, Thane or Raigad unless there is a valid reason, which will be verified,” he said.

In shops, people will need to maintain a distance of four feet from each other, and police officials are making regular rounds with announcements asking people not to crowd in one place, Mr. Mengade said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/l5cct5/article31146953.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMAPMC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/apmc-market-to-be-shut-from-march-25-to-31/article31146954.ece

With the rising number of cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the city, the Maharashtra Motor Vehicles Department on Monday instructed all the Regional Transport Offices (RTOs) in the State to suspend tests for driving licences and fitness renewal of vehicles until further notice.

A circular issued by the Transport Commissioner to all RTOs stated that in accordance with the State government’s directives, RTOs should have only 5% staff working per day. The circular, however, said all vehicles under BS IV and their chassis on which bodies will be built later on should be registered before March 31, in accordance with a Supreme Court order.

The transport department last week had directed all RTO offices to conduct only 10% of the scheduled learning licence test and only conduct the final road test of those whose learning licence will be expiring on March 31. It has since stopped all learning licence tests across all RTOs.

Every day, thousands of people visit RTOs across the city for driving licence tests. Moreover, commercial vehicles are required to be undergo a fitness test every year, barring which they are not allowed to run on roads. Senior transport department officials said since the State is undergoing a crisis, these steps had been taken and they will decide on the modalities of how they will accommodate the backlog after the lockdown is lifted.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qz6s0m/article31146937.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BMRTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/coronavirus-rtos-asked-to-suspend-all-licence-fitness-tests/article31146938.ece
463,2020/03/24,"COVID-19 | Old age, co-morbid conditions lead to higher vulnerability to virus","All 3 who succumbed in city were above 60 years old

Elderly patients with pre-existing co-morbid conditions are at a higher risk of developing severe complications due to COVID-19. In Mumbai, three patients who have succumbed were senior citizens with underlying conditions, which made their recovery difficult.

According to doctors, they were all above 60 and were suffering from hypertension, diabetes or heart disease. While the first patient developed inflammation of heart muscles and increased heart rate, the second patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome. The third patient succumbed to renal failure and respiratory distress.

An article published by the Lancet looking at co-morbidities and multi-organ injuries in COVID-19 patients stated that many of the older patients who become severely ill have evidence of underlying illness such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, kidney disease, or malignant tumours. “These patients often die of their original co-morbidities; we, therefore, need to accurately evaluate all their illnesses,” the authors stated, adding that these patients eventually die of multiple organ failure, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, arrhythmias, and renal failure. “We should, therefore, pay attention to potential multi-organ injuries and the protection and prevention thereof in the treatment of COVID-19,” the article said.

466,2020/03/24,COVID-19 | Police to keep track of home-quarantined,"Officials have received list of suspects detected at airport; 13 squads formed to focus on initiative

With frequent instances of home-quarantined citizens being found outdoors over the last one week, the Mumbai Police have obtained a list of all suspected cases detected at the airport and started checking on their movements.

According to police officers, the initiative was kicked off on Monday after three cases of quarantine violations were observed in the last week alone. Ever since the novel coronavirus crisis first began, Indian nationals arriving from other countries are being screened for signs of infection and being advised home quarantine for 14 days.

Senior officers said the purpose of the initiative was to keep a check on the movements of such people and find out if they had come into contact with anyone else during their quarantine.

“We have formed 13 special squads, one for each zone in the city, to focus exclusively on this initiative. We have already obtained information from the Chhtrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport about all those who were advised home quarantine and this information has been dispersed among the squads depending on the locations,” a senior police officer said.

The officer said the squads have been tasked with visiting all such people to ensure that they are sticking to the terms of their quarantine. “In case someone is found outdoors, they are taken to the nearest facility for a check-up. We also find out who else they have come in contact with so that they, too, can be examined. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is immediately informed of every development on this front,” the officer said.

He said the squads have also been instructed to ensure their own safety first, and are equipped with masks and hand sanitisers, with tips for their usage. To aid the squads, police station staff are also spreading awareness through public address systems mounted on patrolling vehicles and passing on any relevant information from local informants to squad members.

Meanwhile, from Monday, the police and BMC personnel also kicked off another initiative, where surprise checks are being conducted in residential localities to check whether the terms of the ongoing curfew are being adhered to.

“The checks are being conducted on a random basis by police station and civic officials. The ongoing lockdown has also made it easier to check on those who were advised home quarantine. Swift action will be taken against anyone who violates the orders,” Mumbai Police spokesperson Deputy Commissioner of Police Pranaya Ashok said.

While there was a strict curfew from 9.01 p.m. on Sunday to 5 a.m. on Monday, barring movement of one or more people in the city, a slightly relaxed curfew came into effect from 5.01 a.m., prohibiting assembly of five or more. This will be in effect till March 31 under provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and any violators will be liable for actions under the Indian Penal Code.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qfrxep/article31146702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BMQUARANTINESTAMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/covid-19-police-to-keep-track-of-home-quarantined/article31146703.ece

468,2020/03/24,Answers to your vehicle-related queries,"Pick the Kodiaq

Arun Chhabra, Noida: I am looking for a petrol-driven SUV in the ₹35-45 lakh segment. I have shortlisted the Skoda Kodiaq and the Volvo XC40. I like both, but the XC40 does not feel like a family car. My second question is about the XC60: any idea whether Volvo is contemplating a petrol version for this car anytime soon?

The XC40 is a touch more luxurious than the Kodiaq, but it’s a bit cramped in comparison, especially in the rear seating. The Kodiaq petrol with a 2.0 TSI engine will be a brilliant car to drive and is overall a more practical choice. We would go for the Skoda.

Spare parts unavailable

Jitupon Gogoi, Guwahati: Will it be wise to buy a used Fiat Punto diesel now, considering that the company has shut shop in India? I plan to keep it for the next five years. Will spares be an issue?

The Punto diesel is quite a hardy car, so if you have found one in good condition, it should last you for another 4-5 years. With the Fiat brand shut down, parts will be harder to come by, but not impossible. The good thing is that Fiat dealers haven’t shut down with the company and still continue operations with the Jeep brand. So, finding a competent workshop won’t be an issue, but you do have to consider the availability of parts in the long run.

Corolla Altis discontinued

Angad Singh Hanspal, Mumbai: Will Toyota launch the all-new 2020 Corolla Altis in India this year, perhaps by May-June?

There are no plans to launch the new Altis, and in fact, Toyota has discontinued the current model. The company may bring it back in 2021, but it’s not certain.

469,2020/03/24,TVS iQube: Back to the future,"The scooter marks TVS’ proper foray into the Indian electric two-wheeler space

India’s electric two-wheeler space is heating up, and how! The one in question here is called the iQube, and almost refreshingly, it doesn’t come from a brand that was just formed a few months ago to sell us rebranded Chinese products. The iQube scooter marks TVS’ proper foray into the Indian electric two-wheeler space. Yes, TVS beginning its shift to e-mobility is a big deal, but we were more curious to see if the iQube itself makes as much of an impact.

Ever since the iQube was unveiled, it’s been drawing in polarising comments about the styling. To best describe it, it looks like it’s been designed to be a futuristic product, but one that’s been designed close to a decade ago; and that’s not far from the truth, really. TVS did showcase it in concept form back in 2012. Now while that may sound negative, it isn’t. The narrow, horizontal headlight and tail-light look unique and almost RoboCop-like. The rest of the design is extremely simple, and it almost feels like TVS has purposely opted to go this route, as conventional designs attract buyers from a wider age demographic.

While we don’t have a problem with the design, there were a few small areas where the quality levels were inconsistent, but this could be because the scooters we were riding were initial test bikes. We’ll reserve final judgement for when we get to spend some time with the production models.

On the move, the scooter will leave you quite impressed, especially when it comes to acceleration. The hub-mounted motor is made by Bosch and has a peak power output of 4.4kW. This is a fair amount higher than that of the Chetak’s 4.08kW motor, but the iQube’s throttle response feels instant and is not as softly delivered as the Bajaj when you first open the accelerator. However, it’s more along the lines of immediate, rather than jerky, and while I suspect it might take some getting used to, I don’t think this will be a problem.

What is really nice is that acceleration in both modes (Economy and Power) is the same. The only difference between the two is the limit on the top speed. In Economy, you can go up to 45kph, and this is also where TVS is claiming that you will get a range of 75km. Top speed, meanwhile, will go up to a speedo-indicated 80kph in Power mode, but the range is said to go down to 55km here. We also liked how the performance doesn’t go down drastically with a drop in charge. I managed to hit a speedo-indicated 70kph even with just 16km of range remaining, according to the TFT display.

Hub-mounted motors are usually considered inferior to frame-mounted units, but the iQube seems to have no problem. I managed to climb a 10-degree incline with a pillion and on low charge at about 35kph, which isn’t bad. The battery is non-removable, but TVS has cleverly split it into three different packs, with one of them positioned under the footboard. This brings some of the weight-bias towards the front, and the company also says the twin rear shock absorbers have been tuned to help the iQube feel more natural.

And feel natural, it does. We had the opportunity to carry a good amount of speed through the corners at the company’s test track and the scooter didn’t feel nervous or twitchy at all. The grippy TVS tyres on the 12-inch wheel at both ends also helped improve stability. Lastly, the 220m front disc and 130mm drum brake were quite effective, and got the 118kg (slightly higher than the Ntorq 125) scooter to a standstill quite quickly.

Moving on to one of the biggest highlights of this scooter — the TFT instrumentation. It gets bluetooth connectivity and the screen graphics are legible, even under direct sunlight. The dedicated iQube app, along with the bluetooth function, shows incoming call alerts, SMS notifications and turn-by-turn navigation on the screen. What can also be seen via this screen is the scooter’s park assist function, which actually lets you creep forward or backward.

Every iQube also comes with a home charger that’s included in the price. It takes about five hours to charge the battery and there’s no fast-charging option. The charger, battery packs, and the battery management system have been built completely in-house, except for the cells in the battery packs that have been sourced from LG in Korea.

At ₹1.15 lakh (on road, Bengaluru), the TVS iQube is a little cheaper than the top-spec Bajaj Chetak, and significantly more affordable than the new Ather 450X, although you have to factor in the annual subscription cost that TVS will introduce sometime in the future. This subscription cost too is expected to be much lesser than what Ather is asking for, and we’re told it might be somewhere around ₹900 per year. At present, the scooter is only available in Bengaluru and TVS plans to introduce it across other cities in a phased manner.

That’s the iQube for you. In short, it’s a simple, quirky-looking city runabout. The limited range is the only big drawback, and that’s something we’ll have to live with till battery technologies mature. If you can’t wait that long, and only want to buy a product from a well-established Indian manufacturer, then this scooter is now the second option available to you.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/7v6b1a/article31153423.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25MP-TVS-1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/tvs-iqube-back-to-the-future/article31153427.ece
470,2020/03/24,The updated BMW X1 holds it own in this segment,"BMW XI: In a league of its own

BMW has had a relatively quiet year so far — they’ve launched new entry-level variants for the 3 and 5 Series sedans and the X7 SUV — with the updated X1 being the brand’s first major launch of the year. BMW’s entry-level luxury SUV sits in a segment that is set to see some big changes in the coming months; both Mercedes and Audi will bring in new generations of the GLA and Q3, respectively. So, is this just another very typically BMW-esque minor update, or is it something much more?

As seen on other new BMW SUVs, the X1 now gets a larger single-piece kidney grille too, bringing it in line with its bigger brothers. However, unlike the chrome-finished units on its siblings, the painted silver slats on the X1’s grille don’t look as premium and do leave us wanting more bling. Other changes include a new front bumper with repositioned fog lamps (now horizontal LED strips), and redesigned LED headlamps. In profile, the updated X1 looks pretty much the same as before, albeit with a new set of 17-inch wheels on this xLine variant. Meanwhile, changes around the rear are subtle, with mildly updated LED tail lamps, a slightly updated bumper, and slightly larger exhaust tips.

The changes inside are also subtle. The 8.8-inch touchscreen takes centre stage, but though the screen is large on paper, its placement makes it appear smaller than it really is. The system also gets a newer version of the BMW i-Drive interface, which works well; though it’s not the latest version you get on new-generation cars, like the Z4 and 3 Series. Also, while you do get wireless Apple CarPlay, BMW still does not offer Android Auto. Other changes include a new gear lever (which is nicely designed) and configurable interior ambient lighting. There’s also a bit of contrast-coloured, double-stitching on the dashboard that gives it a richer feel, but the X1’s age is starting to show, with materials that just don’t feel quite as rich as in BMW’s newer cars.

What remains unchanged is the sheer amount of space that this SUV packs. Both the front and rear seats are still very spacious, the panoramic glass roof accentuating the feeling of space. The best-in-class boot packs in an impressive 500 litres of space. The space-saver spare sits below the boot floor, without eating into luggage space. To wrap it up, BMW has provided two USB-C charging points for rear passengers, in tune with the times; and in case you don’t have the right adapter yet, there is a regular USB port at the front.

Then, there are the engines — the updated X1, both in its petrol and diesel guise, is now BS-VI compliant. The model we have here is the 2.0-litre, four-cylinder diesel that makes 190hp and 400Nm of torque — figures that are unchanged from the BS-IV-spec model. The new engine meets BS-VI emission norms by adding in a diesel particulate filter (DPF) and selective catalyst reduction (SCR) that uses the AdBlue emission reduction additive, which can be filled via a port next to the fuel filler.

While the output figures suggest no changes, there is a noticeable difference in the way the engine sounds and drives. For starters, it is more refined — both, while at idle, and when being pushed hard — and BMW’s new mapping has also made power delivery much more linear. This has made the X1 easier to drive, especially in traffic; though some are likely to miss the typical punch that these engines were so famous for. However, if you do want that fun (and the relentless turbo torque) you can always toggle the drive mode into ‘Sport’ — shift the gearbox into ‘S’ or use the paddles to go through the 8-speed gearbox.

Moving to performance, the new X1 is quicker than the outgoing model. In our tests, we recorded a 0-100kph time of 7.72sec as against the older car’s 8.07sec. The gap was even greater in kickdown acceleration. It’s also worth noting that the BS-IV car we tested had AWD, while this new BS-VI car is a front-wheel drive. Speaking of all-wheel drive, BMW will not be offering that on the X1 any more, even on the top-spec M Sport trim.

The X1 facelift is also a little more comfortable. Now, while that might be attributed to the car’s 225/55 R17 tyres, there is most certainly an added suppleness to the suspension setup. Bump absorption is better than before; though the X1 still has an underlying sense of the typical BMW firmness, it’s now a lot more forgiving on bad roads while maintaining high-speed composure.

With these updates, BMW seems to have aimed their entry-level luxury SUV towards a more varied target audience. Gone are the days when a Bimmer would be as stiff as nails and the epitome of driving pleasure. Instead, it’s replaced by products that are extremely well-sorted all-rounders; and the X1 is just that. It looks good, has great road manners, is well-equipped and spacious. The model we tested costs ₹39.90 lakh (ex-showroom, India) and prices on the whole are about ₹40,000-60,000 more than the outgoing car, depending on the variant. This is not bad at all, considering the updates and revised engines, and while there’s no top-spec AWD model any more, there is now a new base SportX model that brings the entry price down to ₹35.90 lakh against the previous model’s ₹38.30 lakh.

Since there’s no BMW hatchback on offer any more, and the 2 Series Gran Coupe is not due for launch until later in the year, this updated X1 makes for a strong entry point to the brand. Moreover, the Volvo XC40 has been reduced to a single petrol variant, and as Audi and Mercedes-Benz have exhausted their stocks of the current-generation Q3 and GLA, (and there’s a long wait before the new ones come along) at the moment, BMW has this segment pretty much all to itself.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/mc99ss/article31153135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25MP-BMW-1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/the-updated-bmw-x1-holds-it-own-in-this-segment/article31153143.ece
471,2020/03/24,A little panic is useful if it saves lives,"Sport engenders complacency, but a measured panic is better in a crisis

Authorities the world over tell us not to panic. But sometimes a little panic can be useful if it saves lives. It may be necessary to frighten adults with the bogeyman, the way children are scared into eating their vegetables, if all of us are to survive.

The insouciance with which many continue to go about their business as if nothing is happening — partying, gathering in public places — seems to be a sign that asking people not to panic is a way of telling them to act irresponsibly.

The five-minute plate-banging and clapping on the Sunday was followed on Monday by crowds on the streets and in marketplaces. It was, as one writer pointed out, as if India had won the World Cup. Citizens concluded that the coronavirus had been driven away.

What has all this got to do with a sports column you might ask, and the answer is, “everything.” Sport does not exist outside of normal human practice; it is not something that happens independently of life. Any man’s death ought to diminish us for we are involved in mankind, as the poet pointed out.

Ill-prepared

The worst is yet to come, and we are ill-prepared. The responsibility falls on each of us to follow the rules. Stay home. Wash hands. Avoid people.

The Olympic Games have been postponed. And there is very little chance of the IPL being held any time soon. We might as well accept this and not waste time speculating or swallowing the highly optimistic statements from some quarters.

According to most estimates, we will be dealing in millions of people affected and killed before the thing tapers off. The best case scenario is a few weeks, the worst 18 months or more. Governments and individuals should prepare for the worst while hoping for the best.

This means we will need more emergency hospital beds, more equipment, more trained personnel and huge amounts of money to handle the medical crisis alone (the economic crisis running on a parallel track calls for financial stimulus too). Not every city can construct a 1000-bed hospital in 10 days, as Wuhan, in China, did. And this is where sports facilities come in.

Emergency centres

The Sports Authority of India has already put its 10 centres and five stadiums at the government’s disposal to be used as temporary emergency centres and quarantine areas.

The cricket stadiums where the IPL is scheduled to be played can be put to better use over the next few weeks and months by turning them into similar centres.

Brazil has already done the same with their football stadiums, and Wales with rugby clubs. The three most populous countries got off to a late start for varying reasons. China, where the virus originated, was more keen on covering up than on warning the rest of the world. The United States has the misfortune of having a President who looks at each issue from the point of view of his personal business growth. The country in between, India, has done well so far, but it has two handicaps: an administration that is fundamentally anti-science, and a too-easily satisfied population which is often told what to feel. There is a third too — the reluctance of its billionaires to create a large fund to fight the pandemic. India has 138 of them, at the last count.

Urgency

The virus is no respecter of persons, and all three countries must deal with it with greater transparency and urgency. There are lessons they can learn from one another, and from Italy, Spain, Korea and the rest of the world.

It is not the end of the world if the IPL is postponed (the start of the cricket season in England has been pushed to at least May 28) or if the Olympic Games are not held on schedule. Such things tell us simultaneously about both the significance and the triviality of sport.

Right now it is the triviality that dominates. But we know this is only a phase, and soon the significance will take over. In the meantime, as the British Prime Minister said, many of us would have lost loved ones.

Many of them might have been saved with a bit of panic that saw them stay at home, wash hands and avoid travel and crowds.

In the spring of 1915, a year after the start of the World War (which ended only in 1919), the Surrey Committee issued the following statement: “The County championship will not take place; but in the event of the War coming to an early conclusion, it is hoped that some matches may be played…”

Surrey’s and England’s and the world’s best batsman, Jack Hobbs later wrote in his autobiography: “How curious it seems today to think that the War might not be prolonged throughout 1915…”

Sport engenders complacency, but measured panic is better in a crisis.",columns,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/g7ycnw/article31156487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15-JAPAN-OLYMPICS-24march,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/a-little-panic-is-a-useful-thing-if-it-saves-lives/article31154419.ece
472,2020/03/24,Meeting kind Ladakhis in the time of Coronavirus,"The story of how our longing to visit Ladakh in the off-season turned into one of exasperation, and how a Nari Shakti awardee lent a helping hand...

Two weeks ago, we were in Ladakh. Yes, this is not the ‘season’ to go to Ladakh, and that is exactly why we were there.

The ‘season’ has become synonymous with traffic jams, diesel fumes and haggling tourists. Small local shops are sidelined by big traders, there is water shortage and overall chaos. And so, after 14 years of visiting Ladakh during the season, I wanted to see the real Ladakh. So I chose March.

Admittedly, you do miss out on some of the good parts of Leh — the winter months and fewer travellers mean there is little buzz around coffee shops, bakeries, bookshops and restaurants, most of which are shut — but we were willing to accept that loss.

Which is how we landed in Leh on a clear, sunny morning. (Flying in is the only way to reach Leh till about mid-April as all the passes are blocked due to snow.) This necessitated a two-day period of rest and acclimatisation, during which we focussed on hydrating ourselves, relaxing, and walking around Leh’s semi-open market.

Fortunately, we adapted well to the altitude and were now ready for our first big day of the trip — a visit to the Alchi monastery. The village of Alchi lies about 66 kilometres west of Leh on the banks of river Indus. There are many famous monasteries in Ladakh, including Thiksey, Hemis and Lamayuru, but Alchi, personally, is the most special.

While almost all monasteries in Ladakh are perched on top of a hill or command a prominent view from afar, Alchi lies hidden, and is virtually undiscoverable till you enter its front gate. Its murals and thangkas (Tibetan Buddhist paintings) are considered to be amongst the best in any Buddhist monastery.

Our first stop was SECMOL (The Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh), an inspiring, alternative Ladakhi school run by the now-famous Sonam Wangchuk (who inspired Aamir Khan’s character Phunsukh Wangdu in the Bollywood film 3 Idiots). From there, we continued on the highway till Nimmu, which is popular for the bird’s eye view it offers of the Indus meeting the (semi-frozen) Zanskar river.

By this time, we were hungry. The altitude was taking its toll and we were feeling tired and sluggish. Not unusual, but nevertheless unsettling. We needed food. Our drivers told us there are dhabas four kilometres ahead on the road. That cheered us up, but not for long.

When we reached, we found a deserted, post-apocalyptical space. All the dhabas were closed. Our drivers too were confused. Though it was off-season, highway dhabas usually stay open for the few tourists and locals.

It gradually dawned on us: this was the Coronavirus effect.

With no other immediate options, we drive back to Alchi, reasoning that it is a tourist centre, and would hence have restaurants. But after a 40-minute drive — overpowered by hunger — we get out of the car to an unencouraging scene: rows of closed shops.

We must have presented a very sorry picture because a woman, sitting outside a closed restaurant, called out to us.

“Will a simple meal do?” We were too overwhelmed to answer immediately, so she continued: “Some dal, chawal, aloo sabzi maybe?” We replied with an emphatic, “Yes, please!” “Ok,” she said, adding, “But it will take some time. In the meanwhile, you can go and see the monastery.” Our faces lit up, the tiredness gone just at the promise of a meal. And the monastery, which was the last thing on our minds till a minute ago, now seemed a wonderful place to wait at.

We walked through the monastery, admiring its beautiful paintings, tall imposing statues and whitewashed stupas. However, after 20 minutes, we were back at the restaurant. A short flight of stairs led to a small door on the first floor. We opened and entered a wide room interspersed with wooden columns supporting the roof, a big open kitchen on one side with traditional Ladakhi-style tables.

The woman, whose name we still did not know, and her mother (we assumed) were busy cooking, and the food smelt divine. “It’s ready, please help yourself,” she declared.

As we started serving ourselves, I noticed a gold bag with the Government of India’s emblem on it. I went a little closer to get a better look and it read: ‘Nari Shakti award 2020 — Nilza Wangmo.’

Nilza got the award on March 8 from President Ram Nath Kovind, after which she met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at a function in Rashtrapati Bhawan.

“There were 15 of us from across the country. I was selected for promoting authentic Ladakhi cuisine and being an entrepreneur,” she says, adding, “I just got back from Delhi.”

As we ate her simple meal of dal, chawal and aloo sabzi, we appreciated the fact that we were eating lunch cooked by one of the most celebrated women in Ladakh, and, perhaps, the entire country.

The food was tasty, of course. But this meal meant more than that. It soothed, comforted and reassured us. It truly made us happy. And it reaffirmed the essential goodness of people, of women, especially. At times like these, that is everything.",travel,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/hudufe/article31152181.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPLadakh-3,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/meeting-kind-ladakhis-in-the-time-of-coronavirus/article31152183.ece
473,2020/03/24,"COVID-19: Case to be registered against those violating lockdown, says Puducherry Chief Minister","The Chief Minister warned those who were not taking the lockdown seriously

Expressing anguish at people not taking lockdown seriously, Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Tuesday said the response of people has prompted the government to direct the police to register cases against those violating the prohibitory orders under relevant provisions of the Epidemic Act, 1897 and Disaster Management Act, 2005.

Briefing reporters after holding a meeting with Members of Parliament, MLAs and senior officials, the Chief Minister said he had directed the police to take stern action against those violating the order. “Cases will be registered against violators under the the provisions of the Epidemic and Disaster Management Acts. The guilty could invite punishment of up to one-year imprisonment,” he said.

The lockdown was announced as a precautionary measure to stem any outbreak of the novel coronavirus. People should understand that the only “medicine,” available for coronavirus was social distancing, the Chief Minister said.

“Today morning, we saw people coming out in two-wheelers from rural areas. We got reports of people entering into arguments with the police. I appeal to the public to obey the orders and allow the police to implement the lockdown,” the Chief Minister said.

The police will allow only medical shops, grocery stores, milk parlours and vegetable markets to function. The government has instructed the police to close down all other business establishments, including tea shops till March 31, he said.

The government has also decided to create isolation wards at the Indira Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute, he said. Before the meeting, the Chief Minister and Health Minister Malladi Krishna Rao inspected the Government General Hospital to review their preparedness.

474,2020/03/24,COVID-19: Voluntary organisations step in to provide food during Puducherry lockdown,"Various organisations are providing food to low income groups

With Puducherry having being brought under lockdown since Monday night to contain the spread of COVID-19, many voluntary organisations have stepped in to address the needs of the homeless, daily wagers and low income groups.

The Rotary Club of Puducherry COSMOS has launched an initiative to provide face masks and sanitisers to Swachh Bharat workers and police personnel who are on patrol duty across the city during the lockdown.

“We have already provided home made food prepared by our club members to around 150 people who were stranded at the Rajiv Gandhi Government Women and Children Hospital on Monday. Most of them were from neighbouring districts and they were stranded in Puducherry as the railway station and bus stand were shut down,” said A. Senthil, advocate and president of Rotary Club of Puducherry COSMOS. “We have planned to provide breakfast and face masks to Swachh Bharat workers,” he said.

T.A. Seetharaman, secretary of Dharma Samrakshana Samithi said the association has launched an initiative to provide food to low income groups till the end of this month. “The Samithi has roped in a caterer to prepare the food at a centralised kitchen to ensure that it meets the hygiene aspect. The food is packed in the kitchen and delivered at different locations across Puducherry. We have planned to distribute a minimum of 300 food packets a day to the underprivileged and those affected due to the lockdown,” he said.

The Rotaract Club (initiative of Rotary in colleges) has also drawn up a plan to associate students in colleges to prepare home- cooked food and distribute it to the underprivileged sections in the wake of the lockdown. The club has already distributed 50 face masks to children admitted at the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (Jipmer).",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/heo9hb/article31151987.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24MARTH--PONDYV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/covid-19-voluntary-organisations-step-in-to-provide-food-during-puducherry-lockdown/article31151381.ece

476,2020/03/24,Jipmer’s OP services shut down,"GHs asked to cut down regular outpatient appointments, restrict unnecessary visits

The outpatient services attached to all government general hospitals in Puducherry and Jipmer were shut down on Monday in the wake of increase in number of COVID-19 cases in the country.

A health department official said the government had directed all GHs to cut down regular outpatient appointments and to restrict unnecessary visits, consultations for minor illnesses to maintain infection control.

All cataract surgeries had been suspended and the hospitals have been advised to issue medicines for chronic illness for a period of two months. However, immunisation clinics will function with less crowding.

Jipmer has closed the OPDs in departments of dermatology, orthopaedics, ophthalmology, physiotherapy, psychiatry and dentistry, and all afternoon/evening (special) clinics.

A press note from Jipmer said the measure was in compliance with the restrictions imposed by the Department of Revenue and Disaster Management Authority, Government of Puducherry.

All other patients who visit Jipmer will be directed from the main gate of the institute to a special counter for screening.

There will be restriction on the number of persons who may accompany each patient. Restrictions will also be in place on the entry of people into Jipmer’s residential campus, including the hostels, the note said.

No recreational activities by non-residents will be permitted in the residential campus.

Meanwhile, in an advisory, Jipmer appealed to the public not to panic in view of the continuous information on COVID-19 from various social, print and visual media.

The spread of this disease can be prevented to a large extent by reducing interpersonal contacts, maintaining at least one meter distance from one another and ensuring good general hygiene, such as regular hand washing, and covering mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing, etc.

Reducing inter-personal contact by avoiding all forms of travel, and, by working from home, where possible, is a very effective method to break the chain of transmission, the note added.

Public are requested to co-operate in crowd reduction measures — avoid travel, large gatherings, social functions, and any situation which puts one in contact with a larger number of people.

Travel history

Patients with history of overseas travel and/or exposure to suspected patients with Covid19 must not directly visit hospitals, but contact a helpline.

The COVID-19 helpline phone numbers are national helpline: 1075, Puducherry /Karnataka helpline: 104, Tamil Nadu helpline: 044-29510500, Andhra Pradesh helpline: 0866-2410978, Kerala helpline: 0471-2552056, the advisory stated.

This will ensure that general public is not exposed to COVID- 19 infection and get proper treatment.

A large proportion of those infected with Covid-19 have a mild disease. Such patients can be managed efficiently at home by ensuring preventive measures to control the spread of infection by maintaining social distance and good hygienic practices.

These patients only need drugs to relieve their symptoms (e.g. for reducing fever or cough), and no special drugs are needed.

Only sick patients with difficulty in breathing need hospitalisation. They carry a higher risk of transmission of disease, and hence need stringent infection control measures to prevent spread to other patients and healthcare personnel, the advisory said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/7sg8o5/article31148282.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH24PONDYCOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/jipmers-op-services-shut-down/article31148283.ece
477,2020/03/24,"Public support crucial, says Chief Secretary","‘People need to diligently maintain social distancing in order to stop the virus from spreading’

With the Union Territory on lockdown till March 31, the administration has sought the cooperation of the public in checking the spread of COVID-19 by practising social distancing with the same “admirable resolve” shown during Sunday’s nation-wide ‘Janata Curfew’ to express solidarity with health professionals and others combating the pandemic.

Addressing a press conference, Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar said though a new set of prohibitory measures would take effect, citizens’ access to essential goods and services would be unhindered.

While there was no need to panic, the public needs to diligently maintain social distancing, which is the most potent weapon in the containment effort, given the highly contagious nature of the novel coronavirus, he said.

He offered the contrast of China, which was able to come out of the pandemic by strictly following containment measures, and Italy which is overwhelmed by COVID-19 at present to reiterate the importance of not letting the situation get out of control. And, in this, the power was in the hands of the people.

“The voluntary spirit demonstrated during the ‘Janata Curfew’ should be extended to the practice of social distancing,” the Chief Secretary said.

‘Biggest challenge’

Jipmer Director Rakesh Aggarwal said COVID-19 presented one of the biggest challenges to the medical fraternity.

Social distancing will help break the chain and significantly reduce the disease burden, Dr. Aggarwal said.

Balaji Srivastava, Director General of Police, said the police force would help facilitate passage of citizens who require to access essential services and also act against hoarding and overcharging of essential items.

The Department of Revenue and Disaster Management, meanwhile, issued detailed orders defining the purview of the lockdown.

An order issued by T. Arun, Special Secretary (Revenue), stipulated that residents should stay at home and come out only for buying essential commodities/services by strictly observing social distancing norms.

Any congregation of more than five persons is prohibited, the order added.

All State borders will be sealed, excepting movement of essential commodities and services.

Plying of private vehicles will be restricted only to the extent of procuring essential goods/services. All public transport services — taxis, autorickshaws, are prohibited.

Intra-city/town buses will ply, but overcrowding of passengers to be avoided. Operation of inter-State bus and transport services, including private operators is suspended, it said.

All shops, commercial establishments, offices, workshops, godowns etc will shut down.

However, production and manufacturing units, which require continuous process such as pharmaceuticals, active drug ingredients are exempted.

Units engaged in production of essential commodities such as medicines, sanitary items, dal and rice mills, food and related units, dairy units, feed and fodder units, will operate.

Religious places shut

AIADMK Floor Leader in the Assembly A. Anbalagan told presspersons here on Monday that the government at present had been adopting a piecemeal approach in containing the spread of the infection. He said the views of the elected legislators had not been enlisted and only officials, including those not concerned with public health, were participating in the review meetings.

There should be strict enfiorcement of precautionary steps to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. He said Tamil Nadu, under the leadership of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, had been evolving and implementing several steps to check the spread of the pathogen.

479,2020/03/24,Pangs of the pandemic emerge,"Prolonged social distancing hits livelihoods of many people

Pangs of the COVID-19 pandemic has started taking its toll on the public life in Pathanamthitta.

Though inevitable and an absolute necessity, the restrictions imposed by the authorities on people’s movement, functioning of offices, shops, banks etc, as part of the ongoing intensive disease prevention campaign has rendered many people jobless, at least, for the time being.

“Many marriage ceremonies have been cancelled or being reduced to mere family functions with a participation of hardly 50 people. We, caterers have lost all our orders for March, April and even for May. Our catering group had eight orders for marriage feast (sadya) in March alone and all of them have been cancelled due to the ongoing crisis,” said S.N. Sadasivan Pillai of Parthasarathy Caterers at Aranmula.

Mr. Pillai had to close his two village hotels in Aranmula, retaining all the 12 workers from West Bengal and Tamil Nadu there, with full wages, food and accommodation.

The marriage halls, auditoriums and conference halls too have been shut down since March 7 when the first five COVID-19 cases were reported from Ranni. This has also affected the livelihood of photographers, videographers, interior designers, decorators, beauticians, vegetable and provision merchants, and the long list goes on like that.

Raju Maglight who owns a studio in Thiruvalla says wedding photography has been the main source of a professional photographer’s monthly income. With the cessation of marriage ceremonies and receptions, that revenue source has been sealed, leaving many self-employed photographers in utter despair.

“However, we have been fully complying all the restrictions imposed by the government from time to time in the larger interests of the society,” he said.

Many small-scale business people here have availed themselves of small loans and have joined chit funds of financial institutions, that include the State-owned Kerala State Financial Enterprises, for starting their own businesses. The COVID-19 crisis was a bolt from the blue that had badly hit all their financial plans and calendars.

“We anticipate, at least, a moratorium on the loan repayment and on the monthly chit fund remittances of the KSFE till the coronavirus crisis is over,” said Mathew Thankachan who runs an event management firm.

The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and United Democratic Front (UDF) walked out during the presentation of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation budget for the financial year 2020-21 on March 24, after Mayor K. Sreekumar refused to heed to their demands to postpone the budget in view of the COVID- 19 outbreak.

The civic body authorities who were in two minds on whether to postpone the budget were forced to go ahead due to statutory obligations to present it before March-end.

A separate media pavilion has been set up outside the hall, with an LED wall to watch the presentation. Web streaming of the Budget has also been arranged. Councillors as well as media persons have been provided with protective masks.

As soon as the day's proceedings began, BJP and UDF leaders raised the demand for the postponement of the budget, as the state itself was under lockdown. They demanded the Mayor to request the government for a fresh date. However, the Mayor decided to go ahead with the budget, prompting the Opposition councillors to walk out. The 35 BJP councillors gathered at the Corporation office lobby and raised slogans against the ruling LDF, while the 21 UDF councillors gathered at another corner to tear up the budget document.

483,2020/03/24,Collector warns medical stores violating guidelines,"District Collector K. Gopalakrishnan has warned medical stores against hoarding essential items such as masks, gloves and hand sanitisers that is much in demand in wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Mr. Gopalakrishnan said many outlets were found to have hoarded such items and also overcharged customers.

High rates

“We have found medical stores charging rates higher than what has been fixed by the Central government. There have also been instances in which some outlets have claimed to have ran out of stock, despite having sufficient quantity of the products. We have constituted four squads, comprising officials of the Drugs Control, Legal Metrology, and Revenue Departments. Inspections will be intensified across the district,” he said.

He said there existed no cause for concern in the district with arrangements being made to ensure adequate stock of perishable items.

He added that discussions were also held with traders’ organisations to ensure backups in the event of an exigency.

The district administration had also intensified surveillance of those who were placed under quarantine. Nearly 7,000 teams had been deployed in various parts of the district for the purpose.

Cases registered

Pointing out that cases were registered against two persons for violating home quarantine in Kazhakuttom on Monday, the Collector said while warnings would be issued initially, legal action including arrests would be initiated for repeated violations.

He added that an inventory list had been created as part of taking stock of the facilities and equipment that were available in government and private hospitals in the district.

All private hospitals had pledged support towards efforts to contain the outbreak, Mr. Gopalakrishnan said.

Teams

he administration also constituted teams led by officials to coordinate various activities.

484,2020/03/24,Maintaining vigil to keep the virus at bay,"Health inspectors, JPHNs on their toes in city wards to check coronavirus spread

The time is around 9 p.m. One of the health inspectors of the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation receives a frantic call from a resident saying that he had spotted a person, who was supposed to be in home quarantine near a junction. Over the next few minutes, calls are made to the person in quarantine, who denies having gone out. He also promises to comply with the directions. In between, the health inspector slips in a warning that they will be forced to inform the police if he is noticed outside again.

In another ward, a Junior Public Health Nurse (JPHN) receives a Whatsapp message of a list of things a person in home quarantine requires.

Quarantine needs

The message is conveyed to the civic body authorities and within an hour, the things including medicines and groceries are purchased and brought to the person’s doorstep.

Ever since the COVID-19 outbreak, health inspectors of the local bodies, JPHNs, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers, and a team of volunteers have been on their toes, keeping track of those in home quarantine and meeting their various demands, besides taking steps to prevent large gatherings at religious festivals in their wards.

“Around 40 persons are in home quarantine in the Thirumala health circle. The neighbours and the JPHNs are extra vigilant in ensuring that none of them move out of their homes. The ASHA workers are helpful in tracing the locations. We are constantly in touch over phone with those in quarantine. Once in a while, we receive requests for various items, although some go a bit overboard and request a lot of items,” says Gopakumar, health inspector of the Thirumala health circle.

On Saturday, at around 7 p.m., the health officials received a call from the police regarding a person who had escaped quarantine and was found travelling in a KSRTC bus near Pattom.

They rushed to the spot, took steps to move those in the bus to quarantine, and disinfected the bus.

Defying directions

“Our job is to let them know about the importance of being in quarantine and making them feel comfortable. In some houses, despite this, strict quarantine is not being maintained, as those quarantined were found to interact closely with family members. On Sunday, a 25-year-old who had returned from Delhi was found outside his home, despite multiple warnings from us. We had to inform the police who issued a warning to him that legal action will be taken in case he repeats this,” says Ahalya, who works as JPHN in Palode.

Social reaction

On Saturday morning, a person and his wife had arrived from Dubai and headed to their house in Kalliyoor panchayat for home quarantine, but the neighbours were not keen on having them there. The Corporation health officials had to bring them back to an isolation centre set up at Kadakampally ward.

20 volunteers

“We have formed a control unit in each ward. A team of 20 volunteers have also been formed in each ward, consisting of people from the locality. They have been provided training and they will keep an eye on those in quarantine,” says S.S.

486,2020/03/24,"Make COVID-19 testing more widespread, demands IMA","‘5,000 isolation beds, 200 ICU beds kept in private hospitals’

The Indian Medical Association has demanded that the government take steps to make COVID-19 testing more widespread and that testing facility be made available to healthcare workers and anyone who might be symptomatic.

State president of IMA Abraham Verghese said here on Monday that a police aid-post be set up at all hospitals in the State and that all hospitals be declared as protected zones.

He promised the full cooperation of the private sector in providing medical care to COVID-19 patients, in case the State is up against a situation wherein community transmission occurs and the number of patients go up. The IMA has also been in favour of a State lockdown.

The private sector has at present 56,962 beds in the State, of which, 5,000 isolation beds and 200 ICU beds have already been set aside for COVID-19 care. The IMA was also ready to identify unused hospital buildings that could be turned into quarantine facilities, Dr. Verghese added. The IMA also appealed to the government to ensure that adequate personal protection equipment were stockpiled to protect healthcare workers.

‘Regulate patients’

The IMA is advising all its doctor members to regulate the number of patients coming to out-patient clinics in hospitals and home clinics so that only those who essentially need medical treatment are attended to. All elective surgeries should be postponed, Dr. Verghese said.

Doctors have been asked to regulate their OP numbers in such a way that the OP is not crowded and patients do not have to wait for a long time. People should not unnecessarily visit hospitals. And it is preferable that those below 18 years of age or above 65 years do not accompany patients to hospitals. The IMA has also advised hospitals to arrange beds in ICUs and emergency care strictly as per the spacing norms prescribed. The hospital management should in consultation with the employees re-arrange the staff working hours.

In order to help doctors who are stopping private practice, the IMA has also decided to make arrangements for consultation online or through WhatsApp.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/make-covid-19-testing-more-widespread-demands-ima/article31146890.ece
487,2020/03/24,Lawkeepers out to rein in pandemic threat,"Police officers are State’s foot soldiers in tackling COVID-19

While the State went into a self-imposed lockdown on Sunday, police personnel here were at work covering every nook and cranny to spread awareness on the COVID-19 pandemic.

As all around them clapped and cheered to honour the efforts of health workers in the country, the police quarters in the State capital witnessed poignant scenes when the children of police personnel carried placards that read “My father is on duty to protect us all. You can protect him and all of us too. Stay home.”

Taking up a larger role under the present scenario, the police force have become the resolute foot soldiers for the State government. Kerala Police have tapped into the well-entrenched network of Janamaithri community groups that they have been cultivating across the State since 2008. By tapping its social influence, the police have been able to reach out to the residents’ associations effectively on the need to take precautionary measures.

“We have adopted a multi-pronged strategy to sensitise the public as well as enforce the guidelines laid down by the government. The Janamaithri Suraksha scheme has enabled us to keep tabs on those placed under quarantine in their homes with the help of people’s representatives and residents’ associations. We have also been playing an active role to ensure the availability of essential supplies, the shortage of which could create a law and order situation,” says the District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram City) Balram Kumar Upadhyay.

Personnel under the Thiruvananthapuram Rural Police have been facing a stiffer challenge with large sections, especially in the coastal areas, refusing to pay heed to calls for restraint.

District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram Rural) B. Asokan said the police officers had faced resistance from the public in places including Kadinamkulam, Anchuthengu, Poovar and Pozhiyoor, where many have been placed under observation. Nonetheless, the local residents remained mostly indoors during the janata curfew, providing signs that the sensitisation efforts were beginning to show results.

Announcements

Announcements were also being made using microphones in various parts including Venjaramoodu, Attingal, Ayiroor and Kallambalam to create awareness, the officer said.

According to Mr. Upadhyay, the officers have been practising social distancing and were provided the necessary protection gear including masks.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ht4nzk/article31146881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Tvmpolice2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/lawkeepers-out-to-rein-in-pandemic-threat/article31146882.ece

Anganwadi worker Renuka, posted at the Secretariat on Saturday, is one of the links in the Health Department’s ‘Break the chain’ campaign that attempts to stop the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Renuka, who belongs to the Thrikannapuram health centre under Anganwadi no.17 of the Corporation’s Integrated Child Development Services project, is one among the many Anganwadi workers and staff deployed by the Women and Child Development Department on rotation duty at public places, including railway stations, bus stations and government institutions, as part of the campaign.

Washing hands

Besides creating awareness among the public on the precautions to be taken to limit the spread of the infection, the Anganwadi workers at these ‘Break the Chain’ kiosks also demonstrate how to wash hands effectively.

Across the State, nearly 60,000 Anganwadi workers and helpers are part of the campaign. Sajikumari, an Anganwadi worker at Vamanapuram (Additional), says she and her colleagues make home visits too. People are told to inform Anganwadi workers if anyone from abroad has returned home.

In such cases, they explain in detail the need for the person to physically distance himself/herself from other members of the family and stress the need for only one family member to look after the requirements of the person in quarantine. They keep track if migrant workers in the area still work there or have left for home or anyone new has arrived.

Prevention steps

They also go over the COVID prevention measures with them and the need to visit primary health centres in case they have cold or fever. The people, says Saji, have been cooperating very well.

Renuka who has won the national award for best Anganwadi worker for 2017-18, says that with Anganwadis closed for preschool students since March 11, they have had to take the ration meant for these children and supply it to their homes. Food for adolescent girls is also being supplied to their homes as take-home ration.

Food

The raw food meant for pregnant and lactation women and the Amritham powder for children in the six months-to-three years age group is already being sent to their homes.

Though police teams were seen moving around the town from 5.30 p.m., announcing that the prohibitory orders would come into effect at the stroke of 6 p.m., several commercial establishments, particularly snacks, flower-vending and juice shops, tried to extend their business hours by a few minutes. However, they received a stern warning from the patrolling teams.

Public transport, including autorickshaws, went off the road by 7 p.m. When intercepted by the police, some of the autorickshaw drivers could be seen pleading that they were headed for their shed or house and that the passengers would be dropped enroute.

Once the curfew period began, most of the eateries started shutting down service and encouraged customers to accept food parcels as directed by the State government. But the tea shops had wind up business as they could not offer tea in parcel since the use of plastic covers had been banned.

“I must think twice before lifting the shutters of my shop tomorrow since it will be hard to comply with the crowd restriction rule in this business,” said Ramu, who runs a tea-cum-snacks shop at Mangalapuram on Medical College Road.

On the other hand, Mallika, who runs a kiosk near Municipal Colony on the same road, said she was hopeful that she could carry on with her business since the flow of customers to her shop always remained normal in view of the nature of goods available for sale at her outlet.

Briefing reporters on the steps taken by the district administration to contain the spread of the virus and treat affected patients, he said the hospital had 136 ventilators. As per Medical Council of India norms, there should be a ventilator for every 10 beds and the hospital met the criteria. Similarly, the Government Headquarters Hospital in Manapparai had 35 ventilators.

In case of emergency, it had been decided to make use of the ventilators in private hospitals. Seven private hospitals in the city had more than 100 beds. If needed, 20% of beds would be used to treat patients. Though the private hospitals had been informed of the decision, their services would be made mandatory if the situation warranted, Mr. Sivarasu said.

Twenty-four persons suspected to have been affected by the virus were tested over the last two weeks. Of them, 18 tested negative. The results of six specimens were awaited. Seven patients were in isolation ward including one admission on Tuesday.

Twenty patients could be accomodated in two isolation wards at MGMGH. Since the hospital received patients for delivery, authorities had been asked to take steps to keep them away from the isolation wards as a precautionary measure.

Steps had been taken to provide 200 more beds in the district. While 75 would come up at MGMGH, the government hospitals in Srirangam, Manapparai, Inamkulathur and Musiri would have 30 more beds in addition to the existing ones. The arrangement was to meet any eventuality in the wake of any increase in the number of patients.

502,2020/03/24,Asterix’ co-creator Albert Uderzo passes away,"Uderzo created Asterix in 1959 with the fellow Frenchman and writer Rene Goscinny.

Albert Uderzo, the co-creator and illustrator of the “Asterix and Obelix” comics that delighted legions of children and adults over the past six decades, has died aged 92, his family said on Tuesday.

“Albert Uderzo died in his sleep at his home in Neuilly, after a heart attack that was not linked to the coronavirus. He had been extremely tired for the past several weeks,” his son-in-law Bernard de Choisy told AFP.

Uderzo created Asterix in 1959 with the fellow Frenchman and writer Rene Goscinny, who brought them to life in the French-Belgian comics magazine Pilote.

The adventures of the shrewd and indomitable Gaul, with his winged helmet and formidable blond moustache, and his massive sidekick Obelix as they gleefully thwarted Roman legionnaires became a huge hit, with translations into dozens of languages.

The series has extended into 38 books, most recently “Asterix and the Chieftain's Daughter” from last year, though Uderzo had stopped illustrating the series in 2011, having carried on alone after Goscinny's death in 1977.

Nearly 1.6 million copies of ""The Chieftain's Daughter"" were sold last year in France alone, putting it at the top of best-seller lists.

Both men are considered founding fathers of modern comics and graphic novels, with 380 million of their books sold worldwide, and several stories turned into animated cartoons and feature films.

The pun-filled series is brimming with fist-fights, drunken arguments, heroic rescues and romantic interludes, and the stories often include not-so-subtle references to politicians or popular figures of the day.

They have been translated into 111 languages and dialects, including Latin and Ancient Greek.

‘Nobody recognises me’

Uderzo was born April 25, 1927, in Fismes, a village in northeast France near Reims, to Italian immigrants — his father was a luthier.

At birth he had six fingers on each hand — an anomaly corrected by surgery — and was colourblind, yet he discovered drawing after joining a Parisian publishing house after World War II, while also providing comic drawings for newspapers.

“Making a living through comics was extremely hard in those days, I drew an astronomical amount of pages just to get through the month,” he would recall.

He met Goscinny in 1951, beginning a friendship that would lead to their dreaming up Asterix and his village in Amorican Brittany, fuelled by cigarettes and pastis liquor, in a social housing apartment outside Paris eight years later.

Uderzo claimed he was inspired by tales from his older brother Bruno, who would head to western France to escape labour conscription by the Nazi occupiers.

The first Asterix book, ""Asterix the Gaul,"" appeared in 1961 and became an overnight sensation, eventually introducing the world of comics to a much wider public.

Marketing rights that extended to toys and even a popular French amusement park would make Uderzo a wealthy man, with a mansion in the posh Neuilly suburb of Paris and a collection of Ferrari supercars.

In 2017, an original Uderzo cover for one of the first Asterix books sold in Paris for a record 1.4 million euros.

Yet the easygoing Uderzo regarded his success with amused detachment, and largely avoid the media spotlight even as his reputation soared.

“Nobody recognises me when I walk down the street,” he said. “Characters can become mythical but not us, their fathers.”

He took up his crayons for one of the last times in 2015, to draw an Asterix in hommage to fellow illustrators and others killed in a jihadist massacre at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/fe22qi/article31154008.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Uderzo,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/asterix-co-creator-albert-uderzo-92-passes-away/article31154009.ece

504,2020/03/24,COVID-19: Doctors cautious over use of malaria drug as preventive,"The Council cautioned the general public against the unrestricted of the drug, stating that “it is still at experimental stage and is not recommended for public use.”

Based on the recommendation of the Task Force for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Monday had approved the use of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis by healthcare workers taking care of COVID-19 cases and asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed cases. ICMR does not recommend prophylactic use of the drug for children under 15. Hydroxychloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is used for treating rheumatoid arthritis.

Also read: COVID-19 | After positive outcome in Jaipur, 3 patients in Mumbai put on anti-HIV drugs

However, a day later, the Council cautioned the general public against the unrestricted of the drug, stating that “it is still at experimental stage and is not recommended for public use.”

“Hydroxychloroquine is recommended only for a healthcare worker who is treating a COVID-19 patient. Secondly, it's recommended only for persons staying with and caring for a household patient who has been tested positive. They can take that only for prophylaxis — only for prevention,” the ICMR noted in its release.

“The recommendation is for empirical use of the drug based on available evidence and is restricted for use by only two categories of people and under strict supervision of a doctor,” Director-General of ICMR Balram Bhargava told The Hindu.

The clarification comes as none of the drug approving agencies across the world, including the FDA, has cleared the drug for prophylaxis or for treating COVID-19 patients.

Tiny sample

The available evidence of the efficacy of the drug is a small study by French researchers involving 26 COVID-19 patients. The study found “significant” reduction in viral load in over half the number of patients at end of six days of therapy.

COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

As the trial showed significant reduction, the results were published on March 17 in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents even before the 14-day follow-up was completed. The paper, which did not include the data of six patients, was published a day after it was submitted to the journal. One of the authors is an Editor-in-Chief of the journal where the paper was published.

During a White House press briefing a few days ago, asked if there was any evidence that the drug can be used as a prophylactic or as treatment for COVID-19 patients, Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci, said: “The answer is ‘no’ as it is [based on] anecdotal evidence.”

He then added, “It was not done in a controlled clinical trial. So you really can’t make any definitive statement about it.”

Despite Dr. Fauci’s clarification, two Nigerians are reported to have over-dosed on the drug after hearing President Donald Trump saying the drug could help treat people with COVID-19. A man in Arizona, U.S., died and his wife was hospitalised after they self-medicated with a home remedy of hydroxychloroquine — a chemical used as fish tank additive that has the same active ingredient as the drug.

Prof. Gagandeep Kang, executive director of the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute (THSTI) in Faridabad, told The Hindu: “At this moment there is no evidence available [about its effectiveness]. There are ongoing trials. They must have waited for the results of the trials. Even the trials are for treating COVID-19 patients and not for prophylaxis.”

The Atlanta-based Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that based on “limited in-vitro and anecdotal data”, the drug has been recommended for treatment of COVID-19 patients in several countries. The drug is currently under investigation in clinical trials for pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment.

“There are no currently available data from randomised clinical trials to inform clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection,” CDC says.

However, Dr. Navin Khattry from the department of medical oncology at the Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai and deputy director of ACTREC says: “Its use as prophylaxis has been extrapolated from the treatment trial. As a prophylaxis, the drug may benefit healthcare workers who are taking care of COVID-19 patients.”

“When there is no other drug available, and when the virus is highly contagious, it is best to use if there is some benefit. The same logic applies for other diseases where there are no medicines available,” Dr. Khattry said.

“With the Task Force for COVID-19 recommending the drug, it has become a standard of care even when WHO and CDC have not suggested its use as prophylaxis,” says Dr. Anant Bhan, a researcher in global health and bioethics. “Using the drug as prophylaxis may give a false sense of security to healthcare workers and they may not use personal protective equipment (PPE) or maintain hand hygiene. Good quality PPE is more important and urgent but we are already facing a shortage of PPE.”

“We don’t have a strong pharmcovigilance. So how are we going to pick up adverse effects of the drug and toxicity? Considering the rampant over-the-counter use of drugs, how are going to restrict its sale?” asks Dr. Bhan.

“We also can’t do any trial on prophylaxis when everyone is taking the drug.” He is also worried that just like hand sanitisers and masks, there will be a shortage of hydroxychloroquine for people with rheumatoid arthritis.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/7nro8y/article31155871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MalariaDrug,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/covid-19-doctors-cautious-over-use-of-malaria-drug-as-preventive/article31155872.ece
505,2020/03/24,Mental Health Matters: The need for a comprehensive approach to TB Care,"With survivors speaking out more frequently about their experience of TB and mental health, there is evidence of depression, loneliness, anxiety and low self-esteem associated with the disease.

Tuberculosis (TB) in India continues to present a major threat to the overall health and social- and economic-well being of the country. Along with China and Russia, India accounts for half the world’s TB cases. The proliferation of drug-resistant strains of the disease is an added challenge to the government’s goal of eliminating TB by 2025.

TB is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide. TB incidence in India has always been cause for concern and the fight to end this epidemic gained momentum with the government resolution to end TB by 2025 under the National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2017 - 2025.

Despite this, one critical aspect of TB care – it’s correlation with mental health – remains overlooked. A 2016 study in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care said that 74o f 100 patients diagnosed with TB, referred to the psychiatry department of the same hospital, demonstrated psychiatric symptoms.

Still, TB is rarely associated with mental health. Health service providers and researchers have restricted their focus to the physiological effects of the disease and the connection between TB and mental health remained unexplored. While TB can affect anyone, regardless of socio-economic status, it is especially prolific among the underserved. Cramped and unhygienic living conditions, as in the country’s most populated cities, gives the air-borne infectious disease opportunity to thrive. Malnourishment and health conditions such as diabetes also increase the risk of infection.

Patients with HIV are most vulnerable and account for the high incidence of TB in India, with 80% affected of HIV patients being infected by TB. Stigma associated with both diseases prompts many to hide the infection and not access diagnostic or treatment services. The case for ending TB globally has repeatedly shown that a multi-faceted approach is key to effectively eliminating the diseases. Mental health is a key part of that.

With survivors speaking out more frequently about their experience of TB and mental health, there is evidence of depression, loneliness, anxiety and low self-esteem associated with the disease. Besides cases of drug-induced psychiatric symptoms, TB-related stigma can also have a debilitating effects on patients.

The long duration of treatment — typically six to eight months — often leads to fatigue and treatment discontinuation. The resulting adverse outcomes include morbidity, mortality, drug resistance and disease transmission. Frequent absences from school or work resulting in lost productivity, turbulent inter-personal relationships and poor social support can foster feelings of worthlessness. Common mental disorders, such as substance abuse, also increases the risk to TB patients. Smoking is also a major risk factor.

Psychological support

The need for addressing mental health in TB has gained momentum in recent years. The evidence base is small but compelling. It indicates that better treatment outcomes are possible when psychological support is provided. In Peru, group-based psychological support for patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) significantly improved treatment outcomes; in Ethiopia, an educational and psychological intervention improved adherence and ‘TB clubs’ successfully reduced stigma leading to improved outcomes.

In India, too, there is evidence that counselling results in better adherence. Initiatives such as Saksham Pravah Project provide home-based counselling to MDR-TB patients and caregivers. Patients are encouraged to share fears and talk about the discrimination, depression, and familial discord they face. In Kerala, treatment support groups encourage the community to provide social help to patients, also resulting in positive outcomes.

The ‘Guidelines on Programmatic Management of Drug Resistant TB’ by the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) state that counselling is an important part of treatment. But translating this into action is challenging.

Psychiatric symptoms are often overlooked due to a lack of trained counsellors. Stigma prevents people from seeking counselling services and gets in the way of developing support systems. To address this, the need for health systems strengthening takes increasing precedence. Training providers and communities about the risks mental health disorders pose to the continued spread of TB, as well as the psychological effects of TB on patients, is key to eliminating the disease by 2025.

Incorporating messaging to end stigma around TB in community programs and having the government encourage social mobilization, like in Kerala, is also key. Providing screening and counselling services as part of the DOTS program can integrate mental health in the TB treatment process too.

India accounts for 27% of the world’s TB burden. The resulting losses in productivity, growth and wellbeing are enormous. As part of the effort to meet Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 – ending the TB epidemic by 2030 – it is imperative that the government and partner organizations take into consideration that an inclusive approach that addresses mental health is the need of the hour.
