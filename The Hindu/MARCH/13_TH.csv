0,2020/03/13,Gursimar triumphs in sixth leg of Hero WPGT,"Vani Kapoor takes lead in the Hero Order of Merit

Gursimar Badwal ended a 14-month title drought with a superb three-under 69 that saw her complete a fine rally and win the sixth leg of the Hero Women’s Pro Golf Tour here on Friday.

Gursimar, whose last win came in the second leg of the 2019 season in Pune, had opened the tournament with a disappointing seven-over 79 and was T-13 after the first day.

She recovered from there with 67-69 in the second and final round to total one-under 215 and emerge a winner by two shots over Saaniya Sharma (67) and Vani Kapoor (72). Vani Kapoor may not have been able to win her second title but she did have the consolation of taking over the lead in the Hero Order of Merit after the erstwhile leader, Amandeep Drall had to withdraw from the final round.

Saaniya Sharma made a big charge, including a birdie-birdie finish for a five-under 67. She jumped from Tied-10th to Tied-second place on the final day. Sharing the runner-up spot with Saaniya was Vani Kapoor (73-72-72), who played very consistently on all three days.

Neha Tripathi shot 71, one of the three sub-par scores of the day. She totalled two-over 218 and was fourth.

Overnight co-leader, Asmitha Sathish (74) suffered two double bogeys, one on the Par-4 seventh and another on par-3 17th.

Those errors cost her a chance to make a run for the title. She also had four birdies and two bogeys for a 74 that left her in fifth place.

Pranavi Urs (74) was sixth, while Siddhi Kapoor (74) was seventh and Gaurika Bishnoi (73) was eighth.

Amateur Hunar Mittal, who began with a superb 72 on the first day, and Oviya Reddi (79) rounded off the Top ten.

As Vani Kapoor took the lead in the Hero Order of Merit with Rs.4,91,000 in five starts, Amandeep Drall was second with ₹ 4,21,400 and Saaniya Sharma with this week’s runner-up finish rose to third with Rs.4,17,300.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/lho4gf/article31063262.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14GUR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/gursimar-triumphs-in-sixth-leg-of-hero-wpgt/article31063263.ece
1,2020/03/13,Augusta Masters postponed,"Gives Woods a shot at a 16th Major title

This year's Masters tournament, the season's first golf Major, has been postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak, Augusta National Golf Club chairman Fred Ridley announced on Friday.

“Considering the latest information and expert analysis, we have decided at this time to postpone the Masters tournament,” Ridley said in a statement.

The event has been delayed, not cancelled, so defending champion Tiger Woods, who is battling a back issue, may get the chance to capture a 16th Major at the famed course at some future date.

The outbreak, which has prompted a virtual shutdown of American sport, also forced Ridley to postpone the Augusta National women's amateur and youth drive, chip and putt national finals.

“Ultimately, the health and well-being of everyone associated with these events and the citizens of the Augusta community led us to this decision,” Ridley said. s“We hope this postponement puts us in the best position to safely host the Masters tournament and our amateur events at some later date,” he said.

Augusta National typically closes soon after hosting the world's top players, reopening later each year, so the possibility remains that it could be rescheduled later in the year, potentially after the 2019-20 USPGA season is complete given the schedule already booked through August.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/t095l3/article31063135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14TIGER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/augusta-masters-postponed/article31063136.ece
2,2020/03/13,Harika stays in seventh place,"Plays out a draw with Anna Muzychuk

Indian Grandmaster Dronavalli Harika drew with Ukraine’s Anna Muzychuk in the 10th round to remain seventh on the points table of the FIDE Women’s Grand Prix chess tournament here. Harika has five points.

The Indian No.2 and Anna Muzychuk played out the draw in 31 moves in a Semi-Slav game late on Thursday. Also on five points with Harika are Mariya Muzychuk and Antoaneta Stefanova (Bulgaria).

Out of contention

Harika, who was in the lead in the middle part of the tournament, is out of contention for the top prize.

Defeats in rounds six and eight to Alexandra Kosteniuk and Antoaneta Stefanova respectively, have hurt the Indian’s chances after having picked up three points from the first four rounds.

Meanwhile, Georgian Nana Dzagnidze was joined at the top by Russian Alexandra Goryachkina. While Dzagnidze was held to a draw by Alina Kashlinskaya in the 10th round, Goryachkina humbled World champion Ju Wenjun in 36 moves.

The Chinese player had recently beaten Goryachkina to claim the world crown.

The results: (Tenth round): D. Harika 5 drew with Anna Muzychuk (Ukr) 5.5; Alina Kashlinskaya (Rus) 5.5 drew with Nana Dzagnidze (Geo) 6.5; Antoaneta Stefanova (Bul) 5 bt Anna Muzychuk (Ukr) 5; Zhansaya Abdumalik (Kaz) 6 bt Pia Cramling (Swe) 4; Alexandra Goryachkina (Rus) 5.5 bt Ju Wenjun (Chn) 4; Marie Sebag (Fra) 3.5 drew with Alexandra Kosteniuk (Rus) 3.5.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/harika-stays-in-seventh-place/article31063060.ece
3,2020/03/13,India needs to pay more attention to badminton doubles: Jwala Gutta,"Badminton player Jwala Gutta talks about the Indian badminton circuit, plans about her upcoming academy and her hopes for India from Olympics 2020

“We cannot have just two or three ace players and expect them to win all the medals. We are a population of a billion people, we have the capability to produce more players,” says badminton player, Jwala Gutta. The shuttler was in town to attend the silver jubilee celebrations of The Presidential School.

Talking to Metroplus, the Arjuna Awardee says that having more badminton academies is the need of the hour. “More academies will make the sport accessible to a larger group of people. This will also create healthy competition among the sportspersons and help them get better at the game,” she says.

The player is coming up with her own academy, Jwala Gutta's Global Academy for Badminton that is all set to open in a month’s time in Hyderabad. “Apart from singles, the academy will also focus on doubles game. India needs to pay more attention to doubles. Unfortunately, we prioritise singles game despite doubles being an important part of badminton. In doubles, game co-ordination and understanding plays a major role along with techniques and game plan. The co-ordination comes only if players are trained together,”adds Jwala who represented India in badminton doubles.

Speaking about her role at the academy Jwala says that she will oversee the running of the academy and play the mentor. “I cannot be a coach because I am not trained for it. I would rather put my efforts and expertise in ensuring that the best of facilities are available there,” says the 36-year-old.

A note of advice With over two decades of experience in badminton under her belt, Jwala advises the upcoming players: “There will always be shortcuts, and unfortunately they look very tempting. But nothing can make you a champion except hardwork. So be patient about the long training and practice sessions as that is the only way to ace your game.”

A resident of Hyderabad, Jwala has fond memories associated with Visakhapatnam. “I played my first ever nationals in this city when I was just 11 years old. After that, I have played several other tournaments here. Every time I came here, I would take long walks along the beach. It helped me calm down, especially days before the tournaments when I was under a lot of pressure,” she adds.

Jwala who retired from the sport almost two years ago, says that she is enjoying life at a slower pace now. “I have been playing since the age of eight or nine years old. Since then my routine has always been busy with academics and practice. My day used to begin at break of dawn but now I like waking up leisurely and spending time at home,” she says. Jwala spends her time catching up on web series and movies. “Currently, I am hooked to this Netflix series called Locke and key,” she adds.

Talking about the upcoming Olympics in Tokyo, she says that her hopes are pinned on PV Sindhu who might get home a medal.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/90zold/article31059295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VZJWALA-2,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/india-needs-to-pay-more-attention-to-badminton-doubles-jwala-gutta/article31059296.ece

7,2020/03/13,No work from home for Facebook contract workers: Report,"According to The Interceptor, many contract workers said that “contrary to statements to them from Facebook, they are barred by their actual employers from working from home, despite the technical feasibility and clear public health benefits of doing so”

In a somewhat discriminatory gesture, Facebook has reportedly banned its contractual workers (third-party content moderators) from work out of home, and has instead encouraged regular staff to avail themselves of work-from-home option amid new coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.

According to The Interceptor, many contract workers said that “contrary to statements to them from Facebook, they are barred by their actual employers from working from home, despite the technical feasibility and clear public health benefits of doing so.”

Facebook has hired contractors employed by Accenture and Wipro and most of those are content moderators.

These workers said they’ve been told that the only way they can stay home is by using the paid time off (PTO) days they’re allotted each year.

“Most people here are sick, coughing, and sneezing. The office ran out of Clorox wipes,” the workers were quoted as saying in the report on Thursday.

“One Accenture employee told The Intercept that their entire team of over 20 contractors had been told that they were not permitted to work from home to avoid infection.”

In fact, Facebook had to shut its Seattle office after one of its contractors tested positive for COVID-19. According to Tracy Clayton, a Facebook spokesperson, a contractor based in the Stadium East Office was diagnosed with coronavirus.

The social media giant has “strongly recommended all its workers in the Bay Area to work from home.”

According to a company spokesperson, “there is some work that cannot be done from home for content reviewers, some of this work must be done from the office for safety, privacy and legal reasons.”

“We’re exploring work-from-home options on a temporary basis, and have already enabled it in some locations,” the spokesperson was quoted as saying.

According to a post from an Austin Facebook contractor, Accenture “is only sending home people who exhibit flu-like symptoms in the workplace.”",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/hnyome/article31057715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13NETFACEBOOKHOME,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/no-work-from-home-for-facebook-contract-workers-report/article31057716.ece
8,2020/03/13,Coronavirus: Is your organisation ready for work from home in India?,"The availability of advanced digital tools allows a large number of organisations to implement work from home — if they plan well

As the coronavirus pandemic spreads rapidly across the world, more and more companies are embracing the work-from-home option for business continuity.

While Twitter has taken the “unprecedented step” of making work from home mandatory, e-commerce major Flipkart has encouraged young parents in Bengaluru to work remotely.

But are all organisations ready to embrace the work-from-home culture in view of the growing restrictions due to the spread of the virus?

Obviously not, especially those organisations whose nature of business demands a lot of travel and face-to-face interactions. An Ola or Uber driver would hardly be able to make money by sitting at home.

The availability of advanced digital tools, however, allows a large number of organisations to implement work from home — if they plan well.

Flipkart, for example said it is checking system preparedness for working remotely using digital/video tools.

“We are promoting the use of video conferences for meetings, including job interviews, and are temporarily avoiding events and training programmes that require large gatherings as a precautionary measure,” the e-commerce major said in a statement.

Some companies have even started mock drills to test their work from home capabilities.

Examples are fintech company Zeta and messaging and collaboration tool Flock.

Among the measures announced by the two companies include virtual on-boarding for outstation candidates and virtual interviewing and hiring to the extent possible with digitisation of some of their processes, including signing of employment contract, educational and awareness sessions on health and fitness through online mediums to ensure their health is not compromised even as they work from home, said Bhavin Turakhia, Founder and CEO at Flock and Co-founder and CEO at ZETA.

As a result of the measures introduced with the aim of restricting travel and face-to-face interaction in the face of dangers due to coronavirus, the demand for video-conferencing tools has gone up in India.

Networking giant Cisco said it has seen “significant growth” in the usage of its web conferencing and video-conferencing service Webex in India.

“Cisco has always prioritised the enablement of people to work from anywhere, any time, and on any device so they stay connected with their teams and can continue their business operations,” Cisco said in a statement shared with IANS.

“Since the outbreak began, there has been a 22x increase of traffic on the Webex backbone connecting China-based Webex users to their global workplaces. Significant growth in the usage of Webex in India has also been observed,” it said.

In light of the coronavirus outbreak, Cisco has expanded the capabilities on its free Webex offer in all countries where it is available.

“This comes with the additional features of unlimited usage (no time restrictions) and supporting of up to 100 participants,” the company added.

Google, earlier this month, said that in Hong Kong and Vietnam, where schools have already been closed, it has seen hundreds of thousands of students start using both Hangouts Meet, its video-conferencing tool available to all G Suite users, and Google Classroom, to join classes and continue their schooling remotely from home.

“And, as more businesses adjust their work-from-home policies and adopt reduced travel plans in response to COVID-19, we’re helping to ensure that all globally distributed teams can still reliably meet face to face, even if employees are not in the same location,” Javier Soltero, General Manager and VP, G Suite, said in a blog post.

Google has started rolling out free access to its advanced Hangouts Meet video-conferencing capabilities to all G Suite and G Suite for Education customers globally, including larger meetings, for up to 250 participants per call, live streaming for up to 1,00,000 viewers within a domain and the ability to record meetings and save them to Google Drive.

Typically available in the Enterprise edition of G Suite and in G Suite Enterprise for Education, these features will be available at no additional cost to all customers until July 1, Google said.

While making use of tools enabling remote working, cybersecurity should be on top of an organisation’s mind.

“We’re living in tricky times, so try not to let matters of public health cause the sort of friction that gets in the way of doing cybersecurity properly,” Paul Ducklin, Principal Research Scientist at Sophos, a Britain-based cybersecurity solutions firm.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/mgdml4/article31057674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13NETCORONAWORK,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/coronavirus-is-your-organisation-ready-for-work-from-home-in-india/article31057675.ece

Microsoft has cancelled its flagship developer conference ‘Build 2020’ in-person, scheduled to take place here from May 19-21.

The Microsoft Build will now be a digital-only event this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

New coronavirus cases in Washington State have surged to 457, including 31 deaths.

“In light of the health safety recommendations for Washington State, we will deliver our annual Microsoft Build event for developers as a digital event, in lieu of an in-person event,” Microsoft said in a statement to The Verge on Thursday.

Washington State Governor Jay Inslee has announced a ban on events with more than 250 attendees in King, Snohomish, and Pierce counties through the end of March.

Microsoft uses ‘Build’ conference, attended by over 5,000, to showcase new technologies and features for its Office and Windows products.

Microsoft has also cancelled its Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Summit in Seattle.

Several top-notch companies such as Google, Facebook, Oracle have either cancelled or postponed their annual flagship events in the wake of growing coronavirus cases in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Coronavirus cases in the U.S. have exploded by more than 500% in the past four days — from 213 confirmed cases on March 9 to 1,322 cases on Thursday.

10,2020/03/13,Online tools for teachers and students to hold virtual classes during the coronavirus pandemic,"As a growing number of countries are resorting to school and university closures, there are some online tools that educators and students can use to teach and learn virtually.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on Wednesday. Many schools, colleges and universities are closing down their premises to reduce the spread of infections. And many of these educational institutions are increasingly switching to online instruction.

Harvard University asked its students to not return after the spring break ending on March 23. It has asked students residing on campus to vacate in five days and to not return until the end of the semester. During this period, the Ivy League university plans conduct virtual classes.

Stanford University said in a statement that it will begin its spring quarter on time, but will use virtual learning instead of in-person classes. The reaction to COVID-19 is same across many campuses in the U.S. and several other countries.

Thirty-nine countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, north America and South America have announced or enforced school and university closures as on March 11, according to UNESCO. Twenty-two countries have closed schools nationwide, impacting about 37.23 lakh children and youth.

As a growing number of countries are resorting to school and university closures, there are some online tools that educators and students can use to teach and learn virtually.

Classdojo is a free educational app that enables teachers, students and parents to interact online. It allows teachers to create a virtual classroom in which they can share videos and pictures. An account on the app can be created only by the teacher. The student can access the virtual classroom with an access code sent by the teacher.

EkStep is an on-demand platform that allows educators to create, share and distribute free community-sourced educational content for K-12 class students. The app is loaded with several educational videos that students can access any time and learn in a self-paced way.

The patient from Kalaburgi also had co-morbidities such as asthma, hypertension and diabetes.

There was a contradiction in Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s speech in Lok Sabha on Wednesday where he said that the communal riots in Delhi was a “pre-planned conspiracy”.

14,2020/03/13,Apple iPhone 11 series hit with supply issues: Report,"According to KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc analyst John Vinh, Apple’s “iPhone sell-through was adversely impacted by supply issues” due to coronavirus, “particularly on the Pro/Max models and by lower foot traffic in outbreak areas.”

New Apple iPhones like iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Max are disappearing from retail stores, this time due to supply issues appearing after the coronavirus pandemic amid less footfall.

According to KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc analyst John Vinh, Apple’s “iPhone sell-through was adversely impacted by supply issues” due to coronavirus, “particularly on the Pro/Max models and by lower foot traffic in outbreak areas.”

The stores have been running out of iPhones for some weeks now and they have no idea when the new stock will arrive, reports Seeking Alpha.

Apple shares were down nearly 5.5% pre-market to $260 on Thursday.

According to a New York Post report last week, wireless retailers have either run out of stock or are running low on iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro models.

“Employees at numerous retail locations around Manhattan contacted by The Post uniformly told the same story of low stock and infrequent shipments,” said the report.

“We got a shipment and it didn’t have any iPhones in it a” just flip phones and Samsungs,” a Verizon store employee on the Upper West Side in New York was quoted as saying.

There is, however, cautious optimism that the worst of the “outbreak in China” is now past.

Factories are beginning to ramp up production slowly, though many are still below normal capacity at this time of year.

Apple supplier Foxconn said it is running at about half its normal low-season capacity — this equates to about 25% of full capacity, according to Counterpoint Research.

While factories are anxious to ramp up production, they’re also being careful that labour-intensive work does not rekindle viral outbreaks.

Rumours have also been circulating for several weeks that Apple will delay the launch of the yet to be named lower cost iPhone.

This is to be the successor of the iPhone SE, built around the same form-factor as the iPhone 8 series (SE2 or iPhone 9).

“Problems with the launch were initially thought to be because initial volume ramps could be delayed due to Foxconn’s inability to start production,” said Peter Richardson, Research Director, Counterpoint.

Travel restrictions on Apple’s engineers flying to China to supervise pre-production testing might also be a factor.

And if all these were not problematic enough, just holding a launch event at this time is difficult.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/14njx4/article31057141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13NETAPPLEIPHONE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/apple-iphone-11-series-hit-with-supply-issues-report/article31057142.ece
15,2020/03/13,Apple reopens all 42 retail stores in China,"The tech giant had closed all retail stores China from February 1 based on the advice from leading health experts

As the novel coronavirus situation improves in mainland China, Apple has reopened all its 42 retail stores in the country.

The tech giant closed all retail stores in the country from February 1 based on the advice from leading health experts.

It aimed to reopen stores on February 9 but that date ended up being extended.

The closure of Apple’s retail stores in China, along with supply issues, has affected iPhone sales in the country.

China on Thursday declared that the peak of the coronavirus epidemic has passed, a day after the World Health Organisation (WHO) announced the outbreak as a pandemic.

Thanks to arduous endeavours, China has been witnessing a domestic trend in which the situation of epidemic prevention and control is making sustained progress and the order of life and production is being restored at an increasing pace, according to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Meanwhile, reports said that the supply issues has hampered new Apple iPhones like the iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Max, which have disappeared from retail stores in the U.S.

16,2020/03/13,Face it: The Internet is a very rude place. It always has been,"The kind of harassment that public figures face on social media is frightening

Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the race for the U.S. Presidential elections — arguably the slowest race of all time — last week, leaving her online supporters in a moral quandary. While Warren was busy unwinding by appearing on Saturday Night Live, the kooky comedy sketch show Americans seem to love so much, her supporters were tying themselves in knots trying to decide who to vote for. The argument being widely made against Bernie Sanders, despite his policies aligning the most with Warren’s (from whatever little I understand of the weird world of American politics), was that Sanders’s very vocal online support club was rude.

The Bernie Bros, as they’ve come to be called, have built up a reputation of being loud, self-righteous, obnoxious, and rather mean on the Internet — many of them spent the past few months referring to Warren and her flock as “snakes”. Like lawyers in a bar, Bernie Bros tend to be a bit much. And thus began yet another round of the great civility discourse. Is being polite necessary in politics? Is being mean worse than being morally on the wrong side of things? And on it dragged.

Circular squabbles

The navel-gazing around language is annoying, for starters, because it saddles the argument with red-tape. The debate is reframed. Concerns about foreign policy and public healthcare are then replaced by how civil and friendly a fraction of a candidate’s support base happens to be. Like when you know you’re right about something, but you accidentally call the other person an idiot, and the argument instantly flounders into farce.

More importantly, these circular squabbles ignore a fundamental premise: that the Internet is a very rude place. It always has been. It is anarchy, it is chaos, it’s lord of the flipping flies. Even the kindest, gentlest, purest souls will turn into absolute monsters online when someone insults their favourite film. Find an innocuous, wholesome recipe video on YouTube, scroll down, and in the comments, you’ll stumble on Salman Khan fans in a bitter fight with Hrithik Roshan fans, followed by an old-fashioned India vs. Pakistan showdown. A few years ago, the Twitter account of Chris Hoy, a British cyclist, would be inundated weekly with outlandish abuse by raging football fans angry at decisions made by an English Premier League referee named, well, Chris Foy. Somewhere in the recesses of the Internet, there are people fighting right now over whether gluten intolerance exists or not, and losing their minds over it.

Insult humour

Long before 24/7 social media, before old people discovered the Internet, kids used to prowl online discussion forums — usually around shared interests like film or music or sport — and pick fights with strangers. They would insult each other, call each other names, “roast” and “own” each other in elaborate, nonsensical “flame wars” over minor disagreements. Reddit became a centralised place for the disenfranchised in this way, while the truly dangerous people went to the worst place on the Internet, called 4chan. Insult humour — sometimes just insults, no humour — lies at the very heart of what the web is about.

To be clear, I’m not exactly a fan of the toxicity that’s so widespread online. It’s amusing from a distance (as long as I’m not at the receiving end), but I wouldn’t miss it if it disappeared overnight.

And, more seriously, the kind of harassment that public figures in India face on social media — especially if they’re women or from marginalised communities, and particularly if they speak out against the establishment, and specifically from right-wing supporters — is frightening. It’s terrifying to see how brazenly anonymous criminal threats are made on a daily basis. That’s the extreme version of it, where it spills over into targeted harassment and real-life danger.

At the core of it all lies a kind of dissonance. There was this vague set of dotcom rules that people followed if they felt like it, because the Internet was not actually “real life”. Everyone just shrugged at how angry and insufferable people were online. But then the Internet became very much a part of reality; everyone’s on it, literally, all the time. Its real-world implications are set against a fluid moral centre and an anarchic elasticity. In good times and bad, it remains philosophically untameable. And so we go around in circles, perpetually putting out new fires with a pichkari.

Asked during an interview why Hungary has closed its universities but not schools in response to the outbreak, Mr. Orban said it was because “there are lots of foreigners there”.

“Our experience is that primarily foreigners brought in the disease, and that it is spreading among foreigners,” he said.

So far, Hungary has confirmed 19 cases of infections, nine of them Iranians, one British national, and the rest Hungarians.

“It's no coincidence that the virus first showed up among Iranians,” he said.

“We cannot separate the tens of thousands of foreign students (in Hungary) from the Hungarian students, that's why we thought it best to stop all visits to those institutions,” he said.

South Korea saw its newly recovered patients exceed fresh infections for the first time on Friday, as it reported the lowest number of new cases for three weeks. The country confirmed 110 new infections, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said, taking its total to date to 7,979. But 177 fully recovered patients were released on Thursday, officials said.

Its stock market was caught up Friday in global economic concerns over the pandemic, with trading briefly halted on the Korea stock exchange for six minutes after the opening when the benchmark KOSPI index fell to 1707.90, down 6.8 percent or 126.43 points.

It was the second consecutive day that trading had been halted on the main bourse and the first time since 2011.

To curb speculative trading, Seoul's Financial Services Commission announced a six-month ban on short-selling of shares on the Kospi and Kosdaq.

President Moon Jae-in called for “unprecedented measures” to help the world's 12th-largest economy cope with the outbreak, describing it as “an emergency economic situation”.

The number of new cases in Daegu, the southern city at the centre of the country's virus spread, had declined “dramatically” along with those in neighbouring North Gyeongsang province, officials said.

So far, nearly 90% of South Korea's cases have been in the two regions.

22,2020/03/13,Civilian among 6 dead in U.S. strikes on Iraq,"Pentagon says it has retaliated for the rocket attack on a U.S. base that killed three

U.S. air strikes targeting pro-Iranian military factions in Iraq killed one civilian and five security personnel early on Friday, the Iraqi military said, warning that the raids risked a bloody escalation for the war-battered country.

The Pentagon said the strikes were in retaliation for rocket fire against an Iraqi base on Wednesday night that killed one British and two U.S. military personnel in the deadliest such attack in years.

The strikes battered positions belonging to both the Iraqi Army and the state-sponsored Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary network.

Among them were areas controlled by Kataeb Hezbollah, a hardline Hashed faction that the U.S. has blamed for several attacks on foreign troops in Iraq.

The Iraqi military said its preliminary death toll from the air strikes was three Iraqi soldiers, two policemen and one civilian working at an unfinished airport south of Baghdad.

There were no Hashed members among the dead but the toll could rise as some bodies were still stuck under the rubble, the statement said.

Hashed fighters were among 11 Iraqi fighters wounded in the bombardment, some of them critically. One civilian was also wounded.

The military warned the air strikes risked “escalation and deterioration of the security situation in the country, and exposes everyone to more risks and threats”

President Barham Saleh condemned them as a violation of the country’s sovereignty that could “slide Iraq into anarchy and chaos”.

In its statement, the Pentagon said the strikeswere “defensive, proportional and in direct response to the threat posed by Iranian-backed Shia militia groups who continue to attack bases” hosting foreign troops in Iraq.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qt1qaa/article31063151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13RDIRAQ1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/civilian-among-6-dead-in-us-strikes-on-iraq/article31063152.ece

25,2020/03/13,Hundreds take part in pro-democracy march in Bangkok,"Thais mourn current state of country

Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters marched in Bangkok on Friday, wearing black T-shirts to mourn the state of Thailand under an Army-aligned government, in the first street protest for several years.

Discontent with the administration of ex-Army chief Prayut Chan-O-Cha is seething, with a progressive Opposition party disbanded and the country’s economy faltering as the COVID-19 crisis batters the key tourism industry.

Thailand voted Mr. Prayut’s conservative government into power a year ago. It was the first election since a 2014 coup and held under an Army-scripted Constitution that critics say gave Mr. Prayut an unfair advantage.

The boisterous but peaceful “Black Friday” rally called for the government to quit. “Our families are grassroots people and we’re directly affected by government policy and the failing economy,” said a protester.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1zmbg5/article31062966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13RD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hundreds-take-part-in-pro-democracy-march/article31062967.ece

27,2020/03/13,European Union chief Ursula warns against unilateral coronavirus travel bans,"She spoke after the Czech Republic announced that it would ban all foreigners from entering the country and all Czechs from leaving as of Monday.

European Union Commission chief Ursula Von Der Leyen warned on Friday against imposing unilateral travel restrictions to fight the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic, as some member states have done.

She spoke after the Czech Republic announced that it would ban all foreigners from entering the country and all Czechs from leaving as of Monday.

Other member states including Austria, Slovenia and Hungary have suspended the rules of the passport-free Schengen travel zone and reimposed border checks, particularly with worst-hit Italy.

“Certain controls may be justified, but general travel bans are not seen as being the most effective by the World Health Organization,” Von Der Leyen said, calling instead for health screening at borders.

“Any measure that is taken must be proportionate. What we can do and what we should do is to carry out health screening measures.” Such tests could be carried out either at borders or within member state territory, she said.

Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson will present proposals on screening to a meeting of the 27 EU interior ministers later on Friday.

The European response to the virus has stepped up dramatically in the last 24 hours with several countries including France, Ireland and Belgium closing schools and universities.

Italy has imposed the continent’s toughest response to a pandemic that has killed 1,016 people and infected more than 15,000 in the peninsula in less than three weeks.

The government has shut all shops except for pharmacies and groceries in the hope of stemming contagion and easing the burden on Italy’s overstretched hospitals.

Von Der Leyen said the EU was also taking steps to deal with a shortage of protective equipment such as masks, after several countries including Germany and France abruptly banned exports to guard their own supplies.

“It is not good when member states take unilateral action, because it always causes a domino effect and that prevents the urgently needed equipment from reaching the patients, from reaching hospitals,” she said.

“Ultimately it amounts to reintroducing internal borders, at a time when solidarity between member states is needed.” She said that after talks, Paris and Berlin had relented and are now “willing to adapt their national measures, as we requested”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jndu4q/article31061680.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13IN-URSULA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/european-union-chief-ursula-warns-against-unilateral-coronavirus-travel-bans/article31061681.ece

The Czech government said on Friday that it would ban all foreign travellers from entering and all Czechs from leaving the country as of March 16 in a bid to stem the coronavirus (COVID-19) spread.

“As of midnight Sunday-Monday, we ban all foreigners from entering the Czech Republic and, at the same time, all Czech citizens from leaving the Czech territory,” Interior Minister Jan Hamacek told reporters.

“It’s a very tough measure but we think it may fundamentally contribute to stemming the spread of the coronavirus.” The measure does not concern foreigners with permanent residence or a residency permit for over 90 days in the EU member state, which has 117 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and no deaths.

The government also ordered a mandatory two-week quarantine for people coming to the Czech Republic from 15 “risk countries” as of Friday at noon, with the exception of transit travellers.

These countries include China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Great Britain, Denmark and France.

The government has also designated the act of spreading coronavirus as a crime, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said.

On Thursday, the Czech government declared a 30-day state of emergency.

It has also closed schools across the country, as well as theatres, cinemas, galleries and museums and banned gatherings of more than 30 people with the exception of funerals.

Restaurants will be forced to shutter from 1900 GMT to 0500 GMT and all gyms, swimming pools, clubs and libraries will also be closed to the public.

29,2020/03/13,"Coronavirus spreads across globe; toll crosses 5,000","Governments take emergency steps to contain the spread of COVID-19.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s wife, Australia's Minister for Home Affairs and a Chelsea football player are among new cases of the coronavirus that has infected at least 139,000 people and killed more than 5,000 worldwide.

Governments and central banks readied more emergency measures to tackle the economic impact of the coronavirus on Friday, while more major events were cancelled or postponed.

U.S. lawmakers and the White House neared agreement on a coronavirus economic aid package, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi saying she hoped to announce a deal on Friday.

Experts warn that due to a lack of testing and unreported cases, many more people may be affected by the outbreak that emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

Health authorities around the world face the prospect of services being overwhelmed.

“We're anticipating 20% of the population in the first wave to be affected,” Kerry Chant, the chief medical officer for the New South Wales (NSW) state government.

Home to more than 7 million people, NSW is Australia's most populous State, and Chant said models suggested 5% of the State’s population — some 350,000 people — would need hospital treatment as a result of coronavirus.

Australia has recorded nearly 160 infections and three deaths from the flu-like disease. Among the infected is one of its highest-profile government Ministers, Peter Dutton, who is in charge of Home Affairs. He said he was feeling fine.

Movie star Tom Hanks announced in Australia on Thursday that he and his wife, actress Rita Wilson, had both tested positive.

Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau said he would be in isolation for two weeks after his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, tested positive for coronavirus. She said she was “experiencing uncomfortable symptoms” adding that she would “be back on my feet soon”.

Canada has reported 145 cases of the virus, a three-fold gain from a week ago. There has been one death.

State of alert

Spain's government is to declare a state of alert over the rapid spread of the coronavirus, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Friday after infections soared over 4,200 with 120 dead. “There will be a cabinet meeting tomorrow to declare a state of alert across the country for a period of 15 days,” Mr. Sanchez said.

A host of major sporting events were affected, with the Players Championship golf halted and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix scrapped. Nepal closed Mount Everest to climbers.

Calls grew in Britain for the Premier League season to be stopped with the news that Chelsea forward Callum Hudson-Odoi has tested positive. All of Chelsea's first-team players and coaching staff would self-isolate, the club said.

But the spread of the virus at its epicentre in China's Hubei province has slowed markedly.

30,2020/03/13,Pentagon: U.S. strikes Iran-backed group that hit Iraq base,"U.S. officials said multiple strikes by U.S. fighter jets hit five locations and mainly targeted Kataib Hezbollah weapons facilities inside Iraq.

The U.S. launched air-strikes Thursday in Iraq, targeting the Iranian-backed Shia militia members believed responsible for the rocket attack that killed and wounded American and British troops at a base north of Baghdad, the Pentagon said.

U.S. officials said multiple strikes by U.S. fighter jets hit five locations and mainly targeted Kataib Hezbollah weapons facilities inside Iraq. A Defense Department statement said the strikes targeted five weapons storage facilities “to significantly degrade their ability to conduct future attacks.”

The strikes marked a rapid escalation in tensions with Tehran and its proxy groups in Iraq, just two months after Iran carried out a massive ballistic missile attack against American troops at a base in Iraq.

They came just hours after top U.S. defense leaders threatened retaliation for the Wednesday rocket attack, making clear that they knew who did it and that the attackers would be held accountable.

“The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our interests, or our allies, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said. “As we have demonstrated in recent months, we will take any action necessary to protect our forces in Iraq and the region.

The Pentagon statement said the facilities hit in the precision strikes were used to store weapons used to target the U.S. and coalition forces. It called the counterattack defensive, proportional and in direct response to the threat posed by the Iranian-backed Shia militia groups.

U.S. officials said the locations of the strikes were largely around the Baghdad region. One U.S. official said there were two strikes at Jurf al-Sakher, one in Karbala, one at Al-Musayib, and one at Arab Nawar Ahmad. The official said the US expected casualties would be lower than 50, and said the main effort was to hit the weapons.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because some details about the operations had not yet been made public.

An official with the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units told The Associated Press that two Iraqi federal police personnel were killed in Jurf al-Sakher. An Iraqi military statement said the aerial “aggression” occurred at 1:15 am in the areas of Jurf al-Sakher, Al-Musayib, Najaf and Alexandria on the headquarters of the Popular Mobilization Units, emergency regiments and commandos of the 9th division of the Iraqi army.

Mr. Esper told reporters at the Pentagon earlier Thursday that President Donald Trump had given him the authority to take whatever action he deemed necessary.

“We’re going to take this one step at a time, but we’ve got to hold the perpetrators accountable, Mr. Esper said. You don’t get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it.

At the White House, Mr. Trump had also hinted that a U.S. counterpunch could be coming, telling reporters, “We’ll see what the response is. And Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters the US knows with a high degree of certainty” who launched the attack.

On Capitol Hill earlier in the day, Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie, the top US commander for the Middle East, told senators the deaths of U.S. and coalition troops created a red line for the U.S., but said he didn’t think Iran has a good understanding of where our red line is.

Asked if any counterattack could include a strike inside Iran, Mr. Esper said, We are focused on the group that we believe perpetrated this in Iraq. Two U.S. troops and one British service member were killed and 14 other personnel were wounded when 18 rockets hit the base on Wednesday.

The U.S. military said the 107 mm Katyusha rockets were fired from a truck launcher that was found by Iraqi security forces near the base after the attack.

U.S. officials have not publicly said what group they believe launched the rocket attack, but Kataib Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Shia militia group, was the likely perpetrator. And the U.S. strikes, which came in the middle of the night in Iraq, targeted that group.

Kataib Hezbollah was responsible for a late December rocket attack on a military base in Kirkuk that killed a US contractor, prompting American military strikes in response.

That in turn led to protests at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. They were followed January 3 by a U.S. airstrike that killed Iran’s most powerful military officer, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a leader of the Iran-backed militias in Iraq, of which Kataib Hezbollah is a member.

In response to the Soleimani killing, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on January 8, at al-Asad air base in Iraq, that resulted in traumatic brain injuries to more than 100 American troops.

McKenzie told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday morning that the killing of Soleimani and the increase in US troops and assets in the region has made clear to Iran that the U.S. will defend its interests there. He said the US has re-established a level of deterrence for state-on-state attacks by Iran.

However, he said: What has not been changed is their continuing desire to operate through their proxies indirectly again us. That is a far more difficult area to deter. On Thursday, Mr. Esper and Milley said they spoke with their British counterparts about the attack, but declined to provide details.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7o4q1v/article30240287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ESPERKB-9dec,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pentagon-us-strikes-iran-backed-group-that-hit-iraq-base/article31057998.ece

The latest drills were the fourth since late February.

Nepal on Friday suspended permits to climb Everest over the coronavirus pandemic, closing off the world's biggest mountain a day after China halted access from its side.

Nepal has halted climbing on all mountains in the country and stopped issuing tourist visas, Yogesh Bhattarai, Minister for Culture Tourism and Civil Aviation told AFP.

The Himalayan country earns millions of dollars a year from Everest permits.

Last year's spring window saw a record 885 people summit Everest, 644 of them from Nepal and 241 from the northern flank in Tibet.

The traffic-clogged season saw 11 deaths on the mountain, with at least four blamed on overcrowding.

34,2020/03/13,U.S. judge orders WikiLeaks source Chelsea Manning released from prison,"Prior to her recent incarceration for refusing to testify, Manning had served seven years in a military prison for leaking hundreds of thousands of U.S. military messages and cables to WikiLeaks.

Former U.S. Army soldier and WikiLeaks source Chelsea Manning was released from prison on Thursday on a judge's order after being held since May for refusing to testify in an ongoing U.S. investigation of WikiLeaks.

U.S. District Court Judge Anthony Trenga in Alexandria, Virginia, ordered Manning released because the grand jury hearing the case had concluded.

Alexandria City Sheriff Dana Lawhorne told reporters late on Thursday that Manning had been released from the Alexandria Detention Center.

Trenga rejected a request from Manning to cancel fines that he had imposed for her refusal to testify and ordered her to pay fines totalling $256,000.

A detention hearing for Manning scheduled for Friday was cancelled.

“Needless to say we are relieved and ask that you respect her privacy while she gets on her feet,” Manning's defense team said in an emailed statement.

On Wednesday, a spokesperson for Manning's defense team said Manning had attempted to commit suicide and had been taken to hospital, where she was recovering.

Spokesperson Andy Stepanian said that in spite of her imprisonment and the imposition of financial sanctions, Manning remained “unwavering in her refusal to participate in a secret grand jury process that she sees as highly susceptible to abuse.”

Prior to her recent incarceration for refusing to testify, Manning had served seven years in a military prison for leaking hundreds of thousands of U.S. military messages and cables to WikiLeaks, before being released on the order of President Barack Obama.

WikiLeaks, an internet-based “dead letter drop” for leakers of classified or sensitive information, was founded by Australian citizen Julian Assange in 2006.

Assange is being held in a London prison as British courts consider a request from U.S. prosecutors for his extradition to the United States.

With an iPad on a small tripod, Father Thomas Law of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church in downtown Hong Kong is broadcasting mass to worshippers to their homes via online streaming as a way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

The church was formerly packed during daily morning mass and on Sundays, but the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong has suspended mass and liturgies since Feb. 15 in line with government health guidelines promoting social distancing.

“It was a painful decision,” Father Law said.

“However, it was a faithful decision as we believe in God. God has given us the power to make sacrifices that make it a loving decision.”

Churchgoer Stephen Wong and daughter Amanda said they missed the community spirit but were thankful for the arrangement.

“In this situation I think it is still the best substitute because we cannot physically go to mass,” Mr. Wong, a career coach who has been working from home for weeks, said in his flat after attending the online mass.

Many churches in Hong Kong have taken their services online due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in the Chinese-ruled city, which has reported 130 cases and three deaths.

Similar arrangements have been made in Singapore and elsewhere at various churches, temples and mosques.

Pope Francis, holed up in the Vatican by Italy's coronavirus epidemic, held his first virtual general audience on Wednesday.

In Hong Kong, some funerals and weddings that have been booked before the outbreak are going ahead.

Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, is closing schools until April 5.

Quebec Premier Francois Legault is asking all people returning from travel abroad to self-isolate for 14 days. The measure will be mandatory for all government employees.

British Columbia’s health officer, Dr. Bonnie Henry, said the province is “strongly advising” people to not travel outside Canada, including to the U.S, and said anyone who chooses to do so should self-isolate for 14 days upon return.

""That means no trips to Disneyland, no trips to Paris or Berlin or Boise,” British Columbia Health Minister Adrian Dix said. “Anyone who chooses to travel outside of Canada must stay away from work or school or 14 days upon their return. That responsibility is what we owe to our fellow citizens.”

Canada has more than 140 confirmed cases, with one death - an elderly nursing home resident in British Columbia. The United States has had 40 deaths, with more than three-fourths of them in Washington state. As of Thursday afternoon, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported about 1,260 U.S. illnesses.

The rocket attack sparked fears of a fresh escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran.

While there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, which saw about 18 rockets land on the base, Washington has blamed Iran-backed factions from the Hashed al-Shaabi military network for recent similar violence.

“The strikes began at 1:00 am local time and are using various kinds of aircraft,” one of the sources said.

38,2020/03/13,Russia blocks website opposing Putin’s reforms,"The Russian leader proposed sweeping changes to the constitution allowing him to stay in power until 2036

Authorities have blocked net2020.ru, an Opposition website, that encouraged the public to speak up against constitutional changes that will allow President Vladimir Putin to extend his grip on power.

The Russian leader proposed sweeping changes to the constitution in January and this week agreed to a last-minute proposal to reset his constitutional term-limit clock to zero, allowing him to stay in power until 2036.

Russia's opposition groups led by top Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny had long accused the 67-year-old leader of trying to cling to power for life.

On Thursday, a website set up to protest the constitutional changes was blocked, an opposition activist said.

“The site of a campaign against introducing changes to the Constitution net2020.ru has just been blocked by Roskomnadzor,” Andrei Pivovarov said, referring to the state communications watchdog.

He said the watchdog pulled the plug on the website following a ruling of Moscow's Tagansky district court.

A court spokeswoman confirmed that the site had been blocked but declined further comment.

“Such nervous reaction means we are on the right track,” Mr. Pivovarov said.

He said the campaign dubbed “Nyet!” — which means 'no' in Russian — will continue.

Kremlin critics have called on the public to protest against changing the constitution even before the Russian president revealed his intentions in the speech in parliament on Tuesday.

More than 50,000 people have signed a “manifesto” saying the authorities were pushing through a “constitutional coup”.

Both chambers of Russian parliament backed the amendments that also include stipulations banning gay marriages and protecting “historic truth” about Russia's role in World War II.

The amendments will be put to a public vote on April 22.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rxg0yc/article31052762.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RUSSIANEMTSOV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/russia-blocks-website-opposing-putins-reforms/article31052763.ece

The far-right leader’s test results are expected Friday, Brazilian media reports said.

He cancelled a scheduled trip Thursday to the city of Mossoro, in northeastern Brazil, and his office said he had no other official events on his daily agenda.

Mr. Bolsonaro had previously sought to downplay the coronavirus outbreak, saying its severity had been “overstated.” The news came after Mr. Bolsonaro’s communications chief, Fabio Wajngarten, tested positive for COVID-19 after a trip to the United States last weekend during which both men met with the U.S. president at his Florida resort.

Wajngarten was photographed standing side-by-side with Mr. Trump.

But Mr. Trump said he was “not concerned,” and the White House said he did not need testing.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence “had almost no interactions with the individual,” Mr. Trump’s spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.

They “do not require being tested at this time,” she said, explaining that U.S. government guidelines do not recommend testing for people without symptoms.

Eduardo Bolsonaro, who also accompanied his father to the United States, said he was undergoing testing as well.

The Brazilian delegation also included Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo, who cut short a subsequent trip to Washington Thursday to return to Brazil. He would follow all current protocols on the virus, his office said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qhwq8o/article31055620.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRAZIL-CHINA-HEALTH-VIRUS-CORONAVIRUS-BOLSONARO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brazils-bolsonaro-tested-for-coronavirus-son/article31055610.ece
40,2020/03/13,Trump signs bill to help telecoms replace Huawei equipment,"This bill affects mostly small, rural companies, because the major U.S. network providers don’t use the Chinese equipment

President Donald Trump on Thursday signed into law a bill that provides $1 billion to help small telecom providers replace equipment made by China’s Huawei and ZTE.

The U.S. government considers the Chinese companies a security risk and has pushed its allies not to use Huawei equipment in next-generation cellular networks, known as 5G. Both companies have denied that China uses their products for spying.

The Federal Communications Commission has already voted to bar U.S. phone companies from using government subsidies for equipment from the two Chinese companies.

This bill affects mostly small, rural companies, because the major U.S. network providers don’t use the Chinese equipment.

The White House said that using untrustworthy vendors to build communications infrastructure threatens national security by exposing networks to actors who are potentially influenced by foreign entities.

The legislation creates a reimbursement program that small telecom providers can use when removing and replacing equipment manufactured by entities deemed to pose unacceptable national security risks. The bill is aimed at telecom providers with fewer than 2 million customers.

The administration will not risk subjecting America’s critical telecommunications infrastructure to companies that are controlled by authoritarian governments or foreign adversaries,” the White House said in a statement.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/fos82f/article30885456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21-Langa-TrumG4K75A2E93jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-signs-bill-to-help-telecoms-replace-huawei-equipment/article31054913.ece

Disneyland will close its doors beginning Saturday after California called for large gatherings to be canceled to slow the spread of coronavirus, the resort said Thursday.

The giant 100-acre (40-hectare) attraction in Anaheim is the second-most visited theme park in the world, drawing tens of thousands of visitors each day, but will remain shut at least until the end of March.

“After carefully reviewing the guidelines of the Governor of California’s executive order and in the best interest of our guests and employees, we are proceeding with the closure of Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure,” a statement said.

No cases of the virus had been reported at the resort, it added.

Disney will monitor the situation, and on-site hotels will remain open until Monday to give guests time to leave.

California Governor Gavin Newsom said Disney had “made the right call in the interest of public health and agreed to shut down their California parks.”

42,2020/03/13,Ban imports from Xinjiang: U.S. lawmakers,"Rights groups say as many as one million Uighurs and other minorities are held in camps in Xinjiang

Lawmakers in Washington have proposed a ban on most imports from China’s Xinjiang region, charging that goods produced by Uighur forced laborers were easily making their way into the United States.

The U.S. already bans products made through slavery, but with rights groups saying as many as one million Uighurs and other minorities are held in camps in Xinjiang, lawmakers said forced labor was interwoven into the region’s economy.

“These practices in Xinjiang are one of the world’s largest human tragedies. It remains unimaginable, frankly, that this is happening in 2020,” Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican sponsor of the bipartisan measure, told reporters on Wednesday.

Representative Jim McGovern, a Democrat who leads the Congressional-Executive Commission on China — which looks at human rights — said that witnesses, surveillance photos and leaked documents all showed the existence of forced labor.

“We know that many US, international and Chinese companies are complicit in the exploitation of forced labor involving Uighurs and other Muslim minorities,” Mr. McGovern said.

“Audits of supply chains are simply not possible because forced labor is so pervasive within the regional economy,” he said.

The act would ban the import of any goods from Xinjiang unless US Customs and Border Protection has “clear and convincing evidence” that no forced labor was involved.

Uighur activists say that China is conducting a massive brainwashing campaign in internment camps aimed at eradicating their culture.

Beijing says the camps are “vocational education centers” teaching Mandarin and job skills to steer “students” away from religious extremism.

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said at a regular press briefing Thursday that the U.S. should “stop using the human rights issue to interfere in China’s internal affairs.”

Xinjiang cotton reaches world

The commission also released an accompanying report on Wednesday said it had seen “credible reports” that goods involving forced labor have come into the United States, including textiles, cell phones, computer hardware, shoes and tea.

It listed a number of companies that allegedly benefited from forced labor, including fashion brands Calvin Klein and H&M, beverage giant Coca-Cola and Campbell Soup.

The Fair Labor Association, a collaborative that aims at protecting workers’ rights, said this week it was “deeply troubled” by reports of forced labor in Xinjiang and asked its affiliates to look at alternative sourcing options.

The association covers companies that were also listed as touched by forced labor from Xinjiang, including shoemakers Adidas and Nike.

One major source of concern has been cotton, as Xinjiang — like the American South two centuries ago — supplies the world.

Scott Nova, the executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, which monitors factories, said that China had made a concerted effort to turn the region into a global hub for cotton and yarn.

Of the 10 billion garments imported each year into the United States, around 20 percent are believed to contain at least some material from Xinjiang, Mr. Nova said at a panel of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.

Xinjiang cotton “feeds not just garment factories in China but factories around the world,” Mr. Nova said.

“For apparel brands and retailers, the risk of complicity in forced labor is enormous,” he said.

The Uighur Forced Labor Prevention Act, if approved by Congress, would also require the secretary of state to produce a report on whether coerced labor is taking place and outline steps to combat it.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized China’s treatment of minorities Wednesday as he released the State Department’s annual report on human rights.

“The CCP’s record in Xinjiang is the stain of the century,” Mr. Pompeo said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ifwz8a/article31052530.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MARCORUBIO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ban-imports-from-xinjiang-us-lawmakers/article31052531.ece

44,2020/03/13,New York Fed says to offer $1.5 trillion in cash this week,"Over the coming month, it will provide $500 billion a week of one- and three-month repos

The U.S. central bank announced on Thursday a massive increase to its cash injections into American financial markets to quell the growing uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The New York Fed, which has ramped up short-term funding to markets in recent days, said it will offer $500 billion in three-month funds called repurchase agreements or “repos” on Thursday and Friday, and $500 billion in one-month repos on Friday.

Over the coming month, it will provide $500 billion a week of one- and three-month repos.

That is on top of the at least $175 billion daily in overnight funding, and twice-weekly offers of at least $45 billion in two-week repos.

“These changes are being made to address highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak,” the New York Fed said in a statement.

The bank said operations “will be adjusted as needed to foster smooth Treasury market functioning.”

In was the third time this week the New York Fed has announced big increases in liquidity to help keep markets running.

Also read | Coronavirus: U.S. suspends travel from Europe for 30 days

“This is a full-blown crisis response operation, intended to make it abundantly clear that the Fed will not allow liquidity to dry up,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note.

The Fed uses the money market to keep the central bank’s policy interest rate ) the federal funds rate — in line with the desired range.

Financial institutions use money markets to borrow for very short periods, from one day to a year, a crucial function to keep the gears of the economy running.

The Fed last week made an emergency cut in the benchmark borrowing rate, lowering it by a half-point to 1.0-1.25% to boost confidence in the face of increasing concerns the spread of COVID-19 could impact the U.S. and global economies.

Economists say policymakers could deliver an even larger rate cut March 18 following the bank’s regularly scheduled two-day meeting, with some saying the level could be slashed to zero, where it was during the global financial crisis.

In addition to the moves to ensure markets have sufficient liquidity to operate amid the virus fears, the New York Fed said starting Friday it will buy longer term U.S. Treasury debt, rather than just 3- and 6-month bills.

It has been buying short term Treasuries at a rate of $60 billion a month since mid-October.

The Fed’s actions “should limit the damage,” Shepherdson said. “Now it’s up to Congress to fire the fiscal bazooka, the bigger and quicker the better.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vq16xq/article31053625.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FILES-US-BANK-RATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/new-york-fed-says-to-offer-15-trillion-in-cash-this-week/article31053626.ece

Brexit trade talks scheduled to be held in London next week have been cancelled due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, a joint EU-UK statement said.

“Given the latest COVID-19 developments, EU and UK negotiators have today jointly decided not to hold next week’s round of negotiations in London,” the statement said.

“Both sides are currently exploring alternative ways to continue discussions, including if possible the use of videoconferences,” it added.

The talks were set to be held in the British capital from March 18-20.

Around 100 European negotiators were due to travel to the United Kingdom from next Tuesday, where 590 cases of coronavirus were officially registered.

But according to the U.K. government, the number of infected people is probably between 5,000 and 10,000.

More than 20,000 people have been infected in Europe with the new coronavirus and 930 have died.

Britain on Thursday said up to 10,000 people in the UK could be infected with the novel coronavirus, as it announced new measures to slow the spread of the outbreak.

Also read | UK health minister tests positive for coronavirus

Government chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance said there were currently 590 confirmed cases but it was “much more likely we’ve got somewhere between 5,000 and 10,000 people infected“.

Britain was “about four weeks” behind the level of cases currently seen in Italy and other worst-hit countries in Europe, he added.

Mr. Vallance was speaking after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the outbreak, which has so far killed 10 people in Britain, “the worst public health crisis for a generation” and warned it would get worse.

“Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time,” he told a news conference at his Downing Street office.

He announced new measures to combat the rapid spread of the virus, recommending anyone with COVID-19 symptoms stays at home for at least seven days.

He also said schools will be asked to cancel foreign trips and elderly people or those in poor health were told not to go on cruise ships.

The move is designed to delay the peak of the virus to ease pressure on the state-run National Health Service, which is already stretched by winter flu outbreaks.

Stretching the peak over a longer period would mean “more beds and more time for medical research... so society is better able to cope”, Mr. Johnson added.

The British premier said further measures were likely in the coming weeks, including the possibility of cancelling mass gatherings such as sporting events.

UK health officials said most of the 5,000 to 10,000 people will not be aware that they have COVID-19 but it was clear the virus was circulating in the community.

Britain’s response has been criticised for not going as far as other countries, including Italy, which has seen towns and cities quarantined, schools and shops shut and travel banned.

Mr. Johnson has repeatedly insisted that hand-washing is the best defence against contracting the virus and maintained the government is being guided by his scientific advisers.

He reiterated Thursday that scientists advised against school closures, even as neighbouring Ireland shut all its schools, colleges, childcare facilities, and banned mass gatherings.

“Schools should only shut if they are specifically advised to do so,” he told reporters.

Separately, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the devolved administration in Edinburgh would recommend banning mass gatherings, including football and rugby, from Monday.

But Mr. Johnson and his advisers stopped short of following suit, saying the risk from crowds was lower than in smaller venues.

On Wednesday, a former senior official at Public Health England accused the government of complacency.

“If this now spreads the way it looks likely to spread, there will not be enough hospital beds and people will have to be nursed at home,” John Ashton told BBC television.

“We should have gotten a grip on this a month ago.” Mr. Ashton’s criticism follows that of the editor of The Lancet medical journal, Richard Horton, who accused Mr. Johnson and health minister Matt Hancock of “playing roulette with the public“.

ABC News called the Indian namaste, a ‘prayer-like gesture’ when Prince Charles used it recently during a public event, instead of shaking hands, as a measure advocated to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

As the tweet and accompanying video did the rounds on social media, it didn’t go down too well with Indian users, and finally Bollywood actor Raveena Tandon asked the channel to do their research properly, in response to the post.

Sharing the original ABC News tweet, Raveena stated, “It’s a “Namaste”. Do some homework @ABC.”

Just hours after her tweet, actor-singer Priyanka Chopra also posted a video of herself doing the ‘namaste’ on different public occasions and wrote, “It’s all about the Namaste. An old but also new way to greet people in a time of change around the world. Please stay safe everyone!”

48,2020/03/13,The conservationist and tree saver,"Transplanting trees is part of the tree conservation act, says Vijay Nishanth, Bengaluru’s tree expert referred to as a tree doctor who has at least 250 trees transplanted in several cities

Former chief justice MN Venkatachaliah once jokingly said in a gathering, “To think of Vijay Nishanth just as a tree lover is incomplete. Seeing his love for the woody perennials I strongly feel he must have been a beautiful tree in his previous birth. He is an urban conservationist who can hear the language of trees.”

In one exceptionally horrifying case a few years ago in Marathalli, someone had poisoned 17 trees that were blocking two hoardings. “The trees burned for 20 days before 14 of them succumbed. I was so speechless seeing them suffer, all I could do was shed tears silently at home,” says Vijay going emotional, although he managed to rejuvenate three of them. And what was his healing therapy? The first aid includes removing the poison by scrapping away the charred parts and applies a liquid bandage of beeswax and orange oil on their trunks. Vijay later celebrated rakhi with the ‘survivors’ last year.

Rampant illegal cutting, diseases and pollution-related stress that make trees sick and weak become Vijay’s patients. “Want to know the number of trees that I have saved? Even on a conservative estimate it would be around 1.5 lakh in the last 20 years amongst which I have transplanted nearly 250 until now,” says Vijay better known as Bengaluru’s Tree Doctor. Vijay shows photos of the before-and-after photos of sidewalks transformed by newly planted trees, and poisoned trees he’s brought back to life in several areas of the city.

Vijay believes every tree is valuable. Showing photos of some of the oldest trees at Bannerghatta Road that looked battered, he says, people are heartless, they drill holes and cause pain. Look at their withered innards and decades-old trunk shrinking with blows. Age, weather and human neglect are the reasons they don’t live even half their age. How can I keep quiet, I have to save crores of trees in my lifetime. That’s the best gift I can give to mankind,” he says.

Vijay who lost his parents even as a toddler grew up at Child Fun Association, a children’s home in Jayanagar. Mary Isaacs, the octogenarian who brought up Vijay moulded him to have a ‘complete personality’ as Vijay puts it. She even nudged him “to follow his dreams” when he wanted to step out of the engineering domain at BNMIT college in 2003. This helped him become an urban conservationist and animal rights activist who was used to identifying trees and picking up their fruits in his childhood.

Vijay worked as a volunteer for almost a decade at the Forest Cell of Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). That’s when he saw trees being cut off across Bengaluru and the worst was, there was no account of the number of trees being chopped. One day he said “how can we go on without having a track of it?”

Vijay gradually understood the need for a tracking mechanism to be in place. He quit engineering and joined a friend’s company when he got the time to concentrate on environmental issues. “I worked with a software company, which was into mapping houses. But I decided to use my friend S Shariff’s knowledge at the software company who developed an App that could help in the documentation process. I applied his ideas to track the trees that are being chopped through Vruksha.com for an online tree-mapping start-up,” he says. Vijay received financial assistance from Ravi Kumar, another co-founder.

Concurrently when Bengaluru was being transformed from a garden city to lap up brick and mortar he wanted to learn more about the know-how on healing trees. His mentorship with Harini Nagendra, an author and one of the city’s foremost tree experts, at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (Atree) helped him slide into the subject with more domain knowledge in 2011.

“We are too happy that Vruksha has completed 10 years now,” says Vijay who along with his friends initially tagged 115 trees in Jayanagar ward. They recorded and documented all the trees assessing them on the parameters of species, health condition, and height.

The Vruksha team mapped trees in Jayanagar, Byrasandra, and Pattabhiramanagar. The team recorded the images of trees on iPad. On the website, apart from pictures that denote every kind of tree recorded, Vruksha.com also recommends the options that can be planted on free spaces at different locations. The website also carries a list of endemic and exotic tree species.

Transplantations the key

According to the Karnataka Tree Preservation Act its not only planting and maintaining, but transplanting them which is key to conservation, says Vijay. While the tree man is the local hero, his transplanting work has extended to Hampi, Mysore, Nanjangud, Madhya Pradesh amongst other cities. “Not all species of trees can be transplanted. Mainly about 25 species are the best in the range and that includes Ficus, Peepal, Pongamia, Coppor Pod, Desi Badam, Behandi, and a few varieties of Mango with great difficulty,” says Vijay. To fight fungicides, bacteria and insecticides he uses neem and orange oil, beewax, Honge or Pongamia oil and castor oil apart from a variety of medicated soil depending on a case to case basis.

And on the tree front Vijay is working on recording the sounds of the trees! Elders always said, don’t chop trees, it hurts. So he thought trees should have an inbuilt voice that has to be tracked on record. “So with a special equipment that I imported from Europe called MIDI, I have started a project “Vriksha Dwani” where some trees in Bangalore Palace are being recorded. The equipment picks the electro magnetic variations and converts them into sound and records it for knowing the Dwani or sound,” explains Vijay who has worked on three tress out of the 50 he will take up. He has demonstrated the process to Maharani Pramoda Devi at the Palace.

Only in black

Vijay takes part on Ted talks, speaks to students in schools and colleges, addresses corporate houses and resident welfare associations and reaches out to villagers for advising them on the right plantations according to the demands of soil and climate conditions. As people wait for their ‘tree doctor to arrive” they are shocked to see a young man dressed in black jeans, black T-shirt and a thin black jacket with straight hair flowing over his forehead walking off his Honda Dio scooter. “I am always in black only because any other colour gets dirty as I am always in fields amidst tress,” he laughs.

Social causes

Recently Vijay’s fight against illegal quarrying in the hilly, deciduous forests of the Bannerghatta National Park has come in focus. He fought successfully to reinstate the no-night-traffic rule through Karnataka’s Bandipur forest area. He is also involved in projects to revive the city’s lakes and has volunteered with BBMP’s forest cell to stop illegal poaching and rehabilitate animals. Vijay is also a consultant for the Army at its lush Madras Engineering Group (MEG) campus in the city’s Ulsoor area where he revived 16 trees.

Vijay is also the earliest board member of the city’s high court appointed tree committee. He was part of the crowdfunded transplantation of two large trees — a banyan and a peepal — that were coming in the path of an elevated Metro line at the Bannerghatta Road-Jayadeva busy junction. “I was amongst the team with representatives from the Bangalore Metro, the BBMP’s forest cell, the residents of a building and an infrastructure company. We decided to transplant the two trees to the Arekere lake bed 4-kms away and they are in good health even now,” says Vijay.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/ya60zi/article31062476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12bgm-lead1VijayNishanthjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/tree-saviour-tree-doctor/article31062477.ece
49,2020/03/13,Lucknow is not just about nawabs and kababs: Madhavi Kuckreja,"The Punjabi woman who anointed herself navigator of Lucknow and its many-layered crafts, culture, and cuisine

When Madhavi Kuckreja moved to Lucknow from Karvi, a religious town in Bundelkhand, in 2004, she wanted to experience first-hand the immense cultural wealth of the Uttar Pradesh capital she had heard so much about, especially its array of handmade crafts.

But as she began to explore the city , she was left a little disappointed. She felt the city lacked a navigator, an instrument that connected the dots and showcased its culturally rich places and traditions. The cultural space felt stagnant: the programmes were mostly controlled by the State and the entire history of crafts was locked up in people’s sandooks (trunks), says Kuckreja.

“And there was so much to the city,” she recalls. “We explored the traditions of Muharram. And I found a very strange thing: for instance, how Basant used to be celebrated, but not any longer. People would tell us qissas (anecdotes) about traditions that endure. But not all of this was accessible, especially to the regular visitor.”

Rich diversity

Kuckreja then decided to introduce people to the cultural layers of Lucknow, and 13 years ago opened a crafts bazaar to showcase handicrafts the city was so famous for. Then was born the idea of the Mahindra Sanatkada Lucknow Festival, an annual cultural festival that showcases Awadh and Lucknow, its array of crafts, cuisine, art, tales, literary discourse and much more. Today, Sanatkada, meaning the ‘house of craft’, offers a glimpse into the rich diversity of culture and art in Awadh.

“I don’t know the ‘voila’ moment but we realised that [the festival should be] like a traditional mela (fair), and something the people can own and be involved with,” says Kuckreja, who is CEO of Sanatkada. The century-old Budakki ka Mela on the banks of River Gomti, was a model she wanted to emulate. “Everyone wants to eat, maro adda (gossip), dress up, watch a performance, shop, hear kahanis (stories) — and we knew that qissa goi (storytelling) would happen under the trees here,” she says.

So is she now the navigator for the city? “Yes. In a way. I was like the khoj (scout),” she replies.

The venues of the Sanatkada have been the Safed Baradari and the Salempur House in Lucknow, chosen as much for their proximity to the heart of the city as for their historicity and architectural splendour. The themes are based both on the pluralistic and inclusive traditions as well as the lesser-known thrills of the city: shama (candle), Basant, pehnava (clothes), bazaars, feminists of Awadh, Filmi duniya mein Awadh (Awadh in the world of cinema), Lucknow ki rachi basi tehzeeb (Lucknow’s composite culture) that breaks the Hindu-Muslim binary myth by showcasing Parsi, Chinese and Bengali traditions) and Francisi Awadhi ta'alluqaat (Awadh’s French connection).

This year, the festival theme was Awadh ke qasbati rang, the life and culture of the provincial Awadh, beyond Lucknow. If husn-e-karigari (the beauty of artisanship) showcases the crafts of the general folk, reha’ish (abode) is about affluence: bade logo ke bade ghar (the big homes of big people), as Kuckreja puts it. The nankhatai wala, barf ka gola wala (ice candy) and the sikke wala (coin seller) have been part of the festival from the days of the crafts bazaar Kuckreja launched.

The outsider

Kuckreja takes pride in the taur-tarike (manners and modalities), lihaaz (consideration) and the bariki (detailing) while looking at Awadh, be it food, embroidery or etiquette. Kuckreja has played a role in taking Lucknow beyond popular perceptions, pulling out visitors from the tourist circuit hovering around the Imambara and Nawabs, and exposing them to the people’s cultural roots and contemporary realities.“The myth we broke was that Lucknow was just about Nawabs and kababs,” she says.

While she jokingly admits that she continues to battle the outsider tag, ‘the Punjaban in Lucknow’, she nonetheless feels rooted in Lucknow, a city to which she is deeply linked through the feminist and cultural movements. “I mean, my tallaffuz (pronunciation) is always wrong. My adaabs are right and wrong and sometimes I get the jeete raho (a blessing) right. But the thing is, I feel rooted. I feel like I know more about the gali kochis (nooks and corners).” But what does it mean to be rooted? Kuckreja has a simple answer: rishtas or relationships, the inter-personal links she draws with everyday people. It could be the gali (street) rickshaw wala, who will ask where I want to go, she says.

In Lucknow, she also encountered the famed Ganga Jamuni tehzeeb but found that communal identities co-existed with traces of this syncretic culture. “I had heard a lot about the Ganga Jamuni tehzeeb. But when I came to the city in 2004, it had become very superficial. I could see a lot of polarisation,” she recalls.

For instance, she has been told she has ‘too many Muslims’ in her office. But then there is also this other side, stories of co-existence. In old Lucknow’s Chowk area, she observed that both Hindus and Muslims celebrate Dussehra and Muharram by leading elephants and horses in processions in a very similar fashion.

Then there is Rudauli, the town near Faizabad where a certain Gupta once performed nohas, the Shia lament during Muharram, and the Hindus of the entire village would wear green and peacock feathers and hold a parikrama (circumambulation) for Ali. Then one day Gupta could not find a page of his noha; he eventually discovered it hidden in his copy of the Gita. “That is also a reality, as is the polarisation,” says Kuckreja .

Over the years, lit fests have proliferated in many cities, pulling in corporate sponsorships and popular authors. The Mahindra Sanatkada Lucknow Festival is dedicated to industrialist Anand Mahindra’s mother, who was from Lucknow. An emotional connect is important for any lit fest, or else it gets reduced to just another event, Kuckreja says, but adds quickly that she is not an event organiser. “I’m a social cultural activist,” she says.

50,2020/03/13,Millstone birthdays,"An expert’s guide to surviving surprise parties, speeches and screen time

I crave the old days. And by that I don’t mean when Arnab hadn’t yet said his first words. I mean when you wore fur and bark, lived in a cave, and your mate roasted the giant rodent you’d clubbed to death over a wood fire while you inhaled mellowing herbs.

Because all we lived to those days was 30. If we were lucky. Making it 50 fewer birthday parties to attend per moron-friend.

If the mandatory sangeet and uncoordinated dancing of pot-bellied males wearing sherwanis fashioned out of furnishing material (at every wedding!) is my pet hate, attending the grand birthday bash of same pot-bellied males wearing hakoba shirts with decrepit rear-cleavage playing peek-a-boo from their slim-fat (slam-fit?) trousers is a close second.

Not a month (even one when virus deaths are peaking) goes by without the frantic offspring or hapless wife of some guy celebrating a milestone birthday — Fatuous Forty, Foetid Fifty or Somnolent Sixty — sending you a balloon-and-champagne-spangled invite.

And it is always a surprise party! (Why?) And there’s always a dress code: wear black lederhosen and an underwire bra with a fluorescent-green surgical mask (this for the men).

Every guest who has shoehorned himself into a floral Hawaiian shirt for the night is expected to make a moving speech about the birthday boy, as he beams proudly at the bar counter in a purple tuxedo and lime-green cummerbund holding a piece of half-eaten lollipop chicken.

What does one say about a waste-paper merchant (no offence to the profession) who has inherited the business from his father, a moneylender, who in turn took it off a guy who didn’t make three months’ interest? Yes, Birthday Baby has been playing Tambola every evening for 40 years with the same set of friends. And his waist size, much like the universe, has been expanding indefinitely. And he did pass high school, finally, with flying colours... with a little help from the headmaster, his former classmate. But there’s only so much poetry you can bring to these achievements in a speech.

I have found a way out. For now. When my turn to speak comes, I take the mic and pretend to be so overcome by emotion that I’m speechless, at which point my wife (pre-bribed for the task) jumps in and says, “Krishna is too overwhelmed by this, sorry... Too many memories,” and escorts me out for fresh air as the Birthday Boy, overwrought by sentiment, weeps into his whisky glass.

This is a good way to miss what comes next: the mandatory audio-visual mini biopic of the guy’s life. How much action, sentiment, suspense and drama can even James Cameron bring to a montage of half-a-century’s worth of photographs of a man whose nickname is thoongu moonji? Even with ‘The Final Countdown’ and ‘Eye of the Tiger’ as background score?

But the last one turned out a bit different. As I stood outside waiting for the son to finish his hip-hop-style rendition of ‘Ammavum Neeye Appavum Neeye’, I saw that I had a surprise companion: Birthday Boy’s wife of 31 years.

“Listen,” she said. “Our place, Saturday, okay?”

“Wait, today is Thursday,” I looked at my watch. “Actually, Friday, it is past 12. So you mean tomorrow?”

“Yes,” she said. “It’ll be an intimate gathering. Just 10 couples.”

“What’s the occasion?” I gulped.

“Watching the three-and-a-half-hour video... with background music, SFX ... and director’s (meaning, moi) commentary of this event, silly,” she said. “Wear black. It is going to be a riot!”

51,2020/03/13,‘Flight services plunged on COVID-19’,"In China, there are only 3,000 flights a day against normal 15,000 departures

A top level executive of Boeing on Friday said there has been a steep reduction in flight operations by airlines in the Asia Pacific region following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

This is pattern that is likely to be seen in the Europe and the U.S. under the impact of COVID-19, Darren Hulst, vice-president, commercial marketing, The Boeing Company, said here.

Wither away

He, however, was hopeful of the COVID-19 impact on the aviation industry withering away towards the end of the year.

Mr. Hulst, during a media interaction at Wings India 2020, said there had been a 50% reduction in daily flights in the Asia Pacific region. “In mainland China market in normal times, there are 15,000 departures a day and at the peak of the virus, they were operating 3,000 flights a day,” he said.

“If you exclude China, rest of Asia Pacific, probably, 5,000 flights are operated a day. At one point, we saw 2,500,” he said, pointing out that these were rough estimates. As the virus spreads to other markets, “we see airlines in Europe and the U.S. taking action in terms of cutting capacity. It is demand driven and policy driven,” he said.

Speaking on the Boeing operations in India, Salil Gupte, president, Boeing India, said the company spent $1 billion every year in India on sourcing components from 200 suppliers. The goal is to grow that to $2 billion a year, he said. Manufacturing, he added, was a big part of the work Boeing did in India with small and big manufacturers.

A release said the suppliers manufacture high-end systems and components for some of Boeing’s most advanced products as part of its global supply chain. These include critical components such as aerostructures, wire harness, composites, forgings, avionics mission systems and ground support equipment.

The partnership between India and Boeing had grown over the last 75 plus years, with 3,500 people in India and more than 7,000 people working with its over 200 supply chain partners.Boeing forecasts India to be the third largest global market for commercial fleet. The “aviation market is resilient and the market will grow throughout 2020.

52,2020/03/13,Auto wholesales plunge in Feb.,"19% drop stems from slowdown, transition to BS-VI: SIAM

Wholesale vehicle sales in the country declined by a little more than 19% in February 2020, as consumer sentiment remained subdued amid economic slowdown and upcoming transition to BS-VI norms, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said on Friday.

“The automobile industry continues to face hardships due to a steeper decline in production and wholesale dispatches in all segments in February 2020,” said Rajesh Menon, director general, SIAM.

Vehicle sales across categories stood at more than 16.46 lakh units in February 2020 versus more than 20.34 lakh units in February 2019, according to SIAM data. Rajan Wadhera, president, SIAM, added, “The decline in wholesale dispatches is primarily due to the economic slowdown and lower production of BS-IV vehicles.” He also warned that supply chain disruptions from China was additional cause for concern and may hit production plans of companies, going forward.

Domestic sales of passenger vehicles ( including cars, vans and utility vehicles) dropped 7.61% in the last month to over 2.51 lakh units from more than 2.72 lakh units. The data showed that car sales were down 8.77% to about 1.56 lakh units while that of vans was lower by 32.76% at 11,880 units. However, sales of utility vehicles were almost flat at 83,351 units.

Total two-wheeler sales in February fell by 19.82% to more than 12.94 lakh units compared with over 16.14 lakh units in the same month last year. While motorcycle sales tumbled 22% to 8.16 lakh units, scooter sales dipped 14.27% to 4.22 lakh units. Sales of commercial vehicles were down by almost 33% to 58,670 units against 87,436 units sold in the same month last year.

Companies dispatched 35,245 units of light commercial vehicles, down 28%, and 20,425 units of medium and heavy commercial vehicles, a fall of over 40%.

On Thursday, Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) had said that the retail sales — as measured by vehicle registration numbers — grew 2.60% to over 17.11 lakh units in February 2020. While sales of passenger vehicles declined by 1.17% to over 2.26 lakh units, that of two-wheelers and commercial vehicles were up 1.52% to 12.85 lakh units and 13% to 92,805 units, respectively.

Mr. Wadhera said some upside on the registration numbers can be attributed to last minute purchase by customers trying to advance purchase of BS IV vehicles.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/6r3axp/article31063522.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBURAJAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/auto-wholesales-plunge-in-feb/article31063523.ece
53,2020/03/13,Rupee rebounds after RBI intervenes,"Central bank assures adequate liquidity support

The rupee made a sharp recovery after touching a record low of 74.50 a dollar in early trade following intervention and assurance of liquidity by the Reserve Bank of India.

The rupee opened weak at 74.39 a dollar compared with the previous close of 74.24 and then touched the day’s low of 74.50. The previous record low was on October 9, 2018 when the rupee closed the day at 74.39 a dollar.

On Friday, the rupee closed the day at 73.80 a dollar, up 44 paisa from its previous close.

The turbulence in the financial market steered the central bank into making a statement, saying it would take steps to ensure adequate liquidity and that the situation was being monitored closely.

Markets around the globe are facing volatility due to risk aversion; investors are holding liquidity even as COVID-19 keeps spreading. Trading was halted in the domestic equities market after hitting their lower circuits on Friday.

“The Reserve Bank of India is closely and continuously monitoring the rapidly evolving global situation and will take all necessary measures to ensure that money, debt and forex markets remain adequately liquid and stable, and continue to function normally,” the RBI said.

On Thursday, the RBI announced that it would open a six-month dollar sell-buy swap window to pump in liquidity in the foreign exchange market. The central bank will conduct U.S. dollar-rupee sell-buy swaps worth $2 billion on March 16, to ‘begin with,’ in its effort to fight market volatility.

The central bank observed mismatches in the U.S. dollar liquidity had become accentuated across the world but added that the level of foreign exchange reserves remained at comfortable levels to meet any exigency. Latest data released by the RBI showed the country’s foreign exchange surged $5.69 billion to reach an all-time high of $487.23 billion in the week to March 6 due to an increase in foreign currency assets.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/qqvvfn/article31063520.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBURUPEE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/rupee-rebounds-after-rbi-intervenes/article31063521.ece
54,2020/03/13,Four private lenders join Yes Bank rescue,"ICICI Bank, HDFC to invest ₹1,000 crore each in troubled bank

Private sector lenders, including ICICI Bank and HDFC, will pick up stake in the troubled private sector lender Yes Bank.

While ICICI Bank and HDFC said they would invest ₹1,000 crore each in Yes Bank for about 5% stake each, Axis Bank pegged its investment at ₹600 crore and Kotak Mahindra Bank at ₹500 crore.

The board of State Bank of India’s (SBI) had cleared an investment of ₹7,250 crore to pick up up to 49% stake in Yes Bank.

In a notification to the stock exchanges, ICICI Bank said its board had approved an investment of up to ₹1,000 crore, comprising up to 100 crore equity shares at a price of ₹10 per share, under the proposed Scheme of Reconstruction of Yes Bank.

“This investment is likely to result in ICICI Bank holding in excess of 5% shareholding in Yes Bank, with the final shareholding to be determined based on the final scheme of reconstruction and share issuance,” ICICI Bank said. Similarly, HDFC also announced an investment of ₹1,000 crore for over 5%, while adding that the investment would be completed by March 31, 2020.

Axis Bank said it would acquire 60 crore equity shares of Yes Bank for a total cash investment of ₹600 crore for less than 5% stake.

Amitabh Chaudhry, MD & CEO, Axis Bank, said, “The overall banking and financial system in India continues to remain resilient, even as the global economy is facing some challenges. Axis Bank strongly believes in the long-term prospects of the banking industry in India and we are happy to have an opportunity to contribute to the stability of the system.”

Kotak Mahindra Bank will invest ₹500 crore for 50 crore shares.

Yes Bank has been put under moratorium with deposit withdrawal capped at ₹50,000. The banking regulator had put out a draft plan for the reconstruction of the bank with SBI picking up up to 49% stake, of which 26% will be locked in for three years.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/f7uo7d/article31063511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THBUAXIS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/four-private-lenders-join-yes-bank-rescue/article31063513.ece
55,2020/03/13,Blue-chips gain colour as bourses turn course,"Banking majors among top gainers

While Friday turned out to be the most volatile day for Indian stock markets with the benchmark Sensex trading in a range of nearly 5,400 points and the Nifty hitting the lower circuit of 10% before closing with a gain of nearly 4%, stock- specific action saw many blue-chips gaining over 20% compared to the day’s lows.

Banking majors such as IndusInd Bank, Bank of Baroda, State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank were among the top gainers in the BSE 100 index, comprising top 100 companies as per market capitalisation.

While IndusInd Bank gained a little over 46% compared to its day’s low, SBI, PNB and BoB gained between 30% and 39%.

IndusInd Bank touched a low of ₹550.05 before closing at ₹804. Similarly, SBI, which enjoys a high weightage in the Sensex as well, closed at ₹242.25 after touching an intraday low of ₹184.25, a gain of over 31%.

Meanwhile, the Sensex, which had touched a low of 29,388.97 during the morning session, touched a high of 34,769.48 before closing at 34,103.48, up 1,325.34 points or 4.04%.

The broader Nifty settled at 9,955.20, gaining 365.05 points or 3.81%. Interestingly, the market was abuzz with talks that Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) was among the major buyers in the market as most of the banking stocks were currently available at 52-week low levels.

“LIC is a long-term investor and banking is one of the favourite sectors of the State-owned insurance entity,” said a dealer.

“Most of the stocks are at their multi-year lows and hence, quite attractively priced at the current valuations. For a long term investor like LIC it only makes sense to buy at these levels,” he added.According to provisional data, domestic institutional investors that include banks and insurance companies were net buyers at almost ₹5,900 crore.

Apart from banking majors, stocks like Tata Steel, LIC Housing Finance, BPCL, HPCL and GAIL India also gained between 26% and 29% in intraday trading.

The intraday reversal in price movement could be further gauged from the fact that all the stocks in the BSE 100 index, which were significantly down during the morning session, ended with gains as the session came to an end.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/blue-chips-gain-colour-as-bourses-turn-course/article31063502.ece
56,2020/03/13,Bulls quarantine bears,"LIC-led domestic buying stems carnage, foreign investors on binge sale

Investors thought it would be a Black Friday as the barometer Sensex yo-yoed 5,400 points and the Nifty hit the lower circuit breaker of 10% as trading ground to a halt, albeit temporarily. But the markets sprang a surprise, ending in the green.

The Sensex, which had touched a low of 29,388.97 during the morning session, rebounded to a high of 34,769.48 before closing at 34,103.48, up 1,325.34 points or 4.04%. The broader Nifty settled at 9,955.20, gaining 365.05 points, or 3.81%.

In fact, minutes after start of the trading session, the Nifty’s plunge to a low of 8,555.15 led to suspension of trading in both exchanges for 45 minutes.

Sector heavyweights and bluechips such as TCS and State Bank of India were all trading more than 10% lower as the markets hit their lower circuit for the first time in 12 years. The resumption of trading, however, saw buying support for stocks, most of which are currently trading at their 52-week lows on account of growing concerns over the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Incidentally, the India VIX index, which had more than doubled in the recent past, surged by another 25% on Friday. The recovery in the markets was primarily led by strong buying by domestic institutional investors led by LIC as the net buying by such entities was pegged at almost ₹5,900 crore on Friday as per BSE data.

Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) continued selling shares in huge numbers with the day’s off-loading totalling ₹6,027.58 crore. On Thursday, they were net sellers at almost ₹3,500 crore.

COVID-19 fears

“Concerns on the spread of COVID-19, especially in the EU and the resultant impact on travel, tourism and business has impacted sentiment leading to high FII selling in Indian equity markets,” said Chandraprakash Padiyar, senior fund manager, Tata Asset Management. He added the markets seemed to be closer to the bottom of the current correction phase.

The COVID-19 outbreak and its spread across the world was a key area of concern for governments, corporates and citizens globally and Nasscom and the technology industry was fully committed to deploy the necessary precautions required to deal with this situation, said the industry apex body on Friday.

In accordance with Nasscom recommendations, the Department of Telecom and Ministry of Telecommuncation have decided to grant a slew of relaxations around work-from-home (WFH) for a period upto March 30, 2020.

“Business continuity and employee safety remains our key priority as an industry. The industry is also putting in place contingency measures and leveraging technology to ensure business continuity for customers and employees,” said Nasscom.

As part of safety measures, companies are allowing their employees to work from home wherever it is possible. Measures are taken to deploy technology solutions and online collaboration tools for business interactions, client meetings and internal workouts, so that travel is reduced to the maximum. Companies are also enhancing workplace sanitation and effective monitoring of food provided to employees.

“Employees who are even slightly unwell or unable to work or are showing any suspected symptoms, are advised to take all necessary caution with regular medical check-ups. These employees are advised to not be in physical contact with others and only be connected for work from their homes if required, as per Nasscom.

“Based on discussions with our members, we do not see any immediate business impact; however, we are following developments around this issue closely. The industry has a large footprint of on-shoring centres / offshore and client requirements can be met through such centres, if required. The industry has also put in place business continuity plans and has internal taskforces to monitor the situation continuously,” said Nasscom.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/covid-19-nasscom-bats-for-work-from-home/article31063483.ece

The Union Cabinet on Friday approved a reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank, as proposed by the Reserve Bank of India, under which the State Bank of India (SBI) will acquire 49% stake in the ailing bank.

“The Cabinet has approved the reconstruction scheme for Yes Bank as was proposed by the RBI. The decision to provide a reconstruction scheme keeps at its core the protection of depositors’ interest, keeps at its core providing stability to Yes Bank, and also keeps at its core keeping a stable financial environment, banking system,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at a press conference after the Cabinet meeting.

Sharing key features of the restructuring plan, the Finance Minister said SBI would invest up to 49% of the equity in the crisis-ridden bank. “Other investors are also being invited, and quite a lot of engagement by the RBI is happening to bring in other investors.”

Ms. Sitharaman said there would be a three-year lock-in period for SBI, but only for up to 26% of investment by them. For other players too, the lock-in will remain at three years. However, it will be for 75% of their investments.

Additionally, “The authorised capital itself has been raised from ₹1,100 crore to ₹6,200 crore, so that we can accommodate immediate and also subsequent raising of capital requirements,” she said.

The Minister added that further details of the plan would be available in the notification, which would happen as soon as possible.

60,2020/03/13,‘Centre monitoring virus situation along with RBI’,"Serious repercussions felt globally, says Finance Minister

Amid intense volatility in the financial markets due to concerns over the impact of COVID-19, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday said that the government, along with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), was conscious of the developments and was monitoring the situation almost on a daily basis.

The statement came at a time when the stock markets plunged over 10% in the opening session on Friday as the virus-led recession fears triggered panic selling.

“The Government of India is in touch with various departments concerned, and also State governments, and has been continuously monitoring the coronavirus [situation] and making sure that effective, timely steps are taken to take care of Indian interests and also ensuring that Indians who travelled abroad are tested, monitored,” the Finance Minister said.

Replying to a query at a press conference, Ms. Sitharaman said, “As it is, global markets have all had severe volatility. And we are also consciously monitoring all of them. It’s no consolation to say that stock markets elsewhere have also suffered. I’m conscious of that. But globally, there is [such] serious repercussion felt; we are conscious of the developments and together with RBI we are monitoring.”

The Minister added that she had already held meetings with all the industries concerned to address challenges that are arising due to the outbreak of COVID-19, and the government departments are now spending a lot of time to see how best they could get relief from the challenges.

“So, we are seized of the matter and we are on an almost daily basis monitoring this,” she added.

Asked about the possibility of a fiscal stimulus, the Minister said, “As regards the kind of stimulus or response that we have to give for the coronavirus related matter, you’re fully aware that the interaction and engagement with these sectors through the department concerned is happening almost on a daily basis. So, we are trying and will also see where each of the departments will have to make some intervention. So yes, we are moving on that front.”

Replying to a query on a Budget proposal that lowered the threshold for being deemed a resident of the country to 120 days in the backdrop of travel restrictions due to COVID-19, the Minister said she had received a lot of inputs on this from the various cities that she had visited with officials of the Ministry of Finance. “We will consider the inputs that we’ve received.

I am conscious of that but globally there is a serious repercussion felt and we are conscious of the developments. Together with RBI we are closely monitoring,” she told reporters.

After being battered in the early session, the BSE Sensex spurted 1,325.34 points and the NSE Nifty rose 365.05 points to end in the green.

Indian markets saw their biggest intra-day sell-off in early session on Friday, wiping off nearly ₹12 lakh crore of investor wealth in less than 20 minutes of opening trade.

As coronavirus-led recession fears triggered panic selling globally, both Sensex and Nifty plunged over 10% in the opening session, hitting their lower circuit levels.

Stock exchanges halted trading for 45 minutes. Normal trading resumed at around 1030 hours. The last circuit freeze happened in January 2008.

On coronavirus, the Finance Minister said the Centre is in touch with the States and has been continuously monitoring the situation.

It has been made sure that effective timely steps are taken to safeguard Indian interests and also to ensure that Indians who travelled abroad are tested and monitored, she said. Where necessary and wherever possible, they are being brought back to the country, she added.

“You are aware I had held a meeting with all the industries concerned to address issues which are coming out of the challenge of the coronavirus and for them each department has been now spending a lot of time to see how best they can give relief from the challenges that they are facing. So we are seized of the matter and we are almost on a daily basis monitoring the situation,” Ms. Sitharaman added.

Replying to another related query, she said different sectors of the economy are engaging with the departments concerned almost on a daily basis.

“So we are trying to attend to the requirement of the industries and also see where each department will have to make an intervention where it is related to their own activities. So yes we are moving on that front,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

The RBI has already announced steps to infuse liquidity in the foreign exchange market.

63,2020/03/13,Govt. extends deadline to bid for Air India till April 30,"The changes are in view of the requests received from the interested bidders and the prevailing situation arising out of coronavirus

The government on Friday extended the deadline for submitting bids for buying 100% stake in Air India till April 30.

The deadline was originally set at March 17.

The government had allowed access to the virtual data room of Air India to interested bidders late in February and allowed them further time till March 6 to pose queries.

Home Minister Amit Shah-led ministerial panel on Air India decided on extending the deadline for submission of expression of interest (EoI) by interested bidders till April 30.

While extending the date, the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) in a notification said the changes are in view of the requests received from the IBs (interested bidders) and the prevailing situation arising out of COVID-19.

In January, the government restarted the divestment process of Air India and invited bids for selling 100% of its equity in the state-owned airline, including Air India’s 100% shareholding in AI Express Ltd and 50% in Air India SATS Airport Services Private Ltd.

The government had on January 27 issued the preliminary information memorandum (PIM) inviting EoI for sale of 100% stake in Air India.

On February 21, it issued the first set of clarification answering queries regarding the ‘confidentiality undertaking.’

Interested bidders for Air India should have a net worth of ₹3,500 crore.

After its unsuccessful bid to sell Air India in 2018, the government this time has decided to offload its entire stake. In 2018, the government had offered to sell its 76% stake in the airline.

Of the total debt of ₹60,074 crore as of March 31, 2019, the buyer would be required to absorb ₹23,286.5 crore, while the rest would be transferred to Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL), the special purpose vehicle.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/20sv1t/article31057710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/govt-extends-deadline-to-bid-for-air-india-till-april-30/article31057712.ece
64,2020/03/13,Private airport operators want coronavirus cess,"Association of Private Airport Operators also sought provisioning of an airport operator alleviation package by Airports Economic Regulatory Authority

The Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO) on Friday approached the government with a request to allow levying of a nominal passenger facilitation charge as part of airline fares to cover increased operating expenses being incurred by the operators in wake of the COVID-19 outbreak and fall in passenger volumes.

In a letter to the civil aviation secretary on Friday, APAO also sought provisioning of an airport operator alleviation package by Airports Economic Regulatory Authority (AERA) to facilitate the growing operational expenses, released in the next control period of applicable airport operators.

Citing Airports Council International (ACI) estimates, APAO said that the Asia-Pacific region is suffering the highest impact, with passenger traffic volumes down 24 percent for the first quart er of 2020, compared to forecasted traffic levels without COVID-19. Against this gloomy background of sharp declines in traffic and passenger throughput, airports' aeronautical revenues and non-aeronautical revenues are rendering similar declines.

Also read : Coronavirus | Masks, sanitisers declared essential commodities

The ACI World Airport Traffic Forecasts 2019-2040 projects revenue loss owing to COVID-19 to the tunes of US $3 billion. “While cancellation of flights by various international and domestic carriers (a measure by airlines to save operational expense in response to muted passenger demand) has impacted the air traffic management (ATM)-related revenues for airports, reduced number of passengers has impacted the passenger related revenues,” APAO secretary general Satyan Nayar said.

Mr. Nayar said that reduced passengers at airports have adversely impacted the non-aero revenues due to less sales at food and beverage (F&B) and retail outlets. “Non-aero concessionaires have already started asking for reduced revenue share or mininum monthy guarantee which in turn will impact airport operators' revenues,” he said.

Besides, APAO cited that ensuring compliance with government advisories on screening of passengers has required airports to significantly beef up its manpower deployment at airports as well as make expenditure on various items like masks, sanitizers and floor cleaners.

Also read : Coronavirus | Delhi reports second COVID-19 death

“These issues are impacting the airport adversely with no offset or compensatory stream available to them and are severely impacting the cash flows for the airport operators,” Mr. Nayar said pointing out that this is unlike airlines which have got one major compensatory stream in terms of significantly reduced (more than 50%) crude oil prices, which make up almost 40 percent of their operational expense.

APAO in its appeal to the government for relief said that it was also pertinent to mention that while airlines can choose to cancel flights or relocate their aircraft to other markets to reduce operating costs, airports face immediate cash flow pressures with limited ability to reduce fixed costs and few resources to fund capacity expansion efforts for longer-term future growth.

“For privately-held airports, the situation is even worse as they do not benefit from relief measure but are obliged to continue paying concession fees to the regulator,” the APAO letter said.

65,2020/03/13,Coronavirus | Delhi reports India’s second COVID-19 death,"Number of cases crosses 80; lockdown in many States as fresh cases are reported in Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala.

With the second death and more than 80 positive cases of COVID-19, India has launched a containment lockdown, according to experts, with several States closing schools, colleges and theatres and cancelling public events.

The country, which is in the second stage of transmission, recorded the second fatality in the national capital. Health officials confirmed that the 68-year old woman, a resident of Delhi, who came in contact with her COVID-19 positive son, died at RML Hospital on March 13 night.

“The lockdown that India is currently under is absolutely necessary. India has a 30-day window to halt the beginning of community transmission of COVID-19 cases. The time to act is now. While there is no cause for panic and aggressive measures can also reverse community transmission, if it happens. It’s time that we all worked together to make use of the opportunity that we have right now,” said Balram Bhargava, Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).

On March 13, fresh cases were reported from Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala. Three persons in Thiruvananthapuram district tested positive, taking the total number in the second wave of infection to 19 in Kerala. Delhi-NCR reported yet another positive case, of a 46-year-old man. He is from Greater Noida, with travel history to Italy and Switzerland. More than 700 people working in his leather company have been put under surveillance, Gautam Buddh Nagar Chief Medical Officer Anurag Bhargava told reporters. “When the man, who lives in Delhi, returned home, he felt weakness and consulted doctors... He tested positive. However, he kept visiting the company since returning from abroad, hence all 707 employees have been put under surveillance,” he said.

“His family members and children are already under surveillance,” he said.

Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi University and Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi have suspended classes, and other universities, like Jindal University in Sonepat in Haryana, announced they would be open but there would be no classes till March 29.

Coronavirus | Masks, sanitisers declared essential commodities

The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has asked international airlines to consider waiving ticket cancellation and reschedule charges, or providing any other incentives.

The Union Health Ministry has said of the 81 positive cases, three from Kerala were treated and discharged and seven more from Safdarjung have recovered. Of these confirmed cases, 64 cases are of Indian nationals, 16 Italian nationals and one Canadian. Contact tracing of these cases is being pursued. So far, this has led to the identification of more than 4,000 contacts who have been put under surveillance.

A man who returned from Italy on March 11 and who was at a quarantine facility of the Army in Manesar has tested positive. The individual was working in one of the restaurants in Italy for the past 14 years. He has been shifted to an isolation facility at Safdarjung Hospital.

The Ministry said India evacuated 1,031 people, including from the Maldives, the U.S., Madagascar and China.

The Centre has also decided to allow international traffic only through 19 of the 37 border checkpoints and continue the suspension of the India-Bangladesh passenger trains and buses till April 15, or earlier.

After the country’s first coronavirus death reported from Kalaburagi, the Karnataka government announced lockdown of malls, cinema theatres, pubs and night clubs for a week. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa ordered cancellation of all exhibitions, summer camps, conferences, marriage events and birthday parties. “We will close all universities for a week in the entire State,” he told reporters.

A software engineer, who works in Bengaluru, who had returned from Greece, was diagnosed with COVID-19.

In Kalaburgi town, 46 people who were in contact with the 76-year-old man who died on Tuesday night were quarantined, district officials said, adding that 31 were categorised as “high risk” and 13 “low risk”. Four family members of the man have displayed symptoms of flu, and their swab samples have been sent for testing.

In Odisha, the Naveen Patnaik government said educational institutions would be closed till March 31, but examinations would go ahead. He said the government had earmarked ₹200 crore to combat the threat and declared COVID-19 a “disaster”. Non-essential gatherings such as seminars, workshops and conferences would be cancelled, Mr. Patnaik said. Social gatherings and assemblies, such as religious functions, marriage receptions and parties, would be regulated. Cinema halls, swimming pools and gyms would also be closed.

A quarantine centre run by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police in New Delhi discharged 112 people, comprising 76 Indians and 36 foreigners, on March 13 after they tested negative, a senior official said. They were evacuated last month from Wuhan in China and admitted on February 27 to the centre at Chhawla in south-west Delhi, one of the biggest quarantine centres in the country set up to deal with the pandemic.

“Two tests were conducted on these inmates, the first one on the day they were brought in and the second on the fourteenth day. All the 112 samples have been found negative, and hence it was decided to allow them to leave for their homes and other destinations,” ITBP spokesperson Vivek Kumar Pandey said.

The Central Zoo Authority has directed all zoos to screen visitors and undertake sanitation measures at entry and exit gates.

66,2020/03/13,New York Times report on Delhi riots criticised by Indian Police Service Association,"WSJ journalist faces another complaint

The Indian Police Service Association has hit out at a report in The New York Times that blamed Delhi’s police force for being a part of the recent violence in the capital, and a senior representative of The Wall Street Journal was at the receiving end of a private complaint for “anti-India behaviour”.

In a statement, the Indian Police Service Association claimed India was governed by the “rule of law” and no one had “immunity from killing anyone”. The association said: “Our heart bleeds for every victim of a riot and the objective is to always minimise the loss and bring the guilty to justice.”

The NYT report said that two-thirds of the “more than 50 people” who were killed and have been identified were Muslim. “More evidence is emerging that the Delhi police, who are under the direct command of Mr. Modi’s government and have very few Muslim officers, concertedly moved against Muslims and at times actively helped the Hindu mobs,” the report said. NYT spokesperson Danielle Rhoades Ha said, “Our story was rigorously reported by staff on the ground in New Delhi, and based on numerous witness statements, videos that are widely available and have been confirmed authentic and information provided by police officials. The facts in our story are not in dispute.”

The Association’s comments drew sharp reactions on social media, with a large number of persons posting videos of security personnel beating up men and forcing them to sing the national anthem.

Journalist Ajai Shukla tweeted, “Of course this is a foreign conspiracy! Don’t we all know what a skilled, incorruptible, professional and apolitical police INDIA has!!”

Sidrah, another Twitter user, said, “There are videos of Delhi Police leading rioters, pelting stones wit them; call records of lack of response from helplines; people being humiliated and made to sing the national anthem, Jamia brutalities, Daryaganj?”

Regarding the case of Eric Bellman, South Asia Deputy Bureau Chief of The Wall Street Journal, the official spokesperson of the External Affairs Ministry Raveesh Kumar said the complaint against the senior journalist was filed by a “private individual” which was a “routine matter”.

However, Prasar Bharati News Services, tweeted that the Ministry had asked the Indian Embassy in the U.S. “to look into the request for immediate deportation of The Wall Street Journal’s South Asia Bureau Chief Eric Bellman for ‘anti-India behaviour”. The tweet was deleted later.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/p66ws2/article22646306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IPS-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/new-york-times-and-wall-street-journal-in-governments-focus/article31063113.ece
67,2020/03/13,Delhi violence | Amit Shah ducks MPs’ queries on police brutality,"Questions on hate speech by BJP leaders also ignored

While Union Home Minister Amit Shah has furnished extensive data on FIRs and arrests made in connection with the February riots in Delhi in discussions in both Houses of Parliament, he did not answer several key questions raised by the MPs.

During a short-duration discussion on Thursday, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal asked Mr. Shah about a video circulating on social media showing policemen destroying CCTV cameras in parts of riot-hit northeast Delhi. Mr. Sibal mentioned another video showing policemen hitting an injured person with sticks and forcing him to sing the national anthem. The injured person was later reported to have died.

Asaduddin Owaisi, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen MP, raised the video of police brutality in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

Mr. Shah skirted the question in his reply. “Some members here mentioned that the Delhi police failed, they failed to provide information in time… Accuse me all you want but not the police,” he said. “I analysed the situation, the police acted swiftly. The riots did not spread and that success is of Delhi police… this is essential for the morale of the police.”

Planned or spontaneous

Mr. Sibal pointed to the contradiction between a February 25 statement issued by the Press Information Bureau that the riots were “spontaneous” and Mr. Shah’s speech in the Lok Sabha on March 11 that it was a pre-planned conspiracy.

Prasanna Acharya of the Biju Janta Dal also asked that if it was a conspiracy, “Is it not a failure on the part of the government that it did not get a hint of it? Why did it not take preventive measures then?”

Again the Minister did not specifically clarify the contradiction, but said in the Rajya Sabha that various agencies had received information before February 24 that money was being routed through foreign sources and was distributed in Delhi to foment trouble.

“But investigations were at a preliminary stage and the riots happened; five people were arrested for hawala transactions,” Mr. Shah said.

He said the government had received information about the protests on February 23, but information on what could truly be described as communal riots came only on February 24 and the riots were controlled within 36 hours. He said 80 additional companies of the Central Reserve Police Force were provided to the Delhi Police daily from February 22 to 26.

Javed Ali Khan of the Samajwadi Party asked what action had been taken on a letter written by Shiromani Akali Dal MP Naresh Gujral to the Delhi Police Commissioner on February 27 where the latter alleged that his phone calls were not attended and the police did not help those stuck in the riots.

In the letter, Mr. Gujral had mentioned how his calls to rescue 16 individuals who were trapped in Maujpur received no assistance from the police. Mr. Shah’s replies in Parliament did not touch this issue.

Tiruchi Siva of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam asked why no action was taken against hate speeches with slogans such as “goli maaro” that became the source of the carnage and why were ambulances not allowed to move on the night of riots.

Sonia reference

Mr. Shah said hate speeches started after the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed on December 11. He said the impact of hate speeches was seen on February 15 when protesters sat at Shaheen Bagh, a day after a speech by a political person at Ramlila Maidan asking for decisive action. Mr. Shah was referring to a speech by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, though he he did not name her.

He blamed a February 17 speech by a young leader in Maharashtra asking people to take to the streets in large numbers when U.S. President Donald Trump was in India. Following this, protests were organised at seven or eight places in northeast Delhi that later turned into communal riots, he said.

68,2020/03/13,Rajya Sabha nod for Vivad Se Vishwas Bill,"It gives a second chance to taxpayers to settle their dues

The Parliament on Friday approved the Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Bill, 2020, which will give taxpayers a chance to settle tax disputes by paying their dues without any interest or penalty till March 31.

The Bill, which had been passed by the Lok Sabha on March 4, was approved by the Rajya Sabha on Friday by a voice vote. The Vivad Se Vishwas scheme waives off interest and penalty on pending tax if paid by March 31. For payments made after March 31 and till June 30, a 10% penalty would be charged.

In her response to the discussion on the Bill in the Upper House, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the scheme was not giving amnesty and that those already being prosecuted under the Income Tax Act would be excluded from it.

₹5 crore limit

Replying to questions raised by MPs during the discussion, she said the 75% tax on undisclosed cash deposited at the time of demonetisation would still apply. She said a cap of ₹5 crore in dues had been included in the scheme in order to prevent large-scale evasion or fraud-related cases trying to take advantage of the scheme.

Earlier in the day, DMK MPs P. Wilson and Tiruchi Siva raised concerns about the name of the Bill including Hindi words.

Ms. Sitharaman said: “I do understand the importance of mother tongue and regional languages.”

“In this case, I yield by saying, I give an assurance that we will have circulars going to all the regions to highlight each of the points in this scheme in the respective regional languages,” she added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/774v42/article31062903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THNIRMALASITHARAMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajya-sabha-nod-for-vivad-se-vishwas-bill/article31062904.ece
69,2020/03/13,Opposition hails Farooq’s release,"Ex-CM’s detention showed ‘despotism, arbitrariness’ in rule of law: Chidambaram

Opposition parties on Friday welcomed the release of former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and Lok Sabha MP Farooq Abdullah after seven months of detention. Former Home Minister P. Chidambaram in a tweet said his detention showed “despotism and arbitrariness” in rule of law in J&K.

Opposition’s appeal

Recently opposition leaders have appealed for Dr. Abdullah’s release at the earliest. The appeal was signed by NCP president Sharad Pawar, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee, Janata Dal (Secular) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI general secretary D. Raja, RJD Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Kumar Jha and two former Ministers from the Vajpayee government, Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie.

“Dr. Farooq Abdullah, welcome to freedom. What was the justification to keep him in detention without charges for 7 months? If there was justification (there was none), what is the reason for releasing him today? Despotism and arbitrariness constitute the Rule of Law in J&K. And this virus is spreading to many states in India,” Mr. Chidambaram said on Twitter.

Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, calling Dr. Abdullah’s detention a disgrace, welcomed his “belated” release.

Ms. Banerjee, taking to Twitter, said the other two former Chief Ministers, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, should also be released without delay. “I pray for the good health and long life of Jammu and Kashmir’s former Chief Minister and veteran leader Farooq Abdullah ji,” she said.

‘Long overdue’

Mr. Yechury said Dr. Abdullah’s detention was “illegal, undemocratic and unconstitutional.” “We have all been concerned about his health and well being. His release was long overdue. Several still remain detained or in prison. They need to be released immediately and democracy restored in J&K on priority. There is no political activity there right now, so democracy remains suspended. The curbs on assembly of people and other activities need to be lifted at once,” Mr. Yechury tweeted.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t5tbwc/article31062850.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THPCHIDAMBARAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/opposition-hails-farooqs-release/article31062851.ece

The medical test is part of the yearly appraisal process for government employees, and is mandatory for those 40 years and above.

Postponing the medical tests will reduce the strain on hospital infrastructure and medical personnel at a critical time, said the Ministry Additional Secretary Sujata Chaturvedi, noting that the Centre employs 50 to 60 lakh people across the country.

71,2020/03/13,Modi calls for SAARC videoconference on COVID-19,"All leaders in the 8-nation regional grouping, except Pakistan PM, welcome his suggestion

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday called for a videoconference summit of leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to discuss a common strategy to tackle COVID-19.

Full coverage on COVID-19

All leaders in the 8-nation regional grouping welcomed the PM’s suggestion and agreed to join the conference, except Pakistan PM Imran Khan, who deputed his special advisor on health to participate. Mr. Modi's suggestion was also received with some surprise, since SAARC has had no summit level meeting since 2014, and has been shelved since then due to India-Pakistan tensions, and PM Modi’s decision not to attend the SAARC summit in Islamabad in 2016.

Although Pakistan did not offer any immediate response to the message on Friday, officials in New Delhi indicated they were ready to organise the conference as early as Saturday.

“I would like to propose that the leadership of SAARC nations chalk out a strong strategy to fight coronavirus. We could discuss, via videoconferencing, ways to keep our citizens healthy. Together, we can set an example to the world, and contribute to a healthier planet,” said Mr. Modi in his message, which urged the leaders to “leave no stone unturned to ensure our people are healthy”.

The Ministry of External Affairs declined any comment on when the conference would take place, but a senior official told The Hindu that it was likely to be held “soon”. He said that the coronavirus situation had “lent itself to an opportunity” with SAARC.

South Asia accounts for only 125 of the 44,067 confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far, but there are fears of an escalation in the numbers given the density of population in the region. While SAARC member-states occupy just 3% of the world’s landmass, they account for 21% of its population.

Within hours of the tweets by Mr. Modi, Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, Maldivian President Ibrahim Solih and Bhutan Prime Minister Dr. Lotay Tshering tweeted their responses welcoming the idea of the coronavirus videoconference. Bangladesh’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Shahriar Alam also tweeted on behalf of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, saying that Ms. Hasina “welcomes the proposal and looks forward to a constructive dialogue with [SAARC leaders] who consented to discuss the way forward at this testing time for the region and the world.” In Afghanistan, Sediq Sediqqi, spokesperson of the recently re-elected President Ashraf Ghani, announced Mr. Ghani’s readiness to devise a “unified strategy” to fight coronavirus in the region.

In contrast, Pakistan appeared to snub PM Modi's proposal. ""The threat of #COVID-19 requires coordinated efforts at global and regional level. We have communicated that [Special Advisor to PM Khan on Health, Zafar Mirza] will be available to participate in the video conference of #SAARC member countries on the issue, "" a tweet from the Foreign Ministry posted well past midnight said.

“Timely proposal”

Meanwhile, the SAARC secretariat, based in Kathmandu with new Secretary General Sri Lankan diplomat Essala Weerakoon now at the helm, called the Mr. Modi’s offer a “timely proposal” and offered its services to facilitate the conference.

Mr. Modi has in the past held similar videoconferences to inaugurate infrastructure projects in neighbouring countries as well as for the launch of the GSAT-09 “SAARC satellite” in May 2017.

Set up in 1985, SAARC was the first such grouping for the South Asian region. However, in the last few years, due to the government’s decision to call off all talks with Pakistan until cross-border terrorism ends, New Delhi has shifted focus to other regional groupings that don’t include Pakistan, like the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), the Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) grouping, and the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). It remains to be seen whether Mr. Modi’s offer to convene the SAARC leadership meeting, albeit just for the coronavirus crisis, and only over a videoconference, will lead to a revival of the SAARC forum itself.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8490lk/article31062775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-NarendraModi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/modi-calls-for-saarc-videoconference-on-covid-19/article31062766.ece
72,2020/03/13,Verdict based on technical grounds can’t be a binding precedent: Supreme Court,"“A decision unaccompanied by reasons can never be said to be a law declared by the Supreme Court”

A Supreme Court decision entirely based on technical grounds cannot be used as a binding precedent or declaration of law on a particular issue, a three-judge Bench of the apex court has said.

The March 5 judgment by a Bench led by Justice R. Banumathi found that various high courts were banking on a 2011 decision of the apex court to dismiss a case solely on the ground of delay in filing it.

Article 141 of the Constitution provides that the law declared by the Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts. The court’s pronouncement of the law on a point shall operate as a binding precedent.

In the judgment Union of India versus M.V. Mohanan Nair pronounced on March 5, Justice Banumathi said for an apex court judgment to be classified as a declaration of law under Article 141, the verdict should first lay down a principle of law. To lay down such a principle of law, the court must have applied its mind to the merits of the case. A summary dismissal of a case on a technical ground like delay in filing does not make a decision a binding precedent.

“A decision unaccompanied by reasons can never be said to be a law declared by the Supreme Court,” Justice Banumathi observed.

The Mohanan Nair case concerned a challenge to the Modified Assured Career Progression (MACP) scheme on the basis of a 2011 decision of the apex court in the Raj Pal case. Justice Banumathi held that the Raj Pal judgment cannot be used as a binding precedent because the apex court had dismissed the case only on the ground of delay.

The MACP scheme, which superseded the ACP Scheme, was introduced in 1999 to deal with the problem of “genuine stagnation and hardship faced by the employees due to lack of adequate promotional avenues.” The court upheld the MACP scheme as a matter of government policy.

“Interference with the recommendations of the expert body like Pay Commission and its recommendations for the MACP would have a serious impact on the public exchequer,” the apex court concluded.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/verdict-based-on-technical-grounds-cant-be-a-binding-precedent-supreme-court/article31062583.ece
73,2020/03/13,"Common test for railway, bank, Central government jobs from 2021","To streamline the hiring process, Centre to set up National Recruitment Agency to conduct the online test.

Applicants for jobs in railways, banks and lower levels of Central government will now write a common eligibility test (CET) from 2021, Minister for Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions Jitendra Singh told journalists on Friday.

In a bid to streamline the hiring process for government agencies as well as the 2.5 crore candidates who apply each year, the Centre will set up an autonomous National Recruitment Agency (NRA) to conduct this online test.

Level playing field

“This is not merely an administrative reform, but a huge socio-economic reform as well. It aims at providing a level playing field for all candidates by removing the obstacles involved in appearing for multiple examinations,” said Dr. Singh. “The exam dates for 2020 have already been announced [for the existing separate exams], so this will be implemented from 2021.”

He said the NRA proposal, which had been in the works for about six months and was announced in the 2020 budget speech, would soon go for Cabinet approval. The CET will replace the first level tests conducted by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC), the Railway Recruitment Board (RRB) and the Institute of Banking Personnel Selection (IBPS).

Currently, there are about 1.25 lakh vacancies in the Central government, at the Group B and C level, often known as non-gazetted officers. About 2.5 crore young men and women apply every year for examinations to fill these vacancies, also appearing for 50 other recruitment tests for positions at public sector banks, railways, police, paramilitary forces and other State and Central government bodies. The recruitment cycle takes at least 18 months and is often marred by clashing dates, leaked papers and examination scams.

“They are wasting half their lives applying and travelling from place to place, writing these examinations for similar positions,” said C. Chandramouli, Secretary to the Ministry. He said common entrance examinations such as the JEE for engineering colleges or the NEET for medical colleges had already streamlined the admission process. “We are now bringing the same concept to employment,” he said.

Common portal

Under the new NRA system, candidates will apply through a common registration portal, paying a single entrance fee. They will prepare from a common curriculum. Examination centres will be set up in each district, with the Centre committing to invest in the necessary infrastructure for 117 aspirational districts. A standardised question bank with multiple questions of similar difficulty levels will be created in a central server. An algorithm will be used to jumble and dole out different questions, so that each candidate receives a different question paper, reducing the chances of cheating and paper leakage.

Scores will be generated quickly, delivered online and be valid for a three-year period. Students can write the test multiple times as long as they are within the eligible age limit, with their best score being taken into account. Ultimately, the aim is to allow examination by appointment at the convenience of candidates. For now, however, the examination will be held once a year.

Huge savings

For the recruiting agencies, the savings in terms of logistics are huge, said Dr. Chandramouli. “Currently, for these three agencies alone, we are effectively conducting the exam for 7.5 crore candidates each year. There are 20 other central agencies which can be brought on board,” he said.

For police and paramilitary recruitment, the CET scores plus physical assessment is all that is required, potentially reducing the recruitment cycle to three months. For more specialised positions, the CET will act as the preliminary elimination level, which can be followed by further testing by the separate agencies.

Language concern

“We have spoken to the State governments about using the CET for their own recruitment, but they want to wait and see how it works for the Centre first... One of their big concerns is language,” said Dr. Singh, adding that the Centre planned to make the test available in multiple languages including all those notified under Schedule 8 of the Constitution. “Ultimately, we hope that CET may also be used as a referral parameter for the private sector as well.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/common-test-for-railway-bank-central-government-jobs-from-2021/article31062495.ece
74,2020/03/13,"EC needs to revisit poll spending cap, says Ravi Shankar Prasad","Mr. Prasad said he wanted to flag another issue — of retaining the festive nature of Indian elections.

Union Law and Justice minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday told the Rajya Sabha that the Election Commission of India (ECI) needed to revisit the cap on election spending by candidates.

Mr. Prasad was responding to the discussion on a private member’s Bill introduced by Congress MP M.V. Rajeev Gowda on July 26 last year. The Bill sought to remove all limits on poll expenditure in the interest of transparency.

The Minister said the limits — which cap spending by Lok Sabha candidates at ₹70 lakh and by candidates in Assembly elections at ₹28 lakh for most States — had been revised several times over the years and would likely happen again.

However, doing away with the spending limits altogether would only increase the role of money in electoral politics, Mr. Prasad asserted, while observing that Mr. Gowda had moved the Bill to address the lack of transparency in election spending.

“If this Bill is accepted, it will surely weaken the purity of India’s electoral process,” the minister contended. “I take this point that the Election Commission needs to revisit it. It was last done in 2014,” he observed, adding that it was the ECI’s jurisdiction under Rule 90 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961.

Mr. Prasad said he wanted to flag another issue — of retaining the festive nature of Indian elections.

“While all of us respect the Model Code of Conduct... but with greatest respect to the institution of the Election Commission, they need to reflect that while ensuring the Model Code of Conduct, the festive nature of Indian democracy should not be lost,” he said, referring to the code of conduct for political parties in the run-up to polling.

While withdrawing the Bill upon the minister’s request, Mr. Gowda said the aim of the Bill had been to highlight the negative impact of money power and not to encourage over-spending. But, he added, the “impractical election spending limits” were leading to the expenditure going underground, with the use of black money to “bribe” voters increasing. The Congress MP recalled that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had said that all MPs began their careers with a lie by filing false election spending accounts.

“Let us pay some respect to his [Vajpayee’s] views... And we should not have a law which forces candidates to go out there and lie. A law that is broken by every Member of Parliament is not worth retaining,” he said.

The Congress MP suggested the government set up a national election fund for funding campaigns. He also hit out at the government’s electoral bond scheme, which allows donors to remain anonymous by buying electoral bonds from banks.

“If you want to cleanse the process, start now, get rid of the electoral bonds,” he said.

The discussion comes at a time when the ECI has proposed putting caps on political parties’ expenditure, which is currently not limited in the same manner that spending by candidates is. The ECI has sought public comments and suggestions till March 31 on this proposal and other reforms recommended by the working groups that it had set up after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bmopez/article31062426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV1-RaviShankarPrasad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ec-needs-to-revisit-poll-spending-cap-says-ravi-shankar-prasad/article31062423.ece
75,2020/03/13,"TMC, CPI(M) fact-check Shah’s no ‘doubtful’ category in NPR assertion","Clauses 3 to 6 of the 2003 rules under the Citizenship Act, deal exclusively with the process of preparation of NPR.

In a fact-check of Union Home minister Amit Shah’s assertion in the Parliament that nobody would be marked as ‘doubtful’ in the National Population Register, the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and CPI(M) on Friday said that the government would have to amend the 2003 rules under the Citizenship Act, which contains the provisions to designate residents under just such a category.

Also read: Explained: What connects the NPR, NRIC and Census?

Clauses 3 to 6 of the 2003 rules under the Citizenship Act, deal exclusively with the process of preparation of NPR and the identification of individuals whose citizenship is ‘doubtful’ and prescribe the further process of enquiry and documentation required for people thus marked as ‘doubtful’.

“His claim that nobody will be marked as doubtful is a big lie,” TMC Parliamentary Party leader in the Rajya Sabha Derek O’ Brien said. “Let him read the 2003 rules under the Citizenship Act which clearly has provisions for ‘doubtful’ category. Unless, they amend the 2003 rules under the Citizenship Act, how can you say that there will be no doubtful category,” he asked rhetorically.

There had been at least nine replies tabled in Parliament by the Ministry of Home Affairs, which had stated that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) would be the precursor to a National Register of Citizens, Mr. O’ Brien said, adding that Mr. Shah himself had repeatedly explained the correlation between the two. “He needs to explain the chronology once again on the floor of the house that NRC will not follow CAA. In his one hour forty minute speech he did not mention NRC even once,” the TMC MP added.

Also read: Citizenship Amendment Act comes into effect from Jan. 10

Mr. O’ Brien also rejected Mr. Shah’s invitation to the Opposition parties to meet him to clear all their doubts about the NPR. “Parliament is not a boys club; you have to come and answer the hard questions here in Parliament. You invite three or four MPs to your chamber. I don’t go to anybody’s chamber to have coffee or dhokla. I want answers here on the floor of the house,” the TMC MP said in the Rajya Sabha.

The CPI(M) Polit Bureau asserted that the Home Minister’s assurances didn’t mean anything.

“If the Home Minister’s assurance to the Parliament is to be believed, then this government should immediately scrap these Rules,” the left party said in a statement. “In which case, the relevant clauses in the 2003 Amendment to the Citizenship Act that provide a legal status for the NRC would be rendered infructuous and, hence, the law should also be amended to scrap the NRC,” it added.

The party has also demanded that the 2003 rules should be scrapped. “Mere assertions in the Parliament do not evince confidence amongst the people that the NPR will not be used on a later date to facilitate the NRC,” CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said. “The relevant rules must be scrapped and the 2003 Act amended,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5flciy/article31062280.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-DerekOBrien,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tmc-cpim-fact-check-shahs-no-doubtful-category-in-npr-assertion/article31062273.ece

Adjusting for inflation and cost of living in an expensive urban metropolis like Delhi, the ex-gratia amount must be enhanced to ₹25 lakh,” a letter written by the group to the Chief Minister read.

The group urged the Chief Minister to include sexual violence, including rape and assault, under categories of injury and provide a compensation of ₹5 lakh. They asked him to provide compensation to workers in the area for the “lost opportunities of employment”.

The letter was written by activists Farah Naqvi, Ms. Bhardwaj, Annie Raja, Mr. Mander, Apoorvanand, Anirban Bhattacharya and Amrita Johri.

Today, over 2 weeks to the violence, many families we spoke to have not received this amount,” the letter said.

The group demanded that the ₹25,000 must be renewed for families that are still unable to return at the end of 30 days from February 24, 2020, until their final return or resettlement in new locations.

India has been coordinating bilaterally with countries like Italy and Iran for evacuation but this is the first time that the Indian leadership has called for a joint action by SAARC, which has been stuck because of India-Pakistan hostilities.

On Thursday, the official spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) informed about requests for medical items from Iran, Italy, Bangladesh, and Maldives.

Thursday also saw External Affairs Minister S.Jaishankar assuring Parliament that limited number of commercial flights would be allowed to fly back the Indians stranded in Qom, Tehran and other Iranian cities.

Mr. Jaishankar on Friday announced the arrival of the latest batch of evacuees in Mumbai in an Iran Air flight. “Second batch of 44 Indian pilgrims has arrived today from Iran. Our efforts to bring back the others continue,” he said.

86,2020/03/13,Farooq Abdullah released from detention,"‘Freedom is incomplete till other detained leaders are released’, he says.

In a significant step to allow the resumption of regional politics, the Jammu and Kashmir administration on Friday released National Conference (NC) president and sitting MP Dr. Farooq Abdullah, 82, by revoking his detention under the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA).

Dr. Abdullah, who was in detention for over seven months, said his “freedom is incomplete till other detained leaders are released”.

Dr. Abdullah, an ex-Union Minister, has become the first of the three incarcerated former Chief Ministers to be set free since the Centre revoked J&K's autonomous status on August 5 last. NC vice president Omar Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti, continue to remain in detention in Srinagar.

J&K Principal Secretary, Home, Shaleen Kabra, in an order, said Dr. Abdullah’s detention under the PSA, first in September last and again in December, had been withdrawn.

His second PSA detention was coming to an end this month.

Dr. Abdullah appeared with his wife and daughter before the media on Srinagar's Gupkar Road, where his house was turned into a sub-jail by the authorities.

Thanks people

“I am grateful to people of the State and of the nation and those who spoke for our freedom. This freedom is incomplete till all other leaders like Ms. Mufti and Omar, are released. Also those in the MLA hostel [referring to Shah Faesal] and in outside jails. I hope the Government of India will take action soon, to see all live as free citizens,” he said.

Indicating to abide by the Gupkar Declaration signed by all regional parties --- including the PDP, the NC, the Peoples Conference (PC) and the J&K Peoples Movement -- on August 4, 2019, Dr. Abdullah reserved his comments on critical issues of autonomy, Article 370 and 35A. The joint declaration had then opposed any move to dilute J&K’s special status.

“I will not speak on any political matter till all leaders are released,” he said.

An NC spokesman termed the release of the party leader as “a step in the right direction for restoration of genuine political processes”. “As the pre-eminent political party of J&K, the NC has played a key role in strengthening the voice of people and will continue to do so,” he said.

PDP leader Firdous Tak said, “The unconstitutional, illegal, inhuman and unjustified detention has finally ended and better sense has prevailed. Hope to see early release of other detainees. The state will be looking forward for guidance of Dr. Abdullah”.

CPI(M) leader M.Y. Tarigami said the release was a step to correct one wrong among many wrongs. “There is no political activity in J&K. The government must create conducive atmosphere for the same. Curbs on assembly of people must end too,” he added.

Welcoming the government decision, PC leader Imran Ansari said, “I take this opportunity to demand the release of our chairman Sajad Lone, who is under strict house arrest. We also demand release of our workers detained under the PSA,” he added.

Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, in a tweet, said, “Welcome the belated release of Dr. Abdullah...his detention was a disgrace.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lpja4q/article31060005.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Farooq,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-revokes-detention-of-farooq-abdullah/article31058587.ece
87,2020/03/13,Centre notifies new POCSO rules making law for sexual offences against children more stringent,"Some of the significant additions in the new rules include provision of mandatory police verification of staff in schools and care homes, procedures to report sexual abuse material (pornography), imparting age-appropriate child rights education among others.

The Union government has notified the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Rules, 2020 which enables implementation of recent amendments to the Act under which provisions of punishment for child abuse has been made more stringent.

Some of the significant additions in the new rules include provision of mandatory police verification of staff in schools and care homes, procedures to report sexual abuse material (pornography), imparting age-appropriate child rights education among others.

For crackdown on child pornography, the rules state that “any person who has received any pornographic material involving a child or any information regarding such pornographic material being stored, possessed, distributed, circulated, transmitted, facilitated, propagated or displayed, or is likely to be distributed, facilitated or transmitted in any manner shall report the contents to the special juvenile police unit (SJPU) or police, or the cybercrime portal“.

“The report shall include the details of the device in which such pornographic content was noticed and the suspected device from which such content was received including the platform on which the content was displayed,” the rules said.

Under the rules, the State governments have been asked to formulate a child protection policy based on the principle of “zero-tolerance” to violence against children, which shall be adopted by all institutions, organisations, or any other agency working with, or coming in contact with children.

“The Central government and every State government shall provide periodic training including orientation programmes, sensitisation workshops and refresher courses to all persons, whether regular or contractual, coming in contact with the children, to sensitise them about child safety and protection and educate them regarding their responsibility under the Act,” the rules said.

The Centre and State governments have been asked to prepare age-appropriate educational material and curriculum for children, informing them about various aspects of personal safety, including measures to protect their physical and virtual identity; and to safeguard their emotional and mental wellbeing, prevention and protection from sexual offences and reporting mechanisms, including Childline helpline services through toll free number - 1098.

“Orientation programme and intensive courses may also be organised for police personnel and forensic experts for building their capacities in their respective roles on a regular basis,” it said.

Under the new rules, any institution housing children or coming in regular contact with children, including schools, creches, sports academies or any other facility for children must ensure a police verification and background check on periodic basis of every staff.

The new POCSO rules became effective from March 9.

90,2020/03/13,WBSLSA order on use of compensation money set aside,"Calcutta HC slams the ‘Big Brother’ approach of the disbursing authority towards survivors of human trafficking

The Calcutta High Court has set aside the directions of the West Bengal State Legal Services Authority (WBSLSA) making it mandatory that a sizeable portion of the compensation awarded to a survivor of human trafficking be kept in bank as fixed deposit for 10 years.

“We are in 2020 now, and not in ‘1984’ [as contemplated by George Orwell]. As such, the ‘Big Brother’ approach of the disbursing authority should be shunned and the victim should be free to spend the compensation granted to her/him at her/his option,” Justice Sabyasachi Bhattacharyya said on Wednesday.

The Big Brother reference is drawn from the iconic phrase “Big Brother is watching you” from Orwell’s book. Observing that the SLSA has no authority to control and monitor the amount of compensation disbursed to a victim who has attained majority, the court said the “right to commit a mistake inheres in the right to personal liberty and freedom and should not be curtailed mandatorily and arbitrarily by the SLSA merely because it is in charge of the purse‐string, ... ”.

2019 order

In August 2019, the WBSLSA issued a notification that 75% of the compensation awarded to survivors of trafficking should be kept in bank as fixed deposit for ten years. Two survivors of human trafficking who have received compensation moved the High Court challenging the WBSLSA directive.

In an affidavit, the WBSLSA termed certain expenditures such as purchasing property or spending the amount for making ornaments or for the marriage of the survivor, education of the survivor child “misuse” to which the court took strong objection.

Calling the WBSLSA’s arguments “unfortunate” Justice Bhattacharyya said “most of the reasons could have been justified on the ground of the necessity of the victim’s rehabilitation, in various forms. Thus, the argument of legality and justification of the impugned orders/notifications on the strength of such isolated events are not tenable in the eye of law.”

‘Can do more’

Welcoming the order, Kaushik Gupta, counsel for the petitioners, suggested that instead of trying to keep a check on purse strings of survivors, the WBSLSA could do more for the well being of the survivors.

“The WBSLSA can have a centre for psychological counselling for the survivors and have a financial counsellor as well who can tell the survivors on how to spend or invest the money,” Mr. Gupta said.

Subhasree Raptan, who runs a non-governmental organisation in south Bengal and has actively worked with both the petitioners, said it took years for both of them to get the compensation. “Both of them [survivors] are very poor. In their case, the highest compensation of ₹6 lakh was awarded. After the WBSLSA order, they could only withdraw 25%, which is ₹2 lakh. This was violative of the survivors’ right,” Ms. Raptan said.

Section 357-A of Code of Criminal Procedure has provisions to compensate victims who suffered because of a crime. In 2012, following the national outrage in response to the Nirbhaya rape case, the Government of India announced ₹1,000 crore fund to be used to combat sexual violence against persons — children or adults.

RTI reply

Response obtained through RTI reply from 25 States and seven Union Territories points out that between March 2011 and April 2019 only 82 survivors were awarded compensation, whereas the number of cases of human trafficking in the same period was over 35,000.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/wbslsa-order-on-use-of-compensation-money-set-aside/article31054350.ece
91,2020/03/13,RS polls: Gujarat Cong. fields local leaders,"A dozen legislators warned the party against fielding any ‘outsider’

The Congress has fielded former State chief Bharatsinh Solanki and former leader of the Opposition Shaktisinh Gohil as the Rajya Sabha candidates for two seats in Gujarat.

Their candidature was announced by the party high command late on Thursday night after nearly two dozen legislators warned the party against fielding any ‘outsider’.

The legislators were upset after the name of the Congress leader and former Union Minister Rajeev Shukla came as the party’s candidate. Though officially it was not announced it was reported in the local media, which prompted the MLAs to swing into action and convey their displeasure to the high command.

“I am very happy that the party high command has selected two senior local leaders for Rajya Sabha. Our opposition was only against any outsider,” Congress MLA Baldevji Thakor said.

He and other legislators voiced their concerns in the Assembly after Mr. Shukla’s name had surfaced in the local channels.

Another key contender for the nomination was former State chief Arjun Modhvadia, who is now likely to take over as the State party chief.

Mr. Gohil is a former leader of the Opposition and currently in charge of party’s organisational affairs in Bihar and Delhi while Mr. Solanki, son of former Chief Minister Madhavsinh Solanki, was Union Minister in the UPA regime.

The BJP is currently holding three of the four seats while one is with the Opposition Congress. And as per the arithmetic, both the BJP and the Congress can get two seats each in the absence of voting as per the number of legislators on both sides.

On Wednesday, the BJP has fielded tribal leader Ramila Bara and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani’s protege Abhay Bhardwaj as the party candidates. It is not yet certain whether the ruling party will announce third candidate and force the voting despite the fact that it’s short of numbers.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rs-polls-gujarat-cong-fields-local-leaders/article31054188.ece

94,2020/03/13,Oppn. MPs caution govt. on railway privatisation,"They demand restoration of separate Budget for national carrier

Opposition warns govt. on railway privatisation

Several Opposition leaders on Thursday cautioned against any move to privatise the Railways and demanded that the separate Railway Budget be restored. Members, including Supriya Sule of the NCP and Arvind Sawant of the Shiv Sena, however, acknowledged that stations had become cleaner in recent years. Taking part in a discussion on the demands for grants of the Ministry of Railways In the Lok Sabha, M.K. Raghavan (Congress) accused the BJP Centre of showing consistent apathy in the last five years with a high operating ratio for the Raliways, the worst in the last 10 years.

“This Budget is a call for privatisation and eventual selling off of railways which is the lifeline of the Indian people,” he said.

S.S. Palanimanickam (DMK) said the BJP government is moving towards privatisation and demanded separate Budget to pay proper attention to demands of various railway zones be restored.

Saugata Roy (Trinamool) too hit out at the privatisation and attacked Railway Minister Piyush Goyal for the move to merge all railway services.

Mr. Roy also said the Union government is ‘fooling’ people in the name of bullet trains, saying they are unlikely to actualise in India. “Even if they do run, they will travel at half the speed of a similar train in Japan.”

Arvind Sawant (Shiv Sena) said the platforms are cleaner now but the quality of food in the Rajdhani train is poor.

Tapir Gao (BJP) said the Railways has developed so many facilities that its services are now comparable to those offered by airlines.

Coronavirus | State Helpline numbers for COVID-19

Mr. Thakur and other BJP activists attracted a huge crowd on March 8 at Srinagar's leading maternity hospital, Lal Ded.

“I distributed 500 masks in the Lal Ded hospital. I was surprised by the response of the people. It was quite remarkable. We were accompanied by doctors too. The BJP's idea is to educate masses about precautions required to contain any spread of the disease,” Mr. Thakur said.

The BJP plans to cover all government-run hospitals in its campaign. It also focused on nomadic community in Srinagar's outskirts of Shalimar area. The party has started special drives in central Kashmir's Ganderbal district. BJP senior leader Ruheena Shahzad distributed free face masks among the patients and attendants at the Trauma Hospital, Kangan.

It comes as the BJP plans to emerge as significant contender in the Valley during the Assembly elections. Similar drives are on in Jammu where BJP corporator Sahil Gupta distributed around 350 masks and 300 health sanitizers in the Bishnah constituency.

Mayor takes exception

Srinagar Mayor Junaid Azim Mattu, however, took exception to the BJP's mass contact programme in the Lal Ded hospital. “I would like to bring this to the notice of the Union Health Minister and request no such stunts are repeated in Srinagar. Can political photo-ops come at a cost of compromising COVID-19 precautionary advisories. Let sanity and common sense prevail,” he said.

The BJP drive comes as all regional parties in Kashmir face a lockdown due to the continuous detention of their leadership, including National Conference's Dr. Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah, Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti, Peoples Conference chief Sajad Lone and J&K Peoples Movement head Shah Faesal.

“No regional party is able to organise a public event in Kashmir because it requires seeking permissions from the police and the administration.

96,2020/03/13,Chopper deal case: ED plea for cancelling approver’s bail rejected,"Mr. Saxena failed to comply with conditions of pardon order, says agency

A special court on Thursday dismissed an application of the Enforcement Directorate seeking cancellation of the bail granted to Rajiv Saxena, an approver in the VVIP chopper deal case.

The agency had sought the cancellation alleging that Mr. Saxena had failed to comply with the conditions of the order granting him pardon.

It alleged that after the grant of bail and tender of pardon, Mr. Saxena had “very strategically failed to disclose the full and true facts within his knowledge relating to the commission of offence and also did not cooperate during investigation”.

The ED submitted in the court that Mr. Saxena had failed to join the probe 25 times.

After hearing the arguments from both sides, the court said once the accused was granted pardon and made approver, the status of the accused changed from accused to witness/approver.

If the approver failed to comply with the conditions of order granting him pardon, it made the person liable to be tried as an accused subject to the conditions laid down in Section 308 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

The provision mandates that an approver be examined in the court before revoking the pardon. The court said vide an order dated March 5, the ED’s plea for revoking the tender of pardon to Mr. Saxena was dismissed mainly on the ground that he had not been examined before the trial court and the application was premature.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chopper-deal-case-ed-plea-for-cancelling-approvers-bail-rejected/article31053299.ece
97,2020/03/13,Local body elections: Kanna urges ECI to intervene,"‘Threats to life are being made to force the Opposition nominees to withdraw’

BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana has expressed grave concern over the situation in the State, and said he has lost hope of a free and fair election to the local bodies.

Addressing the media here on Friday, Mr. Lakshminarayana urged the Election Commission of India (ECI) to cancel the ongoing process, and conduct the elections with security by the Central forces.

The State unit of the BJP had written a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the situation, he said.

The party Rajya Sabha members would apprise Mr. Shah and party all-India president J.P. Nadda of the situation, he added.

Condemning the “undemocratic manner,” he said the police and other officials were acting at the behest of the ruling YSRCP leaders, and no action was taken even if nominees were threatened or papers torn in the presence of the police.

Nominations were being rejected on flimsy grounds and threats to life were being made to force the Opposition nominees to withdraw.

In Guntur, the nominees who agreed to file papers backed out fearing for their lives, he said.

In East and West Godavari districts, the officials were threatening the opposition nominees with land acquisition. The State Election Commission remained a mute spectator, he alleged.

Snipe at CM

He said the Ordinance on checking electoral malpractices by amending the A.P. Panchayat Raj Act was brought to intimidate the Opposition as it allowed action even after three months. The Chief Minister encroached upon the powers of the election commission too, he said.

The village volunteer system was being misused to campaign for the YSRCP. Stating that all the opposition parties were targeted, he dared the Chief Minister to implement the Ordinance impartially.

During the press conference, a party member from Durgi in Guntur district called and informed Mr. Lakshminarayana that the police were threatening him with filing false cases.

A BJP delegation will soon meet Union Home Minister Amit Shah to bring to his notice the “large-scale irregularities and misuse of the police force by the YSRCP government” in the conduct of the local body elections, according to party State president Kanna Lakshminarayana.

Addressing the media here on Friday, Mr. Lakshminarayana said he had never seen in his political career so far such misuse of power by the ruling party, though stray incidents were common during such exercises.

“The High Court’s displeasure over the functioning of the police and its remarks against the DGP vouch for it,” he added.

“Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is not confident about winning the elections. That is the reason for such large-scale violations. In many places, the BJP and JSP candidates have not been allowed to submit their nomination papers. In some instances, the nominations have been rejected on flimsy grounds. We have decided to meet Mr. Amit Shah and request him to ensure the conduct of elections in a free and fair manner in the State,” Mr. Lakshminarayana said.

Land acquisition

MLC P.V.N. Madhav accused the YSRCP of resorting to forcible acquisition of lands.

“The government, which has decided to set up three capitals, is trying to acquire lands of the Simhachalam and Padmanabhaswamy temples. It has violated all norms in appointing new chairperson for the MANSAS Trust, which has under its control vast extent of land, with that in view. We will seek the Union government’s intervention for the protection of temple lands,” he said.

101,2020/03/13,MLC K.E. Prabhakar quits TDP,"Says resigning because dissatisfied with the party’s policies; will announce future plans after holding a meeting with his supporters

In another blow to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), MLC from Kurnool district, K.E. Prabhakar has resigned from the opposition party claiming tickets for the local body election were given to BJP members instead of TDP loyalists.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Prabhakar alleged the district TDP leadership was under the thumb of BJP leaders. “There are three corporator seats we asked from the party to candidates that have previously won the local body elections. However, the tickets were given to new candidates preferred by BJP Rajya Sabha MP T.G. Venkatesh and TDP leader Kotla Jayasurya Prakash Reddy,” he added.

‘TDP under BJP’

“BJP leaders are commanding the TDP leadership. And the district TDP leadership is neglecting senior partymen,” Mr. Prabhakar rued. “I am resigning because I’m dissatisfied with the party’s policies,” he added.

Speaking about his moves in the future, Mr. Prabhakar said he would conduct a meeting with partymen soon. “We will announce our plans after holding a meeting with the supporters,” he added.

Mr. Prabhakar is the brother of former Deputy Chief Minister, K.E. Krishnamurthy. He previously won as an MLA from Dhone constituency. In the 2019 general elections, he lost the constituency to the current Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tdp-mlc-ke-prabhakar-quits-tdp/article31059562.ece
102,2020/03/13,"Thermal scanners at Alipiri, Srivarimettu to screen foot pilgrims to avert COVID-19 spread in Tirumala","TTD on a high gear with awareness campaigns, cleanliness and sanitation drives, and even extra isolation wards if necessary

In tune with the measures taken by the Central and State governments to contain the spread of COVID-19, the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) has embarked on a twin-pronged strategy to create awareness among pilgrims, and to screen them at the entry point.

The temple management on Friday set up a screening camp each at Alipiri and Srivarimettu - the two points at the foothills - used by devotees to trek to Tirumala where the famous temple of Lord Venkateswara is located.

Coronavirus | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India

Pre-emptive scrutiny

TTD staff wielding thermal guns have been deployed to screen the pilgrims to check their body temperature for symptoms of fever. The objective is to prevent the further movement of people with COVID-2019 symptoms, so as to contain its spread at the hill top, where tens of thousands of people throng at any given point of time.

Executive Officer Anil Kumar Singhal, who visited the medical camp along with Additional Executive Officer (Tirumala) A.V. Dharma Reddy, and Chief Vigilance and Security Officer Gopinath Jatti, said the TTD had already initiated awareness programmes at the hill town during the last week. Any suspects identified by the thermal scanners would be barred entry to Tirumala. Instead, they would be sent directly to the isolation ward established at SVR Ruia Government General Hospital.

The TTD has also arranged to create COVID-2019 awareness through distribution of one lakh pamphlets, audio announcement at Tirumala, and through its Sri Venkateswara Bhakti Channel (SVBC). Laying special emphasis on health and hygiene, special cleanliness drive is in place to sanitise the Pilgrim Amenities Complex (PAC), Annadanam complex, Vaikuntham Queue Complex and Kalyanakatta (tonsuring centre) every two hours, in view of the heavy congregation of devotees at these places.

Cancellation option

As confusion and a sense of insecurity reign supreme, the TTD has offered an option to the pilgrims to change their ₹ 300 (Special Entry Darshan) ticket booked online up to May 31 to another date of their choice. “Those intending to cancel their tickets will also get their ticket amount refunded,” Mr. Singhal calrified. This is in view of the travel restrictions imposed by the Central government on inbound air passengers coming from abroad and cancellation of visas up to Apr 15. The TTD has once again made a fervent appeal to devotees from abroad or those who had recently returned from foreign countries to postpone their visit to Tirumala in the larger interest of fellow devotees.

Extra isolation wards

Meanwhile, the Padmavathi Nilayam pilgrims accommodation complex recently opened at Tiruchanur will be used as a COVID-2019 Isolation Ward. The TTD has agreed to the State Department of Medical and Health’s request to this effect. Mr. Singhal said the TTD would also consider the plea by the District Collector Bharat Narayana Gupta to use the TTD choultries near the railway station as another isolation ward, if necessary.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jtcdz/article31066874.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Tirumalalipiri,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/thermal-scanners-at-alipiri-and-srivarimettu-to-screen-pilgrims-for-covid-19/article31059519.ece
103,2020/03/13,COVID-19 scare keeps pilgrims off Tirumala,"Drastic decline in footfall; zero NRI arrivals this month, say statistics

The COVID-19 scare has found its ‘echo’ at the famous hill temple of Lord Venkateswara here, if the sudden decline in the turnout of pilgrims is any indication.

According to statistics, about 5.37 lakh pilgrims had the darshan of the presiding deity last week (March 2 to 8) as against 4.97 lakh during the corresponding week last year — an increase of about 39,031 pilgrims.

However, the figures plunged by 46,058 in just three days during the current week. As against 2.33 lakh pilgrims last year, the pilgrim turnout was just 1.87 lakh so far during the week.

Drop in VIP numbers

On the other hand, there is a drastic decline in the number of VIPs and those with recommendation letters. In the past one week, the tickets issued under the discretionary quota has been put at around 2,000 a day as against the normal average of 3,000.

Same is the case with donations to Sri Vani Trust (under which the donors contributing ₹10,000 each are privileged with VIP darshan of the deity) the online bookings of which has come down by more than 50%.

As never before, the number of NRI s visiting the town (for darshan) during the month has almost hit a ‘nil’, while the obligations from Army, Navy and Air Force personnel has also registered a big ‘zero’

No takers

Things are neither rosy on the accommodation front, which for the first time in the temple history registered 20% cancellations in the booking of cottages and guest houses during the month. Meanwhile, the TTD has stepped up preventive measures in combating COVID-19 vis-a-vis refunding the amount for darshan tickets and accommodation already booked, periodical sanitising of the crowded places, supply of face masks to all those continuously interacting with the pilgrims, etc.

Appeal

In an earnest appeal, it requested the devotees coming from foreign countries to visit the shrine only after a lapse of 28 days as any minutest chance of negligence would have a fatal and cascading effect on the entire country.

Additional EO A.V. Dharma reddy in a stern warning on Thursday cautioned the Health and Medical officials of “dire consequences” in case of laxity. All the scheduled meetings would be superseded in case the health and medical officials wished to meet him as the wellness of the country was paramount for him, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/5bgu6n/article31006146.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tm-HUNDITHGG66778RQ84jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/covid-19-scare-keeps-pilgrims-off-tirumala/article31057155.ece
104,2020/03/13,"Canara Bank to focus on rural, semi-urban areas","Merger with Syndicate Bank will augur well for bank, says AGM

Canara Bank is focusing on the rural and semi-urban areas of the north coastal region to improve its business in the financial year 2020-21 when the bank will have more than 100 branches in the region with the merger of Syndicate Bank. Currently Canara Bank has 63 branches and Syndicate Bank 31 apart from administrative and regional offices for both banks in Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, and Visakhapatnam.

Canara Bank Assistant General Manager A. Ramesh Babu, who reviewed the bank’s activities in Srikakulam, told The Hindu that the bank's customer friendly schemes helped it cross ₹9,000-crore business in the financial year 2019-20. He said the merger of Syndicate Bank with Canara Bank would be beneficial for customers as they would have access to more branches in the region.

“Canara Bank is always very strong in gold loan segment as its interest rate is only 8.5 % for the loans below three lakh. Now, it has given top priority for crop loans by promoting the Union government’s Kisan Credit Card scheme which would offer many benefits including interest subvention for farmers. With the support of 74 business correspondents, we are able to sanction loans to the farmers living in the remote areas of Vizianagaram, Srikakulam, and Visakhapatnam,” he said.

New accounts

Mr. Ramesh Babu said that the bank was focusing on opening new accounts, particularly current accounts, by explaining the benefits to entrepreneurs and business persons of all segments. “All the branch managers have been advised to conduct special meetings with potential customers to improve the business activity,” he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ozkmoy/article31056696.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13ONGCANARA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/canara-bank-to-focus-on-rural-semi-urban-areas/article31056697.ece

108,2020/03/13,Notice to Naidu: HC tells DGP to act against officers,"The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Thursday took a serious view of the issue of notice to former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu under Section 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C.) during his recent visit to Visakhapatnam, and questioned why action should not be taken against the police officers who served the notice.

The court adjourned the hearing and the order is awaited.

Sec.151(1) empowers a police officer knowing of a design to commit any cognizable offence to arrest, without orders from a magistrate and without a warrant, person so designing if it appears to him / her that the commission of the offence cannot be otherwise prevented.

In his deposition before Chief Justice J.K. Maheswari and Justices A.V. Sesha Sai and M. Satyanarayana Murthy, Director-General of Police (DGP) Gautam Sawang said he could not take departmental action when the case was pending in the court, which said the pendency of court proceedings was no bar for the DGP to take action in the matter.

The DGP said the notice did not indicate the compliance of parameters in Section 151 of the Cr.P.C. and assured the court that all the principles of law would be upheld.

According to Advocate-General S. Sriram, the DGP told the court that the preconditions for the exercise of power was not expressly indicated in the notice but circumstances existed.

It may be noted that the police detained Mr. Naidu at Visakhapatnam airport on February 27 when a large number of YSR Congress Party activists stopped him from touring the district as part of his ‘Praja Chaitanya Yatra’, alleging that he came to the city to obstruct the proposed shifting of the Executive capital from Amaravati.

109,2020/03/13,YSRCP blames Naidu for ‘money culture’ in elections,"TDP leader wooing voters with liquor and cash, alleges Vijaya Sai Reddy

YSRCP national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy on Thursday accused TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu of introducing a ‘money culture’ in elections and justified changes brought in the AP Panchayati Raj Act through an ordinance to disqualify people distributing cash or liquor to influence voters.

Mr. Vijaya Sai lambasted the TDP for crying foul over the new changes, which he said were a part of electoral reforms being instituted by the YSRCP. Mr. Vijaya Sai was speaking at the 10th Foundation Day of the YSRCP at the city office here.

“Mr. Naidu is resorting to electoral malpractices such as trying to woo voters with liquor and money,” Mr. Vijaya Sai said. “I want to go on record and say that Mr. Naidu believes in and practices the politics of winning over voters with money power,” he said.

Praising Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for introducing several revolutionary schemes and ushering in good governance in the past nine months, Mr. Vijaya Sai said that during a bypoll in Kurnool in 2018, Mr. Naidu tried to change the law to put Opposition leaders behind bars.

The YSRCP leader said that Mr. Naidu was finding fault even with the decision of the government to impose total prohibition in phases.

“We want a total liquor ban to ameliorate the suffering of the poorer sections, to save their health and improve their financial condition. Women in the State are wondering why Mr. Naidu, however, is so desperate to support the sale of alcohol,” Mr. Vijaya Sai said.

‘Politics of deceit’

“Even Mr. Naidu’s father-in-law and TDP founder NTR had said that his son-in-law was a better actor than he ever was,” Mr. Vijaya Sai said, adding that Mr. Naidu pursued politics of deceit.

He also criticised Mr. Naidu for trying to make SC leader Varla Ramaiah a scapegoat by giving him a party ticket for the Rajya Sabha, despite knowing very well that they did not have the numbers to win. “Had he wanted, he could have given a plum post to Mr. Ramaiah when the TDP was in power during 2014-19,” Mr. Vijaya Sai said.

110,2020/03/13,Botcha accuses TDP of fomenting trouble,"‘Number of nominations filed by Opposition speaks volumes’

The number of nominations filed for MPTC posts in the State shows that the election process is being conducted in a transparent process barring stray incidents which the Opposition is harping upon, Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana said here on Thursday.

For the 9,696 MPTCs, 50,063 nominations were filed. Of them, 23,000 were from the YSRCP, while 18,000 are from the TDP, 2,000 from the Jana Sena Party and 1,800 from the BJP, Mr. Satyanarayana said.

“If there were any coercion or high-handedness as alleged by the TDP, how would so many nominations be filed?” Mr. Satyanarayana said at a press conference here.

Asserting that YSRCP was seeking a positive vote on the basis of its performance, the Minister said that no government has fulfilled so many promises in nine months.

“Former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu knew that his party would be wiped out in the local body elections and would not win even 5% of the seats. Having realised this, he is trying to obstruct the election process,” Mr. Satyanarayana alleged.

In several districts, a large number of TDP candidates have filed nominations without any hurdles, Mr. Satyanarayana said, adding that TDP was fomenting trouble ahead of the elections.

Referring to the attack on TDP leaders Bonda Umamaheshwara Rao and Buddha Venkanna in Macherla on Wednesday, the Minister said that whenever political leaders travel to other parts of the State, they should inform the police. “The TDP leaders went without doing so, in a convoy of vehicles. There was an accident involving a physically-challenged man because of which locals got angry,” Mr. Satyanarayana said.

In an incident that occurred in Anantapur on Wednesday, cases were booked against persons owing allegiance to both YSRCP and TDP, and the number of people booked were more from the ruling party, he said. “An Act was passed and an app rolled out to prevent the use of money and liquor during campaigning. Complaints can be lodged through the app,” the Minister said.

“The charges being levelled by the BJP president are baseless. The party has failed to file even 3,000 nominations. JSP chief Pawan Kalyan does not know the difference between reel life and real life,” the Minister added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/botcha-accuses-tdp-of-fomenting-trouble/article31053713.ece
111,2020/03/13,"Jagan encouraging violence, alleges TDP leader","‘YSRCP leaders questioning victims instead of acting against culprits’

State Mahila president of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) V. Anitha on Thursday lambasted the ruling YSR Congress Party, alleging that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was spreading factional politics by encouraging his party cadres to indulge in violence across the State ahead of the ensuing local body elections.

Ms. Anitha also lashed out at Home Minister M. Sucharitha for not initiating action against those who attacked former MLA Bonda Umamaheshwara Rao at Macherla on Wednesday.

“Instead of taking action against the culprits who attacked the TDP leaders, Home Minister Sucharitha and other YSRCP leaders are questioning why Mr. Umamaheshwara Rao went to Macherla,” Ms. Anitha said at a press conference here.

“I wonder what is wrong if a TDP leader from one place goes to another to support a party member. If that is the case, why is MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy coming all the way from Nellore to Visakhapatnam so many times?” Ms. Anitha asked, adding that she would not be surprised if the YSRCP decides to give a party post to one of the attackers in the future as a reward.

Ms Anitha also alleged that some photographs being shown by the YSRCP leaders to the media claiming that they were taken in Macherla on March 11 were unrelated, and that the photographs were originally those of an accident that occurred in Telangana in October 2017.

She also said that women leaders from BJP and a few from TDP were also attacked by the YSRCP leaders, and claimed that the ruling party was fostering an atmosphere of unrest in the State.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jagan-encouraging-violence-alleges-tdp-leader/article31053710.ece
112,2020/03/13,More Armed Police Outposts likely in Agency,"These will help boost security as well as instil confidence among tribals, says CRPF DG

Appreciating the functioning of the Armed Police Outposts (AOP) in Visakhapatnam Agency, Director General of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) A.P. Maheshwari said that more such AOPs can be created in the future if need be.

Dr. Maheshwari was interacting with the media on his maiden visit to Visakhapatnam in his capacity as DG of the CRPF, on Thursday.

Forward bases will not only improve the domination of the security forces in the Left Wing Extremism-affected region but will have a multi-dimensional effect in the region, he said.

“Apart from security forces making deep inroads, AOPs will held in bettering police-community interactions, take development to the neglected areas, improve connectivity and communication and most importantly instil confidence among tribals,” Dr. Maheshwari said.

Speaking about the operations in the AOB region, Dr. Maheshwari expressed happiness on the enhanced domination of the security forces and the synergy between the Central forces and State police, the Greyhounds and various intelligence wings.

Speaking about modernisation, Dr. Maheshwari said that high-end technology is being inducted into the force and it will play a key role in future operations.

He also pointed out that setting up forward bases would go a long way towards improving road connectivity.

Visit to AOB region

Earlier in the day, Dr. Maheshwari visited the Maoist-affected Andhra Odisha Border (AOB) Region along with Sanjay Arora, Additional DG (Operations) CRPF, M.R. Naik, IG CRPF Southern Sector, Ch. Srikanth, IG A.P. SIB, Attada Babujee, Superintendent of Police of Visakhapatnam district, and other senior police and CRPF officials.

Dr. Maheshwari interacted with the jawans and officers in the forward areas in AOB and urged them to be more vigilant.

He later visited the headquarters of the 198 CRPF Battalion and addressed the officers and men of 198, 39, 42 and 234 Battalions. He also inaugurated a blood donation camp organised as part of the CPPF’s ongoing 81 Raising Day.

113,2020/03/13,Political atmosphere hots up as tussle for GVMC begins,"Elections are being held to the municipal corporation after a long gap

It is back to the drawing board for political parties with elections to the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) officially being announced. GVMC goes to polls on March 23.

Elections to the GVMC are being held after a long gap. Formed in 2005, the GVMC saw elections in 2005 and 2007, when Pulusu Janardhana Rao of the Congress was elected Mayor. Polls were due next in 2012, but could not held.

Though several political parties are in the fray, the election is likely to become a two-way contest between the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). The Jana Sena Party (JSP) will fight the elections in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), while other parties like the Left are unlikely to make much of an impact.

The YSRCP, which swept the Assembly elections last year across the State, tasted defeat in four of the eight Assembly seats that come under the GVMC limits. The TDP, which has a strong base in the city, emerged victorious in all four city constituencies while the YSRCP won in Gajuwaka, Pendurthi, Anakapalle and Bheemunipatnam Assembly constituencies.

The YSRCP is confident that the State government’s decision to make Visakhapatnam the ‘Executive capital’ and the introduction of various welfare schemes will ensure the party’s victory in the GVMC limits. Party leaders are also of the opinion that the JSP-BJP combine, which was formed with an aim of defeating the ruling party, will instead eat into the vote bank of the TDP and will end up playing to the ruling party’s advantage.

The morale of the TDP was badly hit after it received a drubbing in the 2019 elections. However, the party is determined to hold on to its base in the city and is also eyeing to regain its lost ground in the remaining four constituencies under the GVMC limits.

TDP’s poll plank

The TDP leaders are keen on raising issues such as the alleged forcible acquisition of assigned lands, appointment of Sanchaita Gajapathi Raju as chairperson of Simhachalam Temple Trust Board by replacing P. Ashok Gajapathi Raju, detaining party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu for several hours at the city airport, and alleged deletion of the names of pensioners and ration card holders.

However, the exit of popular leaders and former MLAs such as S.A. Rehaman and Panchakarla Rameshbabu from the party is expected to come as a big jolt to the TDP at this juncture.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysn6z3/article31053689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-VZ-GVMCOFFICEBUILDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/political-atmosphere-hots-up-as-tussle-for-gvmc-begins/article31053691.ece

A total of 772 vehicles, including 272 cars, 258 jeeps, 199 buses, 35 mini-buses and eight mini-trucks, are said to be required for conducting the ZPTC/MPTC elections in the four Revenue divisions of Anakapalle, Narsipatnam, Paderu and Visakhapatnam.

There is no dearth of vehicles as there are several travel agencies in the city and the district. However, it remains to be seen whether the travel operators are willing to rent out their vehicles to polling officials as they reportedly faced an unsavoury experience in the 2019 Assembly and General Elections, with payments getting delayed.

The operators said that they were also forced to ply their vehicles for far lesser rates than the prevailing market rates.

“It is a known fact that government rates are far below the prevailing market rate for hiring vehicles. We agree to the reduced rates for fear of losing their business. The bills submitted by different travel operators who had given their vehicles for hire during the 2019 General Elections were cleared only in December. Apart from the undue delay, we had to accept the bills with a 30% cut,” a proprietor of a travel agency, requesting anonymity, told The Hindu.

In normal practice, when a company or an individual hires a cab, a certain amount is paid to the driver as a daily allowance (usually ₹100 a day) apart from meeting the driver’s food expenses. Drivers of cabs hired for election duties are not given these allowances, it is learnt.

There is a rush of State-level officials and politicians leaders visiting Visakhapatnam city, even as it is yet to officially become the Executive capital of the State. Vehicles are being hired for the visits of dignitaries but the bills are not being cleared promptly, sources said.

Travel operators said that if the problem of delayed payments is not addressed and streamlining of the payment of bills is not done now, hiring of vehicles could turn out to be a major problem in the future.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/travel-operators-wary-of-giving-vehicles-on-rent-for-local-polls/article31053670.ece
115,2020/03/13,"Violence unleashed by YSRCP unprecedented, alleges BJP","‘Replace SEC to ensure free and fair elections to local bodies’

“The violence being unleashed by the YSRCP in the local body elections in the State is unprecedented and unmatched,” BJP State vice-president S. Vishnuvardhan Reddy has alleged.

Addressing the media here on Thursday, Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy said, “The State Home Minister does not know how to handle the situation, or keep law and order under control.”

Dig at police

Referring to the incidents of violence across the State since notification for the local body elections was issued, particularly the one at Macherla in Guntur district, Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy said the police was remaining a mute spectator in all the places.

“The ruling YSRCP government is ensuring that the candidates from the opposition parties do not file nomination papers to make the election one-sided and unanimous,” he alleged.

At many places, the officials did not give caste certificates so that candidates would not be able to file their nomination papers, he said.

“Let the election commission and the government declare the winners jointly so that elections are not necessitated,” Mr. Vishnuvardhan Reddy said sarcastically.

Criticising the DGP for “failing” to maintain law and order, he said the special observers were not answering the phone calls to receive complaints.

The BJP leader appealed to the Election Commission of India to act immediately against the State Election Commissioner and replace him to ensure free and fair elections.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/violence-unleashed-by-ysrcp-unprecedented-alleges-bjp/article31053605.ece
116,2020/03/13,"Ensure free and fair polls, Naidu urges Governor","Telugu Desam Party (TDP) national president N. Chandrababu Naidu on Thursday submitted a memorandum to Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan urging him to review the entire process of local bodies’ elections, and accordingly monitor for a free and fair conduct of the elections.

Speaking to reporters after meeting the Governor at the Raj Bhavan along with his party colleagues, Mr. Naidu said they apprised the Governor about violations relating to election code.

The TDP president alleged that the State Election Commission was merely watching the violations as a mute spectator. The Opposition party leaders were being attacked and terrorised. TDP leaders Bonda Umamaheswara Rao, and Buddha Venkanna, and lawyer were attacked when they visited Macherla as there was a serious violation of code of conduct, he said.

The official machinery was supporting the ruling party. The candidates were being chased and the police hasn’t acted in desired manner, he alleged.

Governments come and go but the police and courts were permanent. The police have to act in a non-partisan manner, Mr. Naidu said. Instead, the police were counselling candidates to withdraw the nominations so as to make the election unanimous, he alleged. He charged the YSRCP with making a mockery of democracy. There is a break down of law and order in the State and people were denied of fundamental rights, he alleged. “But we are not afraid and will not give up the fight. It is high time the people taught a befitting lesson to the YSRCP,” Mr. Naidu added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ensure-free-and-fair-polls-naidu-urges-governor/article31053593.ece
117,2020/03/13,Jagan wants to win elections by hook or by crook: Kanna,"YSRCP and TDP have no respect for democracy, says Pawan

BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana on Thursday said that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy appeared to have resolved to make the elections to the local bodies unanimous in favour of the YSRCP by physically attacking the opponents and blackmailing them.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy would have captured the local bodies by bringing about an Ordinance, or simply by nominating his candidates as was done in respect of cooperative societies had the government not been under compulsion to mobilise funds from the Central government as per the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, he observed.

Addressing the media along with his party’s State affairs in-charge Sunil Deodhar and JSP president Pawan Kalyan before releasing the alliance’s vision document (manifesto) for the local bodies’ elections here, Mr. Lakshminarayana alleged that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy warned the Ministers and MLAs that they would lose their job if they did not ensure the ruling party’s victory in the elections, and the violent incidents taking place across the State were a result of that threat.

‘Dictatorship’

Mr. Lakshminarayana said he had never seen such unruly scenes during the local body elections in his political career spanning more than four decades, and described what was being seen as a combination of “dictatorship and factionalism.”

Mr. Lakshminarayana said complaints to the State Election Commission (SEC) and the police evoked no response. Even if the candidates of the BJP, the JSP and other parties managed to file the papers, they were being rejected on flimsy grounds, he alleged.

If the people vote for the BJP-JSP alliance, it would put an end to the “anarchic rule of the YSRCP,” he asserted.

Mr. Pawan Kalyan said both the YSRCP and the TDP had no respect for democracy. While the former was conducting elections to the local bodies in a one-sided manner, the latter had completely avoided the elections during its term, he added.

He stated that if the SEC remained a mute spectator to the disturbances, its silence would be construed as encouraging criminalisation of politics.

118,2020/03/13,"Naidu cries foul, urges SEC to postpone or reissue notification","‘Officials on election duty sabotaging chances of opposition candidates’

TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu has written a letter to State Election Commissioner (SEC) N. Ramesh Kumar, urging him to either postpone or reissue election notification for the MPTC and ZPTC seats where the opposition party candidates are either not allowed to file their nomination papers or have been rejected with mala fide intention.

“The SEC can consider the applications or give time to submit the documents removed or changed,” Mr. Naidu said in the letter on Thursday.

Mr. Naidu alleged that several officers conspired to reject the nominations filed by the candidates of opposition parties in general, and TDP in particular, during their scrutiny.

After issuing the acknowledgement to the candidates, the officials were harassing them by saying that a paper was missing, he alleged.

The officials themselves were removing the papers, or altering the details of the candidates, and threatening the candidates saying false details had been furnished, he alleged.

Mr. Naidu further alleged that the officials on election duty were magnifying “minor and negligible aspects” in order to reject the nominations of the TDP candidates.

“At some places, proofs and evidences have been removed after submission of papers and false evidence attached. All candidates are not being invited at a time for scrutiny. They are invited individually and asked to withdraw their papers,” he said.

He also alleged that the officials were deliberately not giving the ‘no dues’ or caste certificates to the candidates, which was leading to rejection of their nominations.

In some mandals, the nominations of all the opposition candidates had been rejected to pave the way for the unanimous election of the ruling party candidates, he alleged.

Legal action sought

“The officials are violating all norms and are personally involved in sabotaging the chances of Opposition candidates. Such acts amount to forgery and cheating, and are punishable as per the Indian Penal Code,” he said, and demanded the SEC to take immediate action against the erring officials and initiate legal action against them.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-cries-foul-urges-sec-to-postpone-or-reissue-notification/article31053560.ece
119,2020/03/13,Major jolt to Telugu Desam as Karanam meets CM,"TDP MLA’s son joins YSRCP citing ‘good work’ done by Jagan

The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) suffered a jolt as its senior leader and MLA from Chirala Karanam Balarama Krishnamurthy on Thursday met Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy along with his son Venkatesh, setting off speculation over his next move.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy draped the party shawl on Mr. Venkatesh, signalling his entry into the party.

Mr. Krishnamurthy, a TDP strongman in Prakasam district who has been with the party since its inception, met the Chief Minister at his camp office at Tadepalli, where Minister for Environment and Forest Balineni Srinivasa Reddy was also present.

Though Mr. Krishnamurthy stopped short of announcing his exit from the TDP, it was evident that he had taken a decision already.

The YSRCP, on the other hand, had made it clear that it would not admit any MLA into the party until he or she resigned from the membership of the Legislative Assembly.

Spate of desertions

The development comes close on the heels of a spate of desertions in the TDP, leaving the party in tatters ahead of the local body elections scheduled in the last week of this month.

Mr. Krishnamurthy had won the Chirala seat by defeating Amanchi Krishna Mohan of the YSRCP.

“We have decided to join the YSRCP after seeing the good work done by Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy who has initiated several welfare schemes in a span of just nine months. We feel that we can serve the people better by being in the YSRCP,” said Mr. Venkatesh after meeting the Chief Minister.

Earlier this week, TDP MLC Dokka Manikya Vara Prasada Rao, former MLA S.A. Rahman and former Minister P. Rama Suba Reddy joined the YSRCP. Former vice-chairman of the Legislative Council Satish Reddy from Pulivendala resigned from the party citing personal reasons.

Other MLAs and MLCs who had left the TDP included Maddali Giridhara Rao (Guntur West), Pothula Sunitha ( Anantapur) and Ch. Sivanatha Reddy.

Those who joined the YSRCP after coming out of TDP were Kadiri Babu Rao (Kanigiri), Jupudi Prabhakar Rao (spokesperson), Mr. Rahman (Visakhapatnam), Beda Mastan (Nellore), Tota Trimurthulu (Ramachandapuram), Devineni Avinash (Gudivada), T.

120,2020/03/13,"Be ready to face challenges posed by new technologies, young lawyers told","“Young lawyers should be ready to face the challenges that will be posed by emerging fields of technologies such as data mining and artificial intelligence that will affect their work,” Judge of the High Court of Karnataka B.M. Shyam Prasad said in Belagavi on Friday.

He was speaking at the inauguration of the M.K. Nambyar National Moot Court Competition at KLS RL Law College.

“We are at the cusp of another technological innovation that will affect all walks of life. The work of lawyers will also be affected by advanced technology. We should all be prepared for it,’’ he said. He urged young law graduates and law schools to be open to such developments. He felt that moot court competitions are opportunities to expose students to such areas of knowledge. He pointed out that the earliest moot court competition about space law was held in India in 1992.

“The earliest moot courts in this country were held in 1962. In 30 years, they had evolved enough to discuss issues of space law,” he said.

He said that moot courts helped students discuss new ideas and effective ways to present those ideas. “At times, a seed sown in moot court develops into a special branch of law,” he said.

Moot courts train lawyers in simulated environments, just as pilots are trained in simulated environments. But pilots need experience and wisdom to navigate through turbulence, he said. Similarly, lawyers also face turbulence when the judges ask the most unexpected, inconvenient questions. They have to pass through it by their ingenuity and experience, he said.

Karnataka Law Society president Anant Mandagi said that unlike in the old times, today’s lawyers are being trained in a truly professional manner. He advised budding advocates not to mislead either the client or the court on facts and never to give false assurances to clients. A lawyer needs to be strong on facts and law. That would help build his reputation, he said.

121,2020/03/13,"Man gets death for rape, murder","The Second Additional District and Special Sessions Court in Kalaburagi on Friday sentenced Yallappa, a resident of Sedam, to capital punishment for sexual assault and murder of a minor girl.

As per court sources, the guilty had, at about 6 p.m. on December 2, 2019, lured the victim with some snacks and took her to a desolate place near a canal behind an anganwadi at Yakapur village and raped her. He later murdered her by strangulating her, as he thought that there were good chances of the victim revealing the crime to her parents. He then hid her clothes in a bid to destroy evidence.

Following a complaint lodged by the victim’s father, a case was registered under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (PoCSO) Act 2012.

Circle Inspector of Police (Sedam) Shankaragowda V. Patil investigated the case and filed a charge-sheet confirming the crimes specified in the First Information Report.

After hearing both sides and examining witnesses, judge Gopalappa S. found the accused guilty of sexual assault and murder of the minor girl and pronounced the judgment.

He awarded capital punishment to the guilty under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of IPC and Section 6 of PoCSO Act read with Section 376(2)(N) of IPC (punishment for rape).

He also awarded 10-year imprisonment and imposed a fine of ₹ 50,000 on him under Section 366(A) (procuration of minor girl) and awarded seven years rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of ₹ 50,000 on the accused under Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of IPC. He clarified that the punishment would run concurrently and not consecutively. The judge ordered the District Legal Services Authority to pay ₹ 10 lakh compensation to the victim. L.V.

122,2020/03/13,No COVID-19 cases in Mysuru; 69 under home quarantine,"Two samples test negative; one person isolated as precaution

As many as 69 people have been placed under home quarantine in Mysuru and about 37 people have completed the 28-day mandatory observation as a precautionary measure over the COVID-19 scare. So far, one person has been admitted to the isolation ward here and is being constantly monitored by a medical team. About 70 people have been placed under active monitoring.

Giving details on the situation, Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar, who held a high-level meeting with officials from all departments on Friday, said of three samples collected, two had tested negative. No confirmed case had been detected in Mysuru, he clarified. Results of samples from two suspected patients from Kodagu are awaited.

According to Mr. Sankar, the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases and the COVID-19 Regulations had been notified. There is no need to panic as Mysuru district administration is prepared to face any immediate emergency, he said.

Acting on directions from the government, six teams had been set up for surveillance and control of the virus. The teams will also look into contact tracing in case of suspected and confirmed cases. Other than the Health Department staff, officers and staff from other departments can also be assigned for duties. It’s a punishable offence if they refuse, he added.

Mr. Sankar said doctors, nursing and paramedical staff would be trained on handling cases and spreading awareness. Each designated team had been assigned tasks, including ensuring availability of necessary aid such as masks, gloves, protective gear, besides facilities like ventilators at the isolation wards. Other than the healthcare staff, nobody would be allowed to access the isolation wards and quarantine facility.

Mr. Sankar said those who had returned from COVID-19 affected countries in the last two weeks or had come in contact with person with COVID-19 disease or their kin, should self-quarantine at home for 14 days despite not having any symptoms.

People testing positive for COVID-19 even though he or she was not suffering from any symptoms needed to be isolated and treated as per protocols, he said.

The Deputy Commissioner advised people to self-declare if they had returned from affected countries. He clarified that the testing of samples at MMCRI would be done only as per ICMR guidelines.

No incidents of bird flu

Mr. Sankar said no bird flu incidents had been detected in Mysuru.

None of the samples tested positive for H5N8.

123,2020/03/13,Ranga Panchami was dry sans rain dance,"Nevertheless celebrations were colourful, though restrictions were in place

It was yet again the time for the streets of Hubballi to get soaked in myriad colours on the occasion of Ranga Panchami (celebrated on the fifth day of Holi festival) on Friday.

Although security restrictions, including prohibitory orders, were in place in a few communally sensitive localities, they did not hamper the spirit of the celebrations. However, the lack of permission for rain dance events and restrictions on the use of DJ music speakers had its effect on the celebrations, particularly among revellers.

Added to them was the coronavirus scare which resulted in many parents not allowing their young ones participate in the celebrations bringing down the number of participants in the revelry.

Despite the restrictions on vehicular movement and “no-man land” that come up in the city during the festival, people of different age groups — from the young ones to senior citizens, came out in considerable numbers (although not like in the previous years), sprayed colours, beat drums, blew trumpets and danced their heart out.

For the revellers, the restrictions, the barricades, heavy deployment of police and the presence of Rapid Action Force personnel hardly mattered. With the central business district remaining closed till evening, the revellers had a field day moving from one locality to another boisterously greeting everyone and spraying and smearing colours on their acquaintances.

But without the rain dance their celebration was dry this year and with the police not permitting DJ music, many missed dancing to the tune of hit numbers. However, DJ music was compensated by the performances of folk troupes that provided robust beats with their traditional drums of various forms and sizes.

As it has been seen in the recent years, the city roads witnessed more young girls on two-wheelers who moved from one locality to another celebrating the festival of colours. Those riding pillion behind the riders had desi whistles and carried small halage (traditional drums) with them.

Compared to last year, the celebration in the extension areas did not see much crowd because of the coronavirus scare. Meanwhile, senior citizens had their share of enjoyment and they played Holi near parks and places of worship.

Section 144 in Kamaripet and adjoining areas had little impact on the celebrations, but the rain dance set-ups had vanished and there was no thumping music.

Muslims too join

At various locations in the city members of the Muslim community too took part in the celebrations and welcomed the processions of idols taken out as part of Holi and garlanded the leaders. As they sprayed colours in the air and smeared them on each other, even the police on bandobast duty got drenched.

As it has been the practice, after the idols of Kamanna were taken out in procession, women and girls performed puja and subsequently, the effigies were burnt. The process of burning Kamanna went on till late in the evening and the celebrations concluded peacefully.

However, there was a small mishap resulting in a reveller suffering burns at Medar Oni. After the Kamanna made of bamboo was set on fire, it collapsed suddenly on one side. Among the revellers, one person suffered minor burns on his hand, the police said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/j3ptaw/article31062804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14HBHUBBALLIRANGAPANCHAMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ranga-panchami-was-dry-sans-rain-dance/article31062805.ece

The Mysuru district administration has resolved to crackdown on pharmacy outlets which create artificial scarcity and hoard masks, sanitizers and other protective aids.

The officials from the office of Drug Controller, Weights and Measurements and the FSSAI will look into the complaints of hoarding of masks which are in demand.

The complaints of masks being sold higher than their MRP can be lodged by calling the helpline on 104 or 1077.

However, Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar said the guidelines had been issued on the use of masks and who should actually wear masks. A healthy person need not have to wear mask. All masks should be discarded six hours after use.

“The healthcare staff, family members or attendants of people with symptoms of COVID-19 and those visiting hospitals (for other treatments) must wear masks.”

A mask is considered infected after use by a person and therefore it should be disposed in a proper manner, he added.

He said those spreading false and misleading information on COVID-19 scare on social media platforms and other mediums can be booked under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code.

When the top-down approach of the government had met with limited success, late D.M. Nanjundappa had come up with the bottom-up approach for ensuring integrated development of the State, according to M.S. Chandakavate.

Delivering a special lecture organised by the Centre for Applied Research in Economics at the Department of Economics of Karnatak University in Dharwad on Thursday, Prof. Chandakavate said that Prof. Nanjundappa’s approach helped in taking the benefits of economic growth to the deprived people in the 1970s.

He said that Prof. Nanjundappa, who headed the High Power Committee for Redressal of Regional Imbalance, was instrumental in designing and implementing decentralised planning in the State.

Recalling Prof. Nanjundappa’s work as Deputy Chairman of Karnataka State Planning Board and as Vice-Chancellor of Karnatak University, he said that Prof. Nanjundappa was committed to ensuring development with social justice, pro-poor development and development with a humane face. And, he contributed significantly to the development of the State, he said.

Prof. Chandakavate urged students to take lessons from Prof. Nanjundappa’s life and contribute to society.

Delivering a talk on “Financial Inclusion through Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana in India”, N.G. Chachadi termed financial inclusion as a pre-requisite for inclusive growth. He, however, said that financial inclusion had come down during the post-reforms period when compared to the situation in the pre-reforms period.

Presiding over the programme, Chairman of the Department of Economics R.R. Biradar said that the event was aimed at introducing the work culture of Prof. Nanjundappa. Prof. Najundappa was not only a good teacher but he was also a researcher, policy-maker, administrator and a great human being, he said.

126,2020/03/13,Protest against transfer of tahsildar,"Members of Dalit and pro-Kannada organisations took out a protest march from Town Hall Circle to the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Tumakuru on Friday demanding that the State government cancel the transfer order of Gubbi taluk tahsildar M. Mamatha.

Hundreds of agitators shouted slogans against the government for transferring a person who they said was working sincerely and efficiently.

Addressing the agitators near the Deputy Commissioner's office, dalit leader, Kodiyala Mahadeva alleged that there is a political conspiracy behind the transfer. He said an impartial inquiry has to be conducted into the incident where around 100 trees in the farm of Siddamma of Thippur in Gubbi taluk were felled in the presence of village accountant and revenue inspector. He also said that the village accountant and the revenue inspector have squarely put the blame on the tahsildar to escape. He also alleged that middlemen and politicians are behind the transfer.

He also demanded justice for Siddamma from the government and also justice for the tahsildar who has been made the scapegoat in the issue; and demanded registration of criminal cases against those who supplied the equipment to cut the trees and also against village accountant and other officers concerned who supported it.

Mr. Mahadeva sought records of village accountant and Circle Police Inspector of Gubbi.

Though the trees were cut on March 6, the video of Siddamma crying in front of the trees was recorded on March 8. He asked why there was a delay.

The protesters formed a human chain and warned the State government of intensifying their protest if the government failed to heed their demands.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/protest-against-transfer-of-tahsildar/article31061146.ece
127,2020/03/13,RSS to activate 15 lakh members through various social schemes,"It has conducted a survey to know their area of interest and time availability

In a bid to effectively harness the potential of its members, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) has conducted a national survey of nearly 15 lakh members to know their areas of interest as well as skills.

“We have conducted a survey of 15 lakh members aged above 30 years. Depending upon their area of interest, we will take up social programmes to involve them to bring about positive changes in society,” said RSS Akhil Bharatiya Prachar Pramukh Arun Kumar.

Briefing mediapersons in Bengaluru on Friday about the three-day conclave of the Sangh’s highest decision-making body - Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS) - which is set to be held at Channenahalli on the outskirts of Bengaluru from March 15, he said the ways and means of utilising the services of these members would be discussed at the conclave.

“We will draw up programmes that have a social thrust to utilise the services of our members,” he said. The idea was to use their services in their neighbourhood.

Meanwhile, sources in the RSS said that the survey had obtained information from members on aspects such as areas of their interest and specialisation; whether they wanted to involve themselves in building the organisation or take up social service;and if they wanted to take up social service, the areas where they want to engage themselves in such as education (holding tuition), health sector, slum areas etc. It had also asked them to specify if they wanted training and skill development in particular areas where they wanted to work.

The survey had asked them to specify the quantum of time they could dedicate for social work in a day/week or month.

The month-long survey that had been completed sometime in December 2019 was taken up as there was an increase in the number of members joining the RSS in the last few years, sources said, while noting that the organisation wanted to utilise their services effectively.

Referring to the three-day national conclave which would be held once a year, Mr. Arun Kumar said around 1,500 elected representatives of RSS and associated organisations would take part in the proposed event.

The conclave would not only review the implementation of plans and programmes that had been finalised in the previous year, but would also share the experiences related to their implementation by different regions. The meeting would also set the agenda for the Sangh’s work for the coming year and finalise the tour programme of its national office-bearers.

132,2020/03/13,"₹4,000 crore needed to provide basic facilities in govt. schools","‘Drive planned for construction of separate toilets for boys and girls’

Primary and Secondary Education Minster S. Suresh Kumar told the Legislative Assembly on Thursday that about ₹4,000 crore would be required for providing basic facilities such as toilets, water, playground, electricity, and smart classrooms in 48,008 government schools in the State.

In his reply to Bandeppa Kashempur (JD-S) during the Question Hour in the Assembly, Mr. Kumar said a massive drive would be undertaken this year for construction of separate toilets for boys and girls in all schools. Under the ‘Subhadra Shale’, MGNREGA funds would be used to provide facilities such as toilets and playground.

Mr. Kumar said just construction of toilets was not enough. Maintenance of toilets was equally important. Many toilets were not used in schools owing to their poor maintenance.

Mr. Kashempur said many schools have been deprived of basic facilities such as toilets. But government records indicate existence of toilets in 98% of government schools, he said.

On R.V. Deshpande’s (Congress) suggestion on mobilising CSR funds for construction of toilets, Mr. Kumar said companies have been showing utilisation of their funds under the CSR only in Benglauru. “Who will spend CSR funds in rural Karnataka?”, he said.

Some members suggested use of services of gram panchayat staff for maintenance of toilets. Others suggested that school students must be taught how to clean toilets, without recruiting Group ‘D’ staff for cleaning purposes.

On alleged misuse of funds under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the Minister said action would be taken against all those officials and contractors who siphoned of funds.

Health and Family Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu told the Legislative Assembly on Thursday that 2,000 doctors would be appointed in April to fill vacancies in primary health centres and government hospitals.

Replying to A.T. Ramaswamy of the JD(S) during the Question Hour, Mr. Sriramulu said a process was on for recruitment of 800 nurses to fill vacancies across the State.

He said differences in pay scales of doctors in the Medical Education and Health and Family departments was one of the reasons for doctors joining medical education. Doctors in the Medical Education Department receive higher pay therefore doctors join that department and not the Health and Family Welfare Department, he said.

Minister for Environment and Forest B.S. Anand Singh told the House that a meeting of legislators would be called soon to discuss the menace of wild elephants in different districts. He told Appachu Ranjan (BJP) that monthly allowance of ₹2,000 was being paid for those people who have become permanently physically challenged owing to elephant attack, besides one-time compensation on humanitarian grounds.

M.P. Kumaraswamy of the BJP demanded permanent jobs for those people who have become physically challenged owing to wild elephant attack.

134,2020/03/13,"There is no need to panic, official tells people","Focus on hygiene and cleanliness instead to improve immunity, says Deputy Commissioner

Dharwad Deputy Commissioner Deepa Cholan on Thursday visited the Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) Hospital and the Railway Hospital in Hubballi to oversee preparedness in these hospitals to handle COVID-19 cases.

Along with Chief Executive Officer of the Dharwad Zilla Panchayat B.C. Sateesh, Ms. Cholan inspected the facilities at both these hospitals and sought information from the health officials about the steps taken so far.

At KIMS Hospital, an isolation ward with 12 beds has been set up with a provision to extend it up to 32 beds.

Ms. Cholan said that there was no need for the general public to panic. People should focus on maintaining hygiene, cleanliness to improve one’s immunity, she added. Director of KIMS Ramalingappa Antaratani said that till date not a single case of COVID-19 had been reported in the district. Although two suspected cases were reported, laboratory reports were negative. All necessary steps had been taken to provide requisite treatment to patients suspected to have COVID-19, he said.

Subsequently, the Deputy Commissioner visited the Central Railway Hospital on Gadag Road and inspected the isolation wards and other facilities created at the hospital. Medical Superintendent of KIMS Hospital Arun Kumar, District Health and Family Welfare Officer Yashwanth Madeenkar, Chief Health Officer of Railway Hospital Ravi, Tahsildar Shashidhar Madyal and others provided information to the Deputy Commissioner.

Vigil stepped up

Meanwhile, in Dharwad the district administration has stepped up vigil and made special medical arrangements to handle possible cases in the district.

Ms. Cholan and Mr. Sateesh and a team of officials visited several private hospitals too. Ms. Deepa during her visit to the Civil Hospital interacted with District Surgeon Shivkumar Mankar and collected information on the steps taken.

Dr. Mankar said that the District Civil Hospital has taken up several measures following an advisory issued by the Union Health and Family Welfare Ministry. Accordingly, an isolation ward has been set up 200 metres away from the OPD and IPD sections.

According to Dr. Mankar, a five-bed exclusive and dedicated ward to deal with coronavirus infection cases has been set up and trained staff have been deputed. This ward would function round the clock.

He said that there is no specific treatment for coronavirus infection and necessary arrangements have been made to provide supportive treatment to affected persons. To ensure safety of doctors and hospital staff, special personal protection kits have been procured, Dr. Mankar said. Sufficient N95 masks too have been procured.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/phxbty/article31054054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12HBHUBBALLICOVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/there-is-no-need-to-panic-official-tells-people/article31054055.ece
135,2020/03/13,ESIC medical complex in Kalaburagi to house 400-bed quarantine ward to tackle COVID-19,"A largely unoccupied student hostel building on campus has been identified for the purpose

As part of its preparations to handle the situation because of the spread of COVID-19 and the directions from higher-ups in the Union government, the Kalaburagi district administration is going to establish a 400-bed quarantine ward at the ESIC medical complex on the outskirts of Kalaburagi.

Addressing a media conference here on Thursday, Deputy Commissioner B. Sharat said that a students hostel building on ESIC campus, which had largely been unoccupied and detached from the main medical block, would be developed into a well-equipped quarantine ward to keep patients with symptoms of COVID-19.

To a question, the officer said that the Union government had notified the establishment of such wards in all ESIC medical complexes across India.

Precautionary measures

On the precautionary measures suggested by the State government in a video conference, Mr. Sharat said that all national and international conferences, religious carnivals and other such events where people would gather in large number would be avoided in the district.

“Our Health Department officials would be meeting the administrators of Sharanabasaveshwara Samsthan and discuss the precautionary measures to be taken during the annual Sharanabasaveshwara Jatra.

“I request people suffering from fever, cough, cold, running nose, nose congestion, sore throat and breathlessness not to attend festivities during the religious carnival,” he said.

The officer told the presspersons that the administration would shortly establish screening facilities and a helpdesk at all tourist spots in the district.

“We will shortly hold meetings with owners of shopping malls, multiplexes and other business establishments where people gather in large number and sensitise them on the precautionary measures to be taken,” he said.

As per the Union government guidelines, Mr. Sharat said, the Airports Authority of India (AUI) would collect all details, including destinations and native place in the country, of all Indians who return from foreign trips upon their landing in India and share them with the district collectors concerned for follow-up.

“We will home-quarantine all those who return from foreign countries for 14 days and monitor them, though they may not show any symptoms of COVID-19,” Mr. Sharat said.

Testing facility

Considering the increasingly mounting pressure on the National Institute of Virology, Bengaluru, for the examination of samples concerning COVID-19, the State government has decided to establish throat swab and blood sample testing facilities in Kalaburagi, Mangaluru, Mysuru and Ballari, Mr. Sharat said.

“The Gulbarga Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) has the required equipment for testing the samples for COVID-19. The medical staff need kits and training to start the testing. They will be provided all these facilities shortly so that the testing could be done here itself,” Mr. Sharat said.

Guidelines

Asked about the delay in transporting the samples of suspected COVID-19 patients to the Bengaluru laboratory, Mr. Sharat said that certain protocols and guidelines should be maintained in handling and transporting samples.

“We were told not to transport the samples with our medical staff as such samples could be handled by only those who were trained in it.

“As per Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines, only three agencies are thus far notified by the Union government for the job. Strict adherence to such protocols might have caused delay,” Mr. Sharat said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/5hzc47/article31054047.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGKALABURAGIESIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/esic-medical-complex-in-kalaburagi-to-house-400-bed-quarantine-ward-to-tackle-covid-19/article31054050.ece
136,2020/03/13,"Assembly stalemate ends as Ramesh Kumar, Sudhakar express regret","Speaker drops privilege motions sought to be moved by the Minister and Siddaramaiah

The stalemate in the Legislative Assembly over Tuesday evening’s war of words between the former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar and Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar ended on Thursday with Speaker Vishweshwar Hegde Kageri dropping privilege motions after both the members expressed regret over their remarks.

Both Dr. Sudhakar and Mr. Ramesh Kumar said they would express regret in case they had breached privileges of members and the House during the debate on the Constitution of India.

Following the war of words on Tuesday, Dr. Sudhakar had sought to move a privilege motion against Mr. Ramesh Kumar and leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah had sought to move a similar motion against Dr. Sudhakar, while some BJP members had even sought suspension of Mr. Ramesh Kumar on Wednesday.

The former Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar speaking in the Legislative Assembly on Thursday

As soon as the House met on Thursday, Mr. Siddaramaiah sought to move the motion against Dr. Sudhakar, claiming that the latter breached the privileges of Mr. Ramesh Kumar and the House by describing disqualification of 17 Congress and JD(S) legislators as a “conspiracy” hatched against them by the then Speaker (Mr. Ramesh Kumar) last year.

Mr. Siddaramaiah said the Supreme Court had partially upheld the order on disqualification passed by the then Speaker. “As the Speaker, Mr. Ramesh Kumar passed the order. Where is the conspiracy in it? Against whom the conspiracy was hatched?” the former Chief Minister asked, and urged Mr. Kageri to take action against Dr. Sudhakar for his remarks on the Supreme Court order and insulting the Speaker’s chair.

Dr. Sudhakar also sought to move the motion against Mr. Ramesh Kumar for allegedly using “unparliamentary words” against him when he was speaking on the Constitution and cutting short his speech.

Dr. Sudhakar, a three-time member, said he read out only the apex court’s judgment on the disqualification of 17 legislators and alleged that injustice had been meted out to them by partial and biased actions of the then Speaker.

In his spirited counter, Dr. Sudhakar read out some of the remarks made against disqualified legislators by Mr. Ramesh Kumar when he was the Speaker. Instead of being impartial, the Speaker was biased and disqualified them for the entire term of the Assembly, the Minister said.

“I have come here because of my hard work, though I do not not have any political dynasty. Hang me if I have crossed over to the BJP by taking money,” Dr. Sudhakar said, and expressed his regrets if he had breached privileges of the members of the House.

Mr. Ramesh Kumar said, “I standby every word I had uttered as the Speaker. I am not withdrawing it. I have not said any unparliamentary word to show disrespect to any member of the House.” There was no need for him to be in public life by telling lies. He, however, would not become a small person by expressing regret if any member got hurt by his remarks during the debate, Mr. Kumar said.

Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy appealed to the Speaker to drop the two motions as both the members had expressed their regret over the developments. Immediately, Mr. Kageri said he had dropped the motions sought to be moved by both Mr. Siddaramaiah and Dr. Sudhakar.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kvmc35/article31053857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BGSUDHAKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/assembly-stalemate-ends-as-ramesh-kumar-sudhakar-express-regret/article31053858.ece
137,2020/03/13,Will act against clubs promoting gambling in border areas: Bommai,"‘Clubs taking benefit of lacunae in the gambling Act’

Amid allegation that certain clubs, registered under the Companies Act, and operating in State border areas have been promoting gambling in a big way, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Thursday told the Legislative Council that the government was committed to taking action against such clubs. He also acknowledged that such clubs coming up now has become a problem in border areas.

“We will appeal to the court that has issued orders earlier to enable clubs to function but with a host of riders. Clubs are taking benefit of lacunae in the gambling Act. We need to strengthen the Act as well and we will do it,” he told the Council when question on operation of three clubs in Raichur came up for discussion. “The clubs are using tokens instead of money to circumvent the court order that strictly stipulated money should not be involved,” he added.

According to the Minister, while DVR Recreational Club was started in 2014, two clubs — Nandi Sports and Social Association Club — came up in 2018.

Congress member Basavaraj Patil Itagi, who raised the issue, said that despite best efforts, these clubs registered under the Companies Act were thriving. “As much as 25 acres has been taken on lease by one of the clubs just to enable parking space. Hundreds of cars ferry people from Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam, and Vijayawada. They are using corrupt means to continue their business,” he said.

Adding to the discussion, another member from Raichur, N.S. Boseraju said these clubs have mushroomed in border areas because Telengana has banned clubs, and most of those running these clubs are from Telengana and Tamil Nadu. “Licences have been issued to three more clubs. They need to be controlled.” He alleged that one of the clubs had even offered him protection money in the past.

In response, Mr. Bommai said the State government was committed to taking a decision to stop such activities.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/will-act-against-clubs-promoting-gambling-in-border-areas-bommai/article31053783.ece
138,2020/03/13,150 acres for Film City identified near Bengaluru: Yediyurappa,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Thursday said that 150 acres of land had been identified near Bengaluru for the much-delayed Film City project, and that the work could be started soon if the film fraternity agreed to the location of the land. He, however, did not reveal the area where the Film City will come up.

Responding to a question by film actor and Congress member Jaimala on the Film City, he said that though it had been spoken about for several decades, there was no allocation. “For the first time, I have allocated ₹500 crore. We have identified 150 acres near Bengaluru and I will take you all to the location. If all of you agree, we can immediately start work on it,” he said.

Film City was first proposed during late Ramakrishna Hedge regime and 350 acres was allotted at Hessarghatta, which, however, ran into legal trouble. While erstwhile Siddaramaiah government allocated 108 acres of land in Mysuru, the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy wanted to move it to Ramanagaram.

Jaimala favours Mysuru

Earlier, Ms. Jaimala said that though for the first time an allocation had been made in the Budget, there was confusion over whether it will be in Mysuru, Ramanagaram or Bengaluru. “There is no clarity. Let the project happen in Mysuru because it was in the Mysuru palace in 1929 that the then Maharaja captured a play called ‘Nirupama’ using a camera. That is the birth place of Kannada cinema,” she added. Ms. Jaimala suggested that the Mysuru land could be utilised to build a studio and technical infrastructure could be set up in Bengaluru. Another member and film producer Sandesh Nagaraj also urged the Chief Minister to expedite the process of setting up the Film City.

Mr. Yediyurappa, however, requested them not to divert from the plan of having it in Bengaluru. “If you really want to have a Film City, do not divert attention to Mysuru or Ramanagaram. I will take all of you to show the land in the first week of April,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/150-acres-for-film-city-identified-near-bengaluru-yediyurappa/article31053645.ece

The video of the incident which went viral on social media also shocked conservationists. Though the incident was explained as accidental and as an inadvertent action that occurred when the elephant was charging at them, the video indicated that they were not in any danger. Also, instead of firing in the air, the pellet was aimed at the elephant’s forehead and hence the outrage.

140,2020/03/13,Surveillance will turn out to be a big challenge: Shylaja,"Health Minister says infected NoRKs could give the monitoring mechanism at airports the slip

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja on Friday indicated that battling the COVID-19 outbreak was likely to be a long haul for the State.

She told the Assembly that tens of thousands of non-resident Keralites (NoRKs) were expected in the State and infected persons could slip through the surveillance net at airports. The House adjourned its routine business to discuss the grave situation that prevailed in the State after the virus resurfaced in Pathanamthitta a fortnight ago. The Minister said no reconnaissance network was foolproof.

On Central directive

Ms. Shylaja refuted the Opposition’s accusation that the government had let COVID-19 re-emerge in the State in March by neglecting the Central government’s directive to quarantine mandatorily citizens arriving in the country from COVID-19 hotspots, including Italy.

The family of three that returned from Italy and infected neighbours had concealed their port of departure to dodge the State’s disease surveillance mechanism.

They wilfully disregarded airline advisories and blindsided the health authorities at the airport by stating they had commenced travel from elsewhere. The government could halt the spread of COVID-19 from students who had returned from Wuhan in China. However, the family from Italy appeared to lack the same candour.

Oppn. charge

Deputy Leader of the Opposition M.K. Muneer, who piloted the adjournment motion, criticised the government for having attempted to stigmatise Keralites returning from COVID-19 ravaged Italy. He said the cyclical press conferences conducted by Ms. Shylaja had caused needless worry in society.

The treasury benches referred to Ms. Shylaja in glowing terms. CPI(M) legislator Saji Cheriyan called her an “angel”.

At the same time, K.U. Jenish Kumar of the CPI(M) equated the Minister to a mother who protectively shielded her children.

The Opposition appeared unimpressed. Congress legislator Anil Akkara said the Minister had used the crisis to burnish her public image. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the Minister considered herself to be above all criticism.

Ms. Shylaja should not expect the Opposition to sing paeans of praise for her like some cyberwarriors the party had employed for propaganda.

The Opposition’s job was to hold the government accountable, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/g0duxw/article31063633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TVTVCOVID-19,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/surveillance-will-turn-out-to-be-a-big-challenge-shylaja/article31063634.ece

People were cautious in general and many were seen avoiding handshakes and hugs. Many people reached the mosques for the mass prayers after completing the ablutions from home. People preferred tap water for ablutions to the traditional mini pond or tank. “When the COVID-19 threat is in the air, we better avoid doing wudu (ablutions) from a tank or houlu,” said Mohammed Mustafa, a trader.

The prayers, including the two sermons or khutba, were shortened at several mosques. People had been advised to come to mosque with precautions.

The Ayyappa temple at Sabarimala was opened on Friday afternoon for the five-day monthly rituals in the Malayalam month of Meenom that begins on Saturday.

The Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) has appealed to devotees not to visit the hillock against the backdrop of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, around 200 pilgrims turned up for darshan on Friday, as against the usual turnout of 10,000 pilgrims. A majority was from the neighbouring States of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

The police personnel deployed at Nilackal apprised the Sabarimala-bound pilgrims on the need to keep themselves away from the hillock in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak in Ranni taluk that houses the pilgrimage centre of Sabrimala. A medical team at Pampa measured the body temperature, using infrared thermometers, before they entered the trekking path.

Sudheer Namboodiri opened the temple in the presence of Tantri (chief priest) Kandararu Maheswararu Mohanararu and TDB Executive Officer Rajendraprasad at 5 p.m. The temple rituals will begin with Ganapati homom on Saturday morning, the first day of the Malayalam month of Meenom.

‘Only necessary rituals’

Mr. Rajendraprasad said only unavoidable rituals would be performed at the temple on all the five days. Devotees will not be able to offer Neyyabhishekom or other offerings at Sabarimala during these days.

The Appam-Aravana counters and the Neyyabhishekom ticket counters remained close at the Sannidhanam and Pampa. The Tantri said only Ushapuja, Utchapuja, Deeparadhana, and Athazhapuja would be performed at the temple.

Special rituals such as Udayasthamanapuja, Sahasrakalasapuja, Padipuja, Pushpabhishekom, and Kalabhabhishekom will not be performed during the period as per the directions of the TDB.

The Tantri too urged the Ayyappa devotees to cooperate with the temple authorities and try to postpone their pilgrimage against the backdrop of the epidemic threat. The temple will be closed after Athazhapuja on March 18 evening.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/quyzxj/article31063586.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvpt-pilgrims2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sabarimala-opens-to-sparse-pilgrim-flow/article31063587.ece
143,2020/03/13,State’s soil museum on solid ground,"Twenty soil monoliths brought from 15 States and Andamans

It is the museum of something that you step on every day, but rarely notice. And it is about to get a lot bigger. The Soil Museum run by the State Soil Survey and Soil Conservation Department at Parottukonam in the district is expanding its collection with samples collected from all over the country.

Twenty soil monoliths — each weighing about 30-35 kg — have arrived at the museum from 15 States and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The monoliths represent 20 agro-ecological regions in India. The Soil Museum expects to have them on display in a month’s time.

This is a major acquisition for the six-year-old museum which till now featured samples from only Kerala — 1.5-metre-high monoliths of 82 benchmark soils encountered in the State’s 27 major land resource areas. The new arrivals arguably make the State Soil Museum the best-stocked of its kind in the country.

Benchmark soil

“Soils from the north-eastern States are represented by one sample each from Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya. One sample each have also come in from Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. There are two samples each from Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh and three from Karnataka,” said Bindu Rajagopal, Joint Director, Soil Survey.

The new samples were acquired through the National Bureau of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning, Ms. Rajagopal added. The museum, which aims to raise public awareness about soils, opened in January 2014 with monoliths of 82 benchmark soils. To be classified as a ‘benchmark soil,’ the soil has to be found extensively in a given region. Further, it should hold an important position in the soil classification system and human activities such as agriculture. Once a monolith is extracted, it undergoes a laborious conservation before it is mounted for display.

A visitor to the museum is provided detailed descriptions of each soil type, their location and advantages such as crop compatibility. At the moment, it has on display 78 monoliths as four have been taken down for repairs.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/7qtk2k/article31063566.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvtiki,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/states-soil-museum-on-solid-ground/article31063567.ece
144,2020/03/13,Village panics as man under isolation dies,"‘Death due to coronary artery disease’

Panic gripped Chengalam village, near Kottayam, when a 68-year-old man who lived near the house of a COVID-19 infected couple died on Friday. He was serving an isolation period at his house when he developed uneasiness.

Samples of his throat swab have been sent for examination and the results are expected in two days. The cremation would be held after taking precautions. His relatives have been asked to keep a safe distance from the body.

District Collector P.K.

146,2020/03/13,Rail passenger traffic takes a hit,"₹4 lakh being refunded to commuters in Thiruvananthapuram division daily

The COVID-19 outbreak has taken a toll on Railways with booking cancellations and a dip in passenger traffic.

Most cancellations are for mail and express trains to north India. The usually crowded passenger and inter-city trains, reservation centres, and booking offices now have fewer patrons, with commuters either skipping or postponing journeys.

Confirmed seats are available for many mail and express trains and the waiting list is thin. Group travel has almost come to a standstill. However, there are fewer cancellations to the northeast. Platforms at key stations are not very crowded any more. Many restaurants and shops are not getting revenue even for salary payment. “Daily ₹4 lakh is being refunded to commuters in the division and this will give a picture of the volume of cancellations. Passenger trains to Shatabdi trains have been hit as no one wants to take a risk,” senior divisional commercial manager Rajesh Chandran told The Hindu.

He said revenue was down by one-fourth in the last few days.

Major reasons

The alert sounded by the government, closure of educational institutions, and tourists leaving destinations en masse are the main reasons for the fall in passenger traffic and cancellations, divisional railway manager Shirish Kumar Sinha said.

Railways are hoping that the situation would improve in a couple of days and people would travel during April and May. “If the situation does not improve by month end, the earnings in the division will take a hit this year,” Mr. Sinha said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/po8uq4/article31063539.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TVTVRAILCORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/rail-passenger-traffic-takes-a-hit/article31063540.ece

150,2020/03/13,Culling of birds to begin today,"Restrictions will continue in Parappanangadi, Tirurangadi municipal limits

The restrictions in the Parappanangadi and Tirurangadi municipal limits following the outbreak of bird flu will continue for three months even after the culling of birds takes place within one-kilometre area of Palathingal on Saturday and Sunday.

The killing of birds being bred in the region, including chicken and ducks, will start on Saturday morning. The licences of all poultry shops in the Tirurangadi and Parappanangadi municipal limits have been suspended as a measure to counter bird flu.

Top officials of the Animal Husbandry Department met the civic heads of Parappanangadi and Tirurangadi on Friday and got the one-kilometre area earmarked for culling.

Rapid response teams

The culling will be done by 10 rapid response teams (RRTs) comprising 20 veterinary surgeons, 119 livestock inspectors, and 30 attendants. The culling of 4,000 birds will take place before Monday. They will be buried in the same locality as part of checking the spread of the disease.

The district administration on Friday assured the people that compensation would be given for the culled birds. But the rate would be decided by the government.

Cleaning drive

A special cleaning drive would be taken up for three days after the culling. Bird cages, feeding plates, and eggs would also be destroyed along with the culling.

A secondary examination would be conducted on the fifth day after culling in the one-kilometre region. If any bird was found in that inspection, it would be confiscated and killed.

S. Nandakumar, disease investigation officer from the State Institute for Animal Diseases, Palode, said no compensation would be given to the birds culled in the secondary stage.

The government would submit a sanitation certificate to the Centre after the culling process. Random samples would be collected from within 10-km radius every fortnight and sent for examination to national laboratories at Bhopal or Bengaluru. This would continue for three months. The Centre would give a certificate only if the tests were negative.

Dr. Nandakumar said the bird flu management would be over only when the Centre issued a certificate.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sya0dg/article31063437.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvmp-birds,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/culling-of-birds-to-begin-today/article31063427.ece
151,2020/03/13,Coronavirus | Kerala braces itself for long haul,"Health Minister says surveillance network not always foolproof

Kerala Health Minister K. K. Shylaja on Friday indicated that battling COVID-19 outbreak was likely to be a long haul for the State.

Also read: Coronavirus: The story of a Kerala vlogger who documented his stay in isolation ward

She told the Assembly that tens of thousands of non-resident Keralites would arrive in the State for summer and infected persons could slip through the surveillance net at airports.

The House had adjourned its routine business to discuss the grave situation that prevailed in the State after the virus resurfaced in Pathanamthitta a fortnight ago. The Minister said no reconnaissance network was foolproof.

Ms Shylaja refuted the Opposition’s accusation that the government had caused COVID-19 to remerge in the State in March by ignoring the central government’s directive to mandatorily quarantine citizens arriving in the country from coronavirus hotspots, including Italy.

Also read: Coronavirus threat: Kerala Assembly adjourns sine die ahead of schedule

She said the family of three that returned from Italy and infected neighbours had concealed their port of departure to dodge the State’s disease surveillance mechanism.

They ignored airline advisories and blindsided the health authorities at the airport by stating they had commenced travel from elsewhere. The government could restrict the spread of COVID-19 from students who had returned from Wuhan in China. However, the family from Italy appeared to lack the same candour.

Also read: Coronavirus: Second Kerala patient discharged

Deputy Leader of Opposition and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) legislator M. K. Muneer, who piloted the adjournment motion, criticized the government for having attempted to stigmatize Keralites returning from COVID-19 ravaged Italy. He said the cyclical press conferences conducted by Ms Shylaja had caused needless worry in society.

The treasury benches referred to Ms Shylaja in glowing terms. Communist Party of India (Marxist) legislator Saji Cheriyan called her an “angel”. At the same time, K.U. Jenish Kumar of the CPM equated the Minister to a mother who protectively shielded her children.

The Opposition appeared unimpressed. Congress legislator Anil Akkara said the Minister had used the crisis to enhance her public image. Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the Minister considered herself to be above all criticism. Ms Shylaja should not expect the Opposition to sing paeans of praise for her, he said.

152,2020/03/13,Coronavirus threat: Kerala Assembly adjourns sine die ahead of schedule,"The Kerala Legislative Assembly adjourned sine die on Friday against the backdrop of the COVD-19 threat prevailing in the State.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) had decided to cut short the current session to address the situation precipitated by the contagion that had resurfaced in Pathanamthitta in Kerala a fortnight ago.

Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan announced the adjournment but set no future date for resumption. The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) had opposed the move.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala had on Thursday termed the move to shorten the session as alarmist.

He said the government should reassure the public. Ideally, its actions should not exaggerate the threat of contagion and spread unnecessary, fear and panic in society by calling off the Assembly.

Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullapally Ramachandran pointed out that both Houses of the Parliament and Assemblies in other States were in session despite the outbreak. If Kerala adjourns its Assembly, it will send a wrong message to the world, he added.

The government had initiated a partial lockdown after a fresh COVID-19 case resurfaced in Pathanamthitta on February 29. Kerala had reported the first coronavirus case in the country on January 30.

154,2020/03/13,Maradu: delay in removal of debris to invite penal action,"45-day time frame set by the Supreme Court expires

The joint committee appointed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to oversee the debris removal process following the demolition of the four apartment buildings at Maradu is likely to suggest penal measures against those responsible for crossing the 45-day time-frame set by the Supreme Court.

The committee will submit its affidavit on debris removal before the tribunal on Friday.

The panel was formed after the NGT took suo motu cognisance of delay in removal of steel and concrete waste from the four sites. The joint committee consists of the District Collector, Ernakulam; Revenue Divisional Officer, Fort Kochi; Chief Environmental Engineer, Pollution Control Board, Ernakulam, and Secretary, Maradu Municipality.

The committee accepted the finding of the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management appointed by the tribunal that the process of segregation and removal of waste was not at the expected pace. The company engaged in segregating steel from the debris had sought a 20-day extension to complete its work.

It could realise only 60% of the target by the end of February.

The joint committee observed that any decision on extending the schedule for debris removal could be taken in accordance with the Supreme Court directives and the recommendations of the tribunal. It will inform the NGT that wind breakers were not set up around the sites as per the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules. The SLMC had asked the authorities to set up metal sheet barriers at a height of 35 feet at the demolition sites.

Inspections revealed that barriers provided on the roadside close to the Alfa Serene site had a height of only 15 feet. It was also found that geo textile barrier at a height of 10 feet was provided beside the backwaters near the Golden Kayaloram site, which was not sufficient to stop the flow of dust into nearby areas. Similarly, geo textile barrier at a height of only 10 feet was seen provided near the backwaters near Holy Faith H2O and Jain Coral Cove sites.

The committee will apprise the tribunal that there was no display of dust mitigation measures at the sites for public viewing. No protective measures like use of geo textiles were put in place in trenches near the lake side of Alfa Serene and Golden Kayaloram sites to prevent the flow of contaminated water into the backwaters.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pgzb0m/article31055782.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12KRAMARADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/maradu-delay-in-removal-of-debris-to-invite-penal-action/article31055783.ece

163,2020/03/13,Maoist has three cases against her in Kerala,"Suspected Maoist Srimathi alias Shobita alias Shoba, who was arrested by the Q Branch of Tamil Nadu police in Coimbatore on Wednesday, has at least three cases against her in Kerala apart from nine cases in Karnataka.

Sources privy to the investigation said anti-Naxal squads in the three States had been maintaining her profile as Srimathi, but she claimed that her identity was Shoba during questioning. They said that Shoba's profile was first created by the anti-Naxal squad in Karnataka as Srimathi from Chikkamagaluru in Karnataka and this was circulated to their counterparts in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

An official, who questioned Shoba told The Hindu, that she had been camping in forests of Tamil Nadu and Kerala coming under Kabani Dalam of the Communist Party of India (Maoist).

“Prior to Shoba's arrest, she was booked in Kerala in connection with an exchange of fire between Thunderbolt anti-Naxal squad of Kerala and a group of Maoists at Manjikkandi near Agali in Palakkad district on October 28 and 29. Four Maoists — Manivasagam, Karthi, Rema and Aravind — were killed, while a few others, including Shoba, managed escape. She was said to have suffered a bullet wound in the thigh,” said the official.

The three other cases registered against her were for pasting posters of CPI (Maoist) in public place and for destroying camera traps set up by Kerala Forest Department.

Sections of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) were invoked against her in the three cases.

The Q Branch arrested her for offences under Sections 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the IPC, 20 (punishment for being member of terrorist gang or organisation) 30 (claims by third party) of the UAPA.

Q Branch produced her before the Coimbatore District and Principal Sessions Judge R. Sakthivel who remanded her in judicial custody till March 26.

The District Legal Services Authority had provided her a woman advocate for legal assistance when produced at the court. Advocate S. Sathyabalan appeared before the court and expressed his willingness to be Shoba's counsel which she agreed. Shoba told the judge that she was a daily wage worker and she was unaware why Q Branch arrested her. When the judge asked Shoba to read out a text, she said that she was illiterate. She was lodged in Coimbatore Central Prison. Q Branch claimed the second woman who got out from bus while taking Shoba into custody from Anaikatti on Wednesday morning was a policewoman in mufti and not a suspected Maoist.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/maoist-has-three-cases-against-her-in-kerala/article31054353.ece

165,2020/03/13,Rajini’s move gets mixed response,"Actor Rajinikanth’s “political ideals” evoked mixed response from political parties in the State on Thursday.

“I am still not confident that he will take the political plunge. He is a good actor and I like him. But he is not MGR. This is my personal view and this won’t stand in the way of Rajinikanth entering into politics,” Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri said.

VCK leader Thol. Thirumavalavan said the actor had indirectly indicated to his fans that he was not coming to politics. “From the 1990s, his fans have been urging him to enter politics. For the last few years he has been saying he will make an announcement. However, his fans would be disappointed today,” he said.

Mr. Thirumavalavan said the actor can make it transparent and tell his fans directly that he was not interested in politics. and they should see him only as an actor. “Instead of waiting for changing the system, why can’t he make the plunge and correct it,” he said.

BJP leader Pon. Radhakrishnan said the people had always been ready for an revolution and change.

“In 1977 they wanted MGR. In 1993-94 they wanted Vaiko. They wanted Vijayakanth and G.K. Moopanar. Rajinikanth made a big mistake by supporting the DMK in 1996,” he said.

“My wish is that he should join the BJP. Since he has said he will start a political party, we have to wait and watch,” Mr. Radhakrishnan said.

He pointed that people backed by the actor have also become CM, so it cannot be said there won’t be support if the actor is not the CM candidate.

Seeman, chief coordinator of Naam Tamilar Katchi welcomed the actor’s announcement and wished him well. “This is what we have been fighting for 10 years and we are confident of winning,” he said.

“Not to be CM candidate is actor’s view. There have been different styles, . When Periyar started Dravidar Kazhagam he did not want power. He fought for equality and social justice. Anna’s approach was different. He wanted power to achieve the goals,” Amma Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary T.T.V.

DMK Deputy Floor Leader Duraimurugan expressed his fear in the State Legislative Assembly on Thursday over the increasing number of community dogs in the State and further urged the State government to take steps to implement the animal birth control.

Joining a debate on lack of availability of anti-rabies vaccines in the House, Mr. Duraimurugan said the government should look at controlling the number of dogs before looking at availability of vaccines. “Those days, when we were young, there were only about 20 dogs on the streets. But, these days, there are about some 200 of them. I wonder whether they are administered birth control measures,” an animated Mr. Duraimurugan said.

167,2020/03/13,NPR only after getting clarification: Minister,"‘Notification issued is only for conducting Census’

Tamil Nadu government has “put on hold” work towards updating the National Population Register (NPR) in the State, pending certain clarifications sought on the issue from the Centre.

“So far, the notification for updating the NPR has not been issued. We will take it up only after we receive clarification from the Centre. Until then, the updating of the NPR has been put on hold,” Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar told journalists in Chennai on Thursday.

The government has sought clarifications from the Centre over three specific questions pertaining to the mother tongue, details of the parents and spouse of the resident during enumeration.

“Since the clarifications have not been received yet, work on updating the NPR has not commenced,” he said and pointed out that the notification issued in the State was only for conducting Census and not for NPR.

As for the claim of the DMK that residents had to produce documents to support their details during the enumeration, Mr. Udhayakumar reiterated that the documents were not required to be submitted.

The NPR was not applicable to any specific religion, he pointed out and said that the State government had been taking steps so that the NPR could be updated as and when Muslims wished.

Mr. Udhayakumar said Muslims should not fall prey to the “instigation and conspiracy” of the DMK and added “100%, AIADMK government will stand by the minorities.”

Muslim festivals

As for the absence of festivals celebrated by Muslims in the NPR manual, the Minister said the manual was just the same was it was followed in 2010. “As for Muslim festivals, since there are not fixed dates but depend on the sighting of moon, those festivals were not mentioned. They could have objected then [2010]. In 2020 too, the same manual is to be followed.”

Asked why a resolution could not be passed against a law passed in the Parliament, when several other States could do so, Mr. Udhayakumar pointed out that some States that passed the resolution have issued notification.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/waxqre/article31054298.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13thCMKhazijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/npr-only-after-getting-clarification-minister/article31054299.ece
168,2020/03/13,Rajini Makkal Mandram disappointed,"Fans say ‘public perception seems to be good’

Tamil film actor Rajinikanth’s three “ideals” for his conceived political party has disappointed a section of his fans and office-bearers of Rajini Makkal Mandram.

RMM district secretaries appeared to, albeit reluctantly, back Rajinikanth’s three-point formula of separating the government from the ruling party, giving prominence to those below 50 and not being the Chief Ministerial face of the proposed party. “Fans are disappointed, but they will come back to work for him out of love. It is the people… public who decide the government. And they seem to welcome it,” said a RMM district secretary in Chennai.

Two district secretaries told The Hindu that they will “follow Rajinikanth’s path” while still hoping for a change of heart from the actor. “We are confident that the people will recognise that he is not after ‘power’ and that such a leader is needed. Even though he has made his path clear to us today, we hope that the public response will change his view,” said one of them seeking anonymity. Rajinikanth had urged his fans to go to the people and explain his position. “If there is an uprising…a wave…a revolution, then I will enter politics.”

A challenging task

Some feel that this is an “open challenge” for the cadres to connect more with people and ensure that the ground is prepared if he has to stake his reputation and fight elections.

“He is not the kind of a person who will want to be one of the players. I reckon that if he doesn’t see the required traction on the ground, then he might see if all this is really worth it,” said an RMM office-bearer.

Another district secretary said that at a meeting Mr. Rajinikanth had with them last week they were unable to convince him to give up the idea of projecting someone else as CM candidate.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rajini-makkal-mandram-disappointed/article31054266.ece
169,2020/03/13,Alert sounded over anti-CAA stir,"Top brass warned about possibility of protesters storming govt. offices

A high-level of security alert has been sounded across Tamil Nadu following intelligence inputs that anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters are planning to storm government offices and launch an indefinite dharna.

Senior police officers have been sent to major cities to monitor the arrangements to prevent any congregation of pro- or anti-CAA protesters near government buildings, offices of elected representatives in the State, police sources said on Thursday. Quick Reaction Teams have been stationed at vantage points and the surveillance stepped up over vital installations.

At the police headquarters, Director-General of Police J.K. Tripathy reviewed the security scheme with Additional Directors General of Police Jayant Murali, Shankar Jiwal, Sailesh Kumar Yadav and Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal who have been posted in Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Tiruchi and Tirunelveli respectively.

“We have intensified patrolling at vulnerable places and enhanced police presence at check-posts along roads leading to the coastline and inter-State borders. Plainclothesmen have been deployed at areas of public gathering such as including cues of worship, to keep tabs on anti-social elements,” Mr. Tripathy said.

Police sources said any congregation of anti-CAA protesters in a public building would lead to a situation where the groups favouring the new law also gathering to disseminate their views resulting in a possible clash.

“Police would not allow any gathering near government buildings or offices of public representatives. Since no permission for agitations relating to CAA had been given, such gatherings would be treated as unlawful and appropriate action as per law would be taken,” a police officer said.

Maoist link suspected

In a related development, sources in the intelligence agencies said Maoist leader Srimathi alias Shoba alias Savita coming out of her hideout was part of a strategy to establish contact with leaders of anti-CAA groups and extend support to them.

The woman was allegedly part of a senior level group of Maoist leaders operating in the trijunction forest belt of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala.

She was arrested by the Q Branch CID police at Anaikatti in Coimbatore district on Tuesday.

“The arrest of Srimathi is a major setback to the Maoist activities of the Westen Ghats Special Zonal Committee operating in the trijunction. She is involved in more than a dozen cases and is wanted by the Karnataka and Kerala police. Srimathi is carrying a bounty of ₹4 lakh on her head. We have seized a mobile phone, a pen drive and some literature promoting the Maoist ideology from her possession,” Deputy Inspector-General of Police (Internal Security) N. Kannan said.

‘Present at encounter’

Investigators in the Q Branch said Srimathi was present at the scene of encounter in Agali forest zone in Kerala’s Palakkad district where Maoist leader Manivasagam was shot dead by the police.

“We had a tip-off that she was coming out of the forest for a specific assignment. Special teams were keeping a close watch in the Anaikatti area and nabbed her,” another police official involved in the operation said added that the gadgets seized from her were sent for analysis.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ddr1fo/article31054259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THTNSRIMATHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/alert-sounded-over-anti-caa-stir/article31054260.ece
170,2020/03/13,"Star power alone not enough, says Rajini","‘I cannot imagine myself sitting in the Legislative Assembly’

Two years after declaring that he wanted to fill the “political vacuum” in Tamil Nadu, actor Rajinikanth on Thursday conceded that he can’t challenge the Dravidian majors based on his star power alone.

Without naming the DMK and the AIADMK, he said there were two parties with ‘monstrous strength’.

“On one hand, [DMK]…has not been in power for 10 years and the heir has to prove worthy of the legacy – they have structure, money and men. On the other hand, a party has power and funds. Can I win using my movie popularity, my fans and make the youngsters sacrificial lambs if my party ideology doesn’t work? So, I want to first make it [ideology] clear,” he said.

“Many will say I am a coward; that I got scared. So I thought it would be better to say it upfront,” he added.

Mr. Rajinikanth, who denied that he has been dilly-dallying his political entry for 25 years, said he had first declared his intention on taking the political plunge only on December 31, 2017. Even then he had stated that he was not after positions and that an opportunity for that had presented itself in the mid-1990s itself. Since then he has been thinking on what sort of politics to pursue.

Mr. Rajinikanth said that the post of the CM was like that of a ‘CEO’. “We need to keep the promises that we give to the people. We will create a council of experienced people and make sure that the promises are kept. We need to implement the ideas.”

He had never imagined himself to be CM. “I cannot imagine myself sitting in the Legislative Assembly. It is not in my blood. Many have tried to convince me – including P. Chidambaram, Cho. Ramaswamy – to become the CM before. We need a CM who is young person, educated, talented, kind-hearted and broad-minded person. We will act like an Opposition party. We will also ensure that we won’t interfere in day-to-day activities of government.”

“I said [in 2017] that the system was spoilt and that people’s minds have to be changed. Without changing people’s minds, without fixing the system and political system, there is no point in changing the government. We cannot cook ‘sakkara pongal’ in an unwashed vessel in which we cooked fish curry,” he contended.

Party posts

The DMK and AIADMK have close to 50,000 party posts. He felt that these posts were needed only during elections. Post-elections, only a bare minimum office-bearers were required.

The actor wanted to set aside 65% of seats for those aged below 50. The remaining would be for good people from other parties and distinguished judges, IAS and IPS officers. “If you see in the Assembly, most of them are above 50, 55 or 60 years of age. You can count the youngsters with fingers. New people and good people stay away from politics,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4vbbv/article31054252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THTNRAJINI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/star-power-alone-not-enough-says-rajini/article31054253.ece

172,2020/03/13,‘Women’s economic empowerment a long-term solution to combating gender violence’,"Nandini Azad says the United Nations’ report failed to highlight India’s successes

Women’s economic empowerment is the long-term solution to combating gender-based violence and working towards fulfilling the 2030 agenda for women’s human rights affirmations, said Nandini Azad, president of the Working Women’s Forum (India) and the Indian Cooperative Network for Women. Referring to the recent United Nations review report on gender equality, Ms. Azad said it was disappointing that the report did not highlight the success of India, its significant civil society and various government efforts.

Data from 170 countries in the report was well below standards on the progress of gender equality.

“We have seen several leaps and bounds in our iconic mass movement of the WWF and ICNW, which now has over 6 lakh women members. We urge the UN to see how our cost effective and sustainable models work and replicate our methodologies,” she said.

Gender and equity model

Ms. Azad explained that the ‘Gender and equity model’ of WWF and ICNW effectively addressed the Sustainable Development Goals (SDPS), which focus on gender equality, financial inclusion of women, poverty reduction, creation of sustainable women’s institutions and financing gender programmes.

Ms. Azad participated in the 63rd meeting of the UN Commission on Status of Women at New York in 2019, where she championed women’s emancipation through setting up cooperatives. “Cooperatives have proven their sustainability, especially at a time when several other civil society organisations are struggling due to lack of funds. Cooperatives can also be instrumental in helping other organisations become more sustainable,” she said.

173,2020/03/13,Class 10 certificates to include parents’ names from this year,"Water-proof marksheets to be issued

From this year class 10 students’ public exam marksheets will include the names of the parents, School Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan announced in the Assembly on Thursday.

The Minister said the decision was based on an order from the Chief Minister. The government has also allocated ₹13.50 crore to develop water- and tear-proof mark sheets. Teachers say the decision could check the use of fake certificates for jobs. Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Association president P.K. Ilamaran said in the last 10 years the School Education Department identified at least 25 teachers who used fake class 10 certificates for jobs.

The government earlier experimented with digitising Secondary School Leaving Certificates. Later, the Directorate of Public Instruction introduced a password system for Chief Educational Officers to verify the genuinty of uploaded certificates. The State had as many as 13 lakh government employees. “We suggest that the government issue the certificate as a smart card just like PAN, driving licence or the ration card,” he said.

School infrastructure

Earlier in the debate on demands for school education, Congress MLA S. Vijayadharani wanted the government to dispense with the practice of using teachers for other purposes. She urged the government to upgrade school infrastructure so that teachers would stay in villages instead of commuting long distance.

Mr. Sengottaiyan said teachers deployed for work such as data collection for census were paid for the job. The government had built homes for teachers in the villages, but teachers sent their children to private schools elsewhere and hence chose to live farther from their workplace, he said.

According to the policy note the rise in dropout rate from primary school (0.75%) to secondary school is a a little over two percentage points at 3.25%. Of the ₹34,181.73 crore allocated for 2020-21 for the department, ₹16,717.33 crore has been allocated for secondary and higher secondary education and ₹16,728.09 crore for elementary education.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/47p6pk/article31054199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13SENGOTTAIYAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/class-10-certificates-to-include-parents-names-from-this-year/article31054200.ece
174,2020/03/13,Conservationists offer a blueprint to save South India’s vultures,"Emphasis on coordinated survey in five States, restricting availability of anti-inflammatory drugs for veterinary use.

The South India Vulture Conservation Group has come up with a blueprint for the conservation of vulture population in five South Indian States, which are home to six of the nine vultures species found in the country.

Strategies discussed at a meeting of experts held at the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History in Coimbatore on Wednesday included a plan for a synchronously coordinated survey in five States, need to press the governments to restrict availability of Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) for veterinary use and to create a vulture safe zone in each south Indian State.

Listed under act

“Out of nine vulture species in India, four namely — white-backed vulture, long-billed vulture, slender-billed vulture and red-headed vulture — are listed as critically endangered by the IUCN and all are in the Schedule-1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, the highest category of endangerment.

Except slender-billed vulture, the three other critically endangered species are found in the Moyar valley in the Nilgiris, whose population has seen a slight increase,” says S. Bharathidasan, chief coordinator of the group and secretary of Arulagam NGO involved in conservation of vultures.

According to B. Ramakrishnan, State coordinator of the group in Tamil Nadu, a synchronously coordinated survey is being planned in the five States to understand the distribution and population estimate of vultures.

D. Rajkumar from Karnataka said use of NSAIDs had wiped out about 90 % of vulture population and disposal of cattle waste in forest peripheries was still rampant. The group emphasised on having a strong protocol for safe carcass disposal.

Carcass disposal

It has appealed to the Forest Department that National Tiger Conservation Authority guidelines should be implemented for carcass disposal by not burying or burning it. C. Sashikumar, State coordinator from Kerala proposed creation of at least one vulture safe zone in each south Indian State so that they are not affected from threats including that of NSAIDs.

The meeting of experts was held in the backdrop of the 13th conference of the parties to the Convention of Migratory Species (CMS) held in Gandhinagar last month, to which the Government of India was a signatory.

The four critically endangered vulture species in India were given special importance and they were recognised in the Annexure 1 of the CMS framework and a multi-species action plan has been devised for all threatened vulture species.

According to Apoorva Kulkarni, ecologist and facilitator of the meeting, a blueprint for the conservation of South Indian vulture population was prepared in alignment to the CMS vulture multi-species action plan, which is designed to help the south Indian state governments for on ground policy and action implementation.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/plxwtu/article31054170.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13VULTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/conservationists-offer-a-blueprint-to-save-south-indias-vultures/article31054171.ece

176,2020/03/13,‘Bloodshot’ movie review: Bloody and senseless,"The action is relentless in Vin Diesel’s new superhero film with nothing more to offer audiences

There’s never a dearth of superhero films with Hollywood and comic books continue to enjoy their day in the sun with Bloodshot. The Valiant Comics title comes alive on the big screen with action star Vin Diesel. As far as powers go, Ray Garrison (Diesel) has got regenerative abilities coupled with super strength. The former soldier, formidable in his heyday as it were, is now transformed into a mean unstoppable killing machine. Engineered by Dr Emil Harting (Guy Pearce ) of Rising Spirit Technologies, Bloodshot is injected with nanites, millions of little machines that will repair any physical degradation within seconds. The nanites are not in his blood but have become his blood.

Bloodshot Director: David S.F. Wilson

Cast: Vin Diesel, Eiza González, Sam Heughan, Toby Kebbell, Guy Pearce

Storyline: Ray Garrison is resurrected from the dead and augmented with technology but are his powers being used for good?

Equipped to take on the dangerous men who murdered his wife in cold blood, the newly resurrected and amped superhero is on a bloody path of vengeance. And what a fun ride it is for the audience, to watch mindless action unfurl, sometimes in meticulously detailed slo-mo. Bullets are relentless, the body count high and in the middle of it all is a steely eyed Diesel wreaking havoc on those he thinks deserve it. A particularly well-defined boss fight towards the end is testament to the marvels that CGI can accomplish and absolutely worth sitting up straight. The action is quick in overwhelming succession, but it’s the only thing that director David S.F. Wilson can pull off with success.

Unfortunately, screenplay writers Jeff Wadlow and Eric Heisserer are unable to construct any heft in this action film. With no character arcs to follow and needless twists and turns — Bloodshot’s sob story will most definitely keep all eyes dry, though they might roll back plenty of times — there’s little to do except switch off and watch the fun. But a suspension of all logic is required. Any stabs at self-awareness go awry when clichés are pointed out in futile attempts at humour. New Girl’s Lamorne Morris who plays tech genius Wilfred Wiggins alone elicits real chuckles. Diesel relies on his bulging biceps more than actual skill and other supporting characters remain unmemorable.

As a first in what is clearly intended to be a franchise, Bloodshot will need a lot more than gratuitous action to take Ray Garrison’s adventures forward.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/a1r7du/article31061682.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bloodshot,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bloodshot-movie-review-bloody-and-senseless/article31061683.ece
177,2020/03/13,"‘Asuraguru’ movie review: Money, money and money, but nowhere to go","Vikram Prabhu’s choice of scripts have been mildly interesting, but this thriller’s over-the-top action sequences and tepid flashback sequences do not contribute to that space

We’ve all seen heist films. The ones in which there’s a gang that makes elaborate plans to loot a bank and make off with the money, leading luxurious lives, till someone manages to track them down.

Asuraguru is a thriller-heist film of sorts... the difference is that there’s no gang. There’s no elaborate planning that’s shown. All we know is that Shakti (Vikram Prabhu) is well-skilled in the ‘art’ of executing a crime; in fact, the film begins with an elaborate train sequence ala Thiruda Thiruda that has Shakti looting off a large amount of freshly-printed currency notes.

The art is in quotes for a reason: much into the film, a detective (Mahima Nambiar) even comments on how good this thief is. Shakti doesn’t leave any traces, and he knows his technology.

Asuraguru Cast: Vikram Prabhu, Mahima Nambiar, Yogi Babu, Jagan

Director: A Raajdheep

Storyline: Why does a man keep attempting high-profile robberies?

But what does he do with the money he successfully loots off on three different occasions? That’s the moot question in Asuraguru. While the protagonist’s ‘motive’ is admittedly unique, Asuraguru does not quite explore it to the hilt. Director Raajdheep veers into sub-plots — replete with Yogi Babu’s not-so-funny comedy and Mahima Nambiar’s characterisation — that have weak links with the main plot. There’s also an attempt at a twist of sorts in the end, but it isn’t exactly that will make you jump up and take notice.

Vikram Prabhu’s choice of scripts in his career have been mildly interesting, but Asuraguru’s over-the-top action sequences and tepid flashback sequences do not contribute to that space. As a lady detective solving a case linked to the main case, Mahima Nambiar gets some solid screenspace, but contributes little, save for the scene in which she is exasperated at the protagonist. Comedian Jagan pitches in, but that does not save Asuraguru from its weak cinematic pursuit.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/41zjwo/article31061077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/asura,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/asuraguru-movie-review-money-money-and-money-but-nowhere-to-go/article31061078.ece
178,2020/03/13,‘Walter’ movie review: Sibiraj’s cop outing is as emotionless as RoboCop,"Unlike a ‘Sethupathi’ which did better justice to the part-masala, part-cop universe, ‘Walter’ takes the genre too seriously — as if the director doused his screenplay in a liberal dose of starch and ironed it out, to keep its rigidity intact

It’s impossible to make a police story without succumbing to ‘cop’ tropes that have percolated Tamil cinema, traditionally. By now, you must be aware that writing a cop movie is an excuse to propel a hero’s image, milking his masculinity to the point where blood starts spilling out of the screen. That’s not a problem unless there’s some scope for the filmmaker to explore a police officer’s vulnerability. When I say vulnerability, please don’t mistake it for the Killing of a Sacred Character midway through the movie, just so that the hero feels ‘helpless’. These are age-old issues with Tamil cinema’s Cop Universe and have little relevance with Walter.

There has never been a more visibly awkward police officer than Sibi Sathyaraj’s Walter. The awkwardness isn’t restricted to his pursuit in making the character look caricaturish; he stands erect, adjusts his pants every time he walks into the screen, and looks wooden — for the most part, I was heavily distracted by Sibiraj’s bushy moustache which, admittedly, has more layers than the script. These aren’t character traits of Walter, but of an actor who seems like the only person taking efforts to be taken seriously, in a movie that is anything but serious.

Walter Cast: Sibi Sathyaraj, Bava Chelladurai, Natty, Samuthirakani and Shirin Kanchwala

Director: U Anbu

Storyline: ASP Walter uncovers the mysterious case of missing babies, orchestrated by a minister

The director’s lacklustre attitude, in the way he perceives cop movies, is evident right through the initial stretches. The central conflict is between two characters: Eswara Moorthi (Bava Chelladurai, in a showy performance), a well-respected political leader, and Bala (Samuthirakani), both belonging to the same party.

Walter is nowhere in the picture until he’s commissioned by his commanding officer to kill Bala in an encounter. We know the politics behind killing Bala; a) he’s second-in-line to Eswara Moorthi and b) he protected his doctor-friend (Natty) from a culpable offence. But Walter doesn’t ask these questions. He simply executes orders, like a “hunting dog”. That’s how Walter is, in life. Like RoboCop. There’s no emotion, there’s no reaction. Anyway, a vital scene that would alter the lives of Walter and Co, is executed in the most basic fashion — too basic for the film medium and revolutionary for a TV soap.

Are we tracing the life of Walter or Eswara Moorthi, or Bala’s friend, or Eswara Moorth’s son-in-law? We are left scratching our heads — even harder, when an abysmal romantic track takes a full-blown shape. Every movie teaches you something; sometimes about life, sometimes about your existence. Here’s an interesting information I learned from Walter: there’s a rare blood group called Bombay Blood. By the end of the movie, one is bound to say: There will be blood.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/na9ku4/article31060932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3E3A1004,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/walter-movie-review-sibirajs-cop-outing-is-as-emotionless-as-robocop/article31060933.ece
179,2020/03/13,Audiences would love to watch Vijay or Ajith sir in a romantic-comedy: Harish Kalyan,"The actor talks about his latest film 'Dharala Prabhu' and why he hasn’t found a film worth substance post his runaway hit, 'Pyaar Prema Kaadhal'

Harish Kalyan has completed nearly 10 years in the industry, but is known as the man who plays charming, romantic-at-heart characters — whether it is Pyaar Prema Kaadhal or Ispade Rajavum Idhaya Raniyum (ISIR). His latest Dharala Prabhu, too, appears to bear testimony to that.

The actor feels that the Coronovirus outbreak will not have a significant impact on movies in Tamil Nadu. “I watched Kannum Kannum Kolaiyadithaal on a weekday with 60% audience, which is a big deal. I think we’re in a safe zone,” says Harish Kalyan, taking a trip to the washroom nevertheless after welcoming me with a handshake. Excerpts from an interview:

‘Dharala Prabhu’ (remake of ‘Vicky Donor’) is your first attempt in doing a remake. How did this offer come about?

Krishna Marimuthu [the director] and I were discussing another movie. He was developing that script and needed more time. The offer to remake Vicky Donor came from the production side. He asked me if I would be interested, but I was sceptical. He rewrote the script for me, which I liked. We have retained the essence of Vicky Donor and made it our own. Dharala Prabhu will be a new movie. That much I can say.

There are two approaches to a remake; watch the original and improvise your performance or avoid it altogether. Which category do you fit in?

I’ve seen Vicky Donor and I liked it. My instant reaction was: Is there something called sperm donation? I realised the importance of being a fertile couple in our society. We have changed my characterisation in Dharala Prabhu. We didn’t want to miss out on the core emotion that Vicky Donor tried to convey. But we had to tone down the adult content.

Is it because our audience might consider it off-putting?

We didn’t feel it was absolutely necessary. Of course, you cannot make a movie like Dharala Prabhu without talking about sperms. But we have conveyed it suggestively. For example, we depict the character’s transformation in song, suggesting that he’s started doing it. Plus, we wanted families to watch our movie.

Actor Prasanna once said that Tamil cinema lacks the space that Ayushmann Khurrana has in Bollywood. Do you think you have a space here?

I think that’s slowly changing now and the market is opening up. You need to break through the clutter. Who knows...Dharala Prabhu could be a starting point for me. The audience will encourage such movies, if artists are willing to take that risk.

Why is Tamil cinema dependent on other industries for high-concept movies? Why not make a ‘Vicky Donor’ in Tamil, in the first place?

That’s true. I recently watched Sillu Karupatti. It dealt with elderly romance in the most sweetest way. There was another story about a guy suffering from scrotum cancer. Though it wasn’t a star-studded affair, it still got is due, right? But you’re right. Stars should step in for such movies to reach a wider audience. They might also inspire someone like me to reinvent my choice of movies.

Take a movie like American Pie, for instance. It’s not a porn movie but adult comedy. Hindi cinema took years to make something like American Pie. It came much later in Tamil. There’s a clear pattern. I think scenes are changing now. It will take sometime but will definitely happen. Another example is Kannum Kannum Kollaiyadithaal. I’ve been thinking about it for the last two days. It’s a romantic-thriller, but there’s no violence, bloodshed or usage of expletives. And yet, the movie turned out to be a massive hit.

Do you think Tamil cinema lacks a Dulquer Salmaan in that space?

Yes. You cannot opt for bigger stars in this space, given their market space and fanbase. But actors below the A-listers should explore such themes. Speaking of stars, I admire Suriya sir for that. He does a Soorarai Pottru on one hand and does a pakka commercial outing on the other. If you take Bollywood, Ayushmann seems properly stamped for such movies.

What worked for ‘Vicky Donor’ was its refreshingly simple tone and the way humour was handled with sensitivity...

That’s where Vivekh sir steps in. I might be the titular hero, but Vivekh sir is the narrative hero. His punchlines are hilarious and never below the belt. For example, there’s a scene where he utters the word sperm and I would chide him for saying it out loud. He would immediately say, “What’s wrong in that, pa? That’s where life beings, no?” Vivekh sir has changed the dimension of the movie.

Annu Kapoor (the role played by Vivekh in Tamil) won the National Award for Best Supporting Actor for ‘Vicky Donor’. Was Vivekh the first choice?

They finalised Vivekh because nobody could have played that role. Funnily, it’s Vivekh sir’s zone — a comedic character with a liberal dose of message. That’s how his comedies have been. During the shoot, he said something personal about my growth. He said, ‘You’re doing good. I’ve seen Pyaar Prema Kaadhal and rushes of ISIR. You’re moulding well.’

Tamil cinema heroes are traditionally known for flexing their masculinity. Do you have any second thoughts when you take up ‘soft’ characters?

I’m at a stage where the audience won’t accept me in a mass movie, thrashing some 20 men. If I have to go back to the 2000s, Vijay sir did a host of romantic movies, displaying multiple shades. But then, he became a huge star. At this point in my career, I’ve the luxury to experiment.

In an interview, you said how Simbu cannot afford to act in a movie like ‘Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya’ in today’s times. Why do the stars show reluctance to star in urban, romantic stories?

I myself have asked Simbu sir about the possibility of VTV 2. There comes a phase in everyone’s career where they get saturated. That has become our pattern I guess. I’ve done only few movies, but I myself am thinking of changing my approach to movies. If Harish Kalyan thinks that way, then think about stars.

What’s next? Harish Kalyan will star in the Tamil remake of the Telugu blockbuster Pelli Choopulu. “Lazy, laidback characters have always resonated with audiences. I’m banking on this.” He is joining hands with director Sasi for yet another love story.

But you cannot completely neglect the genre, no? There can be a one-off...

Absolutely. Vijay Sethupathi acted in 96. Even today, audience would love to watch a Vijay sir or Ajith sir in a romantic-comedy. But they need to find the right script to make that happen. They cannot act in Pyaar Prema Kaadhal (laughs). Will they be ready to take that risk? I don’t know. But I, as an audience, would like to watch them in this space. Amitabh sir was in his 60s when he made Cheeni Kum.

‘Refuse to be average’ goes your Twitter bio. But the movies post ‘Pyaar Prema Kaadhal’ have only been average...

After ISIR, I had Dhanusu Raasi Neyargale which didn’t do well at the box office. It’s a fact that everybody knows and I won’t lie saying it did decent numbers. The intention was to make a fun outing. Somehow it misfired and I won’t put the blame on one person. But I’ve made it up with Dharala Prabhu.

At script level, are you objective enough to judge a movie?

I can, actually. Sometimes, the script may seem average but might work with the audience. It’s the other way round sometimes. At the end of the day, every experience teaches you something.

What was the biggest learning lesson from that misfire?

I learnt how miserable it would be, if the execution fails. When I say ‘execution’, it starts from the first look poster. I thought ISIR was a weak script, but Ranjit matched it up with the execution part. He said he was going to shoot the ‘Kannamma’ song inside an elevator. That was a weak set-up for a montage song. But it got a huge reception from the audience.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/eqonhg/article31060635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/890420jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/audiences-would-love-to-watch-vijay-or-ajith-sir-in-a-romantic-comedy-harish-kalyan/article31060636.ece
180,2020/03/13,‘Angrezi Medium’ movie review: Even Irrfan Khan’s presence can’t salvage this protracted drama,"Instead of any focused progression in the narrative, the film, at best, remains a random collection of disjointed and insanely long sequences and stretched gags

The most notable thing about Angrezi Medium is the array of interesting actors it has managed to get on board. Most of them, however, are either confined to miniscule roles or fall victims to flat, banal writing, one that they themselves can’t salvage despite their consummate performative skills and screen presence. And to think, that the writing credit is shared by four writers. It’s one too many writers that spoils the plot.

Forget flying, the film doesn’t seem to hold together well on the ground despite an interesting premise. Champal Bansal (Irrfan Khan), a sweetshop owner in Udaipur, wants to help his daughter Tarika (Radhika Madan) realise her dream of going to London for further studies. This could have been an interesting and endearing peep into the relationship between a protective-possessive single father and a daughter who wants to sport wings and take off. It could have also pirouetted on the issues of class dynamics and mobility. Far from it.

Angrezi Medium Director: Homi Adajania

Cast: Irrfan Khan, Deepak Dobriyal, Radhika Madan, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Dimple Kapadia, Ranvir Shorey, Pankaj Tripathi, Kiku Sharda, Zakir Hussain, Tillotama Shome

Run time: 145 minutes

Storyline: Champak Bansal, a sweetshop owner from Udaipur wants to send his daughter Tarika off to London for further studies

Instead of any focused progression in the narrative, the film, at best, remains a random collection of disjointed and insanely long sequences and stretched gags. A slapstick but utterly unfunny courtroom battle over the title of a sweet shop, another protracted one of Champak giving speech in broken English at a function in Tarika’s school to bring the spotlight on a corrupt judge. There is more: an outpouring of confessions during a drinking session with brother Gopi (Deepak Dobriyal) and friend (Kiku Sharda), a set piece involving cricket-loving Londoner Babloo (Ranvir Shorey), deportation drama at Heathrow and procuring illegal passport in Dubai from Tony (Pankaj Tripathi). All scenarios that mine broad stereotypes and dish out inane, contrived and infantile humour.

The improbable twists and turns of the plot would have worked, as they do in a lot of mainstream films, if there was an intrinsic panache and inherent ability to handle the silly. Here everything looks laboured to the hilt. The material and the maker clearly don’t belong to each other. There are other basics missing. The Rajasthani accent of the characters seems to come and go at its own sweet will and leisure. Radhika Madan’s way of talking, that prolonged drawl, gets particularly mannered and grating. One misses the crucial spontaneity between her and Khan in their interplay and face-offs. In fact Khan hits it off better with brother Deepak Dobriyal. Angrezi Medium is the film one had been waiting for, to see Khan back in big screen glory. He gets into the groove effortlessly but the film lets him down.

The lesser characters get in to the film and out of it without any notice. Tillotama Shome was gone before I could take two sips of coffee. Strangely the only moments that worked for me were the ones involving a confrontation between the mother-daughter duo that Champak and his brother bump into in London. Dimple Kapadia and Kareena Kapoor, the lengths of their appearance notwithstanding are the actors who light up the screen for a brief time. It’s criminal to have not etched them and their relationship, well.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/heuld9/article31060527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/angrezi-medium-759,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/angrezi-medium-movie-review-even-irrfan-khans-presence-cant-salvage-this-protracted-drama/article31060528.ece
181,2020/03/13,‘Dharala Prabhu’ movie review: Tamil remake of ‘Vicky Donor’ is a squandered opportunity,"Harish Kalyan’s film takes aim, but misses its objective of sensitising the Tamil audience to the concept of sperm donation, by quite some distance

Unless you are in a tearing hurry to remake a popular film from another language, the concept of time allows a filmmaker space for two things.

One, the adapted screenplay could be tighter and crisp (if he/she does not believe in the concept of ‘remaining faithful to the original’). Two, if you have anyway decided to tweak the script to suit ‘cultural sensitivities’ of the audience you are remaking the film for, why not show maturity in your writing and hit two taboos with one stone. Dharala Prabhu fails in both respects.

Also Read Audiences would love to watch Vijay or Ajith sir in a romantic-comedy: Harish Kalyan

Eight years ago, when Vicky Donor — a light-hearted take on the hush-hush subject of sperm donation — found its way to theatres, it managed to elevate interest among young Indians eager to figure out what, whom and how they could help. But Dharala Prabhu, despite drawing off Vicky Donor’s core idea, is not a film that could remotely influence anything among a thinking audience, because its director Krishna Marimuthu seems confined, and more confused, with his line of social messaging.

But first things first. What is Tamil cinema’s sudden fascination with the game of football? You’d understand trends like heroes wanting to grow their hair out after Vikram did so in Anniyan. But seriously, why is every hero now wanting to lace a pair of boots and kick a football around? One cannot be too sure if Harish Kalyan underwent some sort of training for his five-a-side pitch theatrics, but judging by the result, it was time he could have instead used to work on his screen presence and to help develop the general range of emotions one expects of an actor these days.

Prabhu Govind (Harish Kalyan), as you have guessed already, is a ‘footballer’ who plays five-a-side games, and aspires to land a job through sports quota from an employment exchange. Dr Kannadasan Meiyappan (an over-the-top Vivekh) is a fertility specialist who promises great many things to his prospective clients, but he needs to find that one healthy donor who could make his tall claims come true. Nidhi Mandanna’s (Tanya Hope) brief from the director seems to be the femme fatale in every exchange, which, if you think about it, is a bit weird when the character has to grieve.

Dharala Prabhu Director: Krishna Marimuthu

Cast: Harish Kalyan, Vivekh, Tanya Hope, RS Shivaji

Storyline: A fertility specialist convinces a youngster to donate sperms. When he agrees, little does the man realise that his would come back to haunt him

Kannadasan tries all the tricks in the book to coax Prabhu to turn a donor, but he refuses. A situation with his coach, where the latter says that his fragile male ego was the reason why he could not fulfill his wife’s wish to be a parent, is what nudges Prabhu over the edge and he agrees to help Kannadasan. Things are going well, but soon Prabhu falls in love with Nidhi and, eventually, gets married to her. Soon their happily-ever-after is complicated when Nidhi learns she cannot conceive, but one plot twist awaits. Will Prabhu emerge unscathed and manage to keep his family together?

Kannadasan, who seems to be the director’s voice (for all purposes) and the voice of reason as well in the film, is someone who believes in the concept of “children bring families together”. But this viewpoint, I assume, is only valid if said family consists of a heterosexual couple. Eight years on from Vicky Donor, it would have made sense for a Tamil filmmaker to push boundaries and centre this plot on a lesbian couple. That’s an opportunity missed.

Perhaps the biggest flaw in Dharala Prabhu is that the concept of sperm donation is seldom discussed, or does not come across as a major influencer across the story line, except in only the link scenes. Which suggests that the writing could have done with two more levels of refinement. The narrative instead chugs along around the protagonist being a goofy, “likeable”, pseudo-hunk padded up by romantic scenes and songs that are a major drag on the screenplay. Don’t get me wrong, it is not poor film-making; it is just plainly uninspiring.

Dharala... also contradicts itself a lot. Prabhu Govind, earlier on in the film, comes across as someone not too keen on kids because, you know, kids... they are a multitude of problems packaged in a tiny one feet-long blob of a human being. Then, a scene that makes Nidhi fall in love with him has Prabhu argue with a man, who has carelessly let his boy play with waves, where he says, unconvincingly, “Avan avan kuzhandai illama thavichittu irukaan.”

One more example of how a re-imagined plot could have worked better for Dharala... is when the lead male discovers that a child he adopts could actually be his. This moment comes half-way into the second half. Had Krishna Marimuthu wanted a goofball comedy, this could have been the perfect interval block sequence. Another opportunity missed.

I’m of the opinion that a better way of making ideas fit seamlessly across cultures is to treat them as a commonplace occurrence, and not whip up an imagined frenzy around it. Like, if a couple are in a live-in together relationship, do not call attention to the fact in your screenplay, leave it to the audience’s understanding. Like how Dharala Prabhu does not whistle from atop lighthouses about the lead pair’s on-screen smooch. Couples in love do kiss. It really is no big deal, and that is how cultural sensitivites ought to be smoothened.

But this remake squanders its primary objective. The film ought to have sensitised the Tamil audience to the concept of sperm donation. Unfortunately, Krishna Marimuthu manages to take aim, but misses by quite some distance.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jwtbsy/article31060332.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dharala-Prabhu-Songs,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dharala-prabhu-movie-review-tamil-remake-of-vicky-donor-is-a-squandered-opportunity/article31060333.ece
182,2020/03/13,J Geetha’s ‘Run Kalyani’ wins an award at International Film Festival of Thrissur,"The film is about a woman who works as a cook in two households

“Vindicated!” says J Geetha. Run Kalyani, directed by her, has won the Fipresci-India award at the 15th International Film Festival of Thrissur. Shot in the capital city, the woman-centric film is the first feature film of the award-winning documentary filmmaker. Scripted and directed by Geetha herself, the movie premièred at Kolkata in the competition section of the Kolkata International Film Festival when it won a special prize of the jury.

“For its extraordinary treatment of human psyche in subtle cinematic terms with an aura of brevity, artistic excellence, feministic flavour and reverberating connotations,” read the jury’s remarks about the film. The Fipresci jury included Premendra Mazumdar, Madhu Eravankara and Prem Chand.

Run Kalyani was written many years after Geetha wrote a prize-winning script — A Certain Slant of Light — that won the Goteborg International Film Festival’s development fund in 2008, which was about three sisters set in Kerala in the period between the seventies and the nineties. After the film had to be shelved due to lack of producers, Geetha came up with the story of a young woman, Kalyani, played by Garggi Ananthan, working as a cook in two households in the city. Madhu Neelakandan’s evocative camera follows Kalyani’s routine from day break to night. The movie is about how Kalyani forms different ties with the people in the houses she works in and how two women help each other break shackles that bind them to the mundane.

Shot with a large cast and with the help of some of the best technicians in the industry, the film was screened in the city by Soorya. Editing was done by B Ajithkumar while Sreevalsan J Menon composed the music for the film.

183,2020/03/13,French director Robin Campillo of ‘BPM (Beats Per Minute)’ fame says AIDS activism shaped his career,"The filmmaker is set to begin shooting on his new film 'Vazaha', inspired by his childhood in Madagascar, in July

French writer-director Robin Campillo enjoys filming sex scenes. In BPM (Beats Per Minute) — Campillo’s devastating and invigorating 2017 film on the early days of the militant AIDS activist group, ACT UP-Paris — a young newbie, Nathan, and a passionate veteran campaigner, Sean, are in bed, taking off each other’s clothes, after a night of clubbing. As the camera traces their naked bodies, Sean, who is HIV-positive, makes it clear that he prefers to wear a condom. “It’s safer,” he says, as Nathan, who is HIV-negative, obliges. Explicit, queer and unapologetically long, the sex in Campillo’s films often reveals the power dynamics between the characters.

“I really like sex,” the 57-year-old filmmaker says, when we meet on a warm afternoon in Goa. “When my first boyfriend died from AIDS, I was very young and I remember I missed the sex a lot. It was the most difficult thing for me, not to be able to touch him again,” he recalls.

The AIDS epidemic has shaped Campillo deeply as a filmmaker. In the 80s, after graduating from film school, he had convinced himself that he was HIV-positive. “I thought I was going to die anyway, so it took me ages to make my first film,” he shares. In the early 90s, he decided not to be in denial any more, took an HIV test, found that he was negative, and joined ACT UP as a militant. Known for their rather graphic and urgent campaigns, the group demanded attention with “die-ins,” where members sprawled across public spaces, covered in fake blood, and sometimes even hurled blood on buildings and politicians.

“When I was in ACT-UP, India was trying to make drugs without patenting, which was much needed, and we knew how greedy the pharmaceutical industry was,” recalls Campillo. His time in activism prompted Campillo to make a film about queer people and the AIDS epidemic, but it wasn’t until 2017 that he finally got it out of his head and on to celluloid.

BPM not only won the Grand Prix (second-most prestigious prize after the Palme d’Or) at Cannes 2017, it also garnered high praise from Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar, the jury president, who broke protocol and said BPM was his personal favourite for the top prize (which eventually went to The Square). After a successful festival run around the world, it went on to win six César awards (French national film awards), including for Best Film, a rare feat for a queer film with explicit sex scenes.

Why sanitise?

Campillo says there are two problems plaguing contemporary queer cinema: they are mostly confined to streaming services and are often sanitised for a straight audience. “I say this to all young filmmakers who are making queer films — you don’t have to apologise for sex scenes or worry about presenting a good image,” he says. In BPM, after Sean’s death, when Nathan has sex with Thibault, another member of ACT UP, “older straight people” called it “cheating”, says Campillo. “But it’s not!” he exclaims. “It’s just casual sex for pleasure, and the fact that I didn’t apologise for it made people accept it more.”

For him, films like Stranger by the Lake (2013), Ballroom (2003), Carol (2015) and Blue is the Warmest Colour (2013) are unapologetically queer. “But I didn’t like the sex scene in Blue is the Warmest Colour, because one of the two girls is lesbian for years and the other is discovering her sexuality, but when they have sex, it’s like they are equal, they have the same level of knowledge about sex, which is weird for me,” he says.

A still from ‘Eastern Boys’.

The awkwardness and power play in lovemaking are what intrigue Campillo. In his controversial sophomore film, Eastern Boys (2014), he explores the relationship between an older French man and a young Ukrainian boy, as they go from being lovers to developing a father-son bond. “I make films, not as a mirror to society, but because I believe in metamorphosis,” he says. “It’s about discovering that we are not the person we thought we were.” The filmmaker is fascinated by how queer characters evolve, beyond their sexuality, and how they transcend labels as they age. “We are getting older, becoming more bourgeois, or losing jobs, and that is changing us more than our sexual desire.”

That’s why intersectionality is so important to Campillo. For him, queer identity is complex and full of contradictions. “The fact that I discovered I was queer as a child is connected to colonialism,” he says. Born in Morocco to French parents, Campillo moved a lot among the former French colonies as a child. His father was in the military, and they shifted to Madagascar when Campillo was 10. The army background that eclipsed his childhood influenced his perception of how men and women were supposed to behave.

In vogue

Inspired by his childhood in Madagascar, Campillo’s next film, which he hopes to start shooting in July (“My producer wants it to be ready for Cannes”), is currently titled Vazaha. “It means white people, which is often used to refer to foreigners and especially the French,” he explains. “It’s a film that presents the French paradise in Madagascar and then, in the end, you change the point of view and see it through the eyes of the Malagasy.”

Although set in 1972, Campillo wants the costumes in Vazaha to be as contemporary as possible. Even in BPM, which is set in the early 90s, Campillo made his characters wear clothes that are still in vogue. “It’s because I don’t want young people to feel disconnected [from the past],” he reasons. “Today, we have different forms of colonialism, especially in France, where we are dealing with a lot of racism and Islamophobia, so I wanted to talk about the roots of that.” According to the filmmaker, it is easier to be gay, than a Muslim or black, in France. “The government is very right-wing at the moment, so they use queer people for pinkwashing,” he says.

Campillo refuses to contribute to pinkwashing. After BPM’s success, when he was invited to the Élysée Palace, the official residence of the French President, he declined. “Twenty-five years ago, they thought we were gay fascists, and now they think we are great, which is hypocritical,” he says. No longer an activist, politics for him is now in his films. “Cinema is not militant but it makes people interrogate, puts them in uncomfortable positions and makes them rethink,” he says.

184,2020/03/13,Short film 'Vidiyal': Of sandalwood smugglers in the Periyar Tiger Reserve,"Raju Francis’ short film is a heart-warming story of smugglers and their rehabilitation in a project that provided them a livelihood

“Writing the script and directing was a first for me. So was it for the actors who faced the camera,” says Raju Francis, Divisional Forest Officer Vigilance, Ernakulam on his 21 minute short, Vidiyal that was released on February 23, 2020.

His foray into films began when the Head of the Forest Force PK Kesavan, in an outreach initiative, last year, founded a technical team to make films for the Kerala Forest Department YouTube channel that introduces to the public different aspects of the forest. A team of officials was in place but he wished the medium to be more refined — accessible in terms of technicalities and narration.

Dream fulfilled

Francis who nurtured a desire to make films was tasked with this and it proved a way forward.

Vidiyal, meaning sunrise, is a heart warming story of sandal wood smugglers in the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) and their rehabilitation in a project called Vidiyal Vana Pathukappu Sangham that provided them a livelihood.

“The story is based on real incidents that took place in the Periyar Tiger Reserve, in 2004, when I was a Ranger,” says Francis adding, “the smugglers were agile and swift. It was difficult to catch them as they knew the terrain well and came across the border from Tamil Nadu. We, with the leadership of the then Deputy Director, Pramod G Krishnan, founded ‘Cheetah’, a team, comprising the cream of our staff and members chosen from the Eco Development Committee to fight this menace.”

A luring narrative, Vidiyal melds a thrilling encounter of foresters and sandal smugglers with the human interest angle of rehabilitating the captured and surrendered criminals. Their new lives as forest guides who take travellers on a tour of their village ends in hope and fulfilment.

The film opens with the camera panning on a child in a paddy field petitioning his mother to tell “the story” once again. The narrative moves forward looping in the action and ends with a moment of truth with the grandfather coming in search of the mother and son.

Knowing and experiencing the story first hand, Francis wrote a script true to the travails in the forest, marrying fact to fiction. Director P Venu, who vetted the script, when Francis approached him, encouraged Francis to go ahead. Cinematographer Uma Shankar completed the shoot in five days in the Lower Camp area of Gudalur and at PTR. Forest officers and reformed sandal smugglers formed the actors. Edited by Renju RV, post production was done at The Collective Studio and the music is by Dawn Vincent.

“My maiden venture was the result partly of my ignorance and partly of my confidence of the subject,” says Francis who is pleased with the reviews the film is garnering. He has many scripts on hand and is looking ahead to make his dream come true — of directing a feature film.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fd1n29/article31059612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpF3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vidiyal-the-story-of-sandalwood-smugglers-in-periyar-tiger-reserve/article31059613.ece
185,2020/03/13,"‘Les Miserables’ movie review: A brutal, yet beautiful critique of class, ethnicity and multiculturalism in France","Filmmaker Ladj Ly delivers a raw, rough and unrelenting portrayal of violence endemic to life on the margins of society

Some films seem to get an added relevance over time and keep acquiring newer meanings in the varied contexts you view them in. Ladj Ly’s debut feature Les Miserables, based on his own short film, is one that has kept evolving over the past year. I added it to my list of the most searing and disturbing films on class wars when I watched it at Cannes. Recently, when viewed in the immediate aftermath of the violence unleashed in Delhi, it felt unwittingly prescient about the flashpoints between the fascist State might and machinery and the marginalised; a situation in which the only outcome is terrible human loss.

Ly’s film traverses a full circle, from the start to the finish, when it comes to its visual arc and narrative movement. It kicks off with images of joy and togetherness ushered in by a beautiful game of football at the FIFA World Cup. People across all divides unite in the country’s blue jerseys, under the French flag and the fandom of Mbappe.

As opposed to this cheerful montage, the film ends, quite like Ankur and Fandry, with a sharp, pithy image, a signifier of abject hopelessness and desperation. And a quote from Victor Hugo to put it all in perspective: “There are no such things as bad plants or bad men. There are only bad cultivators.” You reap what you sow, violence begets violence in which often it’s the children who are the victims and their innocence the first casualty.

Between the beginning and the final act is an expose of the deep fissures underlying the unifying passion for sports, an unending chain of hatred that refuses to snap. Do the French ideals of liberty, fraternity and egalitarianism truly hold? In a sideways evocation of Hugo’s timeless classic by the same title, about the humiliation of the dispossessed, Ly powerfully brings to light the contemporary class and colour and religion and race politics. His springboard being the 2005 riots of Paris. Not much has changed in all these years.

Les Miserables (French) Director: Ladj Ly

Starring: Damien Bonnard, Alexis Manenti, Djebril Zonga, Issa Percia

Run time: 103 minutes

The kinetic, on the move camera mirrors the simmering unrest and discontent as it takes us into the city’s tough suburbs and its battling gangs along with the crime patrol unit of three officers: Stephane (Damien Bonnard), Gwada (Djebril Zonga) and Chris (Alexis Manenti). It’s a world of strifes and fights. On one hand are the deep and long held prejudices of the privileged, and on the other the bottomless anger of the powerless fed by the persistent, everyday harassment and humiliation. Far from getting contained, the resentment only gets stoked and built up and you know that there is no way it can end other than in resistance and rebellion, individual as well as collective.

There is tonal pause in the middle with an extended sequence of the officers going home: a distraught and guilt-ridden Gwada with his elderly mother; Chris, who has no qualms about frisking young girls, with his little daughters and wife seemingly unaffected by the events of the day and Stephane in an empty apartment, still waiting to unpack, calling his his son. It’s time of peace and calm but an uneasy one as you realise soon after.

A terrific ensemble of professional actors, first-timers and non-actors brings alive Ly’s astutely observed characters. They make their presence felt irrespective of the duration of their stay on screen. The rough, raw feel of the film reflects how things are on the edge, can escalate suddenly and run out of hand and how violence is endemic to life on the margins. It can erupt with an unforeseen rage at the any provocation. “What if voicing your anger is the only way to be heard?” asks a character rhetorically. A moment that leaves you badly jolted and speechless. Ladj Ly might be savage in his critique of class, ethnicity and multiculturalism issues specific to France, but his portrayal of the revenge of the oppressed underclass is a warning that societies and States across the world could well heed.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bm7u7s/article31059433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/les,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/les-miserables-movie-review-a-brutal-yet-beautiful-critique-of-class-ethnicity-and-multiculturalism-in-france/article31059434.ece
186,2020/03/13,Michael Caine: ‘Nolan’s Batman movies is one of the greatest things I have done in my life’,"Soon to be seen in Christopher Nolan’s 'Tenet', Michael Caine, who turns 87 tomorrow, on watching 'The Crown' and penning his first fiction novel

In the mid ’60s when Michael Caine crossed the pond to make his first Hollywood film, Gambit, he never imagined that he would spend the next few decades making over a hundred films, win two Oscars, and become a movie star.“I just did not have the looks and I had a very thick cockney accent,” he says during an early afternoon phone call from his London flat.

Ahead of the television screening of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island to mark his 87th birthday tomorrow, the British film icon spoke about the films he is making, the book he is writing, shows he follows on streaming platforms, and on working with director Christopher Nolan.

Mutual admiration society

Caine, who will be seen in Tenet this July, has been a part of every single Christopher Nolan film since Batman Begins in 2005.

The actor vividly remembers the first time he met the auteur. “He came to the front door of my house in the country with a script. I could see him through the glass but I couldn’t recognise him. The moment he introduced himself, I knew exactly who he was because I was a great fan of his three small films,” says Caine.

When Nolan mentioned that he wanted Caine for Batman, the actor was taken aback. “I told him, ‘I am too old for Batman. Do you want me to play the butler? What would my dialogues be? Would you like another beverage or more custard?’” The director then explained that he saw Alfred’s character to be a lot more than just a butler and that he was ‘the foster-father of Batman’. So, I did the movie and it was one of the greatest things I have done in my life.” It is an industry joke that Nolan thinks of Caine as a ‘lucky mascot’. The actor confirms this, saying, “All the films I have made with him have raked in over a billion dollars, so he has to have me in a film even if he has no part for me. In Dunkirk, I was only a voice-over and I got billing in the credit title.”

It is no surprise then that he is in Tenet (‘I don’t know what it means’), also starring John David Washington, Robert Pattinson, Elizabeth Debicki, Dimple Kapadia and Kenneth Branagh. “He [Nolan] is so secretive he won’t let me have the script. All I had was one day’s work and he gave me my pages. I did my part and shot only with John David. I haven’t heard anything since.”

The storyteller

While Caine often talks about how ‘there aren’t too many parts for 87-year-old men in the movies’, he has two other releases apart from Tenet this year. “There’s a modern version of Oliver Twist called Twist. It is very grown up and Rita Ora plays the Artful Dodger. Before Christmas, I did Best Sellers, a comedy movie in Montreal about an alcoholic author who has to go out and publicise his book.” The two slotted for 2021 are historical action drama Medieval and Four Kids and It (based on the eponymous 2012 novel by Jacqueline Wilson).

When he is not making films, the Alfie actor enjoys watching them. But not in theatres. “I wait for them to come on TV,” says Caine, who sent Twitter into a mini-meltdown in January when he tweeted about the Sam Mendes film, 1917. “It is one of the best war movies I have ever seen. It is very human. I would know a good war movie because I was a soldier in the Korean War,” he says.

A fan of OTT platforms, Caine has watched all the Jack Ryan adventures on Amazon and is currently watching The Crown. “I thought I knew everything about the British royalty, and every single episode (he has watched four now) has me sitting there with my mouth open, amazed about all these things I did not know. It is quite extraordinary.”

In verse

Off screen too, Caine is a raconteur extraordinaire. Over the years, he’s written multiple biographies; the last one was called Blowing the Bloody Doors Off.

He is now busy with his first attempts at fiction with a thriller, If You Don’t Want To Die. “I cannot write any more biographical books because I am 87,” he laughs, adding, “I do not read posh, intellectual fiction; I only read thrillers. I am having fun writing it, but I do not know whether anyone will have a great deal of fun reading it.”

187,2020/03/13,Mysskin responds to ‘Thupparivaalan 2’ allegations: ‘I must protect Tamil Nadu from Vishal’,"The ‘Psycho’ director went on an explosive rant, promising to expose Vishal’s true colours and that they were going to ‘war’ together

After actor Vishal posted a tirade against his former director Mysskin on social media explaining why they’d fallen out and how Vishal had taken over as actor-director of Thupparivaalan 2, now the Psycho filmmaker has delivered his side to the story.

The first look of the film also had no mention of Mysskin’s name, despite the director writing the script and completing over a month of shooting.

At a promotional event for ZEE5’s upcoming web series Kannamoochi, Mysskin took the stage, and after apologising to the organisers for his incoming rant, launched into an explosive speech.

The director first revealed that his script for Thupparivaalan 2 revolved around (possibly the robbery of) the Kohinoor diamond, and that he had conceptualised the movie to help Vishal with his debts, and even found a producer for the same.

“But Vishal wanted to produce it under his banner, even though it was an expensive project. I told him I’d write a different script that he could produce under 10 crores, and after his financial situation was stable, he could take on Thupparivaalan 3. But he was adamant.”

Mysskin then dismissed several claims that Vishal had made in his earlier posts against him, notably about Mysskin’s salary and the money he spent on filming. The filmmaker requested the media to ask for any proof for Vishal’s allegations before believing him.

Mysskin, Vishal and Ilaiyaraaja before the start of ‘Thupparivaalan 2’

“I considered him my brother. So when the conflict arose, because he refused to pay me the salary I was asking for, (Vishal wanted Mysskin to direct Thupparivaalan 2 for the same amount he had directed the original 2017 movie for), I decided to walk away from the project,” the filmmaker explained.

That’s when things got ugly. Mysskin states that not only did Vishal abuse him, but, “when my brother questioned him, he hit him! Vishal had the nerve to even refer to my mother with explicit words. I cannot believe I stood by him when nobody else did, and even supported him during the whole Nadigar Sangam campaign.”

Mysskin added that he completed 32 days of shooting, and was forced to give a NOC (no objection certificate) to Vishal to allow the production of the movie.

He added that he would expose the Action star’s true colours soon: “I’d told Vishal that he would face troubles because of his friends Ramana and Nanda, and now that has exactly happened! Vishal is a porukki (scoundrel). He’s a producer’s son and thinks he can get away with anything. I, however, am the son of a tailor, and came to this industry with just a blank paper and a pen. Can’t I do it all over again? My legacy of work will hold me in good stead.”

Mysskin concluded his speech, saying, “I must protect Tamil Nadu from him. Vishal, your troubles begin now, and you will not be able to sleep hereafter. Let’s go to war.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3vijlv/article31058955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/mysskin,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mysskin-responds-to-thupparivaalan-2-allegations-i-must-protect-tamil-nadu-from-vishal/article31058957.ece
188,2020/03/13,Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are taking it ‘one day at a time’ after coronavirus diagnosis,"The actor shared a picture of the couple, with an update on their health, on his social media platforms

Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson on Friday gave a health update from coronavirus quarantine, saying they are taking it “one day at a time“.

The couple, who is in isolation at a hospital in the state of Queensland in Australia, said they are being well cared for.

“Hello folks. @ritawilson and I want to thank everyone here Down Under who are taking such good care of us. We have COVID-19 and are in isolation so we do not spread it to anyone else. There are those for whom it could lead to a very serious illness. We are taking it one-day-at-a-time.There are things we can all do to get through this by following the advice of experts and taking care of ourselves and each other, no? Remember, despite all the current events, there is no crying in baseball,” Hanks posted on his social media accounts.

The post was accompanied by a photograph that showed the couple smiling.

Hanks announced on Thursday that he and his wife have been tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

The actor couple, who is currently in Australia to shoot for the pre-production of Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis Presley film, decided to get tested after they felt “a bit tired”.

189,2020/03/13,Coronavirus | Delhi cinema closure rattles Bollywood,"Release of Sooryavanshi postponed to unspecified date, Sir also deferred

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s decision to shut down cinema halls in the Capital till March 31 brought home the enormity of the COVID-19 impact on Bollywood with the release of one of the major films of this year, Rohit Shetty’s Sooryavanshi, deferred from its March 24 release, to an unspecified date.

Rohena Gera’s Sir, supposed to release next Friday, was also postponed to an indefinite date, while Yashraj Films have said it is yet to take a decision on Dibakar Banerjee’s Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar slated for March 20 release.

The Delhi CM’s decision was the last straw for the makers, who had been dithering on whether to release Sooryavanshi or not. A statement from Rohit Shetty Picturez said the postponement is “keeping in mind the health and safety of our beloved audience”.

According to Delhi exhibitor Sanjay Mehta, on an average, the Delhi-U.P. territory accounts for 22% of the revenue of Hindi films, with Delhi alone accounting for about 10 to 12% of the collections. Shailesh Kapoor, CEO of media consulting firm Ormax Media, put the figure between 10-15%. “Delhi’s is a sizeable share, can go up to 20% for a metro-centric film,” he said.

Mr. Mehta estimated that within the Delhi-U.P. territory, Delhi, with its multiplexes, brings in more for the so-called family or gentry films like the one releasing this Friday — Homi Adjania’s Angrezi Medium. “Delhi brings 60-65% collections for gentry films within the Delhi-UP territory and for mass films it could be 50-50 or 40-60 between Delhi and U.P.,” he said.

However, he said it will be difficult for Angrezi Medium to back out now at the last minute with overseas delivery, and that across the country, already locked. “They could have had second thoughts if the CM decision had come on Monday,” Mr. Mehta said.

Mr. Kapoor said the Delhi theatre closure decision was a major setback for the Hindi film industry, with every likelihood of it having a domino effect. “Other States may follow. The decision adds to the overall sense that it is not safe to venture out to watch a film,” he said.

A continuing Ormax study on the impact of COVID-19 on theatre-going behaviour showed 26% regular theatre-goers in India are likely to stay away from theatres till the threat of the infection is reduced. The survey was conducted across 80 cities in the Hindi-Tamil-Telugu industries belt between March 9 and 11. This was an increase from the 23% in the earlier poll conducted between March 6 and 8.

The spike was sharper in south India, with 21% saying they will stay away as opposed to 17% last week. In the Hindi belt, too, the figure had risen from 26% to 28%. The next round of results, out on Monday, might see a bigger leap now after the Delhi cinema closure.

Right now, the overall state hangs between caution, fear and panic — not entirely conducive for a moviegoing experience. “Watching movies is not something essential; it is a thing for relaxation,” said Mr. Kapoor, about why people would be keeping away from theatres volitionally. He said it would take time for people to come back to theatres even after they reopen in Delhi.

He had earlier cited to The Hindu the case of the film Main Khiladi Tu Anari, distributed by him back in 1994. “It started off at 100% collection. On the 6th day, the Delhi government ordered cinema closure due to a plague scare. The film couldn’t gather the same momentum when the theatres reopened.”

190,2020/03/13,2BHK project totals 10 crore sft housing space,"It is boosting State’s economy too, says Minister

The government is building 10 crore sft space through its prestigious double bedroom house scheme and this exercise has given a fillip to several other industries like cement, steel, iron and sand apart from providing employment to more than 70,000 people, said Housing Minister Vemula Prashanth Reddy.

In his response to the discussion on demands in the Assembly on Friday, he said the space being built by the government was equal to the housing space being constructed through all the real estate projects in Telangana.

One can understand the enormous exercise that the government has taken up going by the massive construction and it has contributed to the State’s economy as well, he said rejecting the criticism on the delay from the members.

Mr. Reddy admitted that there was some delay in the construction due to various factors, including availability of space. He said the government sanctioned 2.80 lakh houses in 2015 with an outlay of ₹18,000 crore spending ₹5.40 lakh on each unit in rural areas and ₹7 lakh in the GHMC area.

So far, tenders have been called for 1.99 lakh units of which 31,231 units are 50% completed and 1.10 lakh are nearing completion. Work on another 30,000 units will start soon, he said.

The Chief Minister has also decided to provide financial support to people who have land for construction and the modalities are being worked out, Mr. Reddy said.

SC Development Minister Koppula Eashwer said the three-acre land for landless Dalit families was a continuous affair and the government has so far distributed 16,138 acres to 6,385 families spending ₹ 707 crore.

The Minister also listed out various schemes for the Scheduled Castes and said the social welfare residential schools had become a symbol of pride across the country. The government spends ₹55,000 on each student on par with private schools.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/gvjz66/article31063947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14PRASHANTHREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/2bhk-project-totals-10-crore-sft-housing-space/article31063672.ece

194,2020/03/13,Govt. confident of additional resource mobilisation,"IR for government staff, filling up of vacancies in universities soon, says Finance Minister

Finance Minister T. Harish Rao has said that Opposition was apparently disappointed with the State Budget for 2020-21 as it did not give them any scope for serious criticism. The budget which balanced welfare and development turned out to be good for people as it reflected government seriousness to fulfil all the election promises.

He also indicated that the Chief Minister would announce interim relief to government employees in near future as the term of the Pay Revision Commission was extended till year-end.

The Finance Minister was replying to the general discussion on the Budget in the Legislative Council here on Friday. Despite economic slowdown, government did not compromise on welfare programmes and in fact increased the allocations to cover more beneficiaries under Aasara social security pensions, Kalyana Lakshmi, Residential schools and two BHK houses.

Responding to issues raised by N. Ramachandra Rao of the BJP and Jeevan Reddy of the Congress earlier during the two -day discussion on Budget, Mr. Harish Rao said that the government did not give an inflated budget outlay but it was based on the exercise done by the Cabinet sub-committee on resource mobilisation.

Sale of assets

With all elections over, hereafter the government’s focus would be only on revenue mobilisation through sand, mineral resources and disposing of non-performing assets of Rajiv Swagruha, Housing Board and curtailing wasteful expenditure.

On recruitment to government posts, he clarified that 1.23 lakh regular jobs were filled out of over 1.5 lakh jobs that were approved and 1.32 lakh jobs notified. The recruitment was on for 27,000 posts.

Fiscal deficit

A fiscal deficit of ₹33,000 crore was projected which was within the FRBM limits and the State would raise it definitely to meet its capital expenditure targets through market borrowings and other means. He also refuted the notion that State allocated only 9.6% of budget for education and said overall expenditure on education by education department and other departments like welfare, health and agriculture amounted to 12.45%. Government was also contemplating to make it mandatory for MLAs, MLCs to release funds from their CDF funds for strengthening government schools on the lines of residential schools. The vacant teaching posts in universities would be filled soon, he said.

The government would decide on the percentage of funds to be released to mandal and zilla parishads as the 15th Finance Commission also provided some scope. The 14th Finance Commission made provision for direct release of funds only to gram panchayats, the Finance Minister said. A decision on setting up fair price shops in new gram panchayats would be taken soon.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/o6e3p8/article31063096.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14HARISH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/govt-confident-of-additional-resource-mobilisation/article31063097.ece
195,2020/03/13,Kalaburagi COVID-19 victim came in contact with at least 34 in Telangana,"‘Contacts were kept in home isolation and their condition is being monitored’

The first COVID-19 casualty in India came in contact with at least 34 persons in Telangana during his visit to three private hospitals in the city on March 10. The 34 persons include staff from hospital, and ambulances that he had travelled in. More contacts may surface as the Telangana Health department staff are trying to trace with whom he came in contact.

Director of Public Health G Srinivas Rao said the 34 contacts were kept under home isolation. “Their condition is stable as of now and they are under active surveillance,” Dr Rao said.

Sources said that since it was only three-four days since he came in contact with the people, they might show symptoms in the coming days if they contracted COVID-19. Incubation period of the disease is one to 14 days.

“Samples were not collected from them. As their condition is being monitored, samples will be collected if any of them show symptoms of the infectious disease,” sources said.

The Kalaburagi man, who had stayed in Saudi Arabia from January 29 to February 29, landed in Hyderabad, and was headed for Kalaburagi. He developed the symptoms on March 6 and got admitted to a private hospital there. Samples were collected and sent for tests to Bengaluru.

However, the family got him discharged against medical advice (DAMA), and the brought him to Hyderabad on the morning of March 10. He was a known case of hypertension and asthma. At the hospitals, doctors identified him to be suffering from acute respiratory illness, cold, cough and fever.

They took him to at three hospitals in the city. One among them is CARE Hospitals in Banjara Hills. The hospital authorities said that he was isolated, and their healthcare professionals wore Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) while attending him

“He came to the Emergency department and was immediately shifted to an isolation room, equipped with negative air pressure and HEPA air filters as per international guidelines to prevent any further transmission.,” as per a media statement from the hospital.

They said that although the risk to life, if not admitted, had been explained to his family, they decided to take the patient back to their native place against medical advice. Health officials were informed of the case. Employees of the hospital who were suspected to have been around the patient are under home quarantine.

He died on the way back home on the night of March 10. Even before the declaration of his test result on Thursday, he was considered a high-risk case as he suffered from acute respiratory illness, fever and cough, and had travel history to Saudi Arabia.

The process of tracing the contacts started late on Thursday night soon after news broke that the 76-year-old man from Kalaburagi who died tested positive for coronavirus which causes COVID-19. Calls were exchanged between officials, staff, and private hospitals managements. Officials said there could be more people who could have got in contact with the 76-year-old.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/x0h6b8/article31064517.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY13COVID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kalaburagi-covid-19-victim-came-in-contact-with-at-least-34-in-telangana/article31062948.ece
196,2020/03/13,TS to connect remotest parts of State by air,"State planning greenfield airports, chain of heliports to re-activate old airports/airstrips: KTR

The Telangana government plans to re-activate old airports/airstrips, create greenfield airports and establish a chain of heliports to connect the remotest parts of the State, Industries and IT Minister K. T. Rama Rao said on Friday.

It proposed three greenfield airports to the Union Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) and an equal number of brownfield facilities for revival, the Minister told the inaugural session of Wings India 2020 civil aviation conference and exhibition that this year has ‘Flying for All’ as the theme.

The three greenfield airports proposed are at Bhadradri-Kothagudem, Jakaranpally in Nizamabad and Gudibanda village in Adakkal mandal of Mahabubnagar. The three brownfield airports are at Mamnoor village in Warangal Urban district, Basanthnagar in Peddapally district and in Adilabad.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) was appointed by the State government consultant for preparing techno feasibility studies for existing airstrips (brownfield) and feasibility studies for greenfield airports, Mr. Rao said.

Noting that the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA) in Hyderabad was the primary airport in the State, the Minister said the government was actively working with various stakeholders to make the Warangal airport functional as soon as possible. It would boost regional air transport and support various other initiatives such as the mega textile park and the information technology hub launched in the city.

Bidar model

All stakeholders had agreed to work together to operationalise Warangal airport soon with an operating model similar, possibly, to Bidar airport.

Such efforts had become necessary considering Warangal is located within the 150-km concession zone agreed with RGIA. The State government had also requested MoCA to include Warangal Airport under Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS-UDAN), he said.

Stating that the Wings event provided an opportunity to showcase the State to the aviation industry, the Minister said there was a huge opportunity for MROs (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) in Hyderabad. “We see this as a great opportunity for investment and high-value employment creation and aspire to be a hub of airline and engine MROs activities,” he said.

The State was among the first to slash Value Added Tax (VAT) on Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) from 16% to 1%, setting an example for other States — a decision that gave a boost to regional airline industry. It prompted leading operators such as Spicejet and Indigo to expand their operational base in Hyderabad.

Mr. Rao also highlighted other policy measures and support mechanism which the State had extended to support the aviation and aerospace eco-system.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/db4lo6/article31064125.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THMIN-SOUTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ts-to-connect-remotest-parts-of-state-by-air/article31062380.ece

198,2020/03/13,"TSRTC to improve efficiency, cut operational costs: Minister","A number of passenger-friendly measures being introduced, Minister tells Assembly

The Telangana State Road Transport Corporation has initiated a series of measures, including introduction of 1,334 hired buses, to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency.

These buses are being hired from private entrepreneurs to cater to the needs of passengers in place of buses that were being diverted for the cargo services proposed to be introduced shortly. The corporation has identified potential traffic generation points in all depots where employees are being posted as traffic guides to guide the passengers.

Announcements are being made to announce arrival timings of buses through hand held mikes and efforts are on to make the buses observe “halt & go” by stopping the bus for few minutes to facilitate more number of passengers to board the bus and avoid bunching of buses to maintain even frequency, Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar said.

Replying to queries during the Question Hour in the Legislative Assembly on Friday, the Minister said the corporation was implementing passenger friendly initiatives like “halt & go”, “shout & load”, “hail & board” and “alight on request” to improve occupancy ratio and realise more revenue. Senior officers of the corporation were adopting loss making depots to improve profitability of the depots as well as the corporation.

Youth trained

Labour and Employment Minister Ch. Malla Reddy said a total of 18,501 youth of the 23,047 enrolled were given skill development training. Of these, 5,964 youth had been given placements under the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana Centrally Sponsored State Managed (PMKVY-CSSM) scheme.

The Central government had sanctioned ₹71.13 crore to the State under the scheme and only ₹22.94 crore had been released so far. The State was yet to get the balance ₹48 crore, he told the Legislative Assembly.

Overseas scholarship

Social Welfare Minister Koppula Eshwar informed the Legislative Assembly that the government had spent ₹230.4 crore under the Chief Minister Overseas Scholarship Scheme providing financial assistance to poor students from minority communities to pursue their higher studies in foreign universities.

Replying to queries, the Minister said the government selected 1,685 students for the scholarship so far and the government had made provision of ₹42 crore for the scheme in the next financial year. When asked about enhancing the number of students beyond the stipulated 500, he said the government would consider the enhancement once the limit was reached. “The existing quota of 500 is not being filled. The government will consider increasing the number after the number of students crosses 500,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/wp2fdk/article31062234.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14TSRTCHQ,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tsrtc-to-improve-efficiency-cut-operational-costs-minister/article31062235.ece
199,2020/03/13,"Greenery, sanitation improving in villages under Palle Pragathi","It would be a continuous ongoing programme, Minister tells Council

Palle Pragathi will not be a periodical drive but a continuous programme for comprehensively changing the face of the villages and living conditions of people with focus on sanitation, greenery and basic amenities, said Panchayat Raj and Rural Development Minister Errabelli Dayakar Rao.

Participating in the short discussion on ‘Palle Pragathi’ programme in the State in the Legislative Council here on Friday, Mr. Dayakar Rao said that sanitation work should be an every day affair and village development plans should be prepared and accordingly the funds should be spent in a transparent manner. So far special awareness and sensitization programme was conducted in two phases.

Officers and elected representatives would stay in the villages overnight to undertake inspections, conduct padayatras and undertake necessary works with the people’s participation. Flying squads were also created for inspections under the aegis of 45 senior IAS, IPS and IFS officers.

Funds for ZP

Syed Amin Jafri of MIM congratulated the Chief Minister and TRS government for Palle Pragathi and suggested that they should also sanction funds to the mandals and zilla parishads. The Telangana State Finance Commission which was constituted three years ago to give its report on allocation of funds to local bodies did not convene an all party meeting so far to seek their suggestions. The local bodies were not getting their due share in the professional tax, stamps and registration etc., collected by the State. He said the SFC should ensure the local bodies got their share in State tax devolution.

TRS member Karne Prabhakar said rural economy was improving due to welfare and development works taken up by government and people were now inclined to return to villages. BJP member N. Ramachandra Rao also said if villages were developed on par with urban areas, reverse migration would happen.

‘Exceptional work’

Mr. Prabhakar citing his personal experiences, said he could witness exceptional results in villages like Ibrahimpuram in Siddipet. Good rural transformation could be achieved if village sarpanch, people, employees, political parties and people’s representatives were committed to development of their villages. A sarpanch, a retired teacher took an initiative and raised ₹25 lakh from his old students and NRIs and undertook development works in the village without waiting for government funds.

In Ibrahimpuram, one could see thousands of neem trees and there were no tree guards as even animals were trained by people not to go anywhere near them and every house in the village has a rainwater harvesting pit and that resulted in rise in water table. He suggested that RWH pits should be made mandatory under Palle Pragathi programme and sarpanch should be made responsible for upkeep of village tank.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ps5rox/article31061916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14ERRABELLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/greenery-sanitation-improving-in-villages-under-palle-pragathi/article31061917.ece
200,2020/03/13,HC to decide Revanth Reddy’s pleas on Tuesday,"MP moved HC to quash FIR and grant bail

Justice G. Sridevi of Telangana High Court on Friday posted to Tuesday to dispose of three writ petitions filed by Malkajgiri MP A. Revanth Reddy, who has been lodged in prison for past nine days, challenging his arrest.

The pleas, one seeking bail, another to set aside his remand order and the third to quash the FIR, will be heard on Tuesday for passing final orders, the judge said. Initially the judge posted the bail petition to Friday as it came up for hearing first.

The MP’s lawyer, however, appealed to the judge that Supreme Court senior counsel Salman Khurshid Alam Khan would appear for Mr. Reddy for the remaining two pleas and sought audience. When the senior lawyer rose to present his arguments, the government counsel said the other two petitions too be posted for Friday like the first one stating that time was required to file counter affidavits by the police.

Case not maintainable

The senior counsel, however, said the very criminal case registered against the MP under Section 188 of IPC was not maintainable. Citing a Supreme Court verdict, he told the court that Section 188 of IPC mandates that a senior police officer or an appropriate authority should give a written complaint to register a case under that section.

“The FIR states that a junior constable G. Venkatesh along with another constable J. Kumar informed Narsingi police Station House Officer about Revanth Reddy and others using drones to film a farm house,” the senior lawyer said. Based on this a criminal case has been registered against the MP. In the backdrop of the the apex court’s clear ruling on the mater, Section 188 of IPC cannot be invoked and hence the FIR should be quashed, Mr. Salman Khurshid argued.

Moreover, Mr. Reddy is a parliamentarian and has to attend the ongoing Lok Sabha session. The section invoked against the MP invites a maximum punishment of one month of imprisonment and up to ₹ 200 fine. Already, the public representative is in jail for nine days. If the court adjourns it for another week, the MP will be serving half the punishment for a case registered without any justification, he contended.

Political mileage

Public Prosecutor Pratap Reddy told the court that police did not arrest the MP but the latter surrendered himself before the police compelling the police to arrest him. At this stage, the judge asked the PP if the mandatory notice was served to the MP under Section 41-A of Criminal Procedure Code before the arrest.

When the PP replied that the MP surrendered himself, the judge asked if “it was not the duty of the police to serve the notice to the MP”. Mr. Salman Khurshid said issuing the FIR against the MP was travesty of justice. The PP, however, argued that the MP tried to “derive political mileage” out of the issue and his actions of using drone to film a “VIP’s property” posed threat to the VIP.

The senior counsel said, in that case, “release the MP and you derive the political mileage”.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/6btk4w/article31064009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY14AREVANTHREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/hc-to-decide-revanth-reddys-pleas-on-tuesday/article31061507.ece

COVID-19 scare-driven rumours are wringing the poultry industry in the district with the prices of chicken hitting almost rock bottom.

Social media posts that coronavirus is spread by eating chicken and eggs have hit the poultry industry with near zero sales. So much so, vegetables, by default, have become costlier than chicken in the district.

Chicken feed prices

For instance, a kg of dressed skinless chicken is being sold at ₹ 50 per kg, and live birds at ₹ 30 per kg. A kg of ridge-gourd, in comparison, is going at ₹ 60 per kg. In fact, poultry farmers are touring villages in trolleys offering live birds at ₹ 100 for three kg with few takers. A fortnight ago, dressed skinless chicken was sold at ₹ 180 per kg.

Moreover, unable to feed live birds, poultry farmers are resorting to distress sales of chicken at prices lowest ever in the district. In 2006 when bird flu hit the country, chicken was sold at ₹ 20 per kg. Prices of eggs also have come down from ₹ 5 a piece to ₹ 3.

The local poultry industry is in a crisis pushing farmers into a debt-trap. According to sources, each farmer spends around ₹ 130 to ₹ 145 per bird for its growth for about one month to make it weigh 2.5 kg, to sell at ₹ 200 per bird.

While virus-scared people are avoiding eating chicken and eggs at home, even in marriage functions serving of chicken and eggs has come down.

Distress sales, few takers

District Poultry Farmers’ Association leader Vontela Muralikrishna Reddy said poultry farmers have incurred huge debts following COVID-19 rumours. “During the bird flu outbreak of 2006, there was a decline in chicken consumption to some extent. But with social media now, rumours have spread very fast and are proving dearly to the farmers,” he stated.

Sudheer Reddy, another poultry farmer said he was forced to sell away around 2,000 live birds at for 60,000 instead of ₹ 3 lakh incurring huge losses. “Earlier I used to sell eight quintals of chicken per day. Now, am unable to sell even 100 kg in spite of reducing the price,”a chicken centre owner in Bhagathnagar said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/covid-19-rumours-hit-chicken-and-egg-prices-in-karimnagar/article31060620.ece
206,2020/03/13,Yapalguda land losers’ Godot wait for the promised benefits,"Once land-owning farmers, some have been forced to become labourers to eke out a living

Scheduled Caste (SC) farmers and their families of Yapalguda in Adilabad rural mandal had welcomed the proposal to establish the headquarters of an Indian Reserve Battalion close to their village. Nearly two years later, some of them are ruing their enthusiasm, thanks to the delay in the promised compensatory benefits to those who have lost their agriculture lands.

As the case goes, in 2017-18, the State government had acquired over 100 acres of land through GO number 73 of the Revenue Department dated May 10, 2017 in survey number 191, which was all government land assigned to SC farmers. Over eight acres of private patta land was also acquired subsequently.

No jobs yet

During the acquisition process the government had promised to allocate three acres to the dalit farmers under the land purchase scheme besides promising jobs to eligible members of the families which lost their lands, according to the farmers. “It is over two years since our land was acquired but none of my three sons were given a job as promised,” lamented 85-year-old Sada Shivanna.

The old farmer said the government had acquired his more than five acres of land forcing his sons to earn a livelihood by working as labourers. Kothur Ganganna, another farmer who lost 1 acre and 53 cents of his land had the same grouse.

Vacuous responses

“I have been meeting leaders and officials to request them to give a job as promised to my son. No one has given me any satisfactory reply so far,” he added. Many villagers gathered to narraate their woes when The Hindu visited Yapalguda, about seven km away from Adilabad on the Satnala route.

The villagers showed copies of the pattadar passbooks for the lands they had been assigned several years ago. Some of them said the lands had been under cultivation since the times of their grandfathers.

The Battalion Commandant R. Venugopal said there are six or seven land-losing families who remain to be given contract jobs. “The jobs will be given in the next financial year when the notification for recruitment of cooks comes out,” he asserted.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/r62jfi/article31064143.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14HYADILA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sc-farmers-who-lost-lands-yet-to-be-compensated/article31059037.ece
207,2020/03/13,Trade licencing mela from March 19 to 21 in Karimnagar,"Daily water supply scheme to be launched next month

In order to bring more people into the tax-fold, the Municipal Corporation of Karimnagar (MCK) has decided to launch special trade licencing mela at the municipal office in Karimnagar town from March 19 to 21.

Ironically, though there are several traders in the town, only a few have trade licences with them. Against the target of collecting ₹60 lakh during the financial year 2019-20, the authorities could collect only ₹10 lakh so far.

Accordingly, the MCK authorities have decided to launch a special mela to issue trade licences to all the traders in the town.

Disclosing this to newsmen here on Thursday, Municipal Commissioner Valluru Kranthi said that only 850 traders have applied for trade licences in the town, when there are more than 5,500 traders doing various businesses. Appealing to all the traders to apply of trade licences, she said that they had simplified the procedure and informed them to come with personal details, ID proof, trade name, lease deed or rental agreement or self-certification.

She said that the sanitation staff would be visiting each trader in the town and distribute the application form for applying for the trade licence during the three-day mela. She also said that they would launch a special drive for the recovery of pending arrears from the traders. The trade licence fee ranges from ₹ 850 per annum to ₹12,000 per annum for different trades.

With regard to the collection of property tax to the tune of ₹ 26 crore during this financial year, she said that they had achieved 67% of the target. She urged people to pay property tax on time and avoid penalisation of 2% interest on the tax and added that the bill collectors are already in the field for the collection of taxes.

With regard to the drive against the encroachments of footpaths, she said that they are removing all encroachments on the main R&B roads on a priority basis, and later on other roads in the town.

She also said that all illegal encroachment of roads by auto-wallahs will be cleared with the help of police in otder to regulate the smooth flow of traffic.

Ms. Kranthi said that the MCK authorities are taking all measures for launch of daily water supply in Karimnagar, tentatively in the first week of April, and before a trial run is to be conducted to check for leakages and other problems.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/t1ao35/article31053871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY13KRANTHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trade-licencing-mela-from-march-19-to-21-in-karimnagar/article31053872.ece
208,2020/03/13,Her story,"Giriraj brings K Shivarama Karanth’s iconic 1937 novel, Sarasammana Samadhi, on stage

K Shivarama Karanth’s novel, Sarasammana Samadhi, is as relevant today as it was when it was first published in 1937. “Karanth’s thoughts on feminism will be presented on stage in Ashvagosha Theatre Trust’s Maasthi Kallu,” says Giriraj BM, the playwright and director of the play.

Giriraj, who has won State awards for his films Jatta, Mythri and Amaraavti, has directed superstars including Mohan Lal and Punith Rajkumar, trained many young heroes of the Kannada film industry and has been part of the faculty of cinema schools of Nagathihalli Chandrashekar and Gurudeshpande.

Sarasammana Samadhi tells the story of a couple’s inability to understand each other against the backdrop of blind beliefs and orthodoxy. “The women of the village visit the Sarasamma’s grave offering her water and coconut in the hope that she will solve their relationship problems. Bringing the play alive on stage in a way to connect with millennial audience was also a challenge,” says Giriraj. Karanth’s novel which won a Sahitya Akademi Award offers a searing account of the suffering and humiliation Indian women went through in the hands of patriarchy that was prevalent across caste and class. “The novel also addresses Sati and marriage,” says Giriraj who read the novel when R Nagesh wanted to do a serial based on it 18 years ago. “The novel moved me as it dealt with complex topics with simple, accessible dialogues.”

Giriraj was happy that Ashvagosha approached him to adapt and direct the novel for stage as the story had marinated in his psyche for nearly two decades. Giriraj adapted the novel for stage in three days. “I did spend a lot of time on rehearsals steering the 22 actors through the 90-minute production, as both the serious and comic sections had to be subtly balanced to do justice to the book.”

Managing a large cast came easy to Giriraj. “I am used to working with many actors. My play Sugandada Seemeyaache, which won the Nataka Academy Award, had 40 actors. There are both amateurs and senior actors in the play. We have already had three shows and the audience reacted emotionally to the way we have staged certain scenes.”

Giriraj says the climax is a big hit. “At the end of the play the way the ghost expresses her feelings about society has been appreciated.” Giriraj says Abhilash Laakra has given a contemporary spin to the music. “The play is modern as it talks of relationships and male superiority. The music is in tune with present-day sensibilities.”

Maasthi Kallu will be staged on March 15 at KH Kalasoudha, Hanumanthanagar at 7.30 pm. Tickets are available at the venue and bookmyshow.com",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/gmlhlu/article31062291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14bgm-FYI-MaasthiKAllu3jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/maasthi-kallu-sarasammana-samadhi-ashvagosha-theatre-theatre-giriraj-bm/article31062299.ece
209,2020/03/13,Warli art and the stick figure stories from Hyderabad,"They are everywhere: on walls at busy junctions, bus stops... artists in the city are using the traditional Warli art form to not just beautify Hyderabad, but also to create awareness on important issues

The hour-glass stick figures seem to be celebrating a festival. Painted on mud red walls at the busy junctions of Ameerpet, Jubilee Hills check post and Yousufguda, they also convey an important message: to keep our streets clean and not urinate in public. The figures are of the Warli art form, which is finding its way not just on to city walls, but bags and bedsheets too. The city’s artscape has new stories to tell, and many of them use the art form as the medium.

Sohel Sayyad is a gifted Warli artist pursuing his MFA from Pune; he travels to Hyderabad every month for his art projects and workshops. He, along with his friend Shashank Azad, runs Dream Brush Studios in Banjara Hills, that does commissioned art works. “Warli is a traditional art form of Maharashtra,” says Sohel, a native of Male Nagar in the State’s Solapur district. A shepherd during his younger days, he used to watch farmers working in the fields; he was always fascinated by clouds. He is a self-taught artist and began painting when he was 16.

Simplicity is the key in Warli. Figures are created out of geometrical shapes — two triangles, stick-like hands and legs, a circle (representing face), a smaller circle (only for female form to indicate a hair bun) and square. “In Maharashtra, Warli is part of every child’s growing up years. Parents initiate children into it as they would traditional food and music,” he says. Sohel paints Warli figures on bags and bedsheets too. Using acrylic colours and liquid embroidery glue, he spreads the cloth like a canvas to paint on; once it dries, the cloth is ironed out, leaving the Warli imprint. He also does portraits and landscapes and one of his popular works in the city is a depiction of floral festival Bathukamma in Warli. For this, he researched on the significance of flowers and why women release them in water. “Unlike other art forms that need a perspective and colour scheme, Warli is easy to do and draws everyone to it.”

Adding more colours

Warli art on a bag by artist Sohel Sayyad

Warli has appealing themes. At Ahobilam Foods in Madhapur, a 560 square feet wall has a monochromatic depiction of a village scene: roosters crow, farmers walk about the fields, work, and return home after sunset. With millets forming an important part of the menu at the restaurant, the work gives diners an idea bout where their food came from.

Professional artist Ganesh C shares the inspiration behind this work: “Millets are an indigenous food and my idea was to create an art work that connects us to the earth and makes us feel rooted.” Ganesh has done Government projects at places such as Shilparamam, Visakhapatnam, Orissa and Chattisgarh. He attributes Warli’s rise in the city to the fact that it can covey themes in a simple manner. “Warli represents our villages; here, people struggle, but never pause to reflect on their pain. Warli brings alive a village environment where some activity is always happening. You can see people playing drums, dancing...these spirited and animated forms touch hearts.”

Trishna Patnaik | Photo Credit: By arrangement

A few days ago, Mumbai-based artist Trishna Patnaik’s Warli workshop at Jxtapose introduced the art and explained its uniqueness to participants. She explains, “Warli is about day-to-day life and the human connection. A vital part of it is what one does on a regular day — agriculture, weddings, anything a common man will do. There are no deities involved and there is no striking colour palette either,” she observes. “Unlike Mumbai, South India is more grounded and interested in tribal art. People are rooted and love to nurture such art forms.”

Every weekend around 20 volunteers of Bhoomi Foundation select an area to remove posters from the walls, paint and beautify it with different forms of art including Warli. It has been one year since software professional Gopalakrishna Nimmala started working with the foundation. “I enjoy painting Warli forms on the walls of busy junctions,” he says.

Bhoomi’s founder Tejaswi Podapati says that the idea behind choosing Warli is to tell a new story with the past in tow. “This art form was used by our ancestors and we want to rekindle people’s interest in it and also give out a message. These simple figures are powerful in capturing people’s imagination. The best thing about it is that even amateur artists like our volunteers can attempt it,” she says. Bhoomi has around 3500 volunteers from different backgrounds who have cleaned public walls of around 150 bus stops in the city.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/9cxcl6/article31058492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym13warli4,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/the-figures-of-the-warli-art-form-is-finding-its-way-on-to-hyderabads-walls-and-bags-and-bedsheets-too/article31058499.ece

211,2020/03/13,Jyotiraditya Scindia’s growing discontentment in Madhya Pradesh was obvious,"The Congress plunged itself into crisis by downplaying differences within the State unit, snubbing detractors, or simply looking the other way

During the 14-month tenure of the Madhya Pradesh government, ominous signs of Jyotiraditya Scindia’s seething revolt were read accurately, and astutely, by a political party, though on the wrong side of the spectrum — the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Congress, on the other hand, took him for a fusspot, downplayed differences, snubbed detractors, or simply looked the other way.

If the January 2019 meeting after the Assembly elections, between the BJP’s Shivraj Singh Chouhan, denied the Leader of the Opposition’s post, and Mr. Scindia, denied the Chief Minister’s post, failed to rouse the Congress, at least his support for Article 370’s dilution; the erasure of references to the posts Mr. Scindia has held with the Congress from his Twitter handle (the “former Union Minister, MP of Guna” is now described as “public servant, cricket enthusiast”); his unhappiness with the survey of damage caused by the 2019 floods and claim that poll promises were unkept, pointed to only one direction — an imminent cutting of ties. Still, his undue advice to Chief Minister Kamal Nath to “listen to others” was too sinister to go unnoticed.

Full circle

At the “courtesy meeting” with Mr. Chouhan at his residence, he hinted at burying the hatchet after the election by saying “raat gayi toh baat gayi”. The BJP on the stump, especially in his Gwalior-Chambal stronghold, had mocked his titular title: “Maaf karo Maharaj, hamara neta toh Shivraj (‘Sorry Maharaj, our leader is Shivraj’). On Wednesday, Mr. Chouhan, coming a full circle, stated: “Today Maharaj and Shivraj have become one,” this time, in the presence of Mr. Scindia’s aunt Yashodhara Raje, a BJP MLA, while in New Delhi Mr. Scindia praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership after joining the party.

Second-most popular

Mr. Scindia toured around 100 segments in the run-up to the election and was the second-most popular leader after Mr. Chouhan, the former Chief Minister who strode ahead by 10%-12% points, according to a CSDS-Lokiniti survey. If during the Lok Sabha election, a BJP candidate secured the mandate to re-elect Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister, the Assembly election brought back Congress that rode on Mr. Scindia’s popularity, with his appointment as Chief Minister as the logical end. Refusing to settle for the Deputy Chief Minister’s post, Mr. Scindia was placated by close friend Rahul Gandhi to accept Mr. Nath instead.

The first clear sign of factional rift between Mr. Scindia and Mr. Nath came rather obliquely in the form of Ministers from both sides squabbling in a Cabinet meeting in June, days after the Congress secured the Chhindwara seat, the Nath family’s base, the only one of the 29 seats in the Lok Sabha election. A Minister close to Mr. Nath interjected Pradyumna Singh Tomar while speaking, symbolising an open cornering of the Scindia faction, prompting the Chief Minister to intervene.

Then in August, Mr. Scindia’s dissent amplified nationally, with his backing for diluting Article 370, opposed by the Congress in Parliament. Flirting with the idea of his changing ranks, the BJP in Bhind put up a poster congratulating him for supporting the Centre’s decision, positioning Mr. Scindia, Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Mr. Modi in the same frame. Still, to the Congress, the episode seemed too trivial to take notice. Leader of the Opposition Gopal Bhargava even called upon him to quit the party.

Although Mr. Scindia had publicly nursed the idea to be the Chief Minister, later he too often said he never ran after post or power. Yet, his supporters relentlessly and openly vouched to make him the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) chief, another portfolio with Mr. Nath, to secure a Rajya Sabha ticket for him, and pledged allegiance even if he abandoned the party.

Several signs

While in August, a loyalist threatened to quit the party along with 500 workers if Mr. Scindia was kept at bay from the State’s politics and not made PCC chief, in November an MLA stated he would be the first to quit the party if Mr. Scindia did, in January this year an MLA sat on dharna in the Assembly claiming poll promises were not kept, and another leader in February implored him to revive his father’s defunct party. During each of these episodes, Congress spokespersons told The Hindu infighting within the party was a spectre conjured up by the BJP to stoke anxiety and divert attention from governance.

The only time the Congress’s central leadership took notice was when Forest Minister Umang Singhar wrote to Sonia Gandhi, alleging Digivijaya Singh was attempting to destabilise government and interfering in it. While Mr. Scindia backed the Minister, Mr. Nath said only he was in-charge of the government, denying the charge, further alienating Mr. Scindia. Sonia Gandhi had later sought a report, but no disciplinary action was taken.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kvpa36/article31063433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE14-SCINDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jyotiraditya-scindias-growing-discontentment-in-madhya-pradesh-was-obvious/article31063434.ece
212,2020/03/13,BJP springs a surprise by fielding 2 RS candidates from Rajasthan,"Polls slated for March 26; tough fight likely for the seats

The Bharatiya Janata Party sprang a surprise on Friday when it fielded two candidates from Rajasthan for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections. The biennial polls for three seats of the Upper House from the State, scheduled for March 26, will witness a tough fight between the BJP and the ruling Congress.

The BJP, which had earlier announced its State unit vice-president and former Minister Rajendra Gehlot as its sole candidate, fielded former MP Onkar Singh Lakhawat on the last day for filing of nomination papers on Friday. As the Congress has also fielded two candidates, a tough contest is on the cards for the three seats.

Mr. Gehlot and Mr. Lakhawat, accompanied by Leader of Opposition in the Assembly Gulab Chand Kataria, filed their nomination papers at the Assembly Secretariat. Mr. Lakhawat told reporters that he had received instructions from BJP president J.P. Nadda to file his nomination as the party's official candidate.

Nominations filed

Congress candidates K.C. Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi submitted their nomination papers to the Assembly Secretary and Returning Officer Pramil Mathur in the presence of Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Deputy CM Sachin Pilot and government chief whip Mahesh Joshi.

AICC general secretary Mr. Venugopal, who earlier represented the Alappuzha Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala, had opted out of contesting the 2019 general elections because of his organisational responsibilities. Mr. Dangi, a former Youth Congress State president, is considered a confidant of Mr. Gehlot. He had unsuccessfully contested three Assembly elections in the past.

With its tally of 107 MLAs in the 200-member House and the support of Rashtriya Lok Dal and Independents, the ruling Congress could have an easy win on two of the Rajya Sabha seats in the absence of a formidable opposition. The fight will be tough with the entry of two BJP nominees.

A Samajwadi Party leader in Uttar Pradesh has put up a banner of former BJP MLA and rape convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar and former Union Minister Swami Chinmayanand, also facing sexual exploitation allegations, in Lucknow.

The banner, in black background and white font, was put up right next to a large hoarding naming those accused in the violence against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act last December.

The banner featuring Mr. Chinmayanand and Sengar lists out the criminal charges against them in the rape cases faced by them and asks the general public to beware of them. “These are the culprits of the State, beware of them,” the banner said.

“When protesters don’t have any privacy, and when even after the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court the Yogi government is not removing the hoardings, then take this,” I.P Singh, who is a spokesperson of the SP, said in a tweet.

He justified his banner saying it was to alert women against “criminals named by court,” in public interest.

Banner removed

The police have apparently taken off the banner put up by Mr. Singh, who is a former BJP leader.

He said the police removed the banner in the middle of the night. “If the police had shown the same urgency in the security of women, then U.P. would not be number one in crime. the U.P. government is with the criminals. Yogi government has been fully exposed,” he said.

217,2020/03/13,Saradha scam: Calcutta HC asks West Bengal government to inform how it plans to disburse amount to duped investors,"The Bench directed the State to inform within four weeks, in the form of an affidavit, how it plans to disburse the remaining amount to the affected persons.

The Calcutta High Court directed the West Bengal government on Friday to inform how it plans to disburse an unutilised amount of over ₹138 crore out of ₹500 crore earmarked for compensating investors duped in the Saradha chit fund scam.

A Division Bench, comprising Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Suvra Ghosh, observed that it was a declared scheme for compensating the investors, for which the amount of ₹500 crore was allotted by the State.

The Bench directed the State to inform within four weeks, in the form of an affidavit, how it plans to disburse the remaining amount to the affected persons.

The court also asked the State government to place before it a report by the Justice (retd.) Shyamal Sen Commission within four weeks.

The Bench also directed the CBI, which is investigating the chit fund scams involving various companies including the Saradha Group, to file before it a progress report of the probe.

Subir Dey, an investor in the Saradha Ponzi scheme, petitioned the high court claiming that all of the ₹500 crore earmarked for compensating the affected persons have not been disbursed.

His lawyer Arindam Das said that as per a reply to an RTI application, the State government has said that ₹138.95 crore of the ₹500 crore was not disbursed.

219,2020/03/13,Madhya Pradesh govt. reopens economic offences cases against Jyotiraditya Scindia,"A day after Jyotiraditya Scindia joined the BJP, the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh on Thursday reopened two cases against him and his family relating to falsifying information and forgery of land documents.

The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) had admitted an appeal by Surendra Shrivastav, who had filed two complaints in 2014, to reopen and verify the merits of the cases as he was “unsatisfied” with their closure after investigation, said a note by the wing.

“The wing is verifying the application letter given by him,” said the note.

On March 26, 2014, Mr. Shrivastav had filed an application at the wing requesting inquiry in a case wherein Mr. Scindia and his family in 2009 had bought land in Gwalior’s Mahalgaon, and showed his land 6,000 square feet smaller during its registry.

In the second case, for which he filed a complaint on August 28, 2014, Mr. Shrivastav alleged the Chairman and trustees of the Scindia Devasthan Charitable Trust in connivance with the administration forged documents to sell government land in Mahalgaon.

Pankaj Chaturvedi, Mr. Scindia’s spokesperson, said the action by the EOW was being taken with a feeling of vengeance. “Nothing is going to happen anyway. These cases were closed earlier owing to lack of evidence. Still, all this is being done with a burning feeling of vengeance.” He further said, “We have full faith in law and the Constitution, from where we will get justice and the Kamal Nath, who is out to take revenge will get a stern response.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/madhya-pradesh-govt-reopens-economic-offences-cases-against-jyotiraditya-scindia/article31059043.ece

A Samajwadi Party leader in Uttar Pradesh has put up in Lucknow a banner of former BJP MLA and rape convict Kuldeep Singh Sengar and former Union Minister Swami Chinmayanand, also facing sexual exploitation allegations.

The banner, in black background and white font, was put up right next to a large hoarding naming those accused in the violence against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) last December.

The banner featuring Chinmayanand and Sengar lists out the criminal charges against them in the rape cases faced by them and asks the general public to beware of them. “These are the culprits of the State, beware of them,” the banner said.

“When protesters don’t have any privacy, and when even after the orders of the High Court and the Supreme Court the Yogi government is not removing the hoardings, then take this,” Mr. I.P. Singh, who is a spokesperson of the SP, said in a tweet.

223,2020/03/13,Kamal Nath requests Madhya Pradesh Governor to hold floor test in upcoming Assembly session,"The Chief Minister appeals to Lalji Tandon to approach Union Home Minister to ensure release of 19 ‘captive’ MLAs in Bengaluru

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Friday requested Governor Lalji Tandon to hold a floor test in the Assembly session that starts from March 16 on a date fixed by the Speaker and use his office with the Union Home Minister for the release of 19 MLAs “held in captivity” in Bengaluru.

In a letter submitted to Mr. Tandon at Raj Bhavan in Bhopal, Mr. Nath said, “We expect enquiry and investigation on the resignation letters submitted by BJP, allegedly of the captive Congress MLAs, is acted upon and completed early.”

The letters of 19 of the 22 rebel MLAs were carried by former BJP Minister Bhupendra Singh from a Bengaluru resort to the Speaker on Tuesday. So far, the Speaker has served notices on 13 of them, asking them to appear before him in person and attest to having resigned of their own accord.

Meanwhile, on the request of Mr. Nath on Tuesday, Mr. Tandon issued an order to remove six rebel Ministers from the Cabinet with immediate effect, said Raj Bhavan sources.

Speaker N.P. Prajapati had asked the six rebel MLAs to appear before him on Friday and attest to their resignations in person, but they failed to appear.

“I had served notices on six MLAs according to the rules, and I waited for three hours today. But, no one came. I will give them another date now,” he said, adding that another set of MLAs had been asked to appear on Saturday.

Opinion | A self-created political decline

In the letter, Mr. Nath wrote that in these disturbing circumstances, the very edifice of democracy was in danger. “Trust of a transparent democratic process seems lost. It merits full investigation and enquiry, so that persons responsible for derailing the democratic institutional process are exposed and punished,” he said.

They would not leave any stone unturned to “ensure the triumph of democracy and the legislative process, to uphold the Constitution and the values enshrined therein,” Mr. Nath assured the State people.

‘Immoral, unethical acts’

With the subject: “Horse trading of MLAs by the Bharatiya Janata Party”, the letter detailed instances of “immoral, unethical and illegal acts of the BJP in Madhya Pradesh”.

Pointing out the first attempt on the intervening night of March 3 and 4, he said the “the midnight leading to whisking away of MLAs to Bengaluru is in public domain.” He claimed that the Congress foiled the BJP’s attempt at keeping in captivity the MLAs by using both allurement and force.

Explaining the second attempt on March 8, he wrote that the BJP had whisked away the 19 Congress MLAs in three chartered aircraft to Bengaluru. “Since, these 19 MLAs, of whom six are Cabinet Ministers, are incommunicado in a resort arranged by the BJP, nobody is allowed access and/or any sort of communication with them,” he stated.

He described the submission of their resignation by the BJP to the Speaker as an “utter shock” and “most unusual act and conduct”, as none of them were present themselves to tender their resignation. He alleged that this demonstrated the BJP’s complicity in the “entire conspiracy and illegal actions”.

Analysis | Jyotiraditya Scindia revolt a likely turning point in tussle within Congress

Mr. Nath said it raised questions of constitutional propriety, legislative procedure and transparency. He contended the submission dehors constitutional and legislative provisions in force relating to the submission and acceptance of resignations of MLAs.

He elaborated the incident on Thursday when Cabinet Ministers Jitu Patwari and Lakhan Singh Yadav, along with rebel MLA Manoj Choudhary’s father, had gone to meet him in Bengaluru, “wherein all three of them have been manhandled by BJP goons as well as Karnataka State Police and illegally detained”.

This was sheer mockery of the rule of law, wherein BJP leaders had hatched a conspiracy of “abducting” the Congress MLAs to destabilise the duly constituted State government. There were various pictures and videos of the said incidents, he wrote.

13 MLAs call off plan

Meanwhile, 13 rebel MLAs, including the six on whom the Speaker had served notices, called off the plan to fly from Bengaluru to Bhopal at the 11th hour.

Although BJP vice president Shivraj Singh Chouhan has maintained that the crisis was Congress government’s internal matter, and distanced the BJP from it, as per flight tickets for two chartered planes perused by The Hindu, of the 19 passengers listed, at least three were from the BJP. These are former Minister Umashankar Gupta, MP Ramakant Bhargava and State party vice president Arvind Singh Bhadoria. The remaining three passengers couldn't be identified.

Furthermore, at the Bhopal airport, two buses carrying BJP leaders, including State party vice president Vijesh Lunawat, were parked outside the terminal. When asked if they had reached to receive Congress MLAs, a BJP leader denied it: “No, we’re here to receive some workers who were returning from a pilgrimage.” The moment the travel plan was cancelled around 5.30 p.m., the buses were the first to leave.

State president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, BJP’s youth wing, Abhilash Pandey was also present at the spot, along with tens of youth workers. When Congressmen arrived at the airport, both the sides raised slogans against each other, prompting the police to clear the area. Bhopal Deputy Inspector General of Police Irshad Wali announced on a microphone Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) had been imposed.

Strikingly, the State police deployed a team of bodybuilder policemen who waited inside SUVs at the terminal. On Thursday, the Congress released videos wherein Karnataka policemen were seen manhandling Mr. Patwari and Mr. Yadav, as they struggled to enter the resort, and later being detained.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/xp7ajw/article31058798.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KAMAL-NATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kamal-nath-requests-madhya-pradesh-governor-to-hold-floor-test-in-upcoming-assembly-session/article31058799.ece

A special court on Friday sentenced expelled Uttar Pradesh BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and six others to 10 years imprisonment in two cases linked to the death of the Unnao rape victim’s father in 2018.

Sengar and his brother, Jaideep alias Atul Singh, have also been directed to pay Rs.10 lakh each as compensation to the family of the deceased. Among those convicted are the then Makhi Police Station in-charge Ashok Singh Bhadauria and then Sub-Inspector K. P. Singh.

In its order, the court asked the State government to take appropriate disciplinary action against the doctors whose gross medical negligence led to the death of the girl's father.

On March 4, Sengar was held guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The other offences invoked were under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 166 (public servant disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any person), 167 (public servant framing incorrect document to cause injury), 193 (punishment for false evidence), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 211 (false charge of offence made with intent to injure), 218 (public servant framing incorrect record to save person from punishment), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of the IPC.

The CBI had registered the two cases on the request of the State government. One was related to the death of the victim’s father on April 9, 2018, while the other was for possession of illegal arms.

As alleged, the girl’s father was assaulted following an altercation with some of the accused on April 3, 2018. He was taken to the area police station and charges framed for allegedly possessing an illegal firearm and sent to judicial custody, during which he died.

Haryana’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) department on Thursday conducted raids in Maharashtra and several parts of Haryana to recover spurious hand-sanitisers from the market, a day after the department seized a cache of adulterated sanitisers from a manufacturing unit in Manesar town of Gurugram district in Haryana.

Acting on a tip-off, the department had conducted a raid on March 11 at an industrial unit operating under the name of Hi-Tech International, which allegedly did not have any licence as required under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. After finding that spurious hand-sanitisers were being made and supplied to shops, the department conducted subsequent raids for recovery of the product from the market on Thursday.

“Today, we conducted subsequent raids at few places in Maharashtra and in Haryana in a bid to recover the stock of spurious hand-sanitisers that had been supplied by this firm,” Ashok Meena, Commissioner, FDA, Haryana told The Hindu.

The team had recovered and seized around 4,000 bottles (300 ml and 500 ml) under the brand Viro-rub. Several empty bottles, labels and sealing material were also seized.

“During the raid it was found that the firm was manufacturing the hand-sanitiser, which is covered under the definition of ‘drug’ as provided under Section 3 (b) of the Drugs and Cosmetic Act. It requires prior permission to manufacture and also needs a drugs licence. The firm did not have any licence,” said Mr. Meena.

In view of the coronavirus pandemic, the department is keeping a tab across the State regarding black marketing, profiteering, hoarding of drugs and other products and conducting raids accordingly.

“Prima facie the firm was manufacturing the spurious hand-sanitiser to take advantage of the present market situation, in which the demand for hand-sanitisers has increased,” Mr. Meena said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/haryana-govt-conducts-raids-for-spurious-hand-sanitisers/article31054225.ece
227,2020/03/13,Anti-CAA protest continues in Deoband despite rain and COVID-19 scare,"Administration putting pressure on male members of protesters to weaken agitation, they say

Heavy rains on Wednesday night didn’t dampen the spirit of women protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens in Deoband.

The protest has been on at the Idgah ground of the town in Saharanpur district for the last 46 days. “This is the sixth time when we have faced the downpour in the last 46 days. It has become part of the routine now. Around 2,000 to 3,000 women were on the ground last night. We have female volunteers and male supporters who help us out. Yesterday, somebody brought the tractor motor to take out the water,” said Iram Usmani, one of the faces of the protest.

Amna Roshi, Murtahida Khawatin Committee (Women’s Unity Committee) president, said besides the ill-effects of the CAA she was also making the protesters aware of the dangers of COVID 19. “Though every Muslim is expected to perform ablution five times a day we are insisting on women to be extra careful with children,” she said.

Ms. Roshi said the administration was applying pressure on the male members of the protesters to weaken the agitation. “My brother, who is a journalist with a reputed Hindi daily, has been booked along with two other journalists. The administration very well knows that we don’t allow any male members to take the stage at the protest site. Hum apni marzi se aaye hain aur apni marzi se jayenge. [We have come out of our own accord and will go back on our will],” she said.

A post-graduate, Ms. Roshi said those who were leading the protest were educated women and see spreading information about the ill-effects of the CAA and the NRC as their responsibility. “Otherwise, future generations will question us. Many of those sitting here don’t even have ration cards,” she said.

On the protests against the CAA being held responsible for Delhi riots by the leaders of the BJP, Ms. Roshi said their protest was through Gandhian means. “Our Facebook page is called Satyagraha and we have put a charkha at the protest site.”

Irked by a section of the media, she said every fatwa from Deoband makes national news but a 46-day protest has yet to make national news.

Ms. Usmani appealed to the Prime Minister to look at the plight of his sisters. “There has been no clear response from the government on CAA-NRC. The RSS says it sees 130 crore Indians as Hindu society. Our forefathers chose this country because it believed in unity in diversity.”

She alleged meat shops are being shut, e-rickshaws are being challaned and people are being asked to show maps of their houses to put pressure on protesters. “The administration is coming up with newer ways to disrupt the project. They would say it is part of the process but we have never seen the process being followed so keenly before,” said Ms. Usmani.

So far 40 people have been booked for violation of prohibitory orders under various Sections including 270, 280 and 290 of IPC and Section 83 of the Juvenile Justice Act 2015.

Ms. Roshi denied using children for protest deliberately. “These are children of poor women who go with them when going to earn a living as well. One or two could have picked a placard while playing. After all, it is about their future,” she said.

Senior SP Dinesh Kumar P said the journalists had been booked for violation of Section 144. “They are spreading rumours and inciting women under the cover of their profession. We are not targeting any community. During Holi, licences were checked by the Nagar Nigam and those who could not show them were challaned. Every action should not be linked with the ongoing protest.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/anti-caa-protest-continues-in-deoband-despite-rain-and-covid-19-scare/article31053460.ece

The State has overshot its target of planting 50 crore trees in the State, a response to a question in the Legislative Council on Thursday showed. Forest Minister Sanjay Rathod had recently ordered an investigation probe into the erstwhile Bharatiya Janata Party government’s claim of planting nearly 50 crore trees in the State, but figures presented by his own department show the target has been met and the trees have mostly survived.

According to data presented in the Council, of the 28.34 crore trees the Forest Department planted, 81.63% have survived. The Maha Vikas Aghadi government has now pledged to plant 10 crore trees every year.

Following complaints about the previous BJP-led government’s tree plantation drive in the State, including a complaint by OBC Welfare Minister Vijay Wadettiwar, Forest Minister Sanjay Rathod had directed the principal secretary (forests) to conduct an investigation through a satellite survey. The chief conservator of forests (Nagpur) will be submitting its report in the matter. Former forest minister and senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar had welcomed the investigation but said the State should bring out a white paper on the matter.

In the Council on Thursday, Husnabanu Khalife demanded to know the status of the planted trees and the investigation into the drive with claims of 3 crore trees planted in the first year, 13 crore in second year and 33 crore in third year.

In response to her query, the Forest Minister informed the House that between the monsoon of 2017 and 2019, the Forest Department had a target of planting 28.50 crore trees, of which it was able to plant 28.34 crore trees. Of the trees planted, 23.44 crore or 81.63% survived. A similar target was given to local bodies such as gram panchayats. They were supposed to plant 21.5 crore trees but instead planted 23.76 crore trees. The survival rate of trees planted by local bodies was not available.

Thus, of the target of 50 crore trees, the State had planted 52.1 crore trees.

“The Forest Department’s website has detailed information on this. Wherever there is a specific complaint, scrutiny will be done on a case-by-case basis and action will be taken if irregularity is found,” said the minister.

All the 13 crew members on the ship, Mamatamoyee Maa, were rescued. One person sustained injuries in the mishap. The ship was returning home with fly ash from Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation thermal power plant.

Following the damage, the Bangladeshi ship’s sailors brought it close to a jetty at Maheshtala in Budge Budge and even tried to tie it to a tree to prevent it from going down. However, the tree got uprooted due to high tide and the ship sank.

A KoPT official said despite repeated warnings the Bangladeshi vessel intruded into the route designated for KoPT ships. The KoPT chairman has ordered an inquiry into the “intrusion”.

231,2020/03/13,COVID-19 triggers fear of mass return of Odia migrant workers,"Global health crisis taking a toll on industrial units in Surat, Mumbai

Panic due to rising COVID-19 cases and its negative impact on economy and industrial sector is expected to lead to mass return of Odia migrant labourers from Gujarat and Maharashtra to their homes in Ganjam district in the next few weeks.

Social activists, involved with migrant labourers from Ganjam working in Surat and Mumbai, feel if the panic over COVID-19 continues, it will lead to mass return of workers from both these places. Around five lakh migrant Odia workers are employed in textile industries in Surat. In Mumbai, a large number of Odia migrant workers serve in various small manufacturing units.

“Although no cases of COVID-19 infection have been reported from Surat, its threat has started to take a toll on the production process of textile manufacturing units,” said Lokanath Mishra, who is involved in ‘link workers scheme’, a project related to migrant workers of Ganjam district.

According to Mr. Mishra, as a repercussion of international situation due to COVID-19 threat, export of cotton fabric produced in Surat has stopped. Added to it, import of raw materials has also been discontinued. Textile industries in Surat have started reducing their production. If this situation continues, several textile production units in Surat may close down, which will directly affect the Odia migrant workers employed in them, said Mr. Mishra. The gemstone industry in Gujarat has suffered the biggest blow due to COVID-19, but only a small number of Odia workers serve this sector, he added.

In Surat, the economic slowdown due to COVID-19 threat has already started to affect employment scope of migrant Odia workers. “According to the information from the workers in Surat, it is impossible to get a new job in any textile manufacturing unit. Every month, several migrant workers leave their old job and search for employment in other textile units. Those who have left their jobs in the past few weeks are unable to find a new one,” said Pramod Jena, supervisor of ‘link workers scheme’ in Beguniapada block of Ganjam district.

Impact of the economic slump on migrant workers in small production units in Mumbai has been low, said Soudamini Rath, secretary of ARUNA, another organisation working for migrant workers of Ganjam district. She, however, said if cases of COVID-19 increase in Mumbai, it will lead to return of these workers.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/covid-19-triggers-fear-of-mass-return-of-odia-migrant-workers/article31054375.ece
232,2020/03/13,Maharashtra Budget session to end on March 20,"14 coronavirus cases confirmed in State; former CM seeks help for those stranded in Italy

The rising number of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the State, and the situation emerging from it has led to the ongoing Budget session of the Assembly being curtailed by a week.

With both Houses approving the proposal for curtailment, the session, which was to go on till March 20, will now end on Saturday.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab tabled the proposal to adjourn the session on Saturday, after approval to the budgetary grants and demands raised by government departments. “Because of the session, the official machinery is in Mumbai. It is imperative that all go back to their respective areas to lend a helping hand in the measures to contain the spread of the virus,” said Assembly speaker Nana Patole.

Meanwhile, Health Minister Rajesh Tope confirmed 12 positive cases in Maharashtra, of whom nine are in Pune while Mumbai and Nagpur have two and one cases respectively.

Mr. Tope said none of the patients were critical, but showing only mild symptoms. He also appealed to the people to not wear masks as their disposal would create further problems.

Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray held a video conference with all district collectors, civic commissioners, zilla parishad CEOs, and district civil surgeons. Directions have been issued to keep all travellers from China, Iran, Italy, South Korea, France, Spain and Germany to remain in isolation for 15 days after arrival. “District collectors have been asked to set up quarantine facilities for travellers from seven countries. A separate control room will have to be set up as also an isolation ward at every hospital,” said Principal Secretary, Health, Dr. Pradeep Vyas.

‘SOS from Italy’

Meanwhile, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan on Thursday claimed that 102 Indians were stranded in Italy.

Mr. Chavan said they have sent an SOS for evacuation to the Indian government, and asked Mr. Thackeray to come up with an evacuation plan in consultation with the Union government.

“Two of those stranded are from Mumbai, and 44 are from Kolhapur and Sangli districts,” Mr. Chavan said in Assembly. He also sought that Maharashtra set up a dedicated coordination cell to help those who are stuck in a virus-hit foreign country get in touch with government authorities.

Atul Bhatkalkar (BJP) supported Mr. Chavan’s demand for such a cell. He claimed that four people from his Kandivali (East) constituency were also stranded.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/lar9j3/article31054355.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMNAGPURCOLLEGESTAFF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-budget-session-to-end-on-march-20/article31054356.ece

234,2020/03/13,Raids to recover fake sanitisers,"Product was being made at a unit in Manesar, Haryana

Haryana’s Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) Department on Thursday conducted raids in Maharashtra and several parts of Haryana to recover “spurious” stock of hand sanitisers from the market, a day after the department seized a cache of adulterated hand sanitisers from a manufacturing unit in Manesar town of Gurugram district.

‘No licence’

Acting on a tip-off, the department had conducted a raid on March 11 at an industrial unit operating under the name of Hi-Tech International in Manesar, which allegedly did not have any licence required under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.

After finding that spurious hand sanitisers were being prepared and supplied, the department conducted more raids for recovery of the adulterated product from the market on Thursday.

“Today, we conducted subsequent raids at a few places in Maharashtra and Haryana in a bid to recover the stock of spurious hand sanitisers that had been supplied by the firm. The product under the brand of Viro-rub has a label stating that the product contains ethanol but actually it contains Isopropyl alcohol, and we don’t want to take any risk,” Ashok Meena, Commissioner, FDA Haryana, told The Hindu.

The team, which constituted officers Ripan Mehta, Amandeep Chauhan and Dinesh Rana, had on Wednesday recovered around 4,000 bottles of the sanitiser. Several empty bottles, labels and sealing material were also seized.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/raids-to-recover-fake-sanitisers/article31054308.ece
235,2020/03/13,"Comply with HC order, affected tell U.P. govt.","Court had ordered immediate removal of ‘name and shame’ hoardings in Lucknow

Those featuring on the ‘name and shame’ hoardings in Lucknow on Thursday hoped that the administration would comply with the Allahabad High Court direction and remove the controversial hoardings soon after the Supreme Court did not stay the High Court order.

While terming it an “unwarranted interference in privacy” of people and a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution, the High Court on Monday had directed the Lucknow administration to “forthwith” remove the controversial ‘name and shame’ roadside hoardings of those arrested during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act last December. The court also asked the Lucknow District Magistrate to submit a compliance report by March 16.

However, the government challenged the order in the apex court and is yet to remove the hoardings.

“The government should not make it a matter of ego. We are not absconders. I appeal the government to honour the HC order,” said theatre personality Deepak Kabir.

He, however, added that he was not too optimistic that the government would comply with the High Court order, which came after a Division Bench heard the matter suo motu.

He is among the 57 persons whose names, photographs and residential addresses have been highlighted on hoardings put up by the administration at prominent intersections in Lucknow.

‘Families at risk’

Those on the hoardings have said exposure of their personal details in the public domain puts them and their families at risk.

236,2020/03/13,"PDP leader quits politics over special status, bifurcation","Abdul Wani was released on Feb. 6 after six months in jail

Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader Abdul Qayoom Wani, who contested the Lok Sabha election last year, on Thursday announced that he is quitting politics as a mark of protest against the Centre’s decision to revoke Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and divide it into two Union Territories.

“The Centre’s decision was unconstitutional and undemocratic. I had not joined politics to occupy a seat of power or earn money. I contested the Lok Sabha elections so that I can, in a very democratic way, express the aspirations of the people of J&K in Parliament and further strengthen J&K’s special status and seek a final solution of the Kashmir issue, which is also a humanitarian issue,” said Mr. Wani in a statement issued in Srinagar. He has spent six months in jail in his one-year-long political career.

Mr. Wani’s statement, coming after he was released on February 6, is possibly the first instance of a political leader taking a public position post-detention on the Centre’s August 5, 2019 decision on J&K’s special status. Sources said all leaders who signed release bonds have been barred from issuing any statement on Article 370 and 35A for a period of one year.

A former government employees’ union president who resigned from his job to contest the parliamentary poll from Baramulla in north Kashmir last year, Mr. Wani said he expected that a strong government at the Centre would allow the beginning of a process of engagement with all parties holding different views on Kashmir.

‘Democracy murdered’

“Instead, the Centre decided to hurt the sentiments of the people of J&K and strangulated democracy. I will always raise my voice against the decision at every platform,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2gp787/article31054284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12-WANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pdp-leader-quits-politics-over-special-status-bifurcation/article31054285.ece

Contrary to earlier reports that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be fielding senior State leaders like Eknath Khadse for the third Rajya Sabha seat from Maharashtra, the party chose Dr. Bhagavant Karad as its candidate along with Union Minister of State for Social Justice Ramdas Athawale and former Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Udayanraje Bhosale.

Congress has fielded former Lok Sabha MP and young OBC leader from Maharashtra Rajeev Satav while Shiv Sena is likely to announce the name of party spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) too has refrained from announcing its second candidate and will be declaring the name on March 13, last day of filing nomination.

Both Mr. Athawale and Mr. Bhosale filed their nomination papers on Thursday. Of the three BJP candidates, Mr. Karad is the only original BJP leader. Mr. Bhosale had contested the Lok Sabha bypolls last year after resigning from NCP but he lost to Shrinivas Patil. In a bid to rehabilitate him politically, the party had to deny a ticket to two sitting MPs, Amar Sable and Sanjay Kakde.

The decision to field Mr. Satav is seen as an attempt by Congress to promote the young OBC leader from Maharashtra who is also in-charge of Gujarat.

Election for the seven Rajya Sabha seats will be held on March 26. Those whose term ends on April 2 include Mr. Pawar, Mr. Athawale, Hussain Dalwai (Congress), Rajkumar Dhoot (Shiv Sena), Amar Sable (BJP), Majeed Memon (NCP), and Sanjay Kakade (BJP-backed Independent).

238,2020/03/13,"Deoband anti-CAA protest on despite rain, COVID-19 scare","‘We have come out of our own accord and will go back at our own will’

Heavy rain on Wednesday night did not dampen the spirit of women protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens in Deoband. The protest is on at the Idgah ground of the town in Saharanpur district for the last 46 days.

“This is the sixth time that we have faced a downpour in the last 46 days. It has become part of the routine now. Around 2,000 to 3,000 women were on the ground last night. We have female volunteers and male supporters who help us out. Yesterday, somebody brought a tractor motor to take out the water,” said Iram Usmani, one of the faces of the protest.

Amna Roshi, president of the Murtahida Khawatin Committee (Women’s Unity Committee), said besides the ill-effects of the CAA she was also making the protesters aware of the dangers of COVID-19. “Though every Muslim is expected to perform ablution five times a day, we are still insisting that women be extra careful with children,” she said.

Ms. Roshi said the administration was applying pressure on the male members of the protesters to weaken the agitation. “My brother, who is a journalist with a reputed Hindi daily, has been booked along with two other journalists. The administration very well knows that we don’t allow any male members to take the stage at the protest site. Hum apni marzi se aaye hain aur apni marzi se jayenge (We have come out of our own accord and will go back at our own will),” said Ms. Roshi.

A post-graduate, Ms Roshi said those who were leading the protest were educated women and see spreading information about the ill-effects of the CAA and the NRC as their responsibility. “Otherwise, the future generations will question us. Many of those sitting here don’t even have ration cards,” she said.

On the protests against CAA being held responsible for the Delhi riots by the BJP leaders, Ms Roshi said their protest was through Gandhian means. “Our Facebook page is called Satyagraha and we have put a charkha at the protest site.”

Irked by a section of the media, she said every fatwa from Deoband makes national news but a 46-day protest is yet to make national news.

Appeal to PM

Ms. Usmani appealed to the Prime Minister to look at the plight of his sisters. “There has been no clear response from the government on CAA-NRC. Meanwhile, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh says that it sees 130 crores Indians as Hindu society. Our forefathers chose this country because it believed in unity in diversity.”

She alleged that meat shops were being shut, e-rickshaws were being challaned and people were being asked to show maps of their houses to put pressure on the protesters.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/84lrpl/article31054271.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12-PROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/deoband-anti-caa-protest-on-despite-rain-covid-19-scare/article31054273.ece
239,2020/03/13,Ditching Shiv Sena was a mistake: BJP's Mungantiwar,"Former finance minister creates a flutter in Maharashtra Assembly

Former State finance minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sudhir Munganitwar created a flutter in the Assembly on Thursday by accepting that his party had “fooled” Shiv Sena in the power game after the 2019 Assembly elections.

Participating in the discussion on the State’s budget 2020-21, Mr. Mungantiwar said, “Our government played the politics of development but this government’s politics is of stalling projects.”

Looking towards the treasury benches, Mr. Mungantiwar said the “chief minister is your friend for three months, but our relation dates back 30 years,” highlighting the long- standing BJP-Sena ties. To this, some members from the treasury benches commented “still you ditched them”.

“Yes, we ditched the Shiv Sena, but don’t try to take advantage of our mistake. One day we will rectify it,” said Mr. Mungantiwar.

The former minister’s statement comes after he said that both the BJP and the Sena were in alliance for 30 years and this Maha Vikas Aghadi tripartite alliance has not even completed 30 months.

Referring to the ongoing crisis in Madhya Pradesh after former Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia switched over to the BJP, Mr. Mungantiwar added that may be tomorrow there will be a Scindia here as well. “Tomorrow, one Jyotiraditya from you will join us and we will have our government back. That time we will have our government of development and not of stalling projects,” he said.

Mr. Mungantiwar said the Shiv Sena had made a “mistake” which will be rectified one day.

‘MVA will fall’

He said that the present Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has completed 100 days now. “The government will fall after it commits 100 crimes,” he said.

The Shiv Sena however chose not to comment on the statement. When asked, Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray said that the Sena will only continue to work as it has been doing and refused to comment further.

The statement from Mr. Mungantiwar comes at a time when BJP, especially former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, is refusing that there was any understanding on the CM’s post before Assembly polls. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray while quitting the alliance with the BJP had said that the BJP did not keep its word of sharing the CM post for two-and-a-half years.

Mr. Fadnavis was not present in the House during Mr. Mungantiwar’s speech.

Drivers for MLAs

The House also amended the Maharashtra Legislature Members’ Salaries and Allowances Act to allow lawmakers to employ a driver at government expenses. As per the amended Act, every member shall be entitled to the service free of charge.

Mr. Mungantiwar had made the demand during the budget session. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab, who introduced the Bill to amend the Act, said the existing law does not provide the facility to MLAs.

Members will be entitled to appoint any person below the age of 60 at a fixed salary of ₹ 15,000.

240,2020/03/13,Kamal Nath government will survive BJP machinations: Bhupesh Baghel,"MLAs feel betrayed by Jyotiraditya Scindia’s move, says Chhattisgarh Chief Minister.

The Congress government in Madhya Pradesh will “certainly survive the machinations of the BJP,” the party’s Chief Minister in neighbouring Chhattisgarh Bhupesh Baghel said on Thursday.

The defection of senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia from the Congress to the BJP, accompanied by the announcement of at least 20 Congress MLAs that they have resigned from the Assembly, has thrown the government of Chief Minister Kamal Nath into a tailspin, but Mr. Baghel, a key strategist of the party, exuded confidence, talking to The Hindu in New Delhi.

Also read | Jyotiraditya Scindia’s defection a shameless act, says Ashok Gehlot | Scindia revolt a likely turning point in tussle within Congress

“The feedback that we have is that the MLAs who supposedly left the Congress feel deceived. They were taken on the pretext of bargaining for a Rajya Sabha ticket, and they feel betrayed by Mr. Scindia’s move. They are now unwilling to leave the Congress. They do not want to ruin their politics by joining the BJP. We have the numbers, and I can assure you that the Kamal Nath government will remain in office once this crisis blows over,” he said.

Fiercely attacking the BJP and Mr. Scindia, Mr. Baghel said both were trapped with each other now. “I can assure you that nobody is leaving the Congress with Scindiaji,” he said, adding that the former Congress leader betrayed the party. “He was Union Minister, Deputy Leader of the party in the Lok Sabha, AICC general secretary. But what has he achieved for the party? He was in charge of Uttar Pradesh — how many times did he go there? The party has only given him all and taken nothing from him. He has only taken from the party, and not given anything to the party. As long as you were in power, the party was good for you. You lost in the elections, and many others also lost in the elections. Suddenly the party has become very bad for you. The only thing we can make of this is that Scindiaji cannot live without power… He could not survive one year without power,” he said, pointing out that Congress workers in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have remained outside government for 15 years, and in Uttar Pradesh, “our workers have been out of power for decades.”

Mr. Baghel recalled that Mr. Scindia’s father, late Madhavarao Scindia, had left the Congress but returned later. “Many big leaders have left the Congress but they have all come back.” Asked whether Mr. Scindia would return to the Congress in future, Mr. Baghel said: “You wait and watch. People have left the Congress with a lot of arrogance but returned chastened.”

The Chief Minister said the developments in Madhya Pradesh would have no impact in Chhattisgarh where his government enjoys a comfortable majority. “Even in Madhya Pradesh, his influence does not extend beyond Gwalior and Chambal. The BJP in Madhya Pradesh is in a fix with the joining of Mr. Scindia. Their main plank has been targeting Mr. Scindia in this region. Now that they have recruited him, what will they now say?” said Mr. Baghel.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pt55yf/article31053614.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13BHUPESHBAGHEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kamal-nath-government-will-survive-bjp-machinations-bhupesh-baghel/article31053615.ece

‘Chaos and confusion’ was how Vanitha Rengaraj, 60, founder of the Sharanalayam orphanage in Coimbatore, described the atmosphere on board the cruise ship A Sara, which has been moored on the banks of the Nile in Egypt after several passengers and crew contracted COVID-19.

Ms. Rengaraj and her husband R. Rengaraj, 62, were quarantined on the ship for nearly one week. “We planned to spend only three nights on the ship,” she told The Hindu as she recollected her experiences upon returning to Coimbatore on Thursday.

The couple were among 18 Indians who boarded the cruise ship as part of a trip to Egypt on March 3. The next day, officials on the ship announced that more than 30 passengers had contracted COVID-19, including one among the 18 Indians. The passenger, from Chennai, was taken to a hospital in Alexandria. The ship, which had over 100 passengers from various countries, was anchored 20 km away from the city of Luxor, she said.

The rest of the passengers were asked to not leave their rooms on the ship, she said. Ms. Rengaraj said she suffered from heart conditions and hypertension and did not have access to proper medication, and appropriate food was not available on the ship. She said she mostly ate fruits and had fruit juice. “I lost hope on the second day itself,” Ms. Rengaraj said. With all the 17 Indian passengers then testing negative for COVID-19, medical certificates were sent to the Indian Embassy in Egypt for approval.

Following an intervention from the Embassy, the 17 Indians were asked to leave the cruise ship on March 11. Ms. Rengaraj and her husband went to the airport in Luxor and reached Coimbatore on Thursday via Cairo, Mumbai and Hyderabad on four different flights. The Chennai passenger has reportedly tested negative in the Alexandria hospital and is expected to return soon, she said.

247,2020/03/13,Fire destroys an acre of reserve forest in Coonoor,"A forest fire in Ubathalai in Coonoor destroyed around an acre of reserve forest on Thursday. Fire and Rescue Services personnel and Forest Department staff battled the blaze for over five hours to put it out.

The fire spread rapidly in the reserve forest that was mainly populated with exotic eucalyptus trees. The first step taken by the personnel from both the departments was to check a further spread of the fire.

As the Fire and Rescue Services personnel were unable to take the fire tenders to a suitable location close to the fire, the Forest Department staff used counter fires to control the blaze.

Officials said they were unsure as to whether the fire was caused by people accidentally or whether herders had set fire to the forest to clear it for grass for their cattle. Forest Department officials said they had stepped up patrols in all the reserve forests bordering human habitations to ensure that fires were not set off by people. They warned of strict action against persons found to be causing forest fire.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tn0kx0/article31053487.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB13FIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/fire-destroys-an-acre-of-reserve-forest-in-coonoor/article31053488.ece
248,2020/03/13,Coronavirus | Efforts taken to sanitise tourist spots in the Nilgiris,"In order to ensure that the Nilgiris remained free of any cases of COVID-19 infections, the district administration, tourism and horticulture departments are working together to ensure that visitors to important tourist locations have access to hand sanitisers and clean water to wash their hands.

In important tourist areas such as the Government Botanical Garden, Ooty Boat House, Rose Garden and the Sims Park, visitors are being asked to use hand sanitisers kept at the entrance of these locations and to also wash their fingers before they enter. Staff at these locations have also been given face masks to prevent infections.

Officials from the horticulture department said that they had witnessed a steep drop in the number of tourists visiting the garden over the last couple of weeks, but added that they were unsure whether the reduction in the number of tourists was due to news about increasing COVID-19 infections across the world, or due to reports of avian flu in Kerala or other factors. On Thursday, the Government Botanical Garden, one of the most popular tourist locations in the Nilgiris wore a deserted look with less than a few thousand visitors till late afternoon visiting the garden.

Nilgiris District Collector, J. Innocent Divya, also conducted special awareness campaigns at important tourist locations such as the Ooty town bus stand, where the entire area was sprayed with disinfectant. Officials also distributed pamphlets in Tamil, English and Malayalam about how people can take precautions to remain free of being infected by the COVID-19 virus.

Ms. Divya, who spoke to reporters at the event, said that there had been no cases of COVID-19 infections in the Nilgiris, and also dispelled rumours in social media about the district’s borders being closed to tourists.

She said that there were no restrictions on the entry of tourists into the Nilgiris, and also briefed the public about the efforts the district administration and the health department were taking to screen people visiting the Nilgiris and check if they were exhibiting any symptoms.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/am20vh/article31056962.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/efforts-taken-to-sanitise-tourist-spots-in-the-nilgiris/article31053476.ece
249,2020/03/13,Waste segregation at source a non-starter in Krishnagiri,"Garbage collection erratic; battery-operated vehicles nowhere to be seen

Long after garbage segregation at source has become a norm in most municipalities, Krishnagiri Municipality still grapples with source segregation.

A significant number of areas is still not aware of garbage segregation, with their preoccupation being garbage disposal. In many wards, garbage collection itself is erratic. With push carts coming to collect garbage from the households on alternate days, source segregation for the households is of little concern, say residents of Basheer Mohammad Layout, Gandhi Nagar, that falls in Ward 32.

On Thursday, Domestic Breeding Checkers of the municipality were deployed to some of the areas in Ward 32 to chip in as garbage was being thrown into the push cart. Basheer Mohammad Layout is one of many areas that sees garbage collection every alternate day. This is the refrain in many parts of the town, where residents have claimed that there are forced to dump garbage on the streets because of irregular collection.

Though garbage collection and source segregation have been streamlined in large parts of the municipality according to municipal sources, the reality on the streets speaks otherwise. The municipality has put the blame on the public resistance, while the residents await for days together for the pushcart to come and collect garbage.

Under the Swatcch Bharat Mission, and funded by the Solid Waste Management funds, Krishnagiri Municipality was given six battery- operated vehicles for garbage collection. Staff accompanying the vehicles should monitor whether segregated waste is dumped in the bins for biodegradable and non-degradable waste.

However, the battery-operated vehicles were converted into ordinary garbage carts from the day one. Soon enough, even those vehicles vanished from the streets and were replaced by the push carts. Conservancy workers, who use push carts, said the battery- operated vehicles were flawed by design and were put away.

In Dharmapuri, separate staff “animators” are assigned to each vehicle to monitor that only segregated waste gets dumped in the bins. However, in Krishnagiri, the battery-operated vehicles are hardly used, and only eight animators are assigned for 33 wards, with each responsible for four wards.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/klk5kz/article31053466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA13GARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/waste-segregation-at-source-a-non-starter-in-krishnagiri/article31053467.ece
250,2020/03/13,Preventive steps for COVID-19 under way at railway station,"‘Adequate quantity of liquid soap ensured in all coaches’

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Coimbatore Railway Station has initiated preventive steps, including periodic disinfection and awareness campaigns on its premises.

An official from Salem Division of Southern Railway told The Hindu that objects that are touched by multiple passengers such as handrails, door handles, arm rests of chairs and water taps in the railway station are regularly disinfected by conservancy workers. “These are disinfected twice per shift or six times in a day,” the official said. Coimbatore Railway Station currently employs nearly 550 conservancy staff, out of which 150 are contract workers.

Some of the general instructions provided for the railway station staff are usage of face masks (although not compulsorily), checking for COVID-19 symptoms for any staff who returned to work after long leave, restricting activities such as handshakes and usage of objects such as landline phones by more than one person and avoiding any mass gatherings of their own.

Train coaches are also regularly cleaned during maintenance at the station. Objects that come in contact with multiple passengers such as doors, windows, snack tables, berths, chains and sanitary fittings are disinfected. Adequate quantity of liquid soap is ensured in all the coaches, the official noted.

With the railway station experiencing an average footfall of 29,000 people per day, awareness campaigns such as posters, banners and leaflets along with announcements and video clips on instructions regarding COVID-19 are made available at the station.

252,2020/03/13,FASTag: businessman struggles to get refund of money deducted in excess,"A businessman here is running from pillar to post to get refund of excess money deducted from his FASTag account after he was charged six times at IVRCL Chengapalli Toll Plaza and twice at Vijayamangalam Toll Plaza.

T.N. Raju (55) of Thindal had travelled from Alleppey to Erode in his car on February 17 on the national highway and had made payments from his FASTag account that is linked to a nationalised bank.

As he received continuous SMS for the deductions, he verified his account statement and found that ₹95 was debited six times at Chengapalli Toll Plaza in Tiruppur district and ₹ 55 twice at Vijayamangalam Toll Plaza in Erode district.

All the transactions carried the same time as 22:21:31 (10.21 p.m.) and 23:06:25 (11.06 p.m.) for the two toll plazas respectively.

Payment

Mr. Raju said that he approached the officials at both the toll plazas and they said that they had received the payment only once for the passage of vehicle and asked him to contact the bank.

“Syndicate Bank officials said they have nothing to do with the excess deductions and asked me to contact the officials at the toll plazas,” he said.

As his efforts in getting the excess money of ₹ 680 deducted from the FASTag account did not yield result, he was directed to contact FASTag helpline number 1033.

“The customer executive again directed me to approach the bank,” he said and added that the authorities want to pass on the responsibility, and he was struggling for a mistake that he did not commit.

253,2020/03/13,Decline in poultry price affects small farmers,"Sharp decline in the price of broilers over the fear of coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has started affecting the small poultry farmers who fear that summer season will further affect their business.

On Thursday, the farm price of broiler was ₹ 28 a kg in Erode whereas the retail price was ₹ 80 to ₹ 100 a kg. While the wholesale price of egg was ₹ 3.23, it was sold at ₹ 3.50 to ₹ 4 in retail shops.

There are hundreds of small farmers in the district who rear less than 10,000 birds and sell them mostly to retail shops and in local markets. “Last month, the farm price of chicken was over ₹95 a kg, but now, it is less than ₹ 30 a kg,” said Moorthy of Chellapampalayam.

He said that the price of feeds had doubled in the past two years where as the farm rate had dropped drastically. “Price of maize and soybean are on the rise. Selling broiler for ₹ 30 a kg is a huge loss,” he added.

Many owners of poultry farms expressed fear that the virus scare would have a big impact on the sector for another one or two months and summer season would further affect the sector. “We obtain loan from banks and run the units. But we incur loss of over ₹ 30 to ₹ 40 per kg now,” said a poultry owner. The farm owners said that they were unable to bear the loss due to increase in cost of production and drop in demand and feared that many units would get closed in the coming days.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ikovu/article31053428.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA13CHICKEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/decline-in-poultry-price-affects-small-farmers/article31053429.ece
254,2020/03/13,‘Early diagnosis of glaucoma could prevent blindness’,"As glaucoma is a silent eye disease that affects the visual nerves resulting in blindness, early detection and treatment could prevent loss of vision, said doctors here on Thursday.

As part of World Glaucoma Week observance from March 8 to 14, Erode District Blindness Control Society and Erode Idhayam Narpani Iyakkam Trust organised an awareness rally that was flagged off by Collector C. Kathiravan at the Collectorate.

This year’s theme is “B-I-G” - Beat Invisible Glaucoma and college students held placards with the message ‘early diagnosis could reduce the progression of the disease and prevent blindness’. The rally passed through Perundurai Road before culminating at the Kalingarayan Illam.

Doctors said that people should be aware that glaucoma had no warning symptoms until it reached an advanced stage.

People with red eye blurred vision, severe eye and head ache, change in dimension of vision, tubular vision and sudden loss of sight should immediately approach the government hospitals.

They said that people above 40 years, persons with diabetes and hypertension and with a family history of glaucoma should screen their eyes for early detection of blindness. “Glaucoma accounts for over 8% of blindness in the country and screening is essential,” the doctors added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/nmwnys/article31053424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA13RALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/early-diagnosis-of-glaucoma-could-prevent-blindness/article31053425.ece
255,2020/03/13,Coronavirus | COVID-19 poses new challenges to Coimbatore exporters,"It is a wait and watch situation for exporters in all sectors, says an industry representative

An exporter in Coimbatore has the goods ready for shipment, the containers are also available for stuffing the goods, but main vessels do not have adequate space or are not available as frequently as they used to be.

This is one of the new challenges that the exporting hub of Coimbatore is facing because of the spread of COVID-19 across countries.

Initially, when China was impacted with COVID-19, exporters across sectors here were hopeful of orders shifting to India from China. Then came concerns of supply chain disruptions as a lot of industries buy raw materials or key components from China. Now, however, the exporters worry about possible shutdowns at buying markets and the problems related to logistics.

P. Subramaniam, president of Coimbatore Custom House and Steamer Agents Association, says that almost all the main vessels coming to Colombo or Kochi and proceeding to the US or EU originate in China. With shutdown in China for almost two months, the number of vessels starting from that country has reduced and the space available for cargo to be taken from other countries is also not much. Giving instances, he says, “Vessels are not available for loading even later this month and there are cases of cargo that was to be loaded on February 23 was sent only on March 8.” It may take a month or two for the situation to stabilise, he adds.

On the import front, the Government has issued orders that ports and Inland Container Depots clear imported goods immediately so that manufacturing industries that buy goods from other countries for production are not affected.

“Usually cargo sent from India reaches the US in a month. Now, it takes nearly three months,” adds S. Mahesh Kumar, president of the Coir Pith Exporters' Association.

Nearly 95 % of coir fibre exports from Pollachi in Coimbatore District is to China. The Chinese who used to reside in Pollachi and inspect the goods before shipment went home for Chinese New Year and have not returned. For almost two months, exports to China were almost nil. There are reports that China is re-opening except for a few locations and exporters here have stocks. So, the exports may revive soon. However, there are reports that containers are not available.

In the case of castings and engineering exports, sources in EEPC India (formerly known as Engineering Exports Promotion Council) say that there are two categories of exports from Coimbatore - products such as pumps and valves that are shipped to African and Latin American countries and components, castings, forgings, and machine tools that are exported to the EU or the US. Exports to African or Latin American countries are not affected, exports to other countries are also going on now. But, there is a fear that these may be impacted if the situation does not improve. Further, those who procure critical tools and parts from China could not import for the last two months and that has affected domestic sales too.

Further, travel restrictions are having a cascading effect. And, it is not just exports or imports to China and EU but also to countries such as Japan and South Korea.

G. Ezhil, chairman of the Coimbatore chapter of the Institute of Indian Foundrymen, says the foundries import a lot of raw materials from China. “That supply chain is getting affected. We have stocks now and so production is going on. European buyers have stopped coming to India and credit lines are becoming cash transactions. In many countries all offices are closed except for essential needs. If the situation does not improve, we will start feeling the impact,” he says.

As far as textile exports are concerned, A. Sakthivel, chairman of Apparel Export Promotion Council, says there are reports that Chinese ports have opened in the last three to four days and so imports are expected to resume shortly. So far, other countries have not cancelled or deferred major textile events and orders.

Raja Shanmugham, president of Tiruppur Exporters Association, adds that with travel advisories, buyers or their representatives are not travelling. “We continue to receive samples and the orders placed are shipped. But if the virus spread is not contained in the coming days and markets close retail shops as a precautionary measure, the exporters will start feeling the impact.”

One of the industry representatives said, “It is a wait and watch situation for exporters in all sectors and the developments unfold every day.”",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ndeouj/article31053421.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB13-MATTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/covid-19-poses-new-challenges-to-coimbatore-exporters/article31053422.ece

Chennai Super Kings’ practice sessions at the MAC Stadium stand suspended from March 14 due to the COVID-19 threat, it was announced on Friday.

With the IPL being suspended until April 15, the players who had gathered in the city from the first week of March, are likely to head back to their home base.

258,2020/03/13,Australia crushes New Zealand,"Kiwis restrict Aussie batsmen, but stumble against bowlers

Australia crushed New Zealand by 71 runs in the first One-Day International at an empty Sydney Cricket Ground on Friday.

After New Zealand had kept the home side to 258 for seven, the Australian bowling attack dismissed the visitors for 187.

Cricket Australia barred spectators from the match owing to the coronavirus pandemic, leading to the strange sight of players acknowledging milestones to empty grandstands.

It was also revealed that Australian fast bowler Kane Richardson was in quarantine early in the day and had been tested for the virus after feeling unwell. However, he was subsequently cleared and returned to the ground to rejoin his teammates.

Australia skipper Aaron Finch chose to bat, and the home side at one stage was looking at a score in excess of 300 following a superb opening partnership by Finch and David Warner.

But once Warner (67) and Finch (60) were dismissed, the Australian innings lost momentum and New Zealand clawed its way back into the game, despite a late flourish from Marnus Labuschagne, who made 56 off 52 balls.

New Zealand may have seen it as a good chance to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, but some superb Australian bowling in the first 10 overs meant the visitors were always behind in the chase.

None of the New Zealand batsmen was able to dominate — Martin Guptill top-scored with 40 — and wickets fell at regular intervals as Australia took control.

The victory will come as a welcome boost to the Australians, who had lost their last five ODIs in series losses to South Africa and India.

Test spearhead Pat Cummins was the pick of the bowlers with three for 25, while all-rounder Mitchell Marsh claimed three for 29. Adam Zampa and Josh Hazlewood picked up two wickets each in an impressive team display.

Earlier, New Zealand spinners Mitchell Santner and Ish Sodhi reined Australia in after Finch and Warner’s bright start.

Warner brought up a chanceless half-century but soon began to struggle when New Zealand’s fastest bowler, Lockie Ferguson, came round the wicket and he eventually fell when he was beaten by pace and sliced a Ferguson thunderbolt to mid-on.

Santner struck next when Finch got a faint edge to ’keeper Tom Latham to leave Australia at 145 for two. He then rocked the home side when he bowled Steve Smith (14) for the addition of only one run.

Leg-spinner Sodhi was expensive early but he adjusted his length and claimed the next three wickets to give New Zealand hope of chasing down the total under the SCG lights.

The second match will be on Sunday, also at the SCG.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/australia-crushes-new-zealand/article31063045.ece
259,2020/03/13,I wanted to do it for the team: Unadkat,"The team has come a long way playing lots of finals, says the skipper

Saurashtra skipper Jaydev Unadkat on Friday said the self-belief gained from the tough semifinal win over Gujarat helped his side turn the tide in its favour on the last day of the Ranji Troply final.

Unadkat said Saurashtra, which had some players who were sick, was keen to win its maiden title. “Though the energy levels were down, I think the way we won the semifinal gave us belief.

“We still had a lot of hope and that is why we went through,” said an emotionally-charged Unadkat.

Top achievement

For Unadkat, winning the Ranji Trophy was the top achievement. “It has never gotten bigger than this. Not just my achievement, it’s my State’s achievement.

“We have had a glorious cricketing legacy to carry as well. The team has come a long way, playing lots of finals.”

The left-arm pacer, who topped the bowling chart with 67 wickets, said his hunger was stronger than ever. “I have been working harder than many guys. It was not just the IPL on my mind at any time.

“I wanted to do it for the team. I wanted to prove to myself that I don’t want to play the game for something other than cricket.”

India Test batsman Pujara, who battled health issues while putting up a crucial century partnership with Arpit Vasavada, said it was a tough innings. “I’m someone who likes to lead from the front, but here I had to bat lower down the order.

Frustrating

“It was frustrating. On day two when I walked in, it was not easy. I felt a blackout, so it was tough. But you have to be motivated and set a good example.

“This was probably one of my slowest innings in the domestic circuit. It was a tough pitch. Needed to put my head down and play a crucial knock.”

On winning the championship, Pujara said, “When we came to finals last year, we had discussed that we had the potential to win. We decided to work hard for the trophy.”

Pujara said he expected Unadkat to return to the Indian side. “Jaydev was modest that he would not be thinking about the Indian call but I will be surprised if he is not picked in the Indian team,” said Pujara.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/o90vdt/article31062940.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14QUOTES,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/i-wanted-to-do-it-for-the-team-unadkat/article31062941.ece

After a washout of the seriesopener at Dharamshala on Thursday, the remaining two One-Day Internationals involving India and South Africa were cancelled as a precautionary measure against COVID-19 pandemic.

The BCCI took the decision to call oﬀ the matches at Lucknow (March 15) and Kolkata (March 18) on Friday evening, hours after the teams landed here by a chartered ﬂight from Dharamshala.

The statement, issued by BCCI secretary Jay Shah, read: “The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), along with Cricket South Africa (CSA), on Friday announced to reschedule the ongoing ODI series in view of the COVID-19 outbreak. Cricket South Africa will visit India at a later date to play three ODIs. The BCCI-CSA will jointly work out the revised schedule.”

Speculations surrounding the possibility of the BCCI calling oﬀ the ODI series were rife since Thursday afternoon following its announcement of holding the ODI at Lucknow without spectators. This was in keeping with the health advisory from the Union Government

What must have also prompted the BCCI to cancel the ODIs was Friday’s decision of the Uttar Pradesh Government to invoke the Epidemic Act, after 11 cases of Coronavirus were reported in the State. This meant, over 500 people, including players, match oﬃcials, security personnel, media persons and those representing various stakeholders, had to be quarantined before being allowed inside the stadium.

On its part, the Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association (UPCA) was contemplating issuing fresh accreditation card on match-day even to the commentators and media persons, holding BCCI’s central accreditation.

In the afternoon, unseasonal rain lashed the city and overcast weather gave rise to conversations around the possibility of a rain-curtailed match on Sunday, if not another washout like the one seen at Dharamshala.

At the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium here, Bengal, starting from 354 for six and needing 72 runs to overhaul the host’s ﬁrst innings aggregate of 425 runs, could not hold out against Unadkat’s intensity and fell short by 44 runs.

Unadkat took two wickets for 12 runs in seven overs and eﬀected a run out as Bengal could only manage 27 runs in 14 overs to total 381.

The match ended in a draw, with the home side posting 105 for four in its second essay and Saurashtra took the title in its fourth ﬁnal appearance in last eight seasons on the basis of gaining the ﬁrst innings lead. The ﬁrst 83 minutes of the morning belonged to Unadkat.

The lanky left-arm seamer exhibited exemplary leadership to inspire his team to win the coveted trophy, named after Ranjitsinhji of Jamnagar. Unadkat dealt the ﬁrst blow when he trapped dangerman Anustup Majumdar (63) in front with a beauty in the sixth over of the day. Two

balls later, he ran Akash Deep out freakishly to swing the match in the host’s favour. Akash’s run out hampered Bengal’s progress and hurt its morale.

262,2020/03/13,IPL suspended till April 15,"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Friday decided to suspend the Indian Premier League (IPL) till April 15 as a precautionary measure against COVID-19 pandemic.

“The BCCI is concerned and sensitive about all its stakeholders, and public health in general, and it is taking all necessary steps to ensure that, all people related to IPL including fans have a safe cricketing experience,” Jay Shah, Honorary Secretary, BCCI, said.

The decision comes a day after the Sports Ministry asked all national federations, including the cricket board, to follow the Health Ministry’s advisory and avoid large gatherings in sports events.

The Ministry of External Affairs too advised the BCCI not to go ahead with the IPL “at this time” but left it to the discretion of the board.

The Delhi government on Friday banned all sports events and activities in the city, which will see a gathering of more than 200 people, including the IPL.

With a majority of visas to India being cancelled in the wake of COVID-19 scare, overseas cricketers and coaching staff members will be ineligible to enter the country at least till April 15 since they are issued B-Sports visas under Business Visa category.

263,2020/03/13,"Ranji Trophy final | T20 impacting spin bowling, says Dilip Doshi","Youngsters shouldn’t play shortest version, says ex-India spinner

Enjoying a gruelling Ranji Trophy final between his ‘home’ teams, Saurashtra and Bengal, at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium here, Dilip Doshi, a noted left-arm spinner of his time, shares his thoughts on the changing shades of the game, including the trade he pursued with passion.

Acknowledging that spin bowling has been deeply impacted by T20 cricket, Doshi feels young bowlers shouldn’t be playing the shortest version of the game.

Sticking to strengths

“If a young spin bowler coming to the fore sees every ball being hit, he will fall to being defensive. He will bowl quicker and will completely lose his action,” Doshi told The Hindu.

Spinners need to stick to their strength, he said. “If you have been picked as a spinner, then you got to make sure that you are spinning the ball,” he says.

Citing the example of Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon, one of the finest practitioners of the trade at present, Doshi says, “If you are that passionate about maintaining your art, you will find a way to accelerate.”

About the current scenario, he says, “Spinners hardly spin the ball. I cannot call somebody a spinner unless he spins the ball. Otherwise, he falls into the category of a slow bowler. Probably there is too much of coaching.

“Like fast bowlers who are born, (high quality) spin bowlers are born too. It is a natural gift and it is passion that takes them to the top spot. Technique in spin bowling is practically non-existent today.

“Very few spinners have a follow-through… To deliver a spinning ball you got to have a follow-through, which actually makes the ball dip in flight and that’s missing today.

“That’s because most spinners today are open-chested. When you are open-chested, the follow-through is next to impossible,” he said.

Guidance

In Doshi’s view, young spinners are not guided well.

“They don’t even know their fault. The problem is very few people around are able to detect it. Otherwise, India is the home of and nursery for spin bowlers.

“I have not seen a high quality spin bowler in a long time? I don’t know why! It’s not simple to sum it all up in one sentence,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/j0gchd/article31052458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13DOSHI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-final-t20-impacting-spin-bowling-says-dilip-doshi/article31052459.ece
264,2020/03/13,Indian Premier League | Matches to be played in front of empty stands?,"Saturday’s Governing Council meeting will decide the fate of the tournament

The Sports Ministry has asked all the national sports federations, including the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), to adhere to the Health Ministry’s guidelines on barring all “public gatherings.”

Also read: Foreign players not available for IPL till April 15 due to fresh visa restrictions

The Ministry of External Affairs advised the BCCI not to go ahead with the Indian Premier League (IPL) “at this time” but left it to the discretion of the board. The BCCI continued to explore various options ahead of Saturday’s IPL Governing Council (GC) meeting to decide the fate of the 13th edition which is scheduled to start in Mumbai on March 29.

Holistic approach

“There have been conflicting advisories from various quarters, so on Saturday, we will sit down with all the stakeholders and take a holistic approach for deciding the future course of action,” BCCI treasurer Arun Dhumal told The Hindu on Thursday.

While Dhumal confirmed that representatives of all eight franchisees along with those from the broadcaster have been invited for the meeting, he said it would be premature to discuss overseas players’ participation.

The Hindu reported on Thursday that with a majority of visas to India being cancelled in the wake of COVID-19 scare, overseas cricketers and coaching staff members will be ineligible to enter the country at least till April 15 since they are issued B-Sports visas under Business Visa category.

“Yes, it has been brought to our notice. If the GC decides to go ahead with the event, then we shall have to request the relevant government authorities for it (issuing visas to overseas cricketers and support staff members),” Dhumal said.

With the sports ministry diktat of not allowing public gatherings, it is likely that if IPL goes ahead as scheduled, it will be played in front of empty stands, at least till the virus threat subsides.

Ticket sales suspended

All the franchisees which had started ticket sales have suspended it, to adhere to the ministry’s policy.

The big question to be considered for the IPL authorities is whether to postpone IPL or whether to go ahead as per schedule, with overseas cricketers eliminated for the first few games as the last resort. A majority of franchisee executives The Hindu spoke with felt postponement isn’t a suitable option.

“Suspension or postponement would lead to more confusion. If the advisory is extended beyond April 15, then there will be no time to play and with a cramped international calendar for the rest of the year, there’ll be no window beyond May to stage the IPL,” said a franchisee official, preferring anonymity.

A BCCI official, citing anonymity, stated the ball will be in BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s — father of BCCI secretary Jay Shah — court. “If the minister informally advises the president to go ahead with the event, he (Ganguly) will press for the IPL as per schedule with empty stands,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/2s3e13/article31052619.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13STANDS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/indian-premier-league-matches-to-be-played-in-front-of-empty-stands/article31052620.ece
265,2020/03/13,‘Panchopasana’: A well-knit production,"Revathy Srinivasaraghavan’s ‘Panchopasana’ combined bhakti literature and abstract concepts

Panchopasana, Revathy Srinivasaraghavan’s thematic dance production, was hosted by Mulund Fine Arts Society as part of their Golden Jubilee celebrations, at the Mahakavi Kalidas Auditorium, Mulund. The concept was based on Adi Sankaracharya’s definition of Upasana as meditation about ‘someone or something.’

Five concepts from devotional literature on deities and abstract ideas were deployed as inspiration for five segments knit together through music and dance to create a cohesive presentation.

The presentation opened with Swara Laya, a set of swaras in Brindavana Saranga, in vilambam, madhyamam and dhrutam of chatusra and tisra nadai.

The swara laya, interspersed with konnakol, describing Lord Siva and his attributes, was composed and recited by Satish Krishnamurthy. This was followed by Rudram Chamakam and a vibrant Tandav, alternating with graceful lasya.

Students of Revathy Srinivasaraghavan

‘Aagasa Lingam,’ a kriti on Siva composed by Ulundurpettai Shanmugam, pictured the splendid Ananda Tandavam of the celestial dancer at Chidambaram. With the demon representing ignorance under his feet, the fire in his hand to destroy evil, the drum in his hand indicating origin of life, the raised hand to show him as the saviour, the corona arch on the back signifying the cosmos, the Nataraja Murti, is a symbolic representation of the five dimensions of the Lord. The dancing form, the sanctum, the mere space which represents Nirguna Brahman, devoid of all names and forms, were all graphically depicted by Revathi.

Revathi Srinivasaraghavan

Extolling Tamil as one of the finest and oldest surviving classical languages, poems from Tamil literature were chosen to explore and express the Ultimate Truth.

Homage to the Trinity

‘Pachhai mamalai’ and ‘Oorilen kaani illai’ in Bowli, set to Adi talam, selected from Divya Prabandam was followed by Thevaram ‘Todudaya’ in Gambhira Naatai and Khanda nadai and ‘Vaananai’ in Kiravani set to Mishra chapu. Next came a Tiruppavai, ‘Margazhi Thingal,’ in Ragam Naatai, taalam Aadi. All these were presented by Revathi’s disciples with neat coordination and grace, highlighting the devotional element. Revathi joined in for ‘Muthaitharu,’ an energetic Tiruppugazh in Shanmukhapriya, Misra chapu. The Tamil segment concluded with a sprightly namasankeertanam medley which would have fitted better in the final segment.

The next piece was dedicated to the artistic excellence of the Carnatic Trinity. With humble devotion and honed traditional movements, Revathi did full justice to the works of the composers by presenting Syama Sastri’s ‘Kamakshi,’ Bhairavi Swarajati and Tyagaraja’s ‘Endaro Mahanubhavulu’ in Sri ragam, through comprehensive choreography and compact presentation. Dikshitar’s ‘Anandamritakarshini,’ presented in group, had interesting images of rain and poses of Shive, Bhavani. Continuing the spirit of Tamil pride, episodes from Kamba Ramayanam were presented by the senior disciples.

“Encouraged by positive reviews, we are presenting a few excerpts from the ballet we performed at Karaikudi Kamban Vizha,” said Revathi.

Students of Revathy Srinivasaraghavan

Keeping the storyline intact, Tataka Vadham, celebrations at Mithila on the arrival of Rama and Lakshmana, Sita Swayamvar, Maya of Maricha, Sita Apaharan, Jatayu Moksham and the victory over Ravana were the selected episodes, concluding with Rama Pattabhishekam.

While singer Kaushik Champakesan was in his element in the musical sections composed by Satish Krishnamurthy, Guru Revathi wielded the cymbals, and joined the group as a convincing Ravana.

The final upasana was to the saint composers across our Nation who propagated the essence of bhakti and celebrated their chosen deity.

Be it the Thevarams of the Tamil Trinity, the Paasurams of Azhwars, Ashtapadis of Jayadeva, Vachana, keertanas of Purandaradasa and Annamacharya, Abhangs of saint poets of Maharashtra or the bhajans of Mira and Kabir, devotional music is an inherent part of Indian life.

The interesting medley of songs such as as Annamayya's ‘Sriman Narayana’ in Bowli, Oothukadu Venkata Kavi’s ‘Kannan Varugindra Neram’ in Chenjurutti, Purandaradasa’s ‘Brindavanadolu’ in Shanmukhapriya and Swati Tirunal’s ‘Gopalaka Pahimam’ in Bhupalam, were presented in groups. The garuda gamana formation was visually appealing.

Sant Tukaram’s ‘Sundar te dhyan’ in Yaman set to Bhajani Theka taalam, was presented solo by Revathi. ‘Gopi Gopala’ composed by Surdas in Gamanashrama set to Tisra nadai was lively and had the audience joining in with claps. A novel Jugalbandi of Bharatanatyam footwork with mridangam composed and set by mridgangist Satish Krishnamurthy, who also handled the ganjira, was dynamic. The guru on one side and the disciples on the other were well-synchronised and forceful.

Mahakavi Bharatiyar’s ‘Vande Mataram’ in Ragamaalika, Chatusra Eka talam was a befitting finale.

B. Anantharaman on the violin and Sanjay on the flute took turns in setting the mood for the pieces.

Not moving away from the traditional format, the peppy kolaattam, use of Kartaal, the neat Ahaarya both stitched and improvised and the mridangist joining the singer at times to create a chorus effect were some of the highlights of Panchopasana.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/panchopasana-a-well-knit-production/article31057708.ece

The Chief Minister also said that the Delhi government was arranging DUSIB flats which have remained unoccupied for long, and rooms in under-construction hospitals of the Delhi government for the purpose. “More than 500 beds are ready to be installed in Delhi government hospitals,” he added.

COVID-19, Mr. Kejriwal said, had been declared an epidemic in Delhi following which all public places, government and private offices, malls, and shops, had been notified to disinfect their premises and that shall be compulsory for all.

“Whatever we are doing, is to contain the spread of COVID-19. I hope everyone will support us. We are noticing how rapid the outbreak has been, but in India, we have successfully been able to contain the outbreak with the support of the public. We shall remain alert to stop this disease from spreading,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Health Minister wrote to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, requesting assistance to strengthen the number of testing laboratories in Delhi.

“I have written a letter to Mr. Vardhan requesting him to increase and strengthen the testing facilities. We have also requested opening of testing laboratories in four Delhi government hospitals and other private hospitals, along with Lady Hardinge Hospital, where the testing laboratory was to become operational,” he said.

Private hospitals, he said further, should also be permitted to conduct tests because it was important for every hospital to have a testing lab.

‘More labs needed’

“We need more testing laboratories to conduct tests quickly and to also contain the panic around the whole situation,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/j1g949/article31054405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE13CORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-government-fully-prepared-to-handle-covid-19-crisis-kejriwal/article31054406.ece

A man suspected to be involved in the murder of IB employee Ankit Sharma during the violence on February 24 was arrested on Thursday.

A senior police officer said that after scanning the video footage, technical surveillance was mounted on him and he was nabbed.

They are likely to arrest many more who were involved in the murder. The detained person was part of the mob that murdered Ankit.

“We have obtained several videos, photos and the location where Ankit was murdered during riots in Chand Bagh. We are connecting the dots to find out how he was kidnapped and murdered,” added the officer.

2 brothers held

An investigation team also arrested two brothers — Varun and Arun — for killing Akbari Begum in riot-affected Garhi Mendu area. The brothers were leading a mob that torched a Muslim house in the area. The family members rushed to the terrace after their house was set on fire. A police team rescued them safely from the terrace of the adjoining house but Akbari couldn’t go to the terrace because of old age and died of asphyxiation.

“We arrested Arun and Varun after they were identified through video clippings. Their presence and role were also established by eyewitnesses,” said the officer.

277,2020/03/13,Two more PFI members arrested over fuelling riots,"The accused have been sent to seven-day police custody

Delhi police on Thursday arrested Popular Front of India’s (PFI) Delhi president and secretary for their alleged role in hatching a conspiracy to incite riots in north-east Delhi and funding anti-CAA protests in the national capital.

A senior police officer said Delhi unit president Parvez and State secretary Mohammad Ilyas were arrested from south-east Delhi. The accused were produced before a magistrate in Patiala House Courts and were sent to seven days’ police custody.

On Monday, the police had arrested PFI member Mohd Danish for hatching a conspiracy to incite communal riots in north-east Delhi.

During interrogation, Danish is said to have revealed the “role and involvement of PFI” during the anti-CAA protests.

“There are more than 2,000 active PFI members in the city. We are identifying the members who had played an active role in fuelling violence in north-east Delhi and provided help to anti-CAA protesters,” added the officer.

‘Funding of protests’

Besides the Special Cell, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is also probing the alleged funding of the anti-CAA protest across the country by the PFI.

On Friday, the Special Cell of Delhi Police had arrested a Kashmiri couple for alleged links to a module of the IS.

Twenty days after head constable Ratan Lal was killed during communal riots in north-east Delhi’s Gokulpuri, seven persons have been arrested in connection with the murder, the police said on Thursday.

Delhi Police Public Relations Officer and Additional Commissioner of Police M.S. Randhawa said that the accused have been identified as Chand Bagh residents Saleem Malik alias Munna, Mohammed Jalaluddin alias Guddu Bhai, two brothers Mohammed Ayub and Mohammed Yunus, Arif, and Mohammed Saleem Khan, and Loni resident Mohammed Danish.

The police said that “a conspiracy was hatched to attack the police party” and that the accused are “both conspirators as well as active rioters”.

Sufficient evidence

Mr. Randhawa said that the police have sufficient evidence against the accused in the form of video footage, local intelligence and eyewitness accounts. When asked if the murder weapon has been recovered, Mr. Randhawa said that the police are yet to recover it.

A senior police officer privy to the probe said that the seven accused are not among the ones who shot Lal but among the rioters who were part of that mob. “Munna and Saleem are organisers of the mob and they can be seen in the videos procured by the police. Investigation is at an early stage and this is among the first few arrests made in this case,” the officer said.

Lal was killed on February 24 and later, his autopsy report ascertained that he died of a bullet injury.

279,2020/03/13,NGO alleges gaps in government measures for riot survivors,"‘Nodal officers are unreachable, non-responsive, unsympathetic’

Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (JSA), an umbrella group of NGOs, on Thursday said that there were several gaps in measures taken by the Delhi government in the aftermath of the communal violence in north-east Delhi. This included medicolegal case (MLC) records not being provided to victims and absence of people at help desks in hospitals among others.

The JSA wrote a letter to Health Minister Satyendar Jain in which it also alleged that the nodal officers appointed to help patients at hospitals were not working properly and private hospitals were denying victims free and cashless care as announced by the Delhi government and urged the Minister to fix the problems.

MLC record

“In one instance, a woman, injured in the communal violence, demanded an MLC record from GTB Hospital and was told to access it from the police as ‘the hospital did not have a photocopy machine’. She was also not allowed to see the MLC record and what was written in it. Further, despite giving information to the doctors about being injured during the riot, her MLC was not registered as a “Disaster MLC”,” the letter said.

Explaining about the nodal officers not working properly, the JSA said in the letter, “While phone numbers of nodal officers have been provided to us and help desks have been set up, they have been unable to facilitate patients at the hospitals.”

‘Refused to help’

It added, “The purpose of designating a nodal officer at hospitals was to ensure speedy redressal of barriers being faced by the patients. However, this is far from what the experience with nodal officers has been. When the nodal officer of GTB Hospital was contacted to intervene in a case where a patient was having trouble filing an MLC, he flatly refused saying that he was not concerned with this matter and had not been informed that he is a nodal officer.”

The JSA said that the nodal officers were unreachable, non-responsive and unsympathetic to the troubles being faced by victims and their families.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/exludy/article31054322.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL13-HOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ngo-alleges-gaps-in-government-measures-for-riot-survivors/article31054323.ece

281,2020/03/13,Exams at Shiv Vihar school postponed after protest,"Relatives of a victim demanded that the school be re-sealed

Examinations at Rajdhani Senior Secondary Public School in north-east Delhi’s Shiv Vihar have been postponed a day after locals protested demanding that the school be re-sealed.

The school’s principal Sadaf Faisal said that they are managing the internal process at the moment and will reschedule the examinations in due course. “Yesterday [Wednesday], there was a protest outside the school. Nothing happened on Thursday and police helped us to ensure normalcy. The examinations were to begin from Wednesday but given the situation, it’ll be worked upon again,” she said.

Students worried

Two Class 12 students, who are taking examinations through open school, came to check whether they’ll be able to take the exams.

“We have our practical exams next month. Came here to check whether exams are happening or not . It’s quite worrying,” said Nishat.

On Wednesday, locals led by Hari Singh Solanki, whose son was killed during the communal violence on February 24, protested opening of the school and demanded that it be sealed again. He said that his son Rahul died in an attack allegedly mounted from the terrace of the school.

Mr. Solanki said that he won’t let the examinations be conducted in the school which he called “a den of death that doesn’t deserve the presence of innocent children”, adding that the school had weapons, a slingshot and petrol bombs.

Volunteers of the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee had delivered food to around 15,000 riot victims, who had not shifted to relief camps, in north-east Delhi on a daily basis from February 26 to March 7. Many of them who had visited the riot-affected areas said that it would take generations to heal the trauma that the violence had left behind.

Twenty six-year-old Rajphinder Singh, a volunteer said: “There are no words to describe what we saw and it is really difficult to express. All these years we had only heard about the 1984 riots from our family members. But after volunteering here, I realised what the situation must have been then. When we distributed the langar, elderly Muslim women broke down and thanked us for the help extended to them. When the trucks reached their area, their eyes literally lit up. The violence and trauma which these people had gone through would take generations to heal.”

Volunteers said that the trucks, which made two trips a day to the affected areas, started around 6 a.m. and returned only around 10 p.m. after the second shift.

Harbhej Singh, another volunteer who visited Bhajanpura, Seelampur and Maujpur, said: “We had gone there for sewa. People were not able to step out during that period as curfew was imposed. So we went into the lanes till the point vehicles could reach and delivered food. Food for around 15,000 people wass cooked daily.”

Medical teams in ambulances comprising doctors, nurses, ward boys and pharmacists were also sent to the area.

Dr. Milap Singh, who was part of the medical team, said: “When we reached there [a day after the violence stopped], several people locked themselves in their houses due to the curfew. Over the two days that I visited, around 200 people turned up daily for treatment. Most of them were the ones with minor injuries who were not hospitalised.”

DSGMC president Manjinder Singh Sirsa said: “We provided relief material separately to the government when they asked for it. Doctors were also sent as children were falling ill.

Even if the government decides to close schools and colleges the ongoing exams would continue.

The pressure has increased with several other State governments announcing closure of schools, colleges, malls and pubs that see a large number of people coming together.

Though guidelines state that a person who tested positive for coronavirus can be discharged after 14 days of isolation at hospital provided he/she tests negative twice consecutively, the index case from the State was discharged on the 13th day, the date of admission (March 1) included.

In fact, until a few days ago, officials from the Telangana Health department said that the 24-year-old man would be discharged on Sunday, upon completion of 14-day isolation period.

However, officials on Friday said he was discharged and would be under home isolation for 14 days more. His medical condition would be monitored for the fortnight.

285,2020/03/13,Minister takes serious view of milk producers not making supply,"Proposals to enlist support of Gopalmitras should be considered, he says

The Telangana State Dairy Development Cooperative Federation, the State-run outfit selling milk products under the brand name Vijaya Telangana, has decided to take action against farmers who were not supplying milk to the federation despite having membership.

Animal Husbandry Minister T. Srinivas Yadav directed the officials concerned to get district-wise lists of farmers who were not supplying milk to the federation so that appropriate action including cancellation of membership could be initiated against them. Though the government gave an incentive of ₹4 per litre over and above the procurement price fixed, a section of farmers was supplying their produce to private dairies. He expressed concern that some members of these farmers societies were encouraging them to supply to private sector rather than the State-owned federation.

The Minister was addressing the 10th board meeting of the federation here on Friday. He directed the officials concerned to conduct a special drive to identify such farmers and initiate necessary reforms. The officials could give membership to farmers who were willing to supply milk to the federation and could consider provision of incentives to them. This would help the federation augment its procurement.

He said proposals to enlist the support of Gopalamitras, volunteers promoting dairy products in villages, should also be considered and their meeting fixed shortly. Mr. Srinivas Yadav stressed the need for giving adequate publicity to Vijaya brand products so that their sales went up significantly. Outlets selling Vijaya brand products should be set up at all places of tourist and religious importance and modalities should be evolved to ensure supply of the products to all government establishments.

286,2020/03/13,"Govt. will enhance power tariff, property tax: KCR","Seeks people’s cooperation for enhancing the quality of services

The State government has announced its resolve to enhance the power tariff and property tax in urban and rural areas in the coming days.

The tariff hike would not, however, impact the poor and marginal groups and “tariff will be hiked for those sections which can afford”. “There will be no indiscriminate increase in power tariff. The hike will be for sections which can afford and absorb it,” Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said.

The Chief Minister recalled that the government had been supplying 24-hour quality power to all sections since it took the reins of the State. “How can the government enhance quality of supply without enhancing the tariff? People should cooperate with the government, which is working to further enhance the quality of services,” he said, exhorting the elected representatives to explain to people facts in a transparent manner in seeking their cooperation.

He said the government would also hike the property tax in urban and rural areas as it would become a source of revenue for effectively administering local self-governments. Accordingly, property owners would be asked to conduct self-assessment of the property and give declaration so that tax could be fixed.

“In the event of the declaration being proved wrong, the owners will be levied 25 times the property tax and a provision for awarding two-year imprisonment has been incorporated in the new legislations that have been enacted recently,” he said. The Chief Minister was replying to the short discussion on Palle Pragati in the Legislative Assembly on Friday.

He said the government was firm on ensuring quality services to people and there would be no compromise in this regard. The government had therefore fixed roles and responsibilities for officials and elected representatives and action would be initiated against those found wanting in discharge of duties assigned to them.

Soft pedalling the issues related to Panchayat Raj system resulted in the present sorry state of affairs of the local bodies and the government had therefore decided to go for a complete revamp of the systems to make them more accountable. In this context, he quoted the overwhelming success of tree plantation in villages that had witnessed 86% survival. “Anyone can go and inspect this. Such survival rate could be achieved after elected representatives like councillors are made responsible for it,” he said.

He expressed concern that the Panchayat Raj system had been diluted and weakened by successive governments and the system had been politicised to such an extent that liquor flowed freely during the Panchayat elections. “There has to be some beginning. Concrete steps are needed to cleanse the entire system for making it accountable. The government had therefore defined framework for administration at different levels so that they deliver services effectively,” he said.

He asserted that people no longer went by the hollow assurances given by the political parties and credibility had become an important factor in selecting their representatives. He cited the Congress’ promise of waiver of loans up to ₹ 2 lakh at one go while the TRS said it would waive loans up to ₹ 1 lakh in four instalments. “People trusted us and I stand by my conviction,” he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/govt-will-enhance-power-tariff-property-tax-kcr/article31061798.ece
287,2020/03/13,Faye in the time of fake news,"In the city for a talk, hosted by Manthan, journalist Faye D’Souza holds forth on ‘9 pm news’

Braving the threat of Corona virus by mingling with crowds apart from the possibility of being drenched by surprise spring showers, over 800 people from all walks of life turned up to hear journalist Faye D’Souza at the Manthan’s event — What the 9 pm news has done to the country.

As the crowd formed neat queues to tuck into crisp samosas, piping hot tea and Osmania biscuits (staples of Manthan events) there was a percipient buzz in the air about being audience to one of the country’s popular faces on television.

Faye who rose to fame with the show The Urban Debate on one of the news channels, where she anchored on subjects of corruption, communal violence and independent press is one of the country’s prominent independent news anchors. One of the rare breed of journalists who reported on a wide variety of topics including human interest stories, she was awarded the RedInk award for the Journalist of the Year in 2018.

The 45-minute talk (followed by the speaker taking questions from the audience) saw the journalist jump right in by holding forth on the five fundamental tenets of journalism: independence, fairness, impartiality, humanity and accountability. Using crisp illustrations from the recent past, she demonstrated how news media has demolished every golden rule of journalism by unscrupulous reportage, conflicts of interests and murky quid pro quos.

Faye then went on to explain the mounting troubles facing Indian news channels. Rattling off facts, she explained how the extremely competitive space with 400 news channels (including regional and national ones) which is now worth over a whopping 2000 crore is beset by changing audience preferences and increasing government regulations.

She added a new term to the lexicon of those present: ‘cord cutting’ and explained it when she said, “It is generally believed that people under the age of 35 are no longer watching television. People usually switch on their televisions for four things: live sports, movies, general entertainment (sitcoms and serials) and news. People prefer OTT platforms for the first three categories and rarely are they now preferring the news channels for news. They are cutting the cord of cable television.”

She then showcased the power of journalism through two stories she had pursued — one, the story of the people of Mahul near Chembur, Mumbai who were severely affected by the refineries operating in the area which caused them severe health issues. Faye chased the story for two years and finally succeeded as the families were relocated by the government recently. Another example was bringing to notice the taxation on sanitary pads during the implementation of GST. After, a year of reportage the government rolled it back from its ‘luxury’ tax.

Confident, concise and methodical, the journalist gave ample food for thought for those present. Breaking down gory truths which ranged from godmen who run businesses, the truth behind conclaves and the mad dash for TRPs, she stressed that ‘in a democracy media has to be free’ and that ‘the media needs to regulate itself’. She also held forth on the shrill 9 pm news, the role of WhatsApp in news dissemination, the recent Delhi riots and made clear that the very essence of being a journalist is to ‘ask questions’.

Raising relevant questions and delineating the clutter which happens behind the scenes, Faye succeeded in striking a chord with those present and demonstrated why television, which was once reliable descended into being an idiot box. A powerful communicator who held sway over the audience (which held her in good stead on her stint on television) she was clear and in command of the subject on hand.

Her solution to those who wanted credible news: support independent journalists who are risking their lives to bring the truth out, and oh, to not watch television news!",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/3p2ot7/article31060290.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy12-fayedsouza,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/faye-dsouza-manthan-what-the-9-pm-news-has-done-to-the-country/article31060292.ece

Swedish firm Revin Aviation is upbeat on the market for seaplanes in India and is considering making Hyderabad a design hub.

The plan is to set up aircraft design bureau in the city and initially manufacture the seaplanes in Sweden. Overtime, the firm would also like to explore locations in India for setting up manufacturing operations, Chief Executive Officer Niranjan Madari said on Thursday.

Euro 15 million

Founding partner Nils Pihlblad estimated the investment on the design facility as well as manufacturing of two prototypes to be euro 15 million.

The company was keen on keeping the price of each seaplane around euro 3 million to make them accessible to more people, he added.

Our spares network is global in nature and has multiple sources of sourcing, including India where we have significant amount of our spares and component base.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/iazwbk/article31054014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-STANLEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/airbus-to-spread-its-wings-in-telangana/article31054005.ece

293,2020/03/13,Women pilots conquer the skies,"While the world average for women pilots is 3-4%, it’s 13% in India

When it comes to the ‘best job’ in the commercial airlines industry, women have a great going in India. While the world average for women pilots is 3-4%, the percentage is as high as 13% in the country.

“The number of women pilots in our country is much higher than what it is all over the world. In fact, it has come as a record,” said Captain Sapna Patel, who heads the Hyderabad chapter of Indian Women Pilots’ Association (IWPA)

When she conquered the skies in 1989 as a commercial pilot with the then Indian Airlines (now Air India), there were just a handful of women in the industries, but now there are over 1,000 women who operate the flying controls of aircraft.

“We have 210 women flyers in Air India itself and a few hundreds with other private operators,” Capt. Patel, the country’s 12th woman commercial pilot told The Hindu.

She said that the market is booming and this is a great opportunity for youngsters, as the operators are inducting a large fleet every year.

“The industry is advancing every day and the demand is huge,” said Capt. Patel, adding that the aviation will never stop expanding.

When asked about the current slowdown in the aviation sector, she said, “It is like a cycle, sometimes it’s slow, but when there is a boom, the entire slump will be controlled.”

Speaking about the operations of the association, she said that the IWPA provided the forum for women pilots who have the spirit to take up challenges in the pursuit of excellence.

“Through courage, dedication and tenacity, women should know the challenges that empower them to pursue what appears difficult, and in the process achieve greater heights and excellence as well as motivate others,” Capt. Patel said. Formed in 1967, IWPA, a non-profit organisation, educates women about aerospace and aviation and provides vocational guidance.

They encourage youngsters to pursue a career in aviation by conducting awareness programmes at school and college levels.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2gxh6i/article31053922.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy12Sapna,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/women-pilots-conquer-the-skies/article31053911.ece
294,2020/03/13,Efforts for World Heritage Site tag to Ramappa temple gain pace,"Final dossier submitted to ASI to be forwarded to UNESCO

Tourism Minister V. Srinivas Goud has said that the final dossier for World Heritage Site recognition to Ramappa temple in Warangal was submitted to the Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for forwarding it to the UNESCO.

The nomination dossier on Ramappa temple was submitted in 2016 and the final dossier, after several revisions as directed by the ASI, was submitted on January 10, 2019, he said at the Legislative Council here on Thursday.

Vasu Poshyanandana from Thailand, an expert for evaluation of Ramappa temple, was nominated by the International Council on Monuments and Sites, UNESCO. He visited the temple in September last year. “We hope that Ramappa temple will be the first site to get world heritage recognition and will attract the attention of tourists from the entire world,” he said.

TRS MLC Pochampally Srinivas Reddy raised the subject and sought to know the measures that were taken to get recognition to the historical temple. He suggested that Ramappa temple has a 27-acre tank with an island and there were proposals to construct a meditation centre too.

The work taken up by the Central Archaeology department was going on at a snail’s pace and so also work on the Thousand Pillar temple. There was 27 acres of agricultural land near the temple and the whole site could be developed as a tourism village.

The Minister said that plans were on for construction of an auditorium, meditation centre and accommodation for tourists near the temple site. A proposal to develop a tourism circuit in Warangal was under government’s consideration. Government would also develop all natural scenic spots, waterfalls in all the districts and areas around the reservoirs being constructed under Kaleshwaram and other irrigation projects would be developed as tourist centres.

After irrigation projects were completed in two years, government would focus on a big way on tourism and develop tourism spots to generate revenue as well as employment opportunities. He said the suggestion to deploy helicopters for Rama Navami celebrations in Bhadradri and sanction of College of Sculpture near Ramappa temple in Warangal would be taken to the notice of the Chief Minister.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/yjj5mq/article31053897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-RAMAPPA-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/efforts-for-world-heritage-site-tag-to-ramappa-temple-gain-pace/article31053896.ece

The civil aviation show in city turned out to be show of pride of Indian aviation.

As Mark Jefferies and his two partners, on Thursday, pulled of an aerobatic manoeuvre with their propeller-powered Extra EA-330SC trailing tri-colour smoke, visitors to the four-day Wings India-2020 aviation show could feel a sense of pride. The Global Stars aerobatic team brought in for the show then performed a series of aerobatic feats with improbable loops, drops and fly-by manoeuvres.

Earlier, the Indian Air Force’s Sarang Team used modified Dhruv helicopters to pull off a breathtaking aerial show. They showed the capability and flexibility of the choppers that have been used for relief and rescue operations on multiple occasions in the country, including the Kerala and Uttarakhand floods.

Inside a hangar, a clutch of exhibitors showcased their wares. A majority of them were Indians showing the evolution of the country’s airpower and institutional growth. The pride of place was the banner that announced that the cabins of a new set of ‘Marine One’ helicopter used by the US President will be manufactured in Hyderabad. Tata Advanced Systems with its manufacturing plant in the city is the sole global supplier of these airframes for the S-92 helicopters.

Also on display was Air India’s letter to the nation that listed out the numerous missions that the national carrier performed in the service of the nation. It had the tone of a goodbye letter ending with the words: “We hope our name will always be remembered for selflessness and patriotism.”

296,2020/03/13,Corporators’ proposals to be sent directly to govt. for approval,"Decision taken at the GHMC Standing Committee meeting

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) Standing Committee, during its meeting on Thursday, has decided to send various works individually proposed by corporators directly to the government for approval.

Mayor Bonthu Ram Mohan, after discussion with the standing committee members on Thursday, has issued instructions to the zonal commissioners to convene a meeting on Friday with corporators from their respective zones, and receive proposals for developmental works worth ₹50 lakh from each.

The proposals for laying of CC roads and other infrastructural works will be sent for government’s approval, as their combined value from 150 corporators could escalate up to ₹75 crore, he said.

As per the rule book, GHMC Commissioner or each zonal commissioner is authorised to sanction individual works with estimated cost up to ₹2 crore only. Standing Committee has the powers to sanction works up to ₹3 crores, while GHMC Council may approve works up to ₹6 crore during General Body meeting. All works costing above ₹6 crore should be sent to the State government for approval.

However, the rule should be applied to each single work, and not to a bouquet of various works as was decided by the standing committee.

Officials under the condition of anonymity confirm that rules framed for implementation of GHMC Act stipulate the sanctioned limits on estimated cost for a single work and not on combined value of different works proposed by all corporators.

Mr.B onthu Ram Mohan has instructed the zonal commissioners to also accept proposals for sports material from the corporators as per their long standing demand. In view of bore-well maintenance being handed over to the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, he said General Managers of the Board too should be summoned for the meetings with corporators, in order to discuss the water scarcity in summer and related issues.

Property acquisition

The standing committee has also approved two proposals for property acquisition for road development at Begumpet and Shastripuram junction.

297,2020/03/13,HC seeks govt. counter-affidavit over 2% quota,"The Telangana High Court directed the State government to file counter-affidavit in a PIL petition challenging 2% reservation provided to persons of Scheduled Castes, who converted to Christianity, for admissions into fifth standard in Gurukul schools. A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, hearing the petition on Wednesday filed by one P. Srinivas, observed that there was nothing wrong in Telangana government’s decision to be more liberal by providing more space to converts. Posting the petition after four weeks for next hearing, the bench said the main objective of reservations is to come to the rescue of the more oppressed and backward persons.

Petitioner’s contention

The petitioner’s counsel Harinath contended that once a person from SC converts to Christianity, he or she cannot avail reservation. The petitioner said the 2% reservations for admissions into fifth standard in Gurukul schools are arbitrary and illegal.

The bench noted that with the religious conversion only the name of a person changes. But the backwardness and poverty of such persons remain the same, it said. The purpose of the reservations was to uplift the disadvantaged sections and weaker groups of the social strata. If a SC person switches to Christianity, that person would not become Brahmin or a millionaire. Hence, it would be unjustified to deny them the reservation, the bench observed. The bench said that one has to view the government’s purpose in providing 2% reservation in the matter. “The State wants to uplift persons who were suppressed for several years. Their conversion to Christianity would not make them forward,” the bench remarked. Special Government Pleader Sanjeev Kumar told the court that these 2% reservations were meant only for admissions into fifth standard in social welfare Gurukul schools.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hc-seeks-govt-counter-affidavit-over-2-quota/article31053733.ece

299,2020/03/13,Coronavirus | A visit that exposed Telangana to increased risk,"Samples of Kalaburagi man who consulted doctors in Banjara Hills tested positive for COVID-19

The possibility of coronavirus spreading in Telangana has increased as the first COVID-19 casualty in India had visited at least two private hospitals at Banjara Hills in Hyderabad.

The samples of the 76-year-old man from Kalaburagi, Karnataka, who had consulted doctors at the two hospitals in Hyderabad and died on way back to his home-state, were on Thursday declared positive.

Now, the high priority task on the Telangana Health department officials is to track doctors, medical staff and others who came in contact with the man whose death is the first COVID 19 casualty in India.

Director of Public Health G Srinivas Rao said they had identified the hospitals and contact tracking was taken up by the State Rapid Response Teams.

It was published in these columns that he was a high-risk case as the man had travel history to Saudi Arabia, and had suffered from acute respiratory illness, cold, cough and fever. Initially, he had been admitted to a private hospital in Kalaburagi where samples were collected and sent for tests to a laboratory in Bengaluru.

Before the result was known, doctors there suggested that he be taken to Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad. “He did not, however, visit Gandhi Hospital,” sources said, adding that his family had brought him to at least two hospitals in Banjara Hills. They would corroborate it, they said. On Thursdays, it was known that he tested positive for COVID-19.

“He did not die at any hospital in Hyderabad,” sources said.

300,2020/03/13,"‘Kanne’, the track from Thaikkudam Bridge’s album, ‘Namah’ brings back Avial-fame Anandraj Benjamin Paul","The song, written by Dhanya Suresh, is about father-daughter bond

Think Avial and one name that was being sorely missed by music lovers is Anandraj Benjamin Paul, the power-packed lead vocalist of the band who moved to the United States prior to the release of the band’s first album in 2008. Last year, Thaikkudam Bridge sprang a surprise by bringing him on board for a track in their multi-artiste album, Namah. The song, ‘Kanne’ was released on YouTube on Thursday (March 12) featuring videos of Anand performing with the band at two shows in the US last year.

“It was a surreal moment for all of us. He joined us for rehearsal on the eve of the show. He hadn’t performed on stage for over a decade. We jammed for sometime and hearing him sing ‘Chekkele’ [the iconic folk track from Avial’s album], was nostalgic. He still sounds the same and is so effortless when he hits those high notes,” says Govind Vasantha, frontman of the band.

Father’s concern

‘Kanne’, written by Dhanya Suresh, Govind’s sister, is crooned by Anand and Vipin Lal. “It is about a father-daughter bond, how he promises to take care of her and raise her without any hatred. The idea was suggested by our guitarist Ashok Betty Nelson,” says Govind. The track that starts out as a melody in Vipin’s voice is taken to a new level in Anand’s high-voltage rendition, backed by engaging orchestration.

Govind says that ever since they decided to bring out the album featuring leading musicians, they had been trying to get in touch with Anand through Facebook and other avenues. It was his wife who replied after six to seven months. In an earlier interview with The Hindu, Anand had said, “My first reaction was to step back. But being a father, I could connect with the song and decided to be part of the project.”

Even though Thaikkudam had wound up their album with nine songs by then, once they got Anand’s reply, ‘Kanne’ was added and the track was sent across to him. “Apparently, he practised the song several times a day for nearly a month because he wanted to ensure that the result did not disappoint. He is a family man and got emotionally attached to the song,” Govind says.

He remembers how excited they were when Anand recorded the track and sent it to him. “I was in the middle of watching a movie with my family in Chennai. The moment I saw his message, I ran out of the theatre because I couldn’t wait to hear his voice,” laughs Govind.

Namah, officially launched in Bengaluru last year, has leading musicians from India and abroad such as Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, Umayalpuram Sivaraman, Ustad Rashid Khan, Rakesh Chaurasia, Pandit Ram Narayan, Niladri Kumar, Chris Adler, Guthrie Govan, Marco Minnemann and Jordan Rudess.

The band is planning to bring down Anand for a concert to be held in Bengaluru on June 20.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/hmw8lg/article31060019.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvm-anand-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/avial-fame-anandraj-benjamin-paul-in-thaikkudam-bridges-album/article31060020.ece
301,2020/03/13,Being ‘Malayali Da’,"Malayalam rapper Thirumali talks about his art, his fans and what inspires him

The number of viewers on Thirumali’s YouTube page has crossed one million. The Malayalam rapper Vishnu MS from Kottayam, whose YouTube subscriber base has touched a lakh, says fame didn’t happen overnight. He started rapping seven years ago, but it is only recently that Malayalam rap has been getting the attention it deserves. Today, his inbox is flush with fan mail. “I am enjoying the attention, as I have worked hard towards it,” he says.

His track ‘Avastha’, released in 2019, is a tongue-in-cheek, angsty take on our lives and times. The 25-year-old audio engineer says he wrote the track as a student few years ago. When he took to rapping, one of his chief obsessions during his late teens, Vishnu did it in English. “I was hugely inspired by Lil Wayne, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar and Drake and I was trying to imitate what they did. But then it struck me: Why not rap in Malayalam? It is a language in which I can express myself the best. It comes naturally to me and my lyrics felt original.”

Vishnu’s ‘Malayali Da’, released in 2018, which dwells on the “state of being Malayali” hit the right notes among his fans. This was followed by the Ozhappan Anthem (the could be translated the loafer’s anthem), Kottayam Duke and the latest Blue Bucket Rebirth in 2020, an ode to the ‘neela bucket’ ditty that was a rage among the youth in the early 2000s. “We don’t really know who made the actual song, but it was hugely popular and it was just a few lines on how a blue bucket goes missing. In our song, we bring the bucket back,” says Vishnu.

Thirumali in a still from the album ‘Blue Bucket Rebirth’

Rappers always have cool stage names and Vishnu picked Thirumali, derived from the expression kalla thirumali, which roughly translated, means rogue.

Rap as an art form is yet to be fully understood and explored, feels Vishnu. “It is musicality, poetry and social commentary all rolled into one.” His works are usually a spin off on events or situations that touched him in some way. Ever since Ranveer Singh’s Gully Boy was released, rapping has caught on in South India as well. “What I like best about rapping is that it doesn’t have to follow rules. It is a flow … of thought, feeling and emotion. It is straight from the soul.”

It is also a great way to explore the nuances of a language, says Vishnu. “In my initial days, I used to write out lyrics as they occurred to me and practice them; I used to scour the dictionary to find synonyms and words that rhymed. Now, however, it comes to me automatically by sheer practice.” His lexicon is one that appeals to the younger crowd, including ingenious expressions and terms that would resonate with them, Vishnu likes to experiment with pure language too.

He has done over 12 college shows, a big number for a rap act, and has collaborated with other artists too. The animated video and music programming for ‘Avastha’ was done by Amal Antony. For the ‘Blue Bucket Rebirth’, he has collaborated with Thudwiser.

A couple of films are on the horizon as well. Vishnu has done a bit for a song in Anoop Sathyan’s Varane Avashyamundu and Shaheen Siddique-starrer Oru Kadanathadan Katha. He hopes to work for more films in Malayalam.

“Until then, I will continue to do what I do best — rap,” he signs off.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/r6baqe/article31060139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KimpThirumalijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/rapper-thirumalis-viewership-crosses-one-million/article31060143.ece
302,2020/03/13,Kochi band ‘Chemmeen’ collaborates with singari melam team ‘Attamkala Samithi’ to create a different kind of music,"‘Chemmeen feat Attam’ creates a new kind of pulsating music

Rock music and singari melam (percussion ensemble) make an unusual combination, but when Kochi rock band Chemmeen and Thrissur-based percussion ensemble Attamkala Samithi play together as ‘Chemmeen feat Attam’ there is unusual, unexpected harmony. Singari melam is high voltage percussion rhythm and movement based music with a large number of musicians. Marrying the two — the band with six member line-up and 15 members of the melam troupe was not easy.

“The challenge was matching the instruments with the chenda’s rhythmic pattern, which is basically sans shruthi and also matching its pace,” says Shalvin Abraham, bassist and one of the band members. Also, the chenda, as the tempo builds, tends to get loud. The tracks are composed in advance so that both bands can play with synchronicity.

The idea came to Chemmeen keyboardist Sajove Job; the band was composing a song for the St Mary’s Orthodox Church festival at Pazhanji near Kunnamkulam. Since high voltage singari melam is popular, Sajove thought of incorporating some of the elements

“The song was composed by us but we incorporated a part of the attam (singari melam) into the song for local flavour and it sounded good. That set Sajove thinking about performing together with the melam ensemble,” says Shalvin. They put forth the idea of performing more often to Attamkala Samithi, and they agreed. The initial show demanded 10 days practice; the practice sessions have been pared down to three-four days now.

Attamkala Samithi is one of the popular singari melam troupes of Thrissur with a huge fan following. The first fusion performance was at the kodiyettam (inauguration) of the church festival, which was a huge success. Since then they have played at numerous church and temple festivals, college functions and corporate shows, these are their primary events. A melam troupe has 24-30 members, but all percussionists do not perform with Chemmeen since performance spaces would be insufficient to accommodate 30-odd musicians on stage.

A Chemmeen-Attamkala Samithi performance usually has 15 melam artistes and six band members. The band members of Chemmeen, besides Sajove and Shalvin are Vijo Job (lead guitar), Jeo Jacob (drums), Vineeth Mohan (vocals) and Nidhin Raj (violin); Neethu Faizal and Vishnu Achari are guest vocalists.

Saneesh Attam, one of the founder-members of the Attamkala Samithi, enjoys the experience since it is different from their usual music, “The sound is different. While an attam piece has a lot more movement and steps, performing with Chemmeen doesn’t demand that many steps or moving around. Our steps match the rhythm sets that we compose for our performances.” The Attam ensemble comprises 16 chenda and eight of ilathalam (small cymbals). He agrees with Shalvin that chenda is louder than drums and that was initially a problem since the microphone played up the louder noise. During practice, they worked on the acoustics and found their balance with adjustments to the mic. Sarath Attam leads the attam line-up for the singari melam. They play popular songs including Malayalam folk songs and film numbers, especially popular are AR Rahman numbers.

Collaborating has worked well for both as attam fans get to listen to some rock music and vice versa for rock music fans, “it is the best of both worlds,” says Shalvin.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/q7a9mv/article31057657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ASK02401jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/chemmeen-feat-attam-creates-a-new-kind-of-pulsating-music/article31057658.ece

304,2020/03/13,A cop fated to deal with fake messages too often,"If generating fake and misleading social media messages is a mark of one’s popularity then this police officer would rather prefer to remain unpopular.

For, it was the third time in less than as many years that K. Laljy, Assistant Commissioner of Police, Kochi City, had to clarify that he had nothing to do with a message that was found circulating in WhatsApp in his name.

The latest message attributed to him was regarding COVID-19 and started circulating on Sunday coinciding with the spurt in cases. The alarmist message in a male voice claiming to be Mr. Laljy could be heard saying, attributing to a doctor at Kozhikode Medical College Hospital, that COVID-19 will spread across the State within a week.

“I hardly could sleep for two days since then as I was bombarded with calls from across the world asking whether the message was true. It was a mentally exhausting experience clarifying things day in day out,” said Mr. Laljy.

That he was spared of giving official clarifications since his superiors know him and can even recognise his voice served as a small consolation though.

The first fake audio clip impersonating the officer appeared a couple of years ago in which a voice could be heard warning about widespread attempts to kidnap children. At that point, speculation was rife about how kidnappers were on the prowl and marked out houses of their potential targets by sticking a black sticker. It continues to circulate sporadically even now.

This was followed by an audio clip warning people to be careful while using a mobile wallet.

“Since the message was not harmful and was actually well-intentioned, I wasn’t bothered. But the other two messages were alarmist and cases were registered. All audio clips had different voices,” said Mr. Laljy.

In fact, the latest one on COVID-19 is being considered the most alarmist and cyber police are after tracking down its origin though chances, by their own admission, are next to impossible.

“Unlike fake Facebook posts the origin of which could be tracked down with the help of the service provider, in the case of a WhatsApp message the only way was to follow its spread in the reverse from the latest receiver backwards, which is not practical,” said cyber police sources.

So, why Mr. Laljy continues to be singled out for impersonation in social media?

“I could either claim that I interact with people a lot and that accessibility is being exploited for passing off fake messages as genuine or it is some sinister ploy to land me in trouble,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/a-cop-fated-to-deal-with-fake-messages-too-often/article31054019.ece
305,2020/03/13,‘Last note’ by bank board member emerges,"The emergence on Thursday of a note reportedly written by a board member of the Ayyanad Service Cooperative Bank before his death has further deepened the controversy surrounding the scam involving diversion of money from the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) to ineligible persons in the aftermath of the 2018 deluge.

V.A. Siyad was found hanging at his home at Thrikkakara on Monday. It caused a stir as the bank had found itself in the middle of the scam after another member of its board was arraigned as accused in the case by the C-Branch probing it.

However, the police were quick to rule out the alleged suicide to have anything to do with the scam, saying that Siyad was neither a suspect nor was he ever questioned.

Though the Thrikkakara police did not recover any note left behind by Siyad, his brother and relatives on Thursday produced a note reportedly written by him before his death.

306,2020/03/13,Flood relief scam getting bigger,"Money diverted from Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund pegged at ₹23 lakh

The extent of the flood relief scam seems to be getting bigger, with the C-Branch investigation team pegging the amount diverted from the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) at ₹23.09 lakh, an exponential rise from the initial estimated misappropriation of ₹10.54 lakh.

With the investigators suspecting more amount to have been misappropriated by the first accused, Vishnu Prasad, through criminal conspiracy with the other six accused, the figure is likely to go up further.

In their application submitted before the Muvattupuzha Vigilance Court for the custody of Vishnu Prasad, the police delineated an intricate web of transactions through which he diverted funds from the CMDRF between November 2019 and January this year, exploiting his official capacity.

Multiple accounts

The application said that initially the first accused had illegally transferred ₹7.49 lakh from a treasury savings bank account maintained by the District Collector at the district treasury for distribution of flood relief to his own multiple personal accounts and those of the second accused, B. Mahesh, and the fifth accused, M.M. Neethu.

He allegedly transferred ₹20,000 to his personal accounts at the Kakkanad branch of ICICI Bank, ₹3.50 lakh to the Palarivattom branch of HDFC Bank and ₹1.25 lakh to another account maintained by him at the Thevara branch of the Ernakulam District Cooperative Bank.

Besides, the first accused transferred ₹31,500 each to the personal accounts held by the second accused at the Kakkanad branch of Union Bank and the Punnakkal branch of the State Bank of India.

Another ₹31,500 was transferred to the personal account of the fifth accused at the Kakkanad branch of Corporation Bank, ₹1 lakh to the account held at the Piravom branch of Union Bank.

The first accused further transferred ₹2.50 lakh to the account held by the second accused at the Kakkanad branch of the District Cooperative Bank and another ₹5 lakh to the account held by the Ayyanad Service Cooperative Bank at the Kakkanad branch of Federal Bank. Later, the third accused, M.M. Anwar, and the fourth accused, Kaulat Anwar, who was also a board member of the Ayyanad Service Cooperative Bank, got it transferred to their joint account by producing the Unique Transaction Reference number secured with the help of the first accused.

The third accused then transferred ₹49,999 each to the personal accounts held by the second accused and the fifth accused, husband and wife, at the Kakkanad branch of HDFC Bank.

Later, the sixth accused, Nithin N.N., and the seventh accused, Shintu Martin, husband and wife, received ₹2.50 lakh, which was transferred to their accounts at the Kakkanad Grameen Bank and the Kakkanad branch of Dena Bank.

The first accused then transferred another ₹2.50 lakh, ₹1.25 lakh, and ₹1.79 lakh to the account of the Ayyanad Service Cooperative Bank held in Federal Bank with the ulterior motive of misappropriating it through the personal accounts of the third and fourth accused.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/we4day/article31053770.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13-KI-KERALAFLOODS-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/flood-relief-scam-getting-bigger/article31053771.ece
307,2020/03/13,Flood relief scam: court extends custody of first accused,"Further questioning necessary to trace the extent of money diverted, from CMDRF, say police

The Muvattupuzha Vigilance Court on Thursday sent Vishnu Prasad, the first accused and the alleged mastermind of the scam involving diversion of money from the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund (CMDRF) in the aftermath of the 2018 deluge to ineligible people, to the custody of the C-Branch of the city police for five days till March 16.

In their custody application, the police claimed that the available documents pointed to the possibility of the first accused having done more illegal transactions, exploiting his official capacity, and that he should be further interrogated to trace the extent of the misappropriated money.

The police said the first accused, who was a clerk in the CMDRF section at the district collectorate, had not been cooperating with the investigation, and hence the exact amount he had illegally diverted from the fund could not be accurately estimated.

Citing reasons for the extended custody of the first accused, the police claimed that he had so far only admitted to crimes proved by the documents seized but was secretive of other potential crimes and non-cooperative with the investigators.

Initially, the accused admitted to have tampered only with the account numbers to which the transfer of money from the CMDRF had failed.

But investigations proved that he had revised the list of beneficiaries by including his name and those of other ineligible persons to illegally transfer money, which needs to be probed further, the custody application said.

The police also termed the custody of the first accused vital for tracking down and seizing assets procured by him.

His presence was also cited as crucial to more detailed investigations and collection of evidence to find out whether more people were involved in the crime.

The first accused was arrested on March 3 in the wake of a complaint lodged by the Additional District Magistrate with the Thrikkakara police regarding the alleged diversion of money from the CMDRF.

The second accused, who was produced in court after the five-day custody along with the first accused, was sent to the Muvattupuzha sub jail.

The police had arrested four accused in the case, while M.M. Anwar, Kaulat Anwar, and M.M. Neethu, the third, fourth and fifth accused respectively, are absconding.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/flood-relief-scam-court-extends-custody-of-first-accused/article31053718.ece

309,2020/03/13,COVID-19: sense of partial shutdown in Kozhikode,"Drop in number of vehicles on road and people visiting shops; 497 under observation

Two days after the State Cabinet took drastic precautionary measures to curb COVID-19 spread, there was a sense of partial shut down in Kozhikode city on Thursday.

There is a drop in the number of vehicles on the road and those using public transport. Not many are boarding private buses or those run by the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation. Very few people are visiting shopping malls and public places such as the beach. There is a fall in the number of patients visiting the Government Medical College Hospital and other government hospitals. Hotels and restaurants too are seeing a drop in the number of customers. Public events have dwindled as most of them have either been cancelled or postponed. At the same time, people are found to embrace the tips to ensure personal hygiene wholeheartedly. Many offices and homes are now equipped with handwash bottles and hand sanitizer bottles. There is such a high demand for them along with facial masks at medical shops that some of the pharmacy stores had reported a shortage.

Meanwhile, 497 people are under observation for the suspected infection in Kozhikode district. This includes 182 people who were newly added to the list on Thursday. Five are undergoing treatment at the medical college hospital and two at the Government General Hospital. Two were discharged from the medical college hospital and five from the general hospital.

313,2020/03/13,Area under paddy cultivation shrinks in Madurai district,"Officials, however, expect increase in productivity due to good water supply

Despite the good rainfall recorded in the district last year, there has been a reduction in paddy cultivation area in 2019-2020.

The reduction in the area under paddy cultivation has been attributed to the delay in release of water from Periyar dam for irrigation. This has resulted in loss of around 7,000 hectares of paddy cultivation area during the kuruvai season, say officials of Agricultural Department.

According to the officials, paddy has been cultivated on a total of 38,645 hectares in the district until the end of February. The total production so far during this period stands at 1.56 lakh tonnes. The officials say that paddy grown on around 4,000 hectares in Melur, Kottampatti and Madurai East blocks is expected to be harvested by the end of March. This is expected to raise the total production to 1.76 lakh tonnes.

N. Prabhakaran, a farmer from Madakulam, said that usually water was released from Periyar dam in the first week of June every year for irrigation during the kuruvai season. “But in 2019, water was released only on August 29. Due to the uncertainty caused by the delay, many farmers in the district did not cultivate paddy,” he said.

Farmers of the double-crop regions, including Vadipatti, Alanganallur, Madurai East and Madurai North, were able to grow only single crop in 2019-2020 owing to the delayed release of water. “Correspondingly, cultivation was undertaken only on 1,500 hectares during the kuruvai season,” said an official.

On the contrary, paddy coverage as well as the production increased during the samba season. Around 90% of the total area under paddy cultivation was covered during this season.

N. Palanichamy of Melur, president, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, said that the yield had been good during the samba season. “In areas where sufficient water was released for irrigation, paddy yield was good. But, tail-end areas like Vadakkampatti, Kurichipatti and other extended parts of Kottampatti block did not receive water,” he said.

Though there was a decrease in coverage area and total paddy production, the productivity was set to increase when compared to last year due to good supply of water, said the official.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/f1fzu0/article31063021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14MAPaddy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/area-under-paddy-cultivation-shrinks-in-madurai-district/article31063022.ece

316,2020/03/13,COVID-19 | Madurai tourism hit by travel ban,"The lack of inbound tourists from several countries has led to a sharp fall in room occupancy of hotels to merely 30%

Travel bans across the world as a result of COVID-10 have caused a sharp drop in occupancy of hotel rooms in city. They have also placed travel agencies in a tight spot.

Agents and hoteliers say that though there has been a trickle of Indian tourists, there have been few from outside the country. Those wanting to travel outside the country too have been affected, they say.

Treasurer, Travel Agents Association of India, (South Tamil Nadu Chapter) G. Raveendran says that agents have particularly faced the maximum losses this season as outbound tourists have been seeking a full refund for their packages but airlines are refusing to pay back flight ticket charges. “Indian tourists usually travel to Europe and America during the summer. April and May peak months for outbound tourism. Tours to these two countries will most definitely not take place. Lakhs are tied up in these trips,” he says.

Director of Balika Travels N. Sriram says, “While airlines are offering credit time and vouchers to individuals to reschedule their travel within 10 months of the date of issue of the ticket, few are willing to accept the option. Airlines are unwilling to consider the provision of credit vouchers for group bookings. Customers are vehement about full refunds. We are unsure about what to do,” he says.

The lack of inbound tourists from several countries has led to a sharp fall in room occupancy of hotels to merely 30%, which until last week was averaged at about 60%, says a hotelier.

President, Travel Club Madurai, Chitra Ganapathy, says that most tourists from South East Asian countries like Malaysia and Singapore and non-residential Indians from abroad usually arrive in groups around this time.

“Even though there have not been any reported cases in Madurai, most of the stopover cities have been affected,” she says. She adds that walk-ins to restaurants too have significantly dropped.

Director, Fortune Pandiyan Hotel, G. Vasudevan, says that a number of people have also cancelled their meetings and conferences at banquet halls.

“Everyone is afraid and is considering travelling as a risk, particularly since nearby States like Kerala and Karnataka have been affected. We hope that the problem only lasts for a month as the operational cost of running a hotel continues to remain the same,” he says.

A press statement from the Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, the most frequented tourist site in Madurai, has asked those with symptoms of COVID-19 to refrain from entering the temple. “Those who show symptoms are advised to visit a medical facility. In case someone with the symptoms arrives, the temple will provide masks,” the statement reads.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/la9fo8/article31062637.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA14CITY-TIRUMALAINAYAKPALACE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/covid-19-madurai-tourism-hit-by-travel-ban/article31062638.ece
317,2020/03/13,HC wants an amended final report on Sri Lankan duo case,"Madurai

Continuing to hear the case of the Sri Lankan duo, who clandestinely entered and exited India, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday sought an amended final report from the police, filed against the five men who helped them escape.

A Division Bench of Justices P.N. Prakash and B. Pugalendhi directed the police to include Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code for abetment of an offence. The five men were arrested by the Pamban police for helping the Sri Lankan duo — Sanga Sirantha and Mohammed Saffras — sail back to the island nation.

Last year, Sanga Sirantha and Mohammed Saffras, with criminal records back home, had escaped to India to evade arrest by the Sri Lankan authorities. They were then arrested by the Ramanathapuram police for entering India without valid documents.

Subsequently, they were remanded in judicial custody and their bail petitions dismissed by the High Court. Later, in order to facilitate their deportation, the case pending against them before the Judicial Magistrate was withdrawn.

However, the order of the Judicial Magistrate was misconstrued by the Puzhal prison authorities, where the duo had been lodged. After their release from the prison, the duo, with the help of the five Indians, escaped to Sri Lanka.

Earlier, the High Court had taken a serious view as to how such men with criminal antecedents had clandestinely entered and exited India. The Judicial Magistrate, police officials and the prison authorities were summoned by the court.

In a subsequent development, the Court was informed by the Centre that Sri Lankan authorities had confirmed that the duo had surrendered before the Colombo Chief Magistrate. The State on its part submitted that an investigation in the case was on and the five men who helped them were arrested.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-wants-an-amended-final-report-on-sri-lankan-duo-case/article31062540.ece

Two youth, who had been admitted to the COVID - 19 isolation wards of the Tirunelveli and Kanniyakumari Government Medical College Hospitals have been discharged after they tested negative for the deadly infection.

While the youth undergoing treatment at the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital was discharged on Friday night, another young patient admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital at Aasaripallam was discharged on Friday.

The 27-year-old youth from Chokkampatti near Kadayanallur in Tenkasi district, was admitted to the isolation ward of Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital on Monday last after he developed fever, cold and cough on his return to his native place from the Middle East. Though he was asymptomatic for the dreaded infection and responded well to the treatment given for other viral infections, the blood samples were sent to Chennai for analysis.

When the reports were negative, he was discharged on Thursday night.

“Now, a 40-year-old Malaysian, with a history of uncontrolled diabetes, has been admitted to the isolation ward with fever. Since he is also responding to the treatment with the diabetes under control, he may be discharged on Saturday,” M. Ravichandran, Dean, TVMCH, said.

A 26-year-old youth, who had returned to his native place near Nagercoil from Oman volunteered to be admitted to the Government Medical College Hospital at Aasaaripallam. Since clinical investigations showed that he was fine and tested negative for COVID - 19, he was discharged on Friday.

Chairing a meeting in Thoothukudi on Friday with doctors from private and government hospitals, Collector Sandeep Nanduri said patients suffering from fever, cold and cough after returning from foreign trips should be screened thoroughly and should be referred to the government hospitals immediately.

If they were tested positive for COVID – 19, they should be admitted to the isolation ward which should be created in all private hospitals as has been done in the government hospitals, he pointed out.

322,2020/03/13,Police to avoid using breath analysers following COVID-19 scare,"Instead they will refer drunk drivers to hospital

Following COVID-19 scare, Madurai City Traffic police have been asked to not use breath analysers to check whether any vehicle user is drunk in order to safeguard the police personnel from a potential threat of getting infected, Commissioner of Police S. Davidson Devasirvatham has said.

Speaking to the media after distributing ₹ 14 lakh worth torch lights, beacon lights, portable public address systems to the police personnel here on Friday, Mr. Devasirvatham said that instructions had already been issued to the traffic police against using the device as a precautionary measure.

The traffic police have been using the device to detect whether a motorist is drunk. The suspected vehicle rider/driver is asked to blow air into a pipe with his/her mouth and the device indicate the level of alcohol in the blood.

If the blood alcohol content is 30 mg per 100 ml of blood, the road user would be charged of drunk driving or riding.

“The reading of the device is legally permitted evidence in the court. However, following the Commissioner’s directive, all the 18 breath analysers have been withdrawn from the police teams. Hereafter, suspected drivers would be taken to government hospitals for medical test to detect whether they were drunk,” a traffic police officer said.

The lights and mega phone procured under Road Safety Funds were distributed to various police stations. “We have got another ₹ 48 lakh Road Safety Funds with which we are planning to provide signals and for other purposes,” Mr. Davidson said.

The city police have got 12 new SUVs, two buses, one tempo van and 23 motorbikes.

All Women Delta team

The Commissioner said that a special all-women Delta team would be soon formed to deal with women-related issues on the roads.

“This team would visit bus stops and other crowded places and take up eve-teasing and other women-related problems,” he added.

With regard to antisocial activities, Mr. Davidson said that over 1,600 persons were bound under Sections 109 and 110 of Code of Criminal Procedure seeking security for good behaviour.

“This is an effective legal provision to keep people with criminal background under check. Eight such persons, who violated the bond condition, were jailed,” he said.

The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Friday imposed a cost of ₹ 50,000 on a petitioner for falsely claiming that his mother, a ward councillor and member of the ruling AIADMK, had been abducted by members of a rival group.

A Division Bench of Justices P.N. Prakash and B. Pugalendhi imposed the cost on petitioner, R. Vimaleswaran. The court was informed that the woman had been to a relative’s house and she was not abducted.

Vimaleswaran of Bodinaickanur in Theni district said that his mother was elected as ward councillor in the recently held rural local body election and after the win, she had filed her nomination for the post of Chinnamanur panchayat union chairman.

The election, which was postponed due to clashes between the ruling and the rival party members, was finally scheduled for March 4. Under these circumstances, the petitioner claimed that his mother went missing on March 3. He alleged that she had been abducted.

Earlier, the court had restrained the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman from continuing in their respective posts and directed the Theni police to trace the woman. But, with the allegation of abduction turning out to be false, the court vacated the interim order. The court directed the petitioner to pay a cost of ₹ 25,000 each to the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the Chinnamanur panchayat union.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-imposes-cost-on-petitioner/article31062055.ece

Using a nuanced teletherapy machine, doctors at Harshitha Hospitals here have begun providing radiation therapy for patients.

Director C.N. Ilankumaran, showing the hospital’s new machine Bhabhatron 2, said the equipment uses Cobalt 60, a radioactive form of cobalt as its source of radiation. The machine had been made in India and installed at a cost of ₹ 8 crore, he said.

“It reduces the treatment time and the cost significantly and targeted treatment of cancerous cells is possible,” he said.

“While radiotherapy is usually priced at ₹ 1 lakh, using teletherapy machines cost only ₹ 50,000. The amount of time for treatment has also been reduced from 30 minutes to 10 minutes now,” said P. Rajmane, a senior doctor.

Dr. Ilankumaran said that earlier Cobalt 60 was used for radiotherapy but that was in its two-dimensional form. “With advancement, we can provide three-dimensional treatment which is the need of the hour in today’s times,” he said.

327,2020/03/13,Solution eludes subway issue at Vadapalanji,"Stiff opposition from villagers has stalled work on the subway near Madurai Kamaraj University for the past two years

At Tirunagar-Palkalai Nagar Road opposite Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) in Nagamalai Pudukottai a crisis is brewing. Work on a limited use subway on the road near Vadapalanji railway station – around 70% of work is completed here – has been halted for about two years owing to stiff opposition from villagers.

With inspection of the newly laid broad gauge railway line between Madurai and Usilampatti having been done, train services up to Bodinaickanur is expected to start after the completion of the remaining work. While the railways hopes to complete the construction of the remaining portion of the subway to commence train services as per schedule, the villagers demand a manned level crossing.

According to a railway official, the construction of this limited use subway is part of a larger scheme to eliminate unmanned level crossings throughout the country. The subway will be 200 metres long and will have two boxes of 4.5-metre width each. The project is estimated to cost ₹2.5 crore.

The road is crucial as it connects about 20 villages, including Vadapalanji, Thenpalanji, Manapatti, Saakklipatti, Vedar Puliyankulam and Thanakkankulam. It also links the Madurai-Kochi National Highway with Thoppur-Samayanallur four-lane ring road stretch

Every day, hundreds of vehicles cross the railway track. A number of college buses also use this road as Senthamarai College of Arts and Science is situated on this road.

M. Rajangam, a resident of Nagamalai Pudur on the south side of the railway track, says that for many years, schoolchildren and residents have been coming to the highway to board buses. Currently, people use a temporary road next to the incomplete subway to reach their villages.

The railway official says work on the limited use subway began in June 2017. “By August 2018, nearly 70% of the work was completed on the northern side. It was then the villagers started opposing the project and asked us to stop it,” he says.

The efforts of the district administration and railways to bring about a change of mind in the villagers have turned futile even after two peace committee meetings.

The villagers feel the subway would not be safe for pedestrians, especially at night, says Mr. Rajangam.

A. Puliamma, 50, a daily wager worker from Vadapalanji, says, “Hundreds of women, who are daily wage workers, usually walk home late in the night. We are concerned about the safety of our daughters,” she says.

Adding to this is the problem of water stagnation, says M. Rajagopal, another resident. “For over a year now, rainwater is stagnating at the partially-constructed subway. It has turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes. If this situation continues even after the completion of the subway, it will cause serious problems, especially during emergencies. In such a scenario, it will become impossible for vehicles to cross the subway,” he says.

Since the area has hard rock, explosives will be used to blast them during construction of the subway. With the presence of houses and shops in the vicinity, villagers are afraid it may damage them.

But, the railways has solutions to all these issues, says a senior official. “If there is a request, we can provide a foot overbridge in addition to the limited use subway as a measure to beef up security. Also, we have a collection well near the subway to pump out water. This will prevent water stagnation,” he says.

The official also assures that low intensity explosives will be used in a safe manner during construction. “As per norms, we cannot have a manned railway crossing here. Since there is a heavy traffic flow at this spot, a manned railway crossing is also not an advisable option,” he says.

Divisional Railway Manager V.R. Lenin says their officials have written to the district administration to help explain the need for the subway to the villagers so that the work could resume. Collector T.G. Vinay says having a subway is absolutely necessary there.

“We will convince the residents and try to expedite the work,” he says.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/qy15u3/article31057009.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MACITY-SUBWAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/solution-eludes-subway-issue-at-vadapalanji/article31057010.ece
328,2020/03/13,"Disburse crop insurance soon, say maize farmers","A section of maize farmers from Peraiyur taluk, who are members of an association, petitioned the Collector here on Thursday, demanding faster disbursal of crop insurance pending for the year 2018-2019.

O.A. Narayanasamy of the association said the delay had affected about 7,000 farmers in the taluk.

“Due to water shortage and Fall Armyworm attack, more than 50% of the maize crop got damaged in 2018- 2019. A farmer had to suffer a loss of ₹20,000 for every acre of the crop,” Mr. Narayanasamy said.

Subsequently, farmers had to pledge their gold jewellery or borrow money on high interest to start cultivation for the next year. “Compounding the woes, traders have drastically reduced the prices of maize to a meagre ₹1,400 a quintal this year. Hence many farmers have a large stock of maize with them. Maize farmers are facing a major crisis,” he said.

Mr. Narayanasamy also added that farmers had paid a premium of around ₹300 for each acre of maize crop under Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.

“Crop insurance has been paid to farmers in other districts. Hence, they must disburse the dues quickly and help the farmers here,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/disburse-crop-insurance-soon-say-maize-farmers/article31057004.ece

Total wholesale dispatches of vehicles slumped 45% to over 10.50 lakh units in March 2020 as manufacturers halted production and sale in the last week amid the nationwide lockdown due to the outbreak of coronavirus.

The automobile industry had dispatched over 19.08 lakh units to dealers in March 2019, as per data released by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). Production of vehicles across segments also fell by 33.6% to about 14.47 lakh units during the month as compared to over 21.80 lakh units in March 2019.

“The month of March 2020 was one of the most challenging months for the auto sector as the 21-day lockdown resulted in bringing the production and sales of vehicles to a standstill in the last week. As the revenues took a severe hit, the OEMs struggled on meeting fixed cost and working capital requirements,” Rajan Wadhera, President, SIAM, said.

Stating that before the lockdown the industry was already reeling under severe degrowth and pressure of disrupted supply chain, Mr Wadhera said that the auto industry is losing an estimated Rs 2,300 crore in production turnover for each day of closure.

As per the SIAM data, wholesale sale of passenger vehicles in the country stood at over 1.43 lakh units last month, down 51% from over 2.91 lakh units, while production of these vehicles fell 38.14% to 2.07 lakh units from 3.34 lakh units.

While domestic sales of cars fell 52.12% to 85,229 units, that of utility vehicles and vans declined 44.67% to 51,569 units, and 69.88% to 6,216 units, respectively.

For commercial vehicles domestic sales nosedived 88.05% to 13,027 units from over 1.09 lakh units, while production was down 82.88% to 18,057 units from over 1.05 lakh units in March 2019.

As per the data, sale of two-wheelers fell nearly 40% to over 8.66 lakh units as against 14.40 lakh units in the year-ago month. Production was down by 28.21% to 11.61 lakh units, down from 16.18 lakh units. While sale of scooters fell 32% to 2.63 lakh units, sale of motorcycles was down 41.89% to 5.70 lakh units during the month under review.

“The auto industry is engaged in a dialogue with the government on policy measures which could minimize the impact of COVID on the Indian economy and especially the Indian automobile industry. There would be challenges on the supply side; demand side and also on the issue of availability of finance which would all need to be addressed to bring back growth in the sector,” Mr Wadhera added.

“The automotive sales numbers for March have dipped significantly and with the harvest festival lost during the lockdown, April numbers are also set to be very low. Therefore, it is imperative to restart controlled operations across the automotive value chain from plants to dealerships by laying out guidelines for safe working e.g. in-plant stay of workers, only home delivery of vehicles, etc. Given the huge multiplier effect of the auto industry, this may well be one of the most effective ways to restart the economy,” Ashim Sharma, Partner & Group Head at NRI Consulting & Solutions told The Hindu.

For the full year 2019-20, total domestic vehicle sales stood at over 2.15 crore units, down 18% from more than 2.62 crore units dispatched in March 2019. Passenger vehicle sales last year fell 17.82% to over 27.75 lakh units, while that of commercial vehicles was down 28.75% to over 7.17 lakh units.

Retail inflation based on the Consumer Price Index slowed to 6.58% in February, while the industrial production growth as measured in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) quickened to 2% in January amid subdued performance by the manufacturing sector, official data released on Thursday showed.

Retail inflation, which was 7.59% in January 2020 and 2.57% in February 2019, slowed mainly due to easing food prices. Inflation in the food basket was 10.81% February 2020, lower from 13.63% in the previous month, as per data from Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.

The government has mandated the central bank to keep inflation at 4% with a margin of two percentage points on on either side.

“The moderation in inflation has expectedly been led largely by food inflation while core inflation remains muted amid tepid demand,” Upasna Bhardwaj, Economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank said. “We expect the inflation trajectory to continue to moderate going ahead led by deflationary trends from falling crude oil prices, lower food prices and weak demand.”

She added that with domestic and global growth expected to face downside risks from the spread of COVID-19 and deflationary forces emerging, “we see room for up to 50 bps of rate cut by the MPC, with any further easing contingent on the evolving growth environment.”

The IIP had accelerated 1.6% in January 2019. For January 2020, official data showed that the mining sector output grew 4.4% against a rise of 3.8%, manufacturing output rose 1.5% compared with 1.3% in the year-ago month, and electricity generation rose 3.1% versus 0.9% in January 2019.

The Dow suffered its worst session since 1987 Thursday, plunging 10 percent as emergency measures by central banks failed to douse mounting recession fears due to the coronavirus.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down around 2,350 points, or 10 percent, at 21,200.62.

The broad-based S&P 500 plunged 9.5 percent to 2,480.64, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 9.4 percent to 7,201.80.

Thursday's session means the S&P 500, like the Dow, is now in a “bear market,” a drop of more than 20 percent from a market peak, ending the longest “bull market” in history.

“Bottoming is a process, it's not a one-day process normally,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist for Prudential Financial.

“Now the idea of a recession is part of the narrative. Are we going into one? And if we are, how deep will it be? Will we have a recovery in the second half?”

Stocks were deep in the red the entire session, which was paused for 15 minutes early in the day after the S&P 500's losses hit seven percent, triggering an automatic suspension.

Equities briefly cut their losses after the New York Federal Reserve announced measures to inject an additional $1.5 trillion in cash into financial markets this week.

But the bounce proved short-lived. Emergency measures announced by the European Central Bank also did little to reassure investors in Paris and Frankfurt, where bourses lost more than 12 percent.

While President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats sparred over details in a stimulus package, investors absorbed a running stream of announcements of major event cancelations and other economic dislocations.

Major League Baseball postponed its season by at least two weeks, while New York banned events with more than 500 people as the Broadway League announced theaters would be shut for a month.

President Donald Trump's shock announcement to bar travel from Europe for 30 days battered airline and travel stocks, with Delta Air Lines and United Airlines each losing more than 20 percent.

The bleak outlook for airlines also again weighed on Boeing, which plunged 18.1 percent, making it again the biggest loser in the Dow.

Restaurant stocks were another big loser, with Darden Restaurants and Brinker International down around 15 percent or more.

339,2020/03/13,Parley | Should distressed private banks be saved by PSBs?,"It should be the last resort, but right now, the government is facing severe fiscal constraints

A day after the government imposed a moratorium on the financially troubled Yes Bank last week, the Reserve Bank of India announced a draft restructuring plan that entails the State Bank of India acquiring a 49% stake in the private lender. In a discussion moderated by Suresh Seshadri, T.T. Ram Mohan (Professor, IIM, Ahmedabad) and Ananth Narayan (Professor of Finance, SP Jain Institute of Management and Research) examine whether the proposed bailout is warranted and what lies ahead for the wider financial sector. Edited excerpts:

Is a bailout of a failing private lender by a public sector bank justified? And if so, on what grounds?

T.T. Ram Mohan: It’s not the best option certainly. I think the first option should always be to have a private investor come in and infuse his capital into the private bank. The RBI did give some time to the Yes Bank management to work out such an arrangement but evidently that did not succeed.

The next option then, the straightforward option, would have been for the government to simply nationalise Yes Bank. And as you know, that’s exactly what happened during the global financial crisis with innumerable private banks all over the world.

But here the government is facing severe fiscal constraints. And also, it is finding it very difficult to infuse money into its own public sector banks. That perhaps explains the reluctance of the government to nationalise Yes Bank. So, what we have is really something that should be the very last resort, which is getting a public sector institution, a public sector bank, SBI, to lead the rescue.

Why is it that in the case of a private lender, unlike, say, an airline, there’s a reluctance on the part of authorities to let the bank fail?

Ananth Narayan: It’s never pleasant or elegant to see something like this… intervention by the government. But let’s face it, this is an issue of financial stability. Yes Bank was not a small bank. The total balance sheet size was close to ₹3.5 lakh crore, lots of depositors, lots of businesses. And one thing which the Financial Stability Report of the RBI does kind of enumerate is the level of inter-connectedness within the financial services ecosystem. While after the global financial crisis, the idea was always to have no bank which is too big to fail, the reality is the inter-connectedness between banks themselves, banks and the rest of the financial sector ecosystem, including mutual funds, insurance companies, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), etc. And then the inter-connectedness of the financial sector with the real economy is so deep, that you know, what is good in theory would rarely be good in practice. So, I don’t dispute that what the government has done, which is stepping in to try and resolve the Yes Bank crisis, is the right approach. We can argue about what could have been the best approach. In the past, banks such as Global Trust Bank have been subsumed within existing banks, rather than trying a half-way measure as we are doing right now. So we can argue about the right way of doing this and the right modalities of doing this. But some kind of intervention was definitely required.

I will only also add, this isn’t over. While Yes Bank was an immediate problem, which obviously had to be resolved and I’m sure will be resolved, the larger trust deficit in the financial services ecosystem remains. And much work needs to be done beyond this.

Despite the availability of key check posts including Basel III norms, Asset Quality Review (AQR) and metrics to decide whether or not to put a lender into the PCA framework, we find ourselves at the current pass. Is there evidence of regulatory laxity or failure?

T.T. Ram Mohan: Whenever you have a failure like this, there is a presumption that the regulator has not been up to the job. This is something that will have to be looked into. I think the Finance Minister has already asked the RBI to fix accountability for whatever has happened. But it’s not clear to me in what way the regulator can be said to have failed in this particular case. Because they did move in to oust the founder from the bank, sometime in 2018. So that step was taken. Whether any step could have been taken prior to that, I think it’s a matter of guesswork. But what I will say is that the conditions in the financial sector deteriorated significantly post September 2018, when we had the collapse of IL&FS, which is a non bank. And my own view is that that was a serious lapse on the part of the government not stepping in to rescue IL&FS. Because the shocks arising from the failure of IL&FS, the erosion of confidence, and the flight of funds from the NBFC sector, all that we are still sort of experiencing. So, in some sense, it’s not a regulatory failure, or if there’s a regulatory failure, it’s the failure of the RBI to persuade the government to step in, in the case of IL&FS.

Are larger public sector banks, including SBI, being made more fragile by involving them in bailouts of their public sector or private peers?

Ananth Narayan: It’s never good for a bank to have to step in and practically as a last resort have to rescue another bank. I’m sure given the choice, the SBI management would have probably rather not gotten themselves involved in a Yes Bank rescue. But as the chairman and managing director of SBI himself said, when the country’s interests come to the forefront, people have very little choice.

Things are a little fragile for the overall financial services ecosystem. As per the Financial Stability Report, public sector banks have 12.7% of gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as of September 2019. That number could actually be higher if you were to include or remove the kind of forbearance available on some sectors like small and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs] and real estate. Plus, as of September, loans to NBFCs such as DHFL [Dewan Housing Finance Corporation] were actually counted as current. So, accounting for all of that, that number is probably higher, and it’s higher than the rest of the ecosystem. Plus, over the last few years, the government has had to infuse ₹3.5 lakh crore of equity into public sector banks. So, the overall banking system is kind of fragile at this point in time, and it’s clearly burdened with things like NPAs and loans.

I wouldn’t call this particular Yes Bank episode a question as to whether public sector banks are better governed or private sector banks are. I think the reality is that every element of the financial services ecosystem requires governance reforms. Governance is a cross bank and cross institutional issue. It’s not limited to public sector banks or private sector banks or NBFCs; it’s across the board.

Is there a need for some of these metrics [related to the PCA framework] to be recast or reappraised?

T.T. Ram Mohan: The criticism, up to this point, has been that the PCA framework is far too stringent. And as you know, there’s been tremendous pressure on the RBI to get the banks which were under PCA, public sector banks and I think one or two private banks, to get some of the public sector banks out of the framework. Now, if people are arguing the framework is not stringent enough, then that’s an altogether new point that they’re making. In the case of Yes Bank, it did not qualify for inclusion under PCA using the metrics which are applicable and now what people are saying is that the RBI should have looked at something like the rate of growth of assets or the rate of growth of the loan book. And that when there is this kind of aggressive growth, the regulator should be watching very closely. Now that is strictly hindsight. Because part of the reason for a very rapid growth in the loan book of private banks is that the public sector banks have been fairly comatose, there has not been much lending as corporate lending, at least in the last few years, growth has been very tepid. And that space has been taken up by private banks. And the second thing is that a bank like Yes Bank starting off on a low base, high rate of growth would not be an issue. Now, after the event, if we were saying that they were growing at 30-35%, and the regulators should have done something about it, and that the PCA framework should accommodate something like that. Well, I think it’s a bit of a stretch. I would say that matters such as this would fall within the domain of the risk management committee of the board of the bank.

The RBI’s proposal includes a write-off of AT1 (Additional Tier 1)bonds, a move that has prompted an immediate legal challenge. How risky is this whole exercise going to be for the entire financial system?

Ananth Narayan: From what I can see of the RBI circulars, Basel III regulations, as well as the information memorandum relating to these particular AT1 bonds, I think what the RBI has proposed is perfectly legally valid. I understand it’s being challenged in a court of law and you will probably know the result soon enough, but it does seem absolutely within the letter and spirit of the law, whatever has been proposed by the RBI. In fact, one of the information memorandum that I saw for a particular AT1 bond of Yes Bank, specifically says that if Section 45 of the Banking Regulation Act is invoked by the RBI, the bond will necessarily see a full write-down, a permanent write-down of 100%. So, given those kind of conditions, I’m really not sure if bondholders can really contest this. I’ll tell you something, which still is kind of a question mark; any person studying corporate finance is taught that equity is the riskiest instrument, and that subsequent instruments are senior to equity in terms of the risk hierarchy. Having a situation where equity holders are still salvaging something... at a time when AT1bonds are being written down completely is quirky and is something which raises questions. So, at the very least, the people who are subscribing to these AT1 bonds the way they’ve been defined and designed, should have been questioning as to whether these are really senior to equity in terms of risk and should be probably questioned even now as to why those investments really happened.

To your broader question on what the ramifications will be: Look, there’s no question that AT1 investments going forward will be repriced, which means that investors will take a lot more of a hard look at those papers before putting their money into it. In a way, that’s not bad news at all. Frankly, AT1 markets in India were probably being mispriced. There were also instances of mis-selling by some bank relationship managers of AT1 papers to high-net-worth or even middle-net-worth kind of individuals, which is gross mis-selling, in my view. So, while it will be difficult for banks to raise money from AT1 going forward, it’s not a bad outcome in entirety, I think it will be better risk managed, better risk priced, better designed, and there’ll be more checks and balances to ensure that mis-selling doesn’t happen.

One last bit. I’m glad that at least so far, the tier-two bonds and the infrastructure bonds and other senior secured bonds of Yes Bank are not being touched. We don’t know what the final solution will look like. But at the current situation, while we can question as to whether that’s the right outcome for the specific case of Yes Bank, I think it’s the right outcome for the ecosystem as a whole. The last thing you wanted was a broader question mark about the applicability of other senior secured instruments as well, beyond the AT1.

Are we creating a larger number of banks that potentially become ‘Too Big to Fail’ ? The RBI had earlier identified only SBI, ICICI and HDFC Bank as Domestic-Systemically Important Banks.

T.T. Ram Mohan: The systemically important banks are banks which are tracked more carefully and which are also subject to higher capital requirements under Basel III. But that is not to say that banks which are relatively smaller in size, such as Yes Bank, do not pose systemic risk and therefore, should not be rescued. In practice, the threshold for a bank to be considered large enough to constitute a risk to the system is much lower. So characterising a bank as systemically important has more to do with tracking particular banks more carefully. That does not mean that there is no case for a rescue with banks of a much lower size. Even a bank with a size of about ₹2,00,000 crore, if it were to fail today, would need to be rescued. And that way it does constitute a systemic risk.

Are there wider risks to banking stability given the underlying stress among corporate borrowers in a wide range of sectors from telecom to power to aviation?

Ananth Narayan: This is a risk that a lot of us have been flagging for a while now, that there is a trust deficit in the financial services ecosystem which is linked to several stresses on corporate and SME balance sheets at this point in time. As per the Financial Stability Report of the RBI, as of September, the gross NPAs of the banking system was 9.3% of advances. And there are analysts who say that if you include the forbearance available to SMEs and to some real estate assets, besides the fact that some NBFCs were not classified as non-performing in September, even though they subsequently have [become] non-performing like DHFL, the actual number could be higher than 9.3%. The problem really is for NBFCs where the official number for gross NPAs, as of September, was 6.3% of advances. That number doesn’t make sense. NBFCs typically lend to sectors which are riskier than banks. And it does feel like the real number could be much, much higher and mind you, no asset quality review has happened for NBFCs as yet.

Now, the whole edifice of a financial services ecosystem is trust — if people don’t trust the numbers, which are being put out for the asset quality, clearly that has implications for financing, that has implications for the ability and the willingness of people to actually lend and put out money. And this is something which has to be addressed. Eventually to restore trust, I think we have no choice but to actually make a clean breast of where we are in terms of the true asset quality. Which is, where all the ramifications of the stressed sectors including real estate, construction, power, telecom, airline and shipping, maybe even several public sector enterprise loans, will come to the fore. So, alongside that disclosure, if you don’t want the system to actually go through a lot of strain, you obviously require a solution as well. Now, while we have a very good Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and the NCLT [National Company Law Tribunal] process, I don’t think it’s geared to handle the overhang of stock that we have right now of NPAs. We already have more than 2,000 cases pending at the NCLT courts. So we probably require a one-time solution as well to go along with this actual disclosure of the real state of affairs. Absent these two things, and of course, the larger reforms… it is possible that this overall financial services ecosystem remains in a bit of a comatose condition for a long time and that’s terrible news for us. We need our financial system to be able to fund growth; at the moment, that’s not the case at all.

How confident are you about the outlook for the financial system?

T.T. Ram Mohan: I agree the conditions are very challenging, and not just the adverse global conditions. At the moment the stresses within our own financial system have got considerably exacerbated consequent to the Yes Bank episode. We have to see what happens to the attempted rescue. The details of the rescue plan are evolving, even as we speak. It’s not clear what the precise rescue plan is going to be. And so we have to wait and watch and see whether any attempted rescue of Yes Bank has a reasonable chance of success. That is a crucial factor.

But irrespective of how that problem is resolved, the damage to confidence caused by the moratorium, one month moratorium, and the cap on withdrawal of deposits of ₹50,000 cannot be overstated. And I think that is duly reflected in the hammering that several private bank stocks have received over the last few days. It’s also not helpful that the Maharashtra government has made it very clear that none of the State government’s accounts or the accounts of the civic and other bodies under the State government will be left lying with private banks hereafter. Now, I shudder to think of what the implications would be if other State governments were to imitate the State government of Maharashtra, which is highly likely. So we need some cool heads at this point and there has to be coordination between the Central government, the State governments and the RBI to bring about some calm in the sector.

The rescue plan for Yes Bank is a starting point. But there are various other things that need to be done. And let me say that the impending bailout package for telecom is one of the many imponderables in the scenario. But my guess is that whatever plan is announced is going to prove quite stressful for the banking sector.

340,2020/03/13,Coronavirus | The cost of opacity,"It is not data, but lack of transparency and awareness that causes panic during a pandemic

China’s initial cover-up of the novel coronavirus outbreak for nearly a month invited worldwide condemnation. Similarly, there were concerns when the U.S. was reported to be barring leading scientist, Anthony Fauci, from speaking publicly about the COVID-19 outbreak without approval. Dr. Fauci has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984 and has helped combat many novel viruses including SARS, H1N1, MERS and Ebola. Therefore, it is troubling that instead of advocating transparency during a pandemic, the Indian Medical Association (IMA), representing over 3,25,000 doctors, has said that India should adopt the same opaque manner of functioning while dealing with the outbreak.

The World Health Organization (WHO) holds a daily press briefing on COVID-19. It shares data on the number of cases and deaths country-wise every day. The Union Health Minister and the Kerala Health Minister also share data daily, which is commendable. But the IMA does not want the government to share data with the public daily as it says people are “clueless as to what is expected of them” and the release of data daily has “created panic”. However, ironically, it also says that “awareness, self precautions, contact tracing and self isolation are the public health measures required”. Secretary General Dr. R.V. Asokan said to The Hindu that the government should consider releasing data “once in three or seven days”. It should not mention the numbers of those infected, but use terms such as ‘low’, ‘moderate’ or ‘high’ to give a sense of the spread, he said. “Why should people know the numbers? This pandemic will escalate and people will scrutinise the numbers minutely,” he said.

Maintaining trust

While dealing with a public health crisis, especially a pandemic, complete transparency is paramount. It is information that helps build trust in society and puts people at ease. How does the IMA expect people to cooperate, practice self-isolation, and take basic precautions when they are not taken into confidence? As Dr. Anant Bhan, a researcher in global health and bioethics, says, “When the government is transparent, it gives people the confidence that it is in control and is taking all the necessary steps to control the outbreak. The trust factor should not be broken.”

Responses across the world

Many countries responded quickly to the unfolding pandemic. South Korea shared data on the number of cases and deaths even as the numbers steadily increased. On March 5, the U.K. added COVID-19 to the list of notifiable diseases and added SARS-CoV-2 to the list of notifiable causative agents. As a result, doctors are now legally bound to report all cases to Public Health England.

Also Read A swift response and a cover-up

The Indian government has made some efforts to this end but can do much more. It could take a leaf out of Taiwan’s book, for instance. In Taiwan, the public were kept informed about COVID-19 every hour through television and radio programmes. They were informed about how SARS-CoV-2 spreads, the importance of washing hands with soap, when to wear a mask, etc. They learnt about the symptoms and spread of the disease. This helped Taiwan trace contacts easily. People also cooperated in cutting the transmission chain — for instance, parents checked their children for a fever before sending them to school.

The right approach

This is not the first time that the IMA has made an embarrassing statement. Some time ago, it admonished The Lancet for the journal’s stand on the dilution of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Its dangerous advice at a time like this raises questions about whether the IMA and its office bearers are aware of the best public health practices during a disease outbreak, particularly a pandemic. It is not transparency and data, but opacity and lack of public awareness that cause panic. The right approach would be for the government to constantly educate the public on various aspects of SARS-CoV-2 and the precautions to be taken.

341,2020/03/13,What I couldn’t see in isolation,"Some women embrace unjust practices in the name of tradition

When I first arrived at Pottal Pacheri, a village in Madurai district bordering the Watrap hills of Virudhunagar, the women who met me were curious. They had heard that negative news was being reported about a nearby village called Koovalapuram. The news reports were about a room specifically dedicated for women to use during their menstrual cycle. They had seen the reports on WhatsApp and social media, they said.

They asked me why I wanted to know about that one room alone. I told them that I was writing an elaborate article attempting to understand some traditional practices in Tamil Nadu. My answer seemed to mollify them and I was taken to see the room.

I knew, however, that the story was not going to be about women priding themselves on upholding an age-old practice. That was not why I was there. Sometimes, reporters are required to be restrained about their intent when they are chasing a story. Some element of deception is always necessary to get to the hidden truth.

It really wasn’t much of a room. Water was seeping through the roof. Parts of the wall that had chipped off lay on the floor along with soiled mats and animal waste. The women said they had to go to the nearest water tank to relieve themselves as there was no bathroom. Even if 10 women got their period at the same time, they had no choice but to adjust in a space that seemed barely enough to accommodate two. They said they were merely following tradition.

Then came the interesting part. Although to me, an outsider, the practice was blatantly discriminatory, the women I spoke to didn’t think so. They told me that it was an honour to be in the room during their period. They said being confined in that space enabled the birth and growth of healthy children in the village. They believed that if they did not go into the ‘period room’, the other women in the village would not be able to conceive.

One woman, Palaniammal, sought the construction of a ‘period room’ which was spacious, well-lit and with access to a bathroom. She assumed that this demand would form the crux of my article. She told me to tell everyone, particularly senior officers, that the women wanted better infrastructure. She also asked me to highlight how they uphold cultural values.

Instead, I went ahead and reported on how a discriminatory practice excludes women from having access to basic amenities. I wondered briefly later: was that angle not a betrayal of their trust? Was it right on my part to expose their experiences?

I also came across women who had escaped this set-up. Women who had married into these villages said that they travelled to their parents’ homes to avoid feeling isolated. One woman said that she and many others had sent their daughters to hostels so that they wouldn’t have to go through this practice. These women said that this practice filled them with a sense of shame. A natural phenomenon made them feel unwanted and alien. It also allowed the festering of unscientific beliefs — they believed that staying at home would affect child birth.

To end the taboo surrounding menstruation, I believed that the story had to be about discrimination, about the conditions in the room and the experiences of these women. This is why I chose to report the practice in these villages as a discriminatory one. But some women embrace discrimination in the name of tradition. They do have agency and perhaps an outsider is not best placed to judge their ways.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/d1d2yu/article30959281.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ma02Roomjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/what-i-couldnt-see-in-isolation/article31052540.ece
342,2020/03/13,Fighting COVID-19 together for a shared future,"China and India have maintained close communication and cooperation on epidemic prevention

The COVID-19 outbreak is a major public health emergency that is most difficult to contain for China since the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. It is also a formidable challenge to global public health security. Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), China adopted unprecedented, most comprehensive, rigorous and thorough prevention and control measures, which not only protected the health and the security of the Chinese people, but also gained time for global response.

Since the outbreak of the epidemic, President Xi Jinping has personally taken charge of the nationwide response. He has chaired a series of important meetings, passed instructions every day, clearly guided and ensured the scientific deployment of epidemic prevention and control, and enabled the resumption of work and production. On March 10, President Xi went to Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province and the epicentre of the epidemic, to inspect prevention and control work there. He paid respects to the front-line workers and local residents. This has greatly encouraged and inspired the people of Wuhan and the whole nation.

Sun Weidong, China’s Ambassdor to India.

The Chinese government has mobilised the whole nation with confidence, unity, a science-based approach and a targeted response. We focused on the following aspects: first, formulated timely strategies for epidemic prevention and control; second, strengthened a unified command and response in Wuhan and Hubei; third, coordinated the prevention and control work in other regions; fourth, strengthened scientific research, emergency medical and daily necessity supplies; fifth, effectively maintained social stability; sixth, strengthened public education; and seventh, actively engaged in international cooperation.

A resilient country

We are consolidating the positive momentum in outbreak control across the country. In general this round of the epidemic peak is over in China. The progress once again demonstrates the great strengths of the CPC’s leadership and the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics. As President Xi pointed out, China is a resilient nation that has emerged stronger from numerous trials and tribulations. The bigger the difficulties and challenges China faces, the more cohesion and fighting spirit the Chinese nation demonstrates. We have all the confidence, capacity and determination to triumph over the epidemic.

Guided by the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, China is fulfilling its responsibility for the life and health of its own people and for global public health. With an open, transparent and responsible attitude, we have actively engaged in international cooperation against the outbreak, and our efforts have been highly recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the international community.

The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, described China’s sacrifice in fighting and containing the spread of COVID-19 as a great contribution to all mankind. At this critical moment, many countries embodied the spirit of standing together with mutual assistance amid difficulties. Leaders of over 170 countries and the heads of more than 40 international organisations expressed sympathy and support for China. Also, 71 countries and nine international organisations announced the donation of epidemic prevention and control materials to China.

Mutual support

China and India have maintained close communication and cooperation on epidemic prevention and control. In a letter to President Xi, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed support for China. We appreciate the medical supplies provided by India and have helped facilitate the safe return of Indian nationals in Hubei. I am also deeply touched by the understanding and support in various ways from all sectors of the Indian society.

We have been closely following the global footprint of COVID-19. President Xi Jinping has said China will stay in close communication with WHO, share its epidemic control experience with other countries, seek closer international cooperation on medicine and vaccine development, and provide assistance to the best of its capabilities to countries and regions that are affected by the spread of the virus in keeping with its role as a responsible major country.

Reaching out

China has provided various kinds of assistance including testing reagents, remote assistance and medical supplies to countries with a severe outbreak such as Japan, the Republic of Korea and Iran and countries with fragile health systems in Asia, West Asia, Africa and Latin America. We have shared diagnosis and treatment experience and protocols with many countries including India. Recently, the number of confirmed cases in India is increasing. I sincerely wish the patients an early recovery. We are ready to maintain communication with India, share experience in a timely manner, render assistance and make joint efforts to overcome the epidemic.

The impact on the Chinese economy will be short lived and generally manageable. China has a resilient economy with robust domestic demand and a strong industrial base. We will definitely sustain the good momentum of economic and social development and meet the goal of achieving moderate prosperity in our society and eradicating extreme poverty in China. We will also strengthen coordination and communication with economic and trading partners and give priority to the resumption of production and supply of leading enterprises and key sectors that have a major impact on the stability of global supply chains. The fundamentals of China’s economy will remain strong in the long run, and China will remain an important engine for global economic growth.

The history of civilisation is also one of a history of fighting diseases and a great journey of ceaseless global integration. President Xi Jinping has said that to prevail over a disease that threatens all, unity and cooperation is the most powerful weapon. In the process of fighting the epidemic, China is fulfilling its solemn commitment to build a community with a shared future for mankind with its own actions. The world is facing a real threat as WHO characterises COVID-19 as a pandemic. In the face of an increasingly severe situation, China will strengthen international coordination and cooperation, and jointly safeguard our only home, the blue planet, together with the world.

343,2020/03/13,Not a time to panic: On India’s response to coronavirus outbreak,"India must cut the transmission chain of the virus to save its health system from collapse

With the virus galloping to 116 countries/regions causing more than 118,000 cases and 4,291 deaths, as on Wednesday, March 11, the World Health Organisation took the last logical step the same day to spotlight the threat posed by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) — by declaring it a pandemic. The announcement came as no surprise. On Monday, the WHO chief did caution that the “threat of a pandemic has become very real” based on the number of countries reporting new cases. On Thursday, the numbers rose further: 1,27,863 cases and 4,718 deaths. This announcement comes after WHO, on January 30, declared the outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern”. Soon thereafter, it raised the global risk level to its highest — very high. If the spread to more countries and the cases and deaths reported till the third week of February were of concern, it has become alarming since then. On February 22, the WHO chief warned that the “window of opportunity for containing the virus is narrowing”. Unfortunately, many countries did not take the warning seriously; in the last two weeks, the cases reported have increased 13-fold and countries reporting the virus have tripled. Outside China, Italy (12,462), Iran (10,075) and South Korea (7,869) have the most cases. Nearly 90% of cases reported globally are in just four countries and cases reported daily have seen a sharp drop in China and South Korea.

The response to WHO’s new classification should not be one of panic but must instead stir countries into changing the course of the pandemic. While WHO had always asked all countries to take aggressive action in viral containment, it has now become all the more important to take that warning seriously. All countries are required to trace, detect, test, isolate and treat cases to prevent a handful of cases from becoming clusters, and for clusters from becoming widespread in the community and overwhelming the health-care system. Even as India has done well in this by testing, isolating, contact tracing and treating people, it has so far restricted itself to people who have returned from abroad and those who have come in contact with infected people. It may be prudent for India to adopt a more aggressive approach by looking for cases in the community to prevent the silent spread of the virus. In addition, containment measures such as closing down schools and cancelling mass gatherings in enclosed places should be done wherever necessary. Steps such as suspending tourist visas for nearly a month starting March 13 and quarantining Indians if needed are welcome — thermal screening cannot detect infected people who do not show symptoms yet. India should pull out all the stops to cut the transmission chain as its fragile public health-care system will collapse if cases rise exponentially.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/not-a-time-to-panic-the-hindu-editorial-on-indias-response-to-coronavirus-outbreak/article31052802.ece
344,2020/03/13,Danger ahead: On India’s road safety record,"District committees must hold open meetings to better India’s terrible record on road safety

Union Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari has expressed optimism that the significant amendments made to the Motor Vehicles Act have begun reducing the terrible death toll due to accidents on India’s roads. As the prime mover of these changes, he finds the reported reduction in crashes, notably in Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, proof of the law’s beneficial impact. Any reduction in road safety incidents in a rapidly motorising country is encouraging, but the cold reality is that data on those who lose their lives or are incapacitated do not reflect a marked decline. In fact, they underscore the culture of indifference among States. Unlike acute crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has sent governments scrambling to save lives and stop economic derailment, a chronic malaise such as deadly road accidents begets only token measures. What else could explain policymakers tolerating the loss of about 1.5 lakh lives each year since 2015, with the graph rising from 80,888 fatalities in 2001? Small reductions in this infamous tally, which Mr. Gadkari took note of at a transporters’ summit, have little meaning, since they do not represent a trend of targeted reductions. The new Motor Vehicles law does have more muscle in being able to levy stringent penalties for road rule violations — some States are using it — but that is not the same as saying that India has moved to a scientific road system marked by good engineering, sound enforcement, appropriate technology use and respect for all road users. In fact, a World Bank ‘Delivering Road Safety in India’ report is apprehensive that rapid motorisation and more high-speed road infrastructure have raised the risks for road users.

The transition to a professional road environment requires implementation of first-tier reforms that deal with quality of road infrastructure, facilities for vulnerable users and zero-tolerance enforcement of rules by a trained, professional and empowered machinery. A key mechanism of change are District Road Safety Committees, which were enabled even by the 1988 Act, but remain obscure. A mandatory monthly public hearing of such committees involving local communities can highlight safety concerns, and their follow-up action can then be supervised by the Members of Parliaments’ Road Safety Committees, created last year. Here, it is essential to make the Collector, local body and police accountable. Making dashboard cameras mandatory, with the video evidence accepted in investigation, would protect rule-abiding motorists and aid enforcement. To save lives on highways, quality trauma care at the district level holds the key. In the absence of good hospitals and cashless free treatment, no significant improvement is possible in the quest to save life and limb.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/danger-ahead-the-hindu-editorial-on-indias-road-safety-record/article31052803.ece
345,2020/03/13,"Worried citizens cancel wedding, birthday parties","No one is willing to take risks in the wake of coronavirus scare

Popular spots like Church Street and Lalbagh were relatively empty on Friday afternoon and the weekend is unlikely to bring in the crowds as most families are staying at home in the wake of five people from Bengaluru testing positive for COVID-19.

Many people who were preparing for weddings and other functions are making alternative arrangements after Chief Minister Yediyurappa’s slew of precautionary measures. Large gatherings, including sporting events, have been banned for a week, and people have been urged not to conduct weddings and functions with more than 100 people.

Shortly after the announcement, caterers, wedding halls, party planners and other affiliated business owners were flooded with calls from clients. Manasa P. Kumar, a birthday party planner based out of the city, said “Around 30 birthday parties scheduled for March and April have been cancelled. Parents do not want to take the risk of engaging their children in large groups.”

One family in Bengaluru had to cancel their booking with a wedding organiser because it was scheduled to be at an exotic destination in India, and guests could not make travel arrangements. They finally decided to postpone celebrations. However many planners in the city said people had started cancelling functions from last week itself. “The government’s week-long ban has only intensified the trend,” said one planner.

Seetharaman Shetty, Managing Director of Pai Vista Banquet Halls, too, said that there has been a steep drop in the number of bookings from the past week. “Many weddings and other functions have been postponed as guests are wary of travelling from other cities,” he said.

Earlier, a client who had booked a marriage hall for 300 people reduced the guest list to 200. Now, they will either reduce the number to 100 or cancel it. “They said it was because most of them decided to not travel to the city,” he added.

COVID-19 has not only affected functions that were scheduled in March, but has events planned in April. Viveck Bharadwaj, Managing Director of Prratha Weddings, in Bengaluru, said, “One wedding scheduled for May got cancelled because the bride and groom were NRIs, and they could not travel.”

Caterers are worried about the slump. Shivaram, a caterer from Girinagar, predicted that cancellations will only shoot up in the coming weeks. “This will go on for at least a month more,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/worried-citizens-cancel-wedding-birthday-parties/article31062732.ece
346,2020/03/13,COVID-19 | All international passengers to be quarantined for 14 days,"They have to report to health department twice a day

All international passengers coming to Karnataka should be under home isolation for a period of 14 days from the date of arrival in India. They have to call on the toll free helpline Arogya Sahayavani (104) twice a day and inform them of their medical condition.

An order issued by the Department of Health and Family Welfare stated that after the 14-day period, they will enter the ‘reporting period’ where it will be mandatory for them to call Arogya Sahayavani and update them on their health status once a day.

The order also states if any passenger is symptomatic and has fever, cough, sore throat, running nose or breathing difficulty, he or she will be taken to isolation wards in identified hospitals for drawing samples and necessary medical follow-up. This applies to passengers who have come in the last 14 days and those who will arrive in the next couple of days.

While the Chief Minister had initially stated that the mandatory 14-day quarantine would apply to passengers from 12 countries which had heavy incidence of COVID-19 positive cases, it has now been decided to make this applicable to passengers from all countries.

“All the positive cases in Karnataka are from other countries. Therefore it was decided to do universal home isolation for all asymptomatic passengers for a period of 14 days,” the order stated.

The health department has reserved 20 lines of their helpline to receive calls pertaining to COVID-19. Of these, 10 lines are reserved to attend calls from international passengers and to get updates on their health status. They have so far received 19,143 calls to give details on COVID-19.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/covid-19-all-international-passengers-to-be-quarantined-for-14-days/article31062003.ece
347,2020/03/13,Survey on for widening of alternative road to KIA,"Work on it was stuck because of land acquisitions issues

The second alternate road to Kempegowda International Airport appears to be back on track after at least three years. The work on this road between Hennur Bande and Mylanahalli to the airport was in limbo because of hurdles in land acquisition and Transfer of Development Rights (TDR).

“Some villagers were against TDR. We met with them and following a detailed discussion, they agreed to it on the condition that the road alignment will be straight, unlike how it currently is now,” said BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar.

With this hurdle cleared, the Public Works Department is undertaking a ground reality survey and marking the road.

The access road to the airport through Mylanahalli and Begur is two-lane and will be widened to six lanes. The road widening is estimated at ₹20 crore and a proposal was sent to the State government, a senior PWD official told The Hindu. He added that the road marking and survey would be completed in a fortnight.

If all goes as planned, there will be two alternative roads to KIA, via Thanisandra and Hennur. The roads converge at Bagalur and continue to Begur from where motorists can enter KIA.

One alternative road to KIA is already in use by airport commuters to go to areas in east Bengaluru, such as K.R. Puram, Whitefield, Sarjapura, and even Hoskote. By using this road, airport commuters have been able to avoid paying the toll on their way back from the airport.

On the second alternative road, measuring 20.6 km, that will be taken up for widening, 6.8 km comes under BBMP limits. The remaining 14-odd km come under the PWD, the official said.

Recently, the BBMP Commissioner along with officials from different agencies, inspected the alignment of the alternative road to KIA near Mylanahalli. He said in a recent meeting, Chief Secretary T.M. Vijay Bhaskar had directed the BBMP and other agencies to take up the pending road widening and installation of street lights.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/survey-on-for-widening-of-alternative-road-to-kia/article31061869.ece

To curb the spread of COVID-19, all malls, cinema halls, pubs, exhibitions and summer camps in Bengaluru will be closed for a period of one week starting from March 14, 2020.

Briefing the media after a meeting with several departments, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa stated that even colleges and universities will be closed. He said that all IT professionals and those working in AC rooms will also be advised to work from home. He said that all wedding functions and sport activities will also have to be cancelled.

The Chief Minister advised all residents should stay at home and be safe. He also said that a coordination committee had been formed to look into the detection of COVID-19 positive cases across the State. “Private hospitals should immediately reported suspected cases to the government hospitals,” Mr. Yediyurappa said.

349,2020/03/13,Coronavirus | Bengaluru-based software engineer tests positive,"26-year-old techie had been to Greece

A software engineer, who works in Bengaluru, has tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday taking the total number of confirmed cases in Karnataka to five.

The newly married 26-year-old software engineer, who returned on March 6 from his honeymoon to Greece, first landed in Mumbai with his wife to meet his parents who live there. From there, his wife travelled to her parents’ home in Agra from Mumbai.

The software engineer returned to Bengaluru via a domestic flight on March 8. The patient, who stays with his brother in Bengaluru, developed symptoms soon after and self-reported at the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) on March 10.

From there, he was referred to Jayanagar General Hospital, another government hospital that has been designated as an isolation facility and has been admitted there.

“After his return, he went to his office on March 9. Although his office has 154 employees, his contact was with only four colleagues as he was in office for an hour or so. He left his office as he was feeling unwell. We have traced 17 contacts of the software engineer, including 10 members of his family (his parents, brother, wife), and seven secondary contacts. All of them have been screened and are asymptomatic. They are under home isolation,” said Medical Education Minister K. Sudhakar.

“With regard to the co-passengers in the flight, we have informed the concerned airline authorities for a further follow-up. We have also informed Agra health authorities for surveillance of his wife and her contacts there,” the Minister told the media at a press conference on Thursday.

Patients stable

All the five patients in Bengaluru, who have tested positive, are stable and responding to treatment. While three of them do not have any symptoms, the other two have mild symptoms and are being treated, the Minister said.

A total of 18 patients are under quarantine in various hospitals in the State, including 10 in RGICD and two in Jayanagar General Hospital and Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital. Isolation facilities in Hassan, Dakshina Kannada and Ballari have two, three and one patient respectively.

350,2020/03/13,Environmentalists urge KTCDA to cancel MoUs with corporates for lake rejuvenation,"Activists, environmentalists and citizens urged the Karnataka Tank Conservation and Development Authority (KTCDA) to cancel the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) it has entered into with various corporates for the rejuvenation and maintenance of some lakes across the state, six of which were in and around Bengaluru. These include as Doddakallasandra lake, Sarjapura lake and Doddanagamangala lake among others.

At the first-ever meeting organised by KTCDA for residents and stakeholders, attendees brought up complaints and suggestions on ways to improve Bengaluru’s lakes.

Leo Saldanha of the (Environment Support Group) said there was an urgent need for a systematic, scientific approach for the rejuvenation of lakes across the State. Quoting N.K. Patil’s report on lakes, he said that private sector participation would be based on their commercial interests and not in the interest of the lake or its ecology. “This colonisation of lakes by corporates should immediately be stopped,” he said.

In December 2019, MoUs for development of lakes in the city was signed by the State Government, which had also advertised that it was open for CSR funding for rejuvenation and maintenance of lakes.

Environmentalist A.N. Yellappa Reddy criticised the meeting itself as most senior officials from concerned government departments had not attended it. “The Chief Minister is the chairman of KTCDA. I urge him to chair such sessions with secretaries of the government agencies that are even remotely related to lakes. Only then will something concrete can be expected from such sessions,” he said.

He pointed out that lakes in the city were all disconnected and storm water drains (SWDs) were encroached.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/environmentalists-urge-ktcda-to-cancel-mous-with-corporates-for-lake-rejuvenation/article31053592.ece
351,2020/03/13,Trucks stopped from dumping chemical into river,"Alert marshals stopped two trucks from dumping chemical waste into Vrishabhavathi River near Rajarajeshwari Nagar arch on Tuesday morning. The police, who registered an FIR based on the complaint filed by BBMP Health officer Manohar Hegde, are tracking the truck owners.

Mr. Hegde in his complaint said he has instructed the marshals to step up patrolling following a series of complaints from residents stating that chemical effluents were being dumped into the already-polluted river.

While on duty, at around 2 a.m., the marshals caught two trucks dumping the chemical waste. Sensing trouble, the drivers drove away before the marshals stopped them. “However, the marshals managed to take down the registration number of vehicles and reported the matter,” said a police officer.

The dumping of waste into the river is a problem that residents have complained about. In January, residents of a gated community caught a truck driver trying to dump chemical waste.

352,2020/03/13,It’s official: BNP’s eco-sensitive zone reduced by 100 sq.km.,"Centre issues gazette notification; Environmentalists upset

Stiff resistance to the proposal to reduce the regulated buffer zone around protected areas has failed to cut ice with the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF&CC), which has given the green signal to reduce the Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ) of the Bannerghatta National Park (BNP) by around 100 sq. km.

A gazette notification of the ministry dated March 11 states, “... the Central Government hereby notifies an area to an extent varying from 100 metres to 1 kilometre around the boundary of Bannerghatta National Park, in Bengaluru and Ramanagara districts as the Bannerghatta National Park Ecosensitive Zone.”

Elaborating further on the extent and boundaries, it says the area of the ESZ is 168.84 sq km. The first draft notification issued in 2016 had marked an ESZ area of 268.9 sq. km.

“Proposals related to various national parks and sanctuaries were considered by the Expert Committee of the MOEF&CC at a meeting on February 28, 2017 for finalisation of the draft ESZ notifications. Karnataka, without citing any credible reasons, sought a reduction of over 30% of the ESZ area from 268.96 sq.km. to 181.57 sq.km.,” the Bannerghatta Nature Conservation Trust said.

The trust pointed out that in October 2018, the Central government, based on a “diluted proposal” of the State government, issued a second draft notification reducing the area by around 100 sq km.

“The maximum distance of 4.5 km had been watered down to a mere 1 km. A clear analysis carried out by us using high resolution satellite imagery revealed that the reduction in distance of the ESZ was to allow several stone quarries and crushing units to continue,” the trust alleged, adding that despite an Environment Ministry circular in September 2014 clarifying that all development projects located within 10 km of national parks or sanctuaries must obtain the prior approval of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL), activities like stone quarrying, crushing and large construction projects are coming up in the deemed ESZ of 10 km, unchecked and without approval of the NBWL.

In August 2019, the ministry again asked Karnataka to reconsider the 2016 notification. But the State government stuck to stand. Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had stated that many development projects around the BNP had stopped as the NBWL clearance was required for any development activity.

Despite the huge public protest with more than 80,000 citizens of Bengaluru sending their objections to the Centre, and BJP MPs Rajeev Chandrashekar, Tejasvi Surya and P C Mohan, voicing their support, the ESZ has been reduced, they said.

“Bannerghatta National Park’s ESZ area is completely untenable. If in 2016 the proposal to notify 268 sq.km. was justified, leading to the first notification, how is it a problem now? Bengaluru existed even then. Much of the area where the distance from the national park boundary was 4.5 km in 2016, is not towards Bengaluru. It is towards South/South-East which are key corridors with Cauvery North Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu and Cauvery Sanctuary in Karnataka,” pointed out Bhanu Prakash R, co-ordinator, Bannerghatta Nature Conservation Trust, adding that they will take the legal route against the gazette.

Challenge from mining

Forest Department sources said the biggest challenge the park is faced with is from the mining and quarries. “But there is a Supreme Court order prohibiting quarrying and mining activities within 1 km of a protected areas irrespective of the ESZ distance,” said an official.

Residents around the park, who have been fighting against this, said reduction in ESZ will make things “unmanageable.” “We see it as the beginning of the end of the BNP. Thousands of acres of the green belt will now be taken over by the mining and land mafia. A 1 km buffer is nothing to prevent pollution and effluents from affecting the park and its biodiversity,” said a resident, requesting anonymity.

When contacted, Bengaluru Central MP P.C. Mohan said he would “discuss” Mr. Yediyurappa and the Karnataka Forest Minister before taking a call on the next course of action.

Zonal Master Plan

According to the notification, the State Government is required to prepare a Zonal Master Plan within two years “in consultation with local people” and departments such as environment, forest and wildlife, KSPCB, agriculture and revenue “for integrating the ecological and environmental considerations into the plan.”

It says that the Zonal Master Plan “shall not impose any restriction on the approved existing land use, infrastructure and activities” and factor in “improvement of all infrastructure and activities to be more efficient and eco-friendly.”

“The Zonal Master Plan shall provide for restoration of denuded areas, conservation of existing water bodies, management of catchment areas, watershed management, groundwater management, soil and moisture conservation, needs of local community and such other aspects of the ecology and environment that need attention. It shall demarcate all the existing worshipping places, villages and urban settlements, types and kinds of forests, agricultural areas, fertile lands, green area,” the notification says, adding that it should “regulate” development in the Eco-sensitive Zone.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/izct77/article31053454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGBANNERGHATTA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/its-official-bnps-eco-sensitive-zone-reduced-by-100-sqkm/article31053455.ece

355,2020/03/13,Ruhāniyat ~ Kalaiyin Mozhi: a collaborative art and cultural event debuts in Chennai,"With easy collabs and an open plan, a young entrepreneur curates an evening of dance, shopping and comedy

If Gen Z has been a bit of a mystery to you, look no further than Thadam (Footprint) for some clarity. All the performers/presenters at this interdisciplinary arts event are below 23 years of age, with the youngest being 10. The début event of Ruhāniyat ~ Kalaiyin Mozhi, a newly-launched platform to promote upcoming artistes, is the brainchild of Adithi Ganeshan, a first year BCom student of Stella Maris College.

Reaching for abstract

Ganeshan launched her first start-up, Happy Dancing, when she was 17. It was a platform with short dance tutorials. Then came Prospaces, a dance studio. The increasing number of open mics and gigs in the city convinced her that it was time to push the envelope “for more abstract and modern art forms”. Thadam involved scouting talent online for several hours each evening. She then reached out to the 21 artistes invited to be part of the show, to discuss how they could represent the theme within their creative style. A trained Kathak dancer, she too is one of the performers, presenting a piece on the dedication of Indian soldiers.

The lineup is both classical and contemporary: there are not many evenings where you can see a Bharatanatyam thillana on the Dashavatara (by Shruti Umaiyaal), followed by rapper Andrew Jay presenting a specially-composed song bearing the name of the festival in his multisyllabic lyric style. There are also some collaborative pieces lined up. For example, Niranjana Rajan, a law student and make-up artist specialising in illusion and fantasy looks, promises a live demonstration of her art coupled with poetry by Shivam Panigrahi. Stand-up comic Aakash Raja will take on the technological footprint in his set, exploring the humour in his “journey with social media and technological growth”.

Early bakers

Pop-up stalls on the sidelines will offer retail opportunities to the audience. Vinusha Ramalingam, the 10-year-old home baker behind Four Seasons Pastry, already has a following in Chennai. She presents, among other goodies, her signature cupcakes associated with the seasons and its colours. Meanwhile, Sindhuja Sridhar will showcase her eponymous clothing line. Also the creative lead of Ruhaniyat and responsible for the look of Thadam, she has dreamed of a life in fashion. At the age of eight, she was already “drawing clothes and selling them to classmates” who would, in turn, draw ‘money’ and pay her with that.

Thadam is a venture that bears the stamp of all those Gen Z characteristics of open-mindedness, easy interfaces with peer-marketplaces and cool collaborations with friends. And this is just the beginning.

356,2020/03/13,90 flights cancelled at Chennai airport in 11 days,"Chennai airport, which usually has about 33,000 passengers travelling per day, looks nearly empty now

With flight occupancy and passenger traffic decreased drastically owing to the COVID-19 situation, it is now known that 90 flights were cancelled at Chennai airport in the first 11 days of this month.

According to officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI), several airlines including Singapore Airlines, IndiGo, Sri Lankan Airlines, Air India, Cathay Pacific, Kuwait Airways, Lufthansa and Batik Air had cancelled their flights to different destinations. Dubai, Colombo, Singapore and Kuwait are among the major places to which airlines had cancelled their flights.

While some of the airlines had informed AAI that the cancellations were due to the COVID-19 situation, many of them have told AAI that the cancellations are due to ‘operational reasons’. But officials say, when flight occupancy is very low, then an airline will suddenly decide to cancel its flight. “For instance if less than half of the seats remain un-booked, then airlines wouldn’t want to waste money on operating that flight and decide to cancel it and cite operational reasons as grounds for the cancellation,” an official said.

Across the country, nearly 500 flights have been cancelled by both domestic and international carriers to many destinations.

Chennai airport which usually has about 33,000 passengers travelling per day looks almost empty now.

Last month, passenger traffic had decreased by 10% but this is likely to be much higher this month. “With so many flight cancellations, naturally, the passenger traffic will be significantly lower this month. Besides, most people are also putting off their travel plans by at least a month,” an official said.

When asked if domestic passengers will be screened, AAI officials said they have not still received instructions in this regard. “If we get these instructions, we will immediately start screening the domestic passengers as well,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/oxgeyv/article31058870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MARTH--AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/90-flights-cancelled-at-chennai-airport-in-11-days/article31058871.ece
357,2020/03/13,Avadi Municipal Corporation installs fountains as part of its beautification initiatives,"The Corporation has also installed over 200 LED street lights and has opened gyms at 17 parks across the locality

As part of its beautification initiatives, Avadi Municipal Corporation has started installing fountains in various places of Avadi.

The Corporation recently inaugurated a fountain with ornamental lighting at its office campus. There are plans to install similar fountains in eight more parks and public places at a total cost of ₹20.8 crore.

Officials of the Corporation said fountains would be installed in many wards, including Paruthipattu TNHB park, near CTH Road Thirumullaivoyal, the junction of N.M. Road and TNHB Road and parks in Paruthipattu and Modern City, Anna Nagar Main Road and Balaji Nagar. Work on the fountains will be completed soon.

A selfie point was also inaugurated in Avadi to promote litter-free zones.

The Corporation has also started implementing various improvement work in its locality. Nearly 210 LED street lights have been erected in various stretches for better lighting at a total cost of ₹2.45 crore. This includes the stretch from Avadi Poonamallee High Road check post to Paruthipattu, and from a portion of CTH Road between Stedford Hospital and Pattabiram.

Residents noted that motorists negotiating the stretches on these arterial roads were vulnerable to accidents due to poor lighting during night hours. These roads serve as the main connection points to many western suburbs.

N. Ravichandran, Avadi Municipal Corporation Commissioner said, “Street lights that were provided on the roadside were inadequate. These LED lights have been installed on the median for better illumination.”

In a bid to encourage health and fitness among residents and children, open gyms have been opened in 17 parks across Avadi at a cost of ₹1.7 crore. “We also provided one-litre dates syrup to 4,700 students in 17 schools recently along with the Lions Dates company under their CSR fund. This would ensure better nutrition among students,” Mr. Ravichandran said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qd26u8/article31058704.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13MARTH-Fountainjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/avadi-municipal-corporation-installs-fountains-as-part-of-its-beautification-initiatives/article31058604.ece
358,2020/03/13,Oppn. fears Centre will take over Anna varsity,"It will remain a State-run institution, says Minister

The debate on demands for grants for higher education on Thursday centred around the Institution of Eminence (IoE) status of Anna University and the nomination of a person of another State to the Vice Chancellor search committee of a State university.

Opposition member and DMK MLA K. Ponmudy asked why the government had nominated Jagadish Kumar, V-C of Jawaharlal Nehru University, who was accused of attacking students on the JNU campus, to the University of Madras V-C search panel.

Higher education Minister K.P. Anbalagan said the Syndicate and Senate members and the Governor-Chancellor appoint a member each to the search panel and the government had no role. Why did the Opposition remain silent when Mr. Kumar was chosen as a search panel member of the Teacher Education University, he asked.

Mr. Ponmudy said there had been no charges against him earlier. But now after the riots on the campus the government should register its objection. He charged that the Central government, with its offer of IoE to Anna University, wanted to divide the university. “I want the government’s assurance that it will be a state University. We divided the university into several zones but retained its name. Now it appears that the central government wants Anna’s name removed,” he charged.

Congress MLA S. Vijayadharini also said the government should retain Anna’s name for the university. The members also raised the fear of the State’s reservation policy of 69% being squandered if the university received IoE status.

Mr. Anbalagan allayed their fears saying the Centre had assured that the university would continue to remain a State-run institution. He said the Chief Minister had formed a five-member committee, which would take recommendations from educationists. “We have no plan to make it a Central university,” he assured the members. The department has allocated money for infrastructure in many State universities but significantly the government arts college of Tiruvottiyur, started by former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, functioning from a dilapidated structure did not find any mention in the announcements.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/bvwf3/article31054222.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THANNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/oppn-fears-centre-will-take-over-anna-varsity/article31054223.ece
359,2020/03/13,360 new vendors to be given space on Marina to set up shop,"Corporation will provide smart carts based on a draw of lots

The Chennai Corporation has decided to permit new vendors to start businesses on Marina beach, and distribute smart carts to them.

According to a press release, the civic body has proposed to purchase 900 smart carts for businesses on the beach. Vendors getting the carts will be classified into two categories. At least 60% of the 900 carts will be allotted to the existing vendors on the beach. A total of 360 smart carts will be distributed to new applicants.

The Corporation will start receiving applications for smart carts on April 3. The last date is April 8. The civic body will scrutinise applications from April 10 to April 15. The applications will be finalised on April 18 and applicants will be selected by a draw of lots. The selected vendors will get a certificate from the Corporation.

“This is likely to provide a fair balance between existing vendors and the new aspirants,” said an official.

Two types of applications with details of terms and conditions, fees, timings, monthly rental amount, maintenance charges and penalty amount have been uploaded on the website of the Greater Chennai Corporation.

“We have invited bids for the smart carts,” said an official. After finalisation of the tender process, smart carts will be allotted as per orders of the Madras High Court.

According to data compiled by Chennai Corporation a few years ago, the number of illegal vendors on the Marina was more than 2,500.

Former Chennai Corporation Councillor S. Mangala Raj said that permission for new vendors would lead to more pollution on the beach. “The Marina beach is already dirty. The permission for more vendors will lead to more civic issues and public health problems. The scheme will be misused by political party functionaries. Most businesses on the Marina are controlled by party cadre,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/l3hhmz/article31054184.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13Marinacol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/360-new-vendors-to-be-given-space-on-marina-to-set-up-shop/article31054185.ece
360,2020/03/13,No need to panic about COVID-19: CM,"1.5 lakh persons screened in State so far

Attempting to allay fears over the spread of COVID-19 in Tamil Nadu, Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Thursday said in the State Legislative Assembly that there was no need for fear, as all those arriving in Tamil Nadu from abroad were being screened thoroughly. About 1.5 lakh persons have been screened so far, he said.

“As for our health department, the best of doctors in India are in Tamil Nadu. Our doctors have administered best treatment to the person who was affected. Hence, there is no need to be worried,” Mr. Palaniswami said in the House.

Replying to Duraimurugan (DMK) over the issue, Mr. Palaniswami said the virus could spread only from those arriving from aboard and hence they were being screened. “All those cleared after screening, are sent home. So, as far as Tamil Nadu is concerned, there is no need for any fear,” he said.

The virus could spread only when those with infection coughed or sneezed or visited crowded areas, he said and added that officials were screening all those who alight from the aircraft. The Chief Minister endorsed the observations made by Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar who replied to the special call attention motion moved by members of the ruling AIADMK and the opposition DMK, the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League.

Advisory to elders

Mr. Vijayabaskar advised against creating panic over the spread of COVID-19 but maintained that people should remain cautious. Those over 70 should be careful, he said. He urged the public not to believe in rumours and instead follow bulletins issued by the Health Department. However, Mr. Duraimurugan said it was the government that had spread panic over the issue and questioned the steps that have been taken in the House to prevent spread of COVID-19. He sought to know why visitors were still allowed when visitors had been stopped in Parliament.

Speaker P. Dhanapal said the House had restricted visitors to the House for the past two days and that precautionary steps were taken. “If there are any specific requests in this regard, those steps will be taken too,” the Speaker said.

Earlier, AIADMK MLA V.P.B. Paramasivam (Vedasandur), DMK MLA P. Saravanan (Tirupparankundram), Congress leader K.R. Ramasamy (Karaikudi) and IUML member K.A.M.

Rajan Ravichandran, chairman of the foundation, stressed on the high prevalence of kidney disease among the adult population. Almost one in 10 persons have reduced kidney function if sensitive tests are done, according to a press release.

Simple screening tests such as a blood pressure measurement and protein leak in urine are important markers of early kidney disease, he said. He also highlighted the importance of consuming less salt, even if blood pressure is normal.

The event also highlighted the need for greater awareness among the younger population on kidney-related diseases and reduced salt intake with posters and video screening of slogans and messages. As the day coincided with the World Salt Week, a sample snack with less salt was prepared and distributed to visitors at a mall. Tips were given to protect and screen for kidney disease.

363,2020/03/13,FASTag to be rolled out across ECR plazas from April-end,"Officials cite delay in arrival of cargo for late implementation; OMR to also move to system next month

The FASTag toll collection system will be implemented at plazas on the East Coast Road, to Puducherry, by April-end. Toll plazas in Uthandi, Mamallapuram and Hanumanthai too will join the system, followed in the rest of the country, and motorists will no longer need to wait to pay cash.

Several tourist taxi drivers had an issue at the plazas since they had FASTag cards, but the system was not in place. “I had not taken enough cash with me, thinking I could use FASTag. Luckily, my customer gave the required cash,” said Raja, a taxi driver, who recently went to Mamallapuram.

Sources in the Tamil Nadu Road Development Company said that there was a delay in implementation of the system due to a delay in the import of cargo. “Our software is ready and only has to be migrated with the NHAI’s. The equipment had to be imported and took some time,” explained an official. Over 10,000 vehicles take the ECR every day, and in the weekends, the number goes up to 13,000 a day.

The official also added that the FASTag system would be implemented on the Rajiv Gandhi Salai from the first week of April. Over a lakh vehicles take the road, every day, and cross plazas at Perungudi, Akkarai Road, Medavakkam Road and Navalur.

Continued benefits

“Details of local residents will be updated into the system, so that they can continue enjoying the present benefits,” the official said. Toll plazas on the 62-km Chennai Outer Ring Road will commence operations only after the implementation of the FASTag system.

FASTag implementation in the State, at 46 plazas under the control of the National Highways Authority of India, hovers around 65%. In the second week of February, it was 66% at plazas under the Chennai regional office (RO) and 60% at plazas under the Madurai RO. This week, it was 62% under the Chennai RO and 58% under the Madurai RO.

A trucker, Janakiraman, said: “Though initially they gave us a 10% discount, it was later withdrawn. But they have retained the two-way charge and deduct only the difference in the return journey, if made in 24 hours,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/micamd/article31054100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THFAST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fastag-to-be-rolled-out-across-ecr-plazas-from-april-end/article31054101.ece
364,2020/03/13,"In a first, man booked as cyber-law offender","He is an engineering graduate from Cuddalore

Sleuths of the cyber crime wing of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) have, in a first, booked a 23-year-old engineering graduate as a cyber-law offender.

He created fake social media accounts in the name of celebrities, befriended women and threatened to upload their pictures on the internet.

C. Vignesh is an engineering graduate from Cuddalore. He was booked under the Tamil Nadu Act 14 of 1982, as a cyber law offender, by Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan.

The cyber-crime wing of the CCB, attached to the Greater Chennai police, has been receiving complaints from women about a person, who, posing as a serial/film actor on social media, threatened them.

A team was formed by C. Easwara Moorthy, ACP, CCB, and G. Nagajothi, DCP, CCB - 1. “During investigation, we found out that the man had created fake social media profiles of film/serial actors. Many women started befriending him, and in due course, he shared his mobile number with them,” said a police officer. The women then shared their pictures with him, and after some time, he would call them over the phone and threaten them.

“He warned the women that if they did not deposit a certain amount in his account, he would edit their photos and upload them on the internet,” said a police officer.

The police started tracing the number from which he sent the messages and made calls. “We also tracked the bank account, and all these led us to Vignesh. He was arrested and remanded in the Puzhal prison,” said an officer.

“People should not befriend unknown persons on social media and share personal details. There are many fraudsters like Vignesh who are waiting for an opportunity to loot gullible people. We have been creating shortfilms to raise awareness on social media safety. We are also planning awareness programmes in colleges,” added the officer.

Pavan Duggal, cyber law expert and Supreme Court lawyer, said social media crimes are prevalent as offenders presume that they will not be caught. “The police should also ensure that they collect sufficient electronic evidence so that the offender is convicted,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/in-a-first-man-booked-as-cyber-law-offender/article31054056.ece
365,2020/03/13,Seven arrested as police bust another loan fraud operation,"₹90 crore, parked in an insurance firm, frozen

Officers of the bank fraud prevention wing of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) on Thursday arrested seven suspects, including three women, for running a call centre and swindling money from thousands, on the pretext of arranging quick loans, based on documents such as bonds and insurance, for a commission. After the raid, the police have frozen ₹90 crore, parked in an insurance firm.

A special team of the police, on Wednesday evening, swooped down on the office, which was functioning under a fictitious name on the third floor of a commercial building. They raided the office for over four hours and rounded up telecallers and the main suspects behind them. They seized hard disks and mobile phones used by the accused.

“When the police officers landed on the premises, the mobile phones there were ringing without a break,” said Additional Deputy Commissioner K. Saravanakumar.

The callers used to entice customers by offering cheaper loans based on insurance documents and bonds. They would claim that they were calling from Goa, Bengaluru and Pune. The callers were also instructed by the main suspects to use fictitious names. They collected money from the customers on the pretext of investing in insurance. In some cases, they swindled money instead of investing as promised. The callers would then avoid calls from the victims who have paid money.

Muni Rathina, 32, came all the way from Hosur to lodge a complain with the city police, after the local police refused to take her complaint. Ms. Rathina said: “Last December, one of the callers promised to arrange ₹10 lakh. First they asked me to pay ₹20,000 for insurance and then ₹20,000 as commission.”

Shivaranjani, 33, of West Mambalam, paid ₹30,000 for a loan. She never got back the promised amount.

Suspected involvement

Four staff of an insurance firm are suspected to have been involved in the racket.

Assistant Commissioner of Police S. Prabakaran said, “More than 10 fake call centres functioning in Chittlapakkam, Velachery, Triplicane, Vepery, Nanganallur and Anna Salai were raided this year. So far, 27 suspects have been arrested. Our operations will continue against the centres and the fraudsters.”

366,2020/03/13,"Bus, train passengers to be screened","Consulates asked to share information on nationals currently in the State

Measures are being taken to screen passengers arriving in Tamil Nadu from neighbouring States in buses and trains, Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam said.

With Kerala and Karnataka reporting COVID-19 cases, he said, “We have been screening international travellers at airports and seaports. There are cases due to internal spread in the neighbouring States. So, Tamil Nadu has to be extra cautious in screening inter-State movement of persons. We have advised for screening of bus and train travellers using thermal scanners.”

He added that work on establishing quarantine facilities in Tambaram and Madurai was on. “As of now, isolation wards have been set up in hospitals. If these quarantine facilities are ready, it will be a better place and more safe,” he told reporters after a meeting with officials of consulates in the city.

Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said the 45-year-old man, who had tested positive for COVID-19, was ready to be discharged after two mandatory tests returned negative for the virus. There are no new positive cases in the State. “However, as Kerala and Karnataka have positive cases, we are very alert and cautious and have taken up surveillance measures in the border districts,” he said.

The department asked the consulates to share information on the respective nationals currently in the State and advise them about the travel advisories and restrictions. They were urged to coordinate with State the Health Department on travel restrictions and to follow stringent sterilisation and disinfection of places.

Hong Yup Lee, Deputy Consul General of the Republic of Korea, said the visa ban was affecting Korean businessmen in the city. “At least 10 small-sized Korean companies are affected. The businessmen were on a business trip to Korea and are unable to return. So, business decisions are not taken and in some cases their signature is needed to disburse salary. We hope the Indian government will show some flexibility,” he added.

He also pointed out the city has 4,000 strong community and is hurt by the name calling by some in wake of the coronavirus.

“Around 1,000 from the community are kids and teens. Some persons call them corona and they are hurt. Most of the people in Tamil Nadu and India are very kind and generous. A few persons doing this is a disgrace. I appeal to them not to do it,” Mr. Lee said.

Beginning Thursday, the court administration has permitted all its employees to flash their identity cards on the machines which record their attendance instead of placing their forefinger on a scanner attached to the machines, to register their presence, date and time when they report for duty.

A text message sent to the employees on their mobile phones on Wednesday read: “As a preventive measure of coronavirus disease, now you can punch your daily attendance through your original identity card in all biometric devices. Any difficulties in the ID card access shall be intimated to computer server room - High Court of Madras.”

A court official said, the machines placed at vantage points at various entry points to the sprawling court campus were capable of recording both biometric data as well as micro chip enabled ID card data. However, ever since their establishment, the employees had been instructed to follow only biometric system.

“Flashing of identity cards was not allowed so far to make sure that the employee concerned is physically present in the court at the time of registering his attendance and does not end up misusing his/her identity card through others. But coronavirus has changed everything and forced us to dispense with the practice,” he said.

An officer added that the relaxation given to the employees was only a temporary measure until the spread of the disease was contained and that the biometric system would be brought back once again.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-dispenses-with-biometric-attendance/article31053895.ece
368,2020/03/13,PIL seeks adequate supply of water to wash hands frequently,"A public interest litigation petition has been filed in the Madras High Court seeking a direction to Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) to ensure supply of water for a minimum of three hours a day since every person would require at least three litres to wash their hands frequently as advised by the government to prevent COVID-19.

Justices M.M. Sundresh and Krishnan Ramasamy accepted a request made by litigant A.P. Suryaprakasam for early hearing of the case and directed their court officer to issue a slip instructing the registry to list the matter at the earliest. In his affidavit, The petitioner, a lawyer by profession, also sought a direction to Chennai Corporation to ensure adequate water and hand sanitisers were made available in all schools and colleges in the city.

Stating that COVID-19 had been characterised a pandemic by World Health Organisation, the petitioner said, all physicians as well as the government authorities had been advising people to wash their hands several times a day to keep the virus at bay. Pointing out that three litres of water would be required to wash hands continuously in running tap water for about 40 seconds, he said, the city would require several million litres every day.

However, unfortunately, at present, metro water was being supplied in the city only on alternative days and people were not able to get adequate water even for drinking and cooking. In such a situation, washing hands multiple times in a day was next to impossible and the government advice cannot be followed unless it takes serious steps to ensure adequate supply of water to every household through pipelines as well as tanker lorries.

He also claimed that 90% of the government as well as corporation schools in the city too were suffering from non supply of adequate water and not even in one school, either the civic body or the school education department had supplied liquid soaps or hand sanitisers to maintain personal hygiene. He insisted that steps should be taken on a war footing basis to ensure adequate supply of water to schools as well as households.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pil-seeks-adequate-supply-of-water-to-wash-hands-frequently/article31053883.ece

370,2020/03/13,How prepared is Chennai to tackle the COVID-19 outbreak?,"Though the Health department is on high alert, experts flag concerns

Every year, Chennai faces one or the other disease; be it dengue, chikungunya or H1N1 influenza. But how well is the city prepared for the COVID-19 outbreak? While Health department officials say they are on high alert and precautionary measures are in place, there are still areas of concern.

As always, the city is at the centre of all the action. Every day, hundreds of passengers are being screened at the Chennai international airport, and presently, over 400 persons are under home quarantine in the city.

Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said like all local bodies, Chennai Corporation has been roped in for precautionary measures. “The Corporation has been asked to ensure that all public places are disinfected regularly and to carry out awareness initiatives among the public, including in slum tenements,” she said.

While isolation wards in government hospitals in the city have been spruced up, she said an additional quarantine facility with all required treatment/ventilatory support would come up in Tambaram, an area closer to the Chennai international airport. “Private hospitals in the city have been asked to pitch in. We have shared the treatment guidelines with them,” she said.

On its part, the Chennai Corporation has asked over 1,000 buildings including shopping malls, theatres and marriage halls to carry out disinfection of surfaces that people touch such as handrails and provide handwash facilities for people. “We have made our team members aware of COVID-19. We have strengthened disinfection measures in all our hospitals. We have sensitised private doctors, hospitals on symptoms of COVID-19 and identification of suspected patients. They should immediately report such patients to us,” a health official of the Corporation said.

The Corporation has earmarked 30 beds at the Communicable Diseases Hospital (CDH), Tondiarpet for COVID-19 in case of an exigency, he said.

No thermal scanner

There are areas of concern starting with the screening at the international airport. Officials said the thermal scanner at the airport is not in use for nearly two weeks now, and health staff utilise “thermometer guns” to check the temperature of passengers. “This is not as accurate as a thermal scanner. There are sufficient number of doctors and paramedical staff for screening passengers at the airport but still there are certain inadequacies. The airport officials still do not provide sufficient number of masks and gloves for the screening personnel,” a source in the Health department said.

A passenger, who travelled from Singapore, had recently shared his experience on social media. He noted the absence of thermal scanners, insufficient stock of self-declaration forms and pens and improper scrutiny of the filled-in forms.

For P. Kuganantham, former city health officer and director of CDH, Tondiarpet, there is a need for both government and private hospitals in the city to earmark isolation wards with negative pressure rooms, and notify the public. Also, more laboratories are needed for testing samples. “The current isolation facilities are inadequate and ill-equipped. We need to improve the existing facilities. Doctors and paramedical personnel should be trained on how to handle patients,” he said. Considering the city’s population, including the floating population, he said an exclusive quarantine facility that could hold at least 4,000 to 5,000 persons should be readied with adequate number of doctors, staff nurses and persons to be involved in cleaning operations.

So how do experts assess the COVID-19 situation? V. Ramasubramanian, infectious diseases consultant, Apollo Hospitals, said there is likely to be an increase in the number of cases for a couple of months. “Local transmission is a strong possibility. Influenza also has symptoms similar to COVID-19 and without testing and confirmation, we cannot differentiate the two. As of now, testing is being done in the government only for those with a travel history to an affected country,” he said.

Italy, he said, has imposed a lockdown and this provides a good chance to control the spread of infection as social distancing is the main means of prevention. In his view, this is what is needed. “Do not panic as COVID-19 has outcomes slightly worse than flu. Individual responsibility is important. If you have fever and cough, please stay at home and do not travel. There should be an increase in civic sense,” he said. He said the hospital was gearing up to set up an isolation facility for COVID-19.

Masks not for all

Masks and hand sanitisers are fast running out in the city; there are complaints of hoarding and sale for higher rates too. But doctors and public health officials continue to reiterate that masks are not meant for all. Doctors in a few hospitals said they were finding it increasingly difficult to get masks for their use. “We are running out of masks and facing difficulty in getting masks for healthcare workers. Persons suspected to have COVID-19, those taking care of such persons and healthcare personnel need to use masks, and not all,” he said.

Dr. Kuganantham, who is the chairman of Indian Public Health Foundation, said with the WHO declaring COVID-19 a pandemic, there is every chance that every country will have the infection because of movement of people. “We have to be on alert. We need to create more awareness in schools, colleges, workplaces and places where people gather,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mbh7go/article31053740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13City-COVIDcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/how-prepared-is-chennai-to-tackle-the-covid-19-outbreak/article31053741.ece
371,2020/03/13,Delhi’s shame is India’s shame,"The riots were stoked by a series of factors, but it is the stark police ineptitude that must cause much introspection

More than 100 days since protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, or the CAA began, and weeks after the worst ever communal riots in Delhi since 1984, questions are being raised as to what went wrong. It is quite evident by now that collective failure lay at the root of what could have been restricted in scope, if not entirely prevented.

The mix that ignited

Some saw in the Delhi riots the shadow of 1984. The comparison is, however, flawed. The 1984 Sikh riots took the authorities by surprise, while the country has been in a kind of ‘slow burn’ ever since the CAA was passed by Parliament in December 2019. Over time, protests against the CAA became larger in scope, specially in urban centres such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, but no attempt was made on the part of the authorities to defuse the situation. A mixture of political insensitivity, deliberate apathy in allowing the situation to simmer, social disharmony, pronounced incompetence of those responsible for law and order, and, above all, a highly polarised atmosphere, helped stoke the embers of conflict.

The statement of Supreme Court judge, K.M. Joseph, that timely action by the Delhi police could have saved lives, set-off a flurry of accusations by others against other organs of the state as well. Even the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court came in for a share of blame, albeit for not intervening effectively to contain the violence. One former Justice of the Supreme Court argued that had the judiciary been more proactive, lives lost in the recent violence could have been saved. The Chief Justice of India, Sharad Bobde, opined that courts were not ‘equipped’ to handle palpable ‘pressure’ being created to somehow step in and prevent violence.

The politics

Sections of the political class seemed to revel in the unsavoury scenes witnessed during the riots. Some leading members of the ruling party, including at least one Member of Parliament and a Central Minister, also engaged in verbal pyrotechnics. Opposition leaders were no less irresponsible. Provocations from both sides of the political divide thus largely fanned the violence.

The Central government demonstrated an obvious unwillingness to step in to quell the violence, despite the fact that law and order in Delhi is primarily the responsibility of the Home Ministry. The Home Minister is reported to have kept himself abreast of the situation in northeast Delhi, but seemed to have done little else. Political analysts have speculated that this may be due to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s angst, consequent on the rebuff it received in the recent Delhi elections.

While the Union Home Ministry seems to have endorsed the muscular law and order tactics adopted by the Delhi police once the riots broke out, what is surprising and unfortunate is that the Aam Aadmi Party government, which had been elected on a promise of restoration of social harmony, and had sought to distinguish itself from the policies followed by the BJP government at the Centre, sat out the conflict, at a time when social harmony was at high risk, and sizeable segments of the population in northeast Delhi were facing extraordinary high levels of risk to their lives and livelihoods. The Chief Minister’s failure to apply the necessary balm to try and contain the situation has certainly stained his image.

Also Read Delhi violence a matter of great shame: Harsh Mander

In security and law and order parlance, intelligence and police constitute the vital last 10%. Compounding the failure of the political and administrative leadership has been the ineptness displayed by the police and intelligence agencies. No agency could have missed the steady build-up — not only of tensions but also of actual preparations for violence — well before the incidents of February 23 and subsequent days (which took a toll of over 50 lives). A mixture of police overreaction (within the precincts of Jamia Millia University) and of police inaction in Jawaharlal Nehru University had already sounded the bugle for what lay ahead. The Delhi police would also, no doubt, have known that the ‘peaceful demonstration’ in Shaheen Bagh was an aberration of sorts, and that they should be prepared for violence once protests spread to other areas.

A lapse

Arguments adduced subsequently that nearly 7,600 members of the Central Forces — Delhi has about 80,000 police officers and men — were deployed to contain the riots, cannot obscure the extent of failure. Preparations for violence and the polarising rhetoric had made it all too evident that violence could be expected. Provocation was there in plenty from both sides. What was unpardonable, however, was that prominent leaders belonging to the ruling dispensation were allowed a free rein by the authorities to vent their ‘bilious views’ in public, which were heavily laced with communal overtones.

Blaming the police is par for the course whenever a major riot occurs. Sometimes the police are taken unawares, but this time the police had ample warning, from their own accumulation of day-to-day information and presumably from central intelligence agencies as well. What then explains police ineptness on this occasion? The Delhi police does function under a kind of diarchy, controlled not by the Chief Minister, but by bureaucrats in the Union Home Ministry, who operate through the Lt. Governor. In effect, no one remains in control. Yet, even this does not quite explain why the Delhi police failed to see what was coming.

Delhi violence | When the Centre cannot hold

The most widely held view is of political interference with actions being dictated by political considerations. If this indeed is the case, it seems to have been a very high a price to pay. Even then, the Delhi police needs to provide a true explanation for their utter ineptitude.

Target for all

The riots in Delhi did not fall into the category of nuclear science. If it were the latter, one could at least have attributed this to intelligence failure. The steady build-up of tension was all too obvious. Areas that needed to be properly screened for the presence of agent provocateurs and trouble-makers ever ready to exploit such situations were known. Even a far less endowed police force, would have been able to effectively handle a situation that has since become a symbol of shame for Indian democracy, inviting the wrath of not only bodies such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, but also allowing countries with little pretence to secular democracy to point fingers at us.

This is hardly a place to discuss modern policing techniques. It is inconceivable, however, that the Delhi police would not have carried out proper data mapping, so critical for efficient law and order management, one which all modern police forces adopt. This is the fundamental basis of all intelligence-led policing today. It is difficult to believe otherwise. Admittedly, however, to use an age-old idiom, there are many ways to skin a cat and, possibly in this instance, the Delhi police were perhaps directed by their political superiors to adopt another tack.

Delhi violence | In times of distress, humanity shines

Delhi’s shame is India’s shame. Trouble-makers taking advantage of this lapse may feel encouraged to try and repeat the same in the future. The Delhi police need to set their house in order for, alongside other police forces across the world, they need to prepare for a future in which technological advances are creating an entire new paradigm of threats. In the age of rampant social media, they need to be ready to deal with the ‘weaponisation of social media’ — this may have already occurred in the Delhi case.

In the era of artificial intelligence, they will also need to prepare for the so-called ‘deception revolution’, including dealing with ‘deep-fake’ threats, where digitally manipulated audio and video material designed to be as realistic as possible, becomes near impossible to separate from the truth. This would create a whole new portfolio of dangers.

As we face untold new dangers, it would be unfortunate that through a combination of factors, including unwarranted interference in its role and activities, India’s law and order showpiece, the Delhi police, is portrayed as inefficient and ineffective, even to deal with a mundane communal riot.

In February, the accused called her and said since she did not respond to their ‘friendship’ advances, they had created a fake Facebook profile with her cell phone number on it. Mr. Khan had also given the victim’s friend’s cell phone number to Mr. Thakur, who sent obscene videos to her friend.

“The victim lodged a complaint mentioning about the obscene video and the fake Facebook profile. We had their phone numbers.

373,2020/03/13,Businessman forged an old cheque to con ₹42 lakh: contractor,"A civil contractor from Koparkhairane has lodged a police complaint alleging that a construction firm proprietor had cheated him of ₹42 lakh by forging a three-year-old cheque.

The complainant, Munyaswami Nadar (56), had taken a loan of ₹2 lakh from S. Jagannathan in October 2016. When Mr. Jagannathan asked for a surety against the loan, Mr. Nadar handed Mr. Jagannathan an undated cheque with ₹2 lakh written only in numerical figure.

Over the period of time, Mr. Nadar and Mr. Jagannath had several dealings. Every time Mr. Nadar borrowed money, he would issue a cheque for the same amount to Mr. Jagannath as surety.

As per the complaint, during every repayment, though Mr. Jagannathan used to give back the ‘surety’ cheque most of the times, some of the cheques were still in his possession.

In January, Mr. Jagannathan approached Mr. Nadar and asked him for a loan of ₹5 lakh. Mr. Nadar told him that he was waiting for a client’s payment following which he would give him the loan.

On February 20, while Mr. Nadar was at his home town in Tamil Nadu, he asked one of his staffers to transfer ₹5 lakh to Mr. Jagannathan’s account.

But Mr. Nadar received a message in the evening that ₹42 lakh was withdrawn from his account. When Mr. Nadar contacted his bank, he learnt that the money was transferred to Mr. Jagannathan’s account.

On learning about the cheque number, Mr. Nadar learnt that it was the same cheque of ₹2 lakh which he had given to Mr. Jagannath in 2016 as surety to which the former had added the digit ‘4’ before the amount and encashed it. “We have registered a case of forgery and cheating. No arrests have been made as enquiries are on,” senior police inspector Suryakant Jagdale from Koparkhairane police station said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/businessman-forged-an-old-cheque-to-con-42-lakh-contractor/article31054515.ece
374,2020/03/13,"Airfares drop by up to 25% owing to COVID-19 outbreak, falling oil prices","Airlines publicise cleaning efforts to stem droput

COVID-19 and falling oil prices have shaved off last-minute airfares on domestic routes by 20% to 25%. Airlines are holding back from increasing fares over weakening demand and are instead focusing on publicising aircraft sanitising efforts to arrest passenger dropout.

On Thursday, IndiGo said it had seen a 15% to 20% decline in daily bookings week on week. “In January and February, IndiGo experienced modest impact from the coronavirus. We cancelled our flights to China and Hong Kong and reduced frequency to certain other south-east Asian markets. This capacity was redeployed in other markets without having a material impact on our revenues. The decline was seen over the past few days, however,” an airline spokesperson said.

Artificial intelligence-based travel app company ixigo said it had recorded a 27% drop in Delhi-Mumbai fares week on week. “Fares between the Capital and Mumbai between March 9 and 11 were available for ₹3,333, down from ₹4,569 on March 7. Similarly, Chennai-Delhi fares had dropped by 22.5% over the past two weeks. However, Delhi-Chennai had seen an increase of 12.29% over the past one week,” said a spokesperson.

The highest fare increase over the past two weeks was of 41.09% on the Delhi-Kolkata sector. “Airlines are clearly refraining from increasing prices at the moment as they pre-empt a weakening of demand on the domestic side. A few sectors have seen a short-term spike in fares this week probably due to Holi travel,” Aloke Bajpai, co-founder, ixigo, said.

IndiGo, in a statement, said it expects its quarterly earnings to be materially impacted. “In addition, the rupee has also depreciated sharply, which will have an adverse impact on our dollar-denominated liabilities,” the spokesperson said.

SpiceJet has announced a spring season sale, offering one-way fares at ₹987 for domestic sectors and ₹3,699 for international sectors like Colombo, Bangkok and Dhaka. The fares also offer a meal (veg sandwich) and a free seat on selective inventory. The four-day sale is on till March 15 for travel till February 28, 2021.

Global impact

Analysts said that on metro routes like Delhi to Mumbai, airlines could cut down on frequency. The International Air Transport Association estimated global revenue losses for airlines of up to a maximum $113 billion, excluding impact on cargo operations. On the international sector, Air India has already curtailed its operations to Rome, Milan and Singapore, in addition to operating smaller aircraft to some destinations like Jeddah.

Online travel portal, MakeMyTrip, said that given the rapidly changing scenario, they continue to monitor the developments closely and will share updates and forecasts based on the advice of government and public health authorities.

Rajesh Magow, group CEO, MakeMyTrip, said the government’s decision to cancel all visas, with a few exemptions, is timely to control the spread of COVID-19 and given the fast-paced developments, it is critical to account for the inflow of persons from 110 affected countries. “So far, there are no restrictions or advisories issued for domestic travel. The period between February till the end of March is typically lean because of the exam season, but we are seeing a demand slowdown for the summer holiday season, especially for international travel. The situation remains dynamic, making it hard to quantify the actual impact on our business and industry,” Mr. Magow said.

Sabina Chopra, co-founder of Yatra.com, said customers are wary of making fresh bookings to the affected locations and airfares to these destinations have dropped by over 40%. “We have received nearly 35% cancellation queries from travellers planning their trips to foreign locations in the holiday season.”

Cleaner aircraft

With the number of passengers dwindling, airlines have taken to publicising efforts to keep their aircraft cleaner. Air Asia and SpiceJet have been sending out mails to customers explaining how their staff is ensuring that the aircraft was deep-cleaned before a flight.

“A basic but more thorough cabin clean is usually carried out at night or when there is more downtime. This includes the cleaning of toilets, wiping down and disinfecting of trays, cleaning galleys, overhead bins and seats, and takes up to an hour or longer,” an Air India official said.

A SpiceJet spokesperson said all international flights were treated with disinfectants after passenger disembarkation. “Extensive deep cleaning ofi all flights s done during the night halt of aircraft,” he said.

As per a Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) directive, a special advisory has been released on dos and don’ts for all ground personnel and staff at check-in counters. Those who handle boarding cards and are in direct contact with passengers have been advised on regular use of sanitisers. “All staff entering the aircraft have to be provided with masks and gloves to ensure their own protection against COVID 19,” a senior DGCA official said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/airfares-drop-by-up-to-25-owing-to-covid-19-outbreak-falling-oil-prices/article31054474.ece
375,2020/03/13,PMC Bank fraud: 3 more in EOW net,"Agency’s inquiries estimate bank’s unpaid debts at ₹4,635.62 crore; total number of arrests reaches 15

The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police on Thursday made three more arrests in connection its investigations into the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank fraud, bringing the total number of arrests to 15.

The EOW has been investigating the alleged malpractices by the bank’s officials in granting large amounts of money in loans to the Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited (HDIL) Group and doctoring its books to hide the fact when the loans became non performing assets (NPAs). The EOW’s inquiries so far estimate the unpaid debts at ₹4,635.62 crore.

According to EOW officers, the three have been identified as Jasvinder Singh Banwait, Vishwanatha Prabhu, and Govind Jere. Mr. Banwait is a former director of the bank, while the other two work with Yardi Prabhu Consultants and Valuers, and were valuers of the PMC Bank for several years.

“Mr. Banwait has served as a director and a member of the loans, investment and executive committee of the PMC Bank. He was questioned about the loans granted to HDIL and what efforts were made to recover the outstanding loans,” an officer said.

Meanwhile, Mr. Prabhu and Mr. Jere were quizzed about the inconsistencies that came to light in the EOW’s own evaluation of the bank’s assets in 2012 and 2015, and the evaluation submitted by the duo.

“Inquiries revealed that the duo deliberately presented inflated valuations of the bank’s assets to maintain its capital adequacy. As per the rules set by the Reserve Bank of India, every bank needs to have a specific amount of capital available at its disposal to deal with any crisis, like a large loan turning into an NPA,” the officer said.

The trio were questioned about their roles in the fraud and when none of them could provide satisfactory replies, they were arrested. After being produced in court, they were remanded in police custody till March 16.

The EOW had earlier arrested 12 people, including high ranking members of the PMC Bank’s board of directors, and Sarang and Rakesh Wadhawan, the promoters of HDIL.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/y4kizo/article31054488.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMHDIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pmc-bank-fraud-3-more-in-eow-net/article31054472.ece

Mumbai has been declared the most forgetful city in the country in the fourth edition of Uber’s Lost and Found Index. The city was followed by Kolkata and Prayagraj on this year’s list with Bengaluru, the leader of the last three editions, being ranked five.

The index said phones continued to be the most forgotten item, followed by camera and bag. The list also included a series of quirky items that people had forgotten, like an Acrylic artificial tooth, mangoes, kitchen tawa, teddy bears, kids’ tricycle, tambola game, and AC remote.

The report said Fridays, followed by Thursdays, were two days which had the highest number of objects left behind by Uber users. It also said Uber users were the most forgetful at 2 p.m., and August 3 was the day that saw the highest number of objects left behind in cabs. The top five days when people left behind their personal objects were in June and August.

The index further said people were most likely to forget a guitar on Saturdays and Sundays, their business card holder on Mondays and Fridays, and lunch on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.

“Backed by rider insight and captivating data, the Lost and Found Index aims to educate riders in a fun yet informative manner about Uber’s in-app options available to them at the tap of a button, in case they lose or forget something in their Uber during a trip,” an Uber spokesperson said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbaikars-most-forgetful-uber-data/article31054457.ece

To curb the spread of novel coronavirus, some top schools in the city on Thursday decided to suspend classes, while others said they would close early for their spring break.

South Mumbai’s Cathedral and John Connon School sent out a circular on Thursday saying that “the school has decided to enter a state of lockdown starting from [March 13 to March 31]. All classes and activities will be suspended and no extra classes in either curriculum will be held on our premises during this period”.

School principal Meera Isaacs said the only exceptions to this will be students appearing for the ICSE and ISC board exams and the IB Class XII mock exams. “Our IB Class XII calendar remains unaltered and the students are expected to follow the schedule already shared with parents,” she said.

The Utpal Shanghvi Global School cited the positive cases reported from the western suburbs as the reason to keep the school closed for two days as a “proactive precautionary measure”. The circular also said students will have homework coming their way through Skolaro, an online school information management software.

Dhirubhai Ambani International School and Oberoi International School said they are closing earlier than scheduled for their spring break, from Friday.

Rustomjee International School also declared an early summer break for Classes I to IX starting Friday. A circular from the school said, “With final exams being cancelled for Grades 1 to 8, grade promotion decision will be based on the average score of the previous exams conducted during the academic year. For Grade 9, we are working out the details of conducting the exams.”

378,2020/03/13,Hit-and-run accidents claim 3 lives,"Two killed at Panvel on the night of Holi, another in Vashi

In a span of three days, three people died in hit-and-run accidents in Navi Mumbai.

Kishor Mokal (38), a resident of Rave village in Panvel, was found dead at Karnala on Panvel-Goa road.

Mokal, a Ganapati idol sculptor, had left home after 6 p.m. on Tuesday after playing Holi. His brother Kiran, in his complaint registered on Wednesday with the Panvel Taluka police station, said when his brother did not reach home till late night, the family started looking for him in the areas nearby.

At the same time, a family friend, Sopan Patil, saw a photo of an accident victim in a WhatsApp group. The photo was being circulated as that of an unidentified person. Mr. Patil sent the photo to the complainant who confirmed it to be his brother, and went to Panvel rural hospital.

The same night, Shrikant Bhivaji Patil (33), a resident of Akurli village in Panvel, was mowed down by an unidentified vehicle on JNPT-Palaspe bypass road. Mr. Patil worked with Gurukrupa Transport at Uran and on Tuesday night, while he was returning from work on his motorcycle, an unidentified vehicle mowed him down. A case has been registered with Panvel City police station.

In the third incident, around 4.30 a.m. on Thursday, Santosh Sampat (45), was mowed down by an unidentified vehicle at APMC, Vashi. Milind Mane, supervisor at the Vashi truck terminal, was alerted by one of his employees about a man lying in a pool of blood outside the gate. Mr Mane in turn informed the APMC police, following which the victim was taken to hospital. “The person was declared dead on arrival at the NMMC Hospital. We found his driving licence in his pocket as well as the contact number of his relative at Pawane who came and identified Sampat,” an officer from APMC police station said.

379,2020/03/13,"Coronavirus | Mumbai couple recovering, three close contacts test negative","Building cleaned; paramedics guide residents on precautions

A day after two senior citizens from Mumbai tested positive for COVID-19, their residential building in the western suburbs saw a flurry of activity, from meetings with residents held by medical officers to efforts to sanitise the entire premises including the gates, lifts and corridors.

While three families in the building have been asked to remain in home isolation as one of the contacts of the senior citizen couple had visited them, other residents have been advised to maintain basic hygiene and report symptoms immediately.

“We are simply concerned. But the medical officers have assured us there is no reason to panic,” said one elderly resident, adding that measures have been taken to clean the building, including spraying of disinfectant.

Paramedics who visited the building on Thursday said they have explained the basic precautions that need to be taken to the residents. “We have also guided them on the right way to wear masks in case they have a cough and cold,” a paramedic said.

They have reached out to residents of 10 neighbouring buildings too, he said.

The paramedical staff collected details of residents as well as domestic help, drivers and security guards working in the buildings and sensitised them. Residents, however, complained that a few children were turned away from school after the authorities found out that they lived in the building from where two cases have been reported.

In a relief for residents, the three close contacts of the senior citizens — a driver, domestic help and a neighbour — tested negative for the infection on Thursday. “This is a very good development as it shows there is no immediate community spread,” additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said.

Civic officials were earlier mulling a scientific quarantine of the entire building, but as the immediate contacts of the couple have tested negative, no such step will be taken.

According to Mr. Kakani, a relative of the couple had visited them and later travelled to Kolkata. “We are in touch with him and his family, and have advised them accordingly,” he said. The couple have not been out much since their return from Dubai on March 1. “They have mostly been on the building premises,” the civic officer said.

The senior citizens, meanwhile, who are admitted to the isolation facility in Kasturba Hospital, have been responding well to symptomatic treatment. Besides the doctors at the hospital, an honorary infectious disease specialist called in by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation is also monitoring them. “They are on medication and have not required any additional support like oxygen or ventilator. We will send their samples for retesting after two days,” Mr. Kakani said.

Forty suspected COVID-19 patients remained admitted at Kasturba Hospital on Thursday.

Fake messages, address leaks cause stress

A 21-year-old Mumbai resident, who was part of the same Dubai tour group as six COVID-19 patients, said fake messages are being circulated on WhatsApp claiming that all 40 people from the group have been infected. “Firstly, it is extremely worrisome that our names and addresses have been leaked. Secondly, people are making up their own messages saying that all of us have tested positive. It has caused a lot of stress to us,” said the woman, who was part of the six-day tour to Dubai and Abu Dhabi along with a family member.

While six of the group have tested positive, a cab driver who ferried some of them to Pune has also been infected. “Since the fake messages got out, I have received more than 100 calls from relatives and friends asking about it,” she said.

Thane society stops using biometric system

A housing society in Thane (West) has suspended its biometric security system and advised members not to gather in groups after one of the residents was asked to remain in home isolation. A circular by the society said the member had travelled in the cab of the driver who has tested positive for COVID-19 in Pune. The driver had ferried travellers from the Dubai tour group, who tested positive, from Mumbai airport to Pune.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/92lv8j/article31054369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMTRAINMASK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-couple-recovering-three-close-contacts-test-negative/article31054371.ece
380,2020/03/13,8 sea turtles found dead at Dapoli,"Local trained to watch over hatchery blamed for negligence

Eight Olive Ridley sea turtles were found dead at Dapoli beach in Ratnagiri earlier this week. The forest department said the incident occurred due to negligence on part of a kasav mitra, a local resident trained to take care of turtles as part of a joint initiative between the authorities and citizens.

Olive Ridley sea turtles are a vulnerable species, which need a great deal of care and protection to ensure that their eggs hatch safely, and are released into the waters on time. As soon as eggs are found on beaches, they are moved to hatcheries constructed close to the sea shore so that they can incubate and hatch properly, under the supervision of kasav mitras.

The incident came to light on Monday, when Gayatri Kshirsagar, a visitor to Dapoli beach, released a video online in which newborn sea turtles were stuck in a net enclosing a hatchery.

“We saw five to six sea turtles stuck in the net and tried to help them. We released them into the water, but three of them were already dead,” Ms. Kshirsagar said.

An examination by the forest department revealed that eight sea turtles had died due to exposure to the elements. Forest officials said the kasav mitra, who was patrolling the stretch on Monday, failed to notice a depression that formed in the sand when eggs started to hatch.

“Once the eggs are laid, we have to quickly move them to the hatchery. Any delay can directly reduce the birth rate of the newborns. Kasav mitras watch over the hatchery, where after 45-55 days the hatchlings are born. We have to be careful and cover the newborns with a basket as a protective measure. After they are hatched, we carry them in the baskets to release them into the waters at the proper time,” Vaibhav Barote, range forest officer, said.

He said in this case, since the concerned kasav mitra, Dattaram Vanarkar, did not notice the depression, he did not cover the eggs, and the resultant exposure to heat caused eight newborns to die.

“However on the same night, 62 hatchlings were also born and safely released into the waters. It is unusual for such a large number of turtles being born in such a quick succession, as they usually emerge in groups of 10 to 12,” Mr. Borate said.

The forest department then counselled all the kasav mitras, urging them to take their work seriously failing which more such deaths would occur.

“When the kasav mitras are not interested in their work, they often delay duties, such as moving the eggs to the hatchery after hours. We will be hiring more experienced people, after which Mr. Vanarkar will be transferred to another duty,” Mr. Borate said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/84yjx3/article31054387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMOLIVERIDLYTURTLES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/8-sea-turtles-found-dead-at-dapoli/article31054367.ece
381,2020/03/13,Coronavirus | Man back from U.S. is Pune’s ninth case,"District authorities tracking 614 people; relatives told not to visit patients in isolation facilities

One more person from the city tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, taking the number of confirmed patients of the infection in the city to nine, district authorities said.

District Collector Naval Kishore Ram said the person in question had arrived from the U.S. on March 1 and his samples were taken on March 11.

The condition of all nine patients who are in isolation at the Naidu Infectious Disease Hospital is stable, authorities said. Of these, seven were part of a 40-member group that had travelled to Dubai last month. The eighth is the cab driver who had ferried a couple— the first to test positive in the State — from Mumbai airport to Pune on their return from Dubai on March 1.

Meanwhile, the Pune district authorities are tracking 614 people with a history of foreign travel, Divisional Commissioner Dr. Deepak Mhaisekar said.

Individuals who had travelled after February 15 to any of the seven countries most affected by the virus would immediately be placed in institutional quarantine at isolation facilities set up across the city.

“Persons who had travelled to any of these seven affected countries as per the fresh guidelines issued by the Centre — China, Italy, Iran, the Republic of Korea, France, Spain and Germany — after February 15 will be straight away taken to institutional quarantine facilities. This is distinct from home quarantine, which applies to people who had travelled to these places prior to February 15,” Dr. Mhaisekar said.

Of the 614 persons being tracked, 325 have already crossed the standard 14-day incubation period and had fortunately not shown any symptoms associated with the novel coronavirus infection.

“We will still be contacting them for a further 14 days. The remaining 289 have yet to complete the two-week incubation period and we are following up on them,” said Dr. Mhaisekar.

He also requested relatives not to attempt to visit these individuals at the isolation facilities.

“While we will arrange for them to be contacted through other means, they will not be permitted to come into physical contact with their kin or anybody else,” he said, adding that the quarantine would be strictly enforced across facilities set up in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.

Dr. Mhaisekar said samples of 213 suspected cases had been sent to the National Institute of Virology, of which 171 had tested negative while the results of the remaining 42 are awaited.

He said that while travel histories were being taken from passengers returning from abroad after they landed, he had requested airport and immigration authorities to send information on this count before flights left places like Dubai.

“If we can get information about the passengers’ travel histories beforehand, we can estimate how many can be quarantined in advance,” Dr. Mhaisekar said.

He said district authorities would immediately put into effect a containment plan to rein in the spread of the virus, while issuing an advisory urging people to curtail travel. “We have urged cancellation of all public gatherings and meetings. We are putting in place a containment plan which will be enforced in a 3-km radius from where these cases have originated, while movement restrictions will be imposed within a 5-km buffer zone from the origin of the affected or suspected cases,” he said, adding that only prevention could act as a cure for COVID-19 as of now.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/oihx2p/article31054330.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMPUNECORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/man-back-from-us-is-punes-ninth-case/article31054331.ece
382,2020/03/13,Police on lookout for 4 kidnappers of co-operative credit society chief,"Satyanarayanrao Bhandari was let off after he paid ₹37 lakh

The Kamothe police are on the lookout for four unidentified men who had kidnapped the managing director of A.P. Mercantile Co-operative Credit Society Ltd. and kept him captive for a day at a farmhouse in Pune. They let him off only after he transferred ₹37.10 lakh to them.

Following the incident, the complainant, Satyanarayanrao Bhandari (44), went to his guest house in Nagpur and registered a case with the Ambazari police, which was transferred to the Kamothe police on Thursday. On February 12, Mr. Bhandari came to Mumbai for the opening of a branch office at Bhuleshwar and was in the city since then to oversee its marketing.

On March 6, Mr. Bhandari received a call from a person who identified himself as Ankit Jain. Mr. Jain told Mr. Bhandari that he wanted to deposit ₹5 crore in his bank but had no time to come to the branch office as he ran a cloth business in Kamothe. Mr. Jain asked Mr. Bhandari to visit him at his shop to discuss the procedure and the rate of interest. Mr. Bhandari, along with the branch manager Sayyed Mohiuddin, left for Kamothe by train as Mr. Jain suggested. At the railway station, a person who identified himself as Mr. Jain’s friend came to pick up Mr. Bhandari and asked Mr. Mohiuddin not to accompany them.

Two men, including the driver, were in the car and later, two more joined in. The men in the car snatched Mr. Bhandari’s phone, assaulted him and drove to a farmhouse in Pune.

The accused demanded a ransom of ₹1 crore. Mr. Bhandari said he did not have so much money, and that the money in his bank belonged to his clients. The accused checked his bank balance to verify his claim. They then confined Mr. Bhandari in a room, assaulted him and told him to ask someone from the bank to transfer the money by the next morning.

The next morning, Mr. Bhandari received a message regarding a deposit of ₹35 lakh into his account. The accused asked him to transfer the amount, as well as ₹2.10 lakh from his HDFC Bank account. Mr. Bhandari instructed Mr. Mohiuddin to transfer the amount to three different accounts in Pune, which the accused provided. He was dropped off at a bus stop at Pune highway by 4 p.m. on March 7, and given a ticket and ₹300 in cash. Mr. Bhandari reached Mumbai from there. On March 9, he left for Nagpur and registered a case there.

“The case was transferred to us on Thursday and we have not met the complainant yet. The Nagpur police informed us that he had received injuries and has gone to his hometown, Hyderabad, to rest. Meanwhile, we have started our investigation and are looking for the accused,” said senior police inspector Balasaheb Tupe from Kamothe police station.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/police-on-lookout-for-4-kidnappers-of-co-operative-credit-society-chief/article31054300.ece
383,2020/03/13,₹900 crore cyber crime lab to come up in Navi Mumbai,"CCTV cameras to be installed in all jails in State in six months

Home Minister Anil Deshmukh in the Council on Thursday said that a ₹900 crore world-class cyber crime lab would be set up in Navi Mumbai. Anant Gadgil (Congress) had raised a question on the number of cyber crimes, including online stalking of women, and the State’s competence in handling such cases.

In his written response, Mr. Deshmukh said 3,511 cyber crimes were registered in the State in 2018, and the figure stood at 4,822 last year. In the past five years, 16,512 cases were registered and 4,530 of them have been cracked so far. There were 867 cases of online harassment of women in 2018 and 799 in 2019. He said 550 police officers are handling the cases at 43 cyber police stations, and there is an independent cyber police station at BKC.

In his reply, Mr. Deshmukh mentioned Jamtara, a town in Jharkhand known for bank frauds on which a Netflix series is based. “Banks should be vigilant about cyber crime and have their own systems in place,” he said. Mr. Deshmukh also said CCTV cameras will be installed in every jail in the State in the next six months. He was responding to a query raised by Ramhari Rupanvar (Congress) on the unlawful supply of items from outside to prison inmates. Mr. Deshmukh said measures such as frisking of visitors, patrolling and inspection of vehicles entering the prison premises have been put in place.

When Jayant Patil (Peasants and Workers Party) said inmates even have access to movie tickets, Mr. Deshmukh said CCTV cameras will be installed in all jails in six months. He said, “We are installing CCTV cameras in every jail to ensure that there are no blind spots. The project will cost ₹90 crore. A detailed project report has been prepared.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/5l4fvx/article31054242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13bmAssembly-Backbencherscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/900-crore-cyber-crime-lab-to-come-up-in-navi-mumbai/article31054243.ece
384,2020/03/13,Pre-paid taxi business at T2 hit,"Drop in tourist arrivals amid coronavirus scare increases waiting time of drivers

With people avoiding foreign trips in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak, the business of pre-paid taxi drivers at Terminal 2 of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport in the city has been affected.

A sudden drop in international travellers over the past week has resulted in drivers waiting for inordinately long hours for a customer. “Earlier, we had to wait for around four to six hours for a passenger, now it is anywhere between 18 and 20 hours,” said R.B. Panday, who had been waiting at the pick-up point since 9 p.m. on Wednesday and managed to get a customer only at 2.30 p.m. on Thursday. Mr. Panday said in his 20-odd years of ferrying passengers, business had not been this bad.

Ajay Singh, another pre-paid taxi driver, said he has noticed that now only around 15 passengers arrive on an international flight. He said, “Earlier, we would get two to three trips in 24 hours, now we barely get one. From what we hear, matters are only going to get worse.” Mr. Singh said even if they get a passenger, there is no surety that they will earn a good sum. “Regardless of how many hours we spend waiting, we have to go wherever we are assigned to. The fare at times can be as low as ₹200,” he said.

The pre-paid taxis are allowed entry into the parking bays at Terminal 2 in lots of 60 from their holding area outside the airport. Lako Thakur, who has been driving a taxi since 1989, said once inside the terminal, all taxi drivers usually get a customer in 40 minutes, but over the past week, the waiting time has increased to around two to three hours.

At a disadvantage

Badri Yadav, another taxi driver, said they have to compete with Ola and Uber drivers for passengers. He said, “Even app-based cab aggregators have been affected, but we see that passengers who have to travel a long distance choose them over us.” Mr. Yadav said domestic travellers are fewer in number and prefer taking an autorickshaw as they don’t carry much luggage.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/lzhm1k/article31054209.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13BMFACEMASK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pre-paid-taxi-business-at-t2-hit/article31054210.ece

386,2020/03/13,Beertails and no-nonsense finger food,"Retox, the popular bar chain from Pune makes a boozy city debut in Andheri

Several drinks down after a night out in town, many of us (like me!) have had that drunken conversation of vowing to open a bar with a friend. While most of these drunken plans usually don’t work out, Kaustubh Naik and Kaustubh Lakaswar, are friends who managed to make this a reality. The duo met in Manchester where they were working and studying.

Once back in India, the Naik and Lakasar opened Retox in Pune in 2016, and three outlets later, they are now ready to test the Mumbai restaurant scene with their first outpost in Andheri. While Lakaswar is an engineer, Naik is a hospitality graduate and has worked at different bars and restaurants before. Both hail from Nagpur but chose to open in Pune which made sense for a cocktail bar. The focus on cocktails is thanks to Naik, who is also a mixologist. To reiterate this, the bar even has attached tables for seating.

Universal appeal

A glance at the food menu and we realise that Retox (which the owners say is the opposite of detox), like many other bars in the locality, follows a tested formula: a multi-cuisine menu. There are fries, soups, nachos, stir fry, a host of chicken appetisers, a tandoor section, Asian curries, and even different Indian thalis. Naik and Lakasar are appealingly honest about their food menu choices. So rather than force pushing a hipster theme – trust us on this one, from women empowerment to millennial-friendly, we have seen promoters forcibly push many facile ideas. “I wanted to focus on the cocktails as that’s what I love working on. We have realised that when it comes to food at bars, people always love familiar flavours. So we decided to stick to mainstream choices, with a few tweaks of our own,” Naik explains. One bite into their Tandoori Chicken Lollipops (₹329), and we immediately reach for the second piece. Naik adds that the Mumbai menu also has a bacon section owing to its popularity in the city. A great bar munchie from this section is the Bacon-Thecha Cheese Toast (₹329), which is a bacon variation of the popular roadside sandwich offering.

Cheap and cheerful

The beer lover in me gets excited at spotting a beertails section in their alcohol menu, where the beer cocktails are available by the glass and as a 1.5 litre jug. “Back in Manchester, the bar I used to work at used to have beertails as there were many college kids around, and not all women liked beer. So beertails were both cheap and popular back then,” Naik explains as he serves Snakebite (₹199 for a glass), a vodka, blackcurrant and lager cocktail which is very easy to wash down within a minute. If you love a tall drink, ask for their Quarter Island Iced Tea which has 180 ml of a combination of vodka, rum, gin and tequila. “Except for the LITs, we have no classic cocktails on the menu as we want to showcase our signature cocktails. Of course, our bartenders are skilled enough to make one on request,” says Naik as we try The Retox (₹449) from their signature list. A refreshing gin cocktail in every sip, this concoction of cucumber, pineapple juice, basil and some sweetness from elderflower and sugar will make you call for round two. If you prefer sweet cocktails, try the Caramelised Rum Punch, a rum cocktail with pineapple juice, candied orange, cinnamon sugar and brown sugar which is caramelised for you at the table. For more theatrics, order the Smoked Whisky Sour (₹449) which is smoked on the table. As we continue to try the cocktails, one snack we keep going back to is their Roti Chips (₹179). Sprinkled with green chilli thecha, the fried roti crisps manage to keep us away from our beloved fries (in which they offer three varieties).

If you love trying new cocktails and are looking for no-nonsense bar grub which will make you feel at home, Retox is where you should head for.

387,2020/03/13,Bira 91 joins the beer party in Bengaluru with its first taproom,"From mango lassi to Malabar stout, customers can try a new brew every week

For the five-year anniversary this year, the folks at Bira 91 decided to do something different. Sure, they could have launched a new beer, but why enjoy one new variant for months on end when you can enjoy a new brew every week?

With this in mind, Bira 91 has opened its first Limited Release Taproom in the country in the beer capital of Bengaluru, with the aim of directly connecting with customers and using their feedback to determine which new brew will find a place on the menu and which can be bottled and sold nationally. (Taprooms offer their own specialty beers; pubs usually just serve bottled fare on tap.)

Formerly home to The Beer Café (which is managing operations for the new venture), the taproom in Koramangala is spread across a spacious 3,500 square feet. Not a lot has changed in terms of décor, which is for erstwhile regulars at The Beer Café to either appreciate or disparage. The high ceiling with Mangalore tiles is still there in the main area; it’s just that now it sports the Bira 91 logo. With visible metal framework, an unpainted brick wall on one side, wood-top bar and wooden furniture, and of course, the Bira mascot in all its colours on another wall, the vibe is a little industrial yet warm. There is also an al fresco area, complete with plants and coconut trees. The upstairs area is where you can kick off your shoes (perhaps, not literally) and shoot pool or lounge on the sofa outside.

Did someone say jowar beer? Says Thomas Hartman, “So, Ankur Jain (founder of Bira 91) challenged me to launch a beer every week. That’s a lot of different beers to come up with. I had to think about how to compartmentalise it and start working on themes. One theme that we’re going to be doing is a lager exploration series, under which we will be playing with unique Indian grains like jowar. We’re also going to be playing around a lot with unique Indian fruits. That will mostly be either with sour beer or wheat beer, and we will be injecting different types of fruits into them. Another thing we really want to do is hand over the keys to the brewers and if they want to come up with something, we definitely have the capacity to encourage that.”

As for the star attraction, there are a total of 20 taps (more than the average). This means that apart from Bira’s regular portfolio of beers that includes White, Blonde, Light, Strong, and Boom, new brews will be created and transported on a regular basis from the microbrewery in Mysore to the taproom.

For now, among your choices is the mango lassi (yes, you read that right), a concoction that takes your favourite summer drink and amps it up to make, well, your other favourite summer drink. It also comes in a nitro version, which is far frothier. The Malabar stout, which also comes in a nitro version, is meant to mimic cold brew with alcohol, while the pomegranate champagne rose, created to mark the anniversary, is fermented with champagne yeast and pomegranate juice. But the most popular beer since the launch has been the West Coast IPA, inspired by crisp, bitter and hoppy brews from the American west coast, the first batch of which quickly ran out.

Says Thomas Hartman, vice-president, brewing and innovation, with a laugh, “I think we learned that the hard way with the West Coast IPA. We sold it all on the first night and were like ‘okay, we need to brew this immediately’. Based on the success, that’s the beer we think we want to have as the house beer.”

He adds, “At the microbrewery, we have four tanks or fermenters and each one is of five-hectolitre capacity. We can rotate them so we can do about four different beers a month. So, we can pretty much crank out a new beer every week. Depending on the beer, the brewing process takes anywhere from two to four weeks.”

Far from seeing the number of microbreweries in Bengaluru (over 60) as a disadvantage, Thomas welcomes it. “We are looking at this less as a competition and more like a party we want to join. Now there’s a lot of activity in Bengaluru and we want to get in there and engage with the customers and beer brewers. Specialty beer (sector) in India is relatively new but it’s similar to everywhere else in that it’s kind of a community. If brewers aren’t in dialogue with each other and trying each other’s stuff, then it just won’t evolve as quickly.”

Beer prices start at ₹135 for a 330ml glass of Bira 91 Boom. Other alcohol is also available, as is food.

388,2020/03/13,This south Indian eatery is the best thing to happen to Mayur Vihar Phase 2 recently,"Got ID?

Little things make me happy. The little thing that gladdened my heart earlier this week was a tiny eatery in my own neighbourhood. I had spotted it one day, on my way back home. Tiny it may have been, but the name was big, and the message was crystal clear. Here was a place that sold south Indian food.

The name in itself was intriguing. The Madras, it said in bold, and next to it were two intriguing letters: ID. “What’s ID,” I asked the gentleman at the counter. “Idli Dosa,” he replied. This was just my kind of place, I thought, and decided that I had to try it out.

The markets in Mayur Vihar Phase 2 do not have good south Indian eateries. There is one, in the shopping plaza close to my house, but the idlis there are the kind that can only be used if you are in urgent need of a discus. Then, I remember how happy I was when a restaurant called Malabar opened. But the joy was short-lived: It turned out you didn’t get anything from south of South Extension there.

That is why my heart leapt up when I saw The Madras ID. You will spot it the moment you enter Phase 2 from the highway (G6, Ground Floor, Pocket B, Sachdeva Plaza, Plot no, 25, Local Shopping Complex; 9841733280). I will tell you right here and now that this is one of the best things to have happened to my neck of the woods in recent times.

It serves dosas (plain, special with podi, ghee roast, rawa onion, rawa butter and so on) and utthapams (plain, tomato-onion, tomato-onion-paneer and more). It has medu vadas, masala vadas, idlis and coffee. The food is excellent, and the rates are reasonable. It also delivers to areas at a distance of up to 2 km on a minimum order of ₹200.

We asked for plate of medu vada (₹20 for a piece), a masala vada (₹30), ghee idli (₹40), tomato-onion utthapam (₹100) and Mysore masala dosa (₹90). And even though this is all mostly breakfast fare, it served as our dinner. At the end of it, there were three happily sated people.

The vada was incredibly tasty, crispy on the outside, soft within, and flavoured with peppercorn. The ghee idli, stir fried with cumin seeds in a spot of ghee, was simply superb. I tried out a bit of the dosa, which had been smeared with podi, and found it delicious. The masala vada, which is a variation of the North’s dal vada, was crunchy and full of bits of spicy dal. And the utthapam — a large and crisp base topped with soft tomatoes and onions — was out of this world. I got the flavour of the ginger slivers that had been added to it when I tore off a chunk, dipped it in coconut chutney, and popped it into my mouth.

Apart from the coconut chutney, the food came also with a tomato-onion chutney and a coriander-based chutney.

The sambar, filled with juicy bits of onion slices, was neither too runny nor too thick. I had some of the sambar the next day too, with a little bit of rice, and, despite the absence of a papadam, it made for a nice meal.

The Madras ID has my vote. The question ‘ID hai kya’ has taken quite a pleasant turn.

389,2020/03/13,A sip of bhoot jolokia,"A special blend of tea leaves from Assam now has bhoot jolokia in it

Move over chilli tea and civet dropping coffee, because bhoot jolokia is now getting blended in tea leaves. Termed the world’s most notorious chilli, bhoot jolokia is now used to make a ‘deliciously hot’ tea by Aromica tea — a home-grown brand in Guwahati, Assam.

Aromica was established in 2018 by Ranjit Baruah, founding director of Tender Buds Teas & Crafts. A former tea planter with over 20 years of experience in tea plantation and manufacturing, Baruah’s quest to make tea more flavourful and interesting had him working on blending bhoot jolokia with organic tea leaves “in order to get the deliciously hot beverage. We call it the fiery tea,” adds Ranjit.

Everyone talks about bhoot jolokia and the tea leaves of Assam. They are both spoken of individually. No one had tried combining the two most popular products from the State, so Ranjit leapt into action and started working to create the unique tea blend.

Known by many names in the different parts of the Northeast region, the most common among them, for the chilli which has been rated at 1 million-plus scoville heat units, are bhoot jolokia, bih jolokia, nagahari, raja mircha, raja chilli or borbih jolokiai.

The chilli is cultivated in Nagaland and Assam, and in parts of Bangladesh as well. “We source our green teas from different organic tea gardens in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh to support local producers. The chillis, which are grown in farms in Amguri in Sivasagar district of Upper Assam, are pounded in a dheki (an indigenous manually operated pounder),” adds Baruah. He says the tea underwent several trial-and-error sessions before it was brought out. “Everything is done in the backyard of my home in Guwahati. I converted my garage into a little factory, where apart from trials, we also carry out packaging work. I have put my knowledge of 20 years in the tea industry to build a setup that is efficient and hygienic.”

“While creating the blend, it was important to see that we don’t simply sell bhoot jolokia. The tea had to have all the elements of the Assamese tea-drinking tradition. I was sure of what I wanted. When people sip the fiery tea, they should be able to enjoy the aroma, the taste and the look (colour of the decoction). So with a lot of study and work, we have chosen those leaves that give a ruby red liquor when combined with the dried paste of the chilli. If I have to categorise the blend, it will come under ‘exotic speciality blend’, because it is not only organic but also handcrafted,” explains Baruah.

When one gram of the bhoot jolokia blend tea is steeped for 40 seconds, the aroma of both tea and bhoot jolokia has your mouth watering, claims Baruah. The heat is just a teaser, he says, it is the combination of the aromas and the flavour that is a win-win.

People in Assam love their black tea or laal saah with a hint of ginger, so Baruah has infused the gingery flavour into the fiery tea as well.

Currently, Aromica tea has four specialty blends and has applied for a patent for its bhoot jolokia tea. They are all available online at www.aromicatea.com",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/rons7o/article31057686.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13mpchilli1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/aromica-tea-bhoot-jolokia-tea-assam-tea-ranjit-baruah-amguri-tender-buds-teas-crafts/article31057687.ece

391,2020/03/13,#CancelEverything,"Amidst travel restrictions and cancelled events, hitting the pause button is a silver lining

“Don’t worry darling, we have so much dirt and disease in India, this virus won’t make a difference,” said Bejewelled Brunette as she patted me reassuringly with her perfectly-manicured hand. “This corona-shorona, it is just like the cold, why is everyone panicking so much?” she continued, sounding like the infectious disease expert she wasn’t. “Anyway, it won’t last in our heat. Now let’s get a drink!”

Much like the Roaring 20s of a century ago, life in 2020 must go on and so here we were, at a packed dinner party, where the talk revolved around the dastardly coronavirus and its fall out: sinking markets and travel restrictions. This is, after all, South Mumbai — money and travel are paramount. And prospects for both look grim, especially now that so many countries have restricted entry and exits.

Move over ‘artisanal’ and ‘curate.’ With this global pandemic, ‘cancel’ is the new IT word. Everywhere one turns, things are cancelled. Back in February, I was meant to attend the big home goods trade fair in Frankfurt, but rumblings around the coronavirus and my own flu-like symptoms made me cancel. Next came news that the world’s biggest phone expo, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, was cancelled. Early in February, I also received an email from Art Basel Hong Kong saying it was called off; a day later, the fair’s VIP card arrived in the mail!

The Geneva International Motor Show, the big watch fair Baselworld, the London Book Fair, and ITB Berlin, the travel trade show, went the same way. Art Dubai sent an email saying it was postponed, as is Milan’s Salone del Mobile, the world’s largest design fair. Also nixed: the Dubai International Boat Show, the Singapore Yacht Show, Austin’s South by Southwest, and the ASEAN Summit in Las Vegas. The number of other shows and conferences, not to mention sporting events, that have been cancelled or postponed are innumerable. Add to that the shuttering of Disney World in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo and Paris, the closing of the Louvre and other museums, the complete lock down of multiple countries, including my beloved Italy, and well, 2020 is definitely distinguishing itself.

Yet, some things have gone as per schedule, including TEFAF Maastricht, the European Fine Art fair. I reached out to my friend, the gentleman-ly genius Viren Bhagat, India’s pre-eminent jeweller, who participated in the fair for the first time this year, to ask him how it was. “It was better than expected, and very crowded on the first two VIP preview days,” Viren said via WhatsApp. He was pleased with the response. Given that he is supremely talented, only produces 60 pieces a year, and isn’t very accessible, I am not in the least surprised. And despite the global slump, reports from the fair, where a Van Gogh just sold for 15 million Euros, were positive.

That’s the thing about folks who attend such fairs (in TEFAF’s case, 10,000 visitors attended the exclusive first two days) — they make up the cocooned, skinny layer of global society who can shield themselves from the virus through their private estates, jets, yachts and on-call doctors. The rest of the world isn’t as lucky. Lack of tests, masks and hospital beds are just some public health challenges.

Fatality rates are becoming worse than the flu, despite what Donald Trump says. But in all this gloom is one thin silver lining: we are being forced to hit the pause button. Suddenly, what seemed so important isn’t — that meeting you had to attend or that trip you had to take. Technology, which gets bashed for compromising our privacy and our attention spans, is enabling new ways of communicating and consuming. Virtual meetings and virtual viewing — for sports, conferences, art fairs and shows — are becoming popular. The planet is also getting some respite. Swaths of air above China are cleaner, emissions are fewer as factories are forced to shut and as air travel reduces. So while the global economy is in bad shape temporarily, these forcible closures are forcing us to get off our hamster wheels and slow down. Do it and stay well.

392,2020/03/13,Inside the dark side: How internet inspires real life violence,"How the Internet encourages violence to leave fantasies and enter chat rooms, and then real life

Extremists on a mission are not new. Conspiracy theorists are not new. Panic-mongers and reality deniers are not new.

What is new is that they all find each other online now, schmooze and network, and make life miserable for many more people than before. Earlier, you would expect to find an Earth-is-flat nutcase moping in his study, living off his parents, with no friends to speak of. Today the same guy is connected to hundreds of fellow nuts who all want to remap Earth into a giant loony bin.

For her new book, Going Dark, London journalist Julia Ebner went undercover for two years, at considerable personal risk, and signed up with several ultra-fringe online groups. What she discovered about the sophisticated and widespread web of disinformation, neuroses and hate speech such groups spread globally is chilling to say the least.

What we are dismissing fairly lightly as ‘WhatsApp University’ forwards are not quite so innocuous — they are, as is becoming obvious, the by-product of a galloping global pathology. It is the job of people like Ebner, who works at the Institute of Strategic Dialogue, to dig out these networks. Her findings are shared with governments, parliament bodies, and UN groups who are racing against time to unmask neo-Nazis, white supremacists, Christian fundamentalists, jihadists, radical misogynists (remember incels?) — in fact, a whole nest of creepy-crawlies who have been inadvertently but so powerfully armed by the World Wide Web.

Just as Walter Benjamin, the Marxist German-Jewish philosopher, showed that fascism was propelled by the new ‘instruments of mechanical reproduction’, the rise of neo-fascism has been accelerated by cutting-edge communication technology. Ebner calls these tools “artificially intelligent, emotionally manipulative and socially powerful” — look around you to see how true this is.

India entered this millennium with huge numbers of unemployed, disaffected youth. Then it provided them with extremely cheap smartphones and data connectivity, thus creating the exact population of young, angry, tech-savvy people who could be snapped up by socially-corrosive counter-cultures that instantly appealed to their sense of inferiority and insecurity and fed their need for an “enemy” to blame. Today, we have several such “enemies” — Pakistan, Leftists, Muslims, Urban Naxals, Anti-nationals, Seculars, Protesters, Journalists…

All that the ruling regime’s IT minions have to do is feed this hungry mass an enemy a day to maul and snarl at, while the government escapes unscathed despite its spectacular failures. So far, so clever. But it doesn’t stop here. It gets lethally worse when the online posturing and aggression spills over into real life — as it did in Delhi two weeks ago. And as Ebner saw it unfold inside chat rooms when the alt-right began planning the deadly new-Nazi Charlottesville rally of 2017.

Internet hubs have become cheer groups for inchoate private grudges and enmities. They legitimise every hate, phobia and psychosis into a fanciful credo, which then plays out as real violence. For this, misinformation is a vital tool. One group that Ebner infiltrated creates fabulous Dan Brownish tales using spies, Hollywood, aliens and more, to discredit everything from climate change and vaccinations to scientific facts and research data. Using this, white supremacists, for instance, build up fears of an ‘existential threat’ — that they are being slowly replaced by racial or religious minorities and that elites, intellectuals and media are complicit in this. Sounds familiar here in India? That’s the fake news you receive on your phone.

To understand organised hate, see how the livestreaming of Brenton Tarrant’s Christchurch shootings echoes and presages the Delhi attack videos, many of which were shot by the perpetrators themselves; or how the Jamia shooter Rambhakt Gopal went live on Facebook about “ending the protest” minutes before he fired. These are not random miscreants; they are on a mission. And that is the danger.

We are sitting on a powder keg. Hate speech, open incitements to violence, dog-whistles — all that was ostensibly outlawed is back. From private fantasies to chat rooms to politicians’ speeches and on to the streets. It is no longer democratic politics, it is organised dystopian politics.

The only way out is to push the tide back. Talk, show, deconstruct. Challenge disinformation and debunk fake news. Show people how vulnerable they are, how easily they are being gamed and used by fanatics.

Can it be done? This wonderful young man shows how. Vandit Jain says on Twitter: “My family believes the Delhi riots was a ploy of the opposition and it caused major damage to only Hindus. Tomorrow I am going to book their tickets to come to Delhi and take them to riots affected areas. Revolution begins at home. Wish me luck!”

393,2020/03/13,‘Occupancies will be hit for sure’,"The COVID-19 situation remains fluid and uncertainty still looms on the possible economic impact of the outbreak, according to Samantak Das, Executive Director and Head of Research, REIS, JLL.

“Given that the real estate sector contributes significantly to India’s economic growth, it is important to analyse how the outbreak will influence this sector. We are already seeing a slump in the hotel and hospitality sector due to the cancellation of flights and closure of borders. The retail sector too will be challenged due to sourcing disruptions. Moreover, the slowdown is already being reflected in the delayed decisions by retailers to lease spaces. While the commercial sector has been on a strong foothold, investors and businesses will adopt a wait-and-see approach that we’re witnessing in other global markets.”

Says Jaideep Dang, Managing Director-Hotels & Hospitality Group, JLL: “It will likely have an impact on the hospitality sector, especially on luxury hotels. Luxury chains have about 60-65% foreign travellers in their total guest composition and a large chunk of their business will potentially be impacted this season. Luxury hotel rates are also likely to decline in both quarter one and two as result. A full rebound may take time but we could see some recovery signs in the third quarter depending on the wider situation. Mid-scale brands on the other hand, derive more business from local tourists but even for those chains two quarters are going to be challenging as domestic travel restrictions come into force. Occupancies will be hit for sure but given the fluidity of this global situation, assessing the impact is a challenging proposition.”",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/occupancies-will-be-hit-for-sure/article31061371.ece
394,2020/03/13,COVID-19 | Will constructions pause?,"The COVID-19 scare is likely to leave a scar on Indian real estate by way of delayed supply chains and revenue loss.

For a country struggling with economic growth, the year 2020 had been cautiously touted as a harbinger of hope. It was expected that the new year would finally break away from the gloomy downward trend, resolve its NBFC woes through various remedial measures announced, confront global headwinds and chart an upward growth trajectory, albeit at a much slower rate. The real estate sector, that has been chiefly dependent on the strong performance of the commercial space segment, was expected to observe an all-around growth as well, particularly in the residential segment with easing of the unsold inventory situation through initiatives such as the stressed realty projects fund.

These expectations, as of today, remain somewhat challenged by the outbreak of COVID-19, that emerged in Wuhan, China, and is spreading around the world. This has left businesses to deal with considerable revenue loss and disrupted supply chains, primarily on account of their dependence on China, the second-largest economy of the world and a prime trading nation.

While the impact is yet to take on an alarming situation in India, the fact that India has major trading ties with China, portends several implications for the real estate sector. Key construction material components such as steel and steel products, that see relatively short production in India compared with their demand, are projected to witness a price increase in the short term. This, in turn, is expected to increase the cost of construction, lowering the profit margins of real estate developers.

Additionally, most interior finishing materials such as carpets, acoustic panels, and fire alarm protection systems, are imported from China. With constraints arising out of the virus outbreak, there would be a resultant delay in materials reaching the project site, thereby leading to a cascading effect in terms of tenants deferring the space take up; and even go as far as suspending hiring of resources. With the anticipated growth of the office sector pegging the absorption figure close to 50 million sq. ft across markets in India this year, the outbreak of COVID 19 comes as a major setback. This would lead to a slowdown in the market, as most companies have strategized their business plans based on new hiring and the premise of office space being ready in 2020.

At this point, we anticipate that all sectors of the construction industry will have a marginal slowdown in terms of timelines anywhere between 30 days for a fit-out of space to 6 months in construction projects.

Having said that, if manufacturing doesn’t pick up within the next couple of weeks in China, the supply chain is bound to be affected.

The construction industry is heavily dependent on China for all equipment/ materials and any delay will impact deliveries of the base buildings by the developers; in turn, space being ready for occupancy by corporates for their operations. The next 4 weeks are extremely crucial, as it will determine the anticipated delays in supply chain management and the overall impact on the industry and the economy of the country. From India’s perspective, if COVID 19 continues to spread, the labour force is bound to be reluctant to come back to work. Even on the presumption that workers are willing to work, the cost of ensuring the safety of the workers will increase over the next 2-3 quarters.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/2ru27p/article31061335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGPLEAD1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/will-constructions-pause/article31061336.ece
395,2020/03/13,Getting ready to design future cities,"Members of top civil engineering bodies in India and the U.S. discuss possible scenarios down the line. By M.A. Siraj

If an app fails to function, it does not hurt anyone. But if a building collapses, it hurts or kills people, compromises public safety and dents the credibility of designers, planners, and engineers and host of other professionals associated with a city. Great responsibility rests on the shoulders of civil engineers as human civilisation is increasingly getting urbanised. They would need to plan future cities that would be safe, healthy, and sustainable.”

This seemed to be the focus of deliberations of top civil engineers from India and the U.S. who gathered in Bengaluru at an interactive conclave themed “The Future World Vision”. The conclave was hosted by the Association of Consulting Civil Engineers (ACCE), India for an interaction with Kancheepuram N. Gunalan, President, American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE).

Mr. Gunalan pointed out that American civil engineers are exploring possibilities such as mega city, rural city, floating city, frozen city and cities on other planets. “As more and more people move into cities through the current century, there is possibility of people living in skyscrapers and there being bridges connecting the high-rises, thereby eliminating the necessity to come down.” With oceans rising in the wake of climate change, several coastal cities would go under water, and planners may have to think of “floating cities.” One such project has been conceived with regard to Miami, Florida.

Mr. Gunalan said city planners may have to re-conceive the pavement for future cities. They may become an interactive space for future citizens and will increasingly be used to tap solar energy or for installing charging stations as mobility solutions are switching over to electric vehicles. “Rural cities would envision increasing induction of drones for movement of goods and services in place of surface mobility. This may lead to choking of corridors in the air, prompting further research into mobility.”

According to Mr. Gunalan a new material will have to be found as concrete is not green and steel has become a material of the past. Seattle already has glass bridges while bamboo could also be tried in future. “Some people are even talking of nano-material and researches are progressing to find newer material for future buildings,” he remarked.

Mr. Gunalan who acquired his bachelor in civil engineering and M.Tech in Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering from Guindy College of Engineering, Chennai (in 1981), was accompanied by Thomas W. Smith, Executive Director, ASCE; Elias Boutros Sayah, Director, Region 10 Board of Directors, ASCE; and G.L. Sivakumar Babu, Governor, Region 10 Board of Governors.

Ethical commitment

Mr. Gunalan however emphasised that ethics should come first among the priorities of civil engineers who are principally responsible for city infrastructure and buildings where health and safety cannot be compromised. He indicated that asset management has emerged as a $3 trillion to $4 trillion business across the globe and maintenance holds the key to health and safety of structures. “Attempt to minimise cost of maintenance by stretching the period has a bearing on safety of buildings and there needs to be an ethical commitment on such issues,” he remarked.

M.U. Aswath, President, Association of Consulting Civil Engineers (ACCE) (also Principal, Bangalore Institute of Technology), stressed the need for finding new materials as sustainability has acquired centrality in the new context of climate change.

Greenest Metro

Rohit Mane, Consultant, Nagpur Metro Rail, said it has emerged as the ‘greenest Metro’ in the country with the entire operations being powered by solar energy. The Nagpur Maha Metro Rail Corporation has deployed solar panels on all its platforms, rooftops of buildings and fencing walls.

396,2020/03/13,"Easy to build, and durable","Want your house to come up in a day, and make a style statement too?Try Canadian wood. By Nandhini Sundar

In a fast changing world where immediate gratification is the rule of the day, it is not surprising that housing too is viewed with similar timelines.

The construction industry, keen to satisfy this emerging market, is coming up with various options, with wood becoming an increasingly preferred choice especially in the context of the eco-friendly tag it comes with.

Long, neat and natural | Photo Credit: Mail

In the recent India Wood exhibition held at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC), WoodBarn India showcased cottages at the Canadian Wood stall. The combination of spruce, pine and fir revealed the use of tongue-and-groove technique in construction.

While the combination of these three varieties were opted for due to their inherent strength and dimensional stability, the interiors hosted other species such as western hemlock for the furniture, and yellow cedar for the door and door frames. Yellow cedar is a high quality substitute for the UPVC windows which keep out noise, dust and water.

Small and attractive

According to Sanjay Sharma, Chairman & Managing Director, WoodBarn India, these wood structures can be put up in straight 12 hours. “Earlier the time required was 36 hours to have the cottage fully constructed but our tie-up with Lameco LHT Oy has reduced this to 12 hours, enabling us to bring in more energy efficiency.”

Self-sufficient and sustainable

In short, a typical self-sufficient wood cottage can be put up in a day, from dawn to dusk and would be up and running for use the same night. A point to note here, the wood used here is plantation wood, making it totally sustainable, working towards reducing the carbon footprint with its absorption and storage of carbon dioxide. Besides, when the structure is dismantled, the wood can either be recycled or it goes back to earth seamlessly, making it a perfect eco-friendly choice.

Given its increased thermal performance, a wood-frame construction results in lower heating and cooling costs compared to conventional structures. Besides coming in compact, well-managed spaces, the structure offers greater flexibility to alter the spaces, add in balconies, alcoves, walls or other features with relative ease. This is so in installing electrical and mechanical services too. Contrary to the myth that wood-framed structures are less durable, history shows many wood buildings having lasted over a hundred years.

A lifestyle statement

Pranesh Chhibber, Country Director, FII India (Canadian Wood), points that apart from the hospitality industry which is increasingly looking at using wood as building material for its resorts, there is also increased usage of wood in the residential category for villas, country homes, and farmhouses as a lifestyle statement.

“Canadian Wood is playing a significant role in offering technical support for building with wood using tongue-and-groove method, post & beam method besides the hybrid structures that use both wood and local bricks and stones.

This is besides the traditional use of wood in interiors, in cladding, doors, windows, pergolas, gazebos”, he states.

Reducing carbon footprint

Research shows that wood products use least amount of energy to manufacture, leaving the least impact on the quality of air and water, resulting in minimum carbon footprint.

The plantation wood which is sourced for the construction, also aids in absorbing the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as they grow, storing this absorbed carbon dioxide for centuries. In North America, it is estimated that a typical wood frame house stores 29 tonnes of carbon dioxide which is typically the amount emitted by a family car running for five years.

The structures built by WoodBarn, with technical know-how from Lameco LHT Oy, are also designed to be fire-, earthquake- and termite resistant apart from being sound insulated.

The kiln dried and heat treated wood has moisture content of only 15-18 per cent, making it resistant to weathering. The base floor woods are ACQ treated to ensure the structure remains resistant to termites and other insects.

These versatile, adaptable, easy to assemble and dismantle structures are also cost efficient, contrary to expected concerns.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/kr0bg6/article31061256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14BGP-WOODENHOUSE,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/easy-to-build-and-durable/article31061261.ece
397,2020/03/13,The import duty hike could make India no country for foreign toys,"While importers and retailers protest the 60% customs duty on toys, others wonder if this couldn’t be a stepping stone to something new

The Child — aka Baby Yoda from Disney+’s The Mandalorian — was a big draw at the recent New York Toy Fair. Hasbro’s animatronic doll joined Lego’s buildable Star Wars Razor Crest ship on the popularity charts, for both adults and kids. Fans who visited the Big Apple in February have either pre-ordered or brought them back, but for the rest of us the toys may not feature on our shopping lists any time soon. The reason: the already expensive toys have become prohibitively so after the new 60% import duty on toys (up from the earlier 20%) that has come into effect after the budget.

Needless to say, it is a blow to India’s $1.5 billion toy industry, where 85% of what’s sold is imported. The impact is already showing. Wholesale markets have hiked costs (between 15% and 35%) and industry watchers claim sales have declined by a quarter in February. “People are price sensitive; they stick to budgets. If a remote-controlled car goes up from ₹499 to ₹673, people may not buy it. So, think about a ride-on car that commands ₹10,000. It will go out of sale,” says Vikas Nahar, importer and secretary of the Tamil Nadu Toy Dealers’ Association, who supplies to retail chains like Hamleys, Toys R Us, and online platforms such as Amazon.

Covid-19 in the mix On the one hand you have the hike and on the other, the coronavirus. “At the moment, the effects of the virus are much higher,” says Kukreja. “Materials are not coming in because of restrictions imposed by both the Indian and Chinese governments. So, we’ll know the full impact [of the tax] only once the panic dies down.”

Ground reality

A quick visit to a Hamleys outlet in Chennai doesn’t throw up any red flags though. There’s decent footfall for a Wednesday evening and the price tags seem no different from a month ago. The store manager tells me it is because they are still retailing the merchandise they had in stock. “Once the new imports come in, the prices will change,” he shares. But is he fielding anxious questions from customers? “No, not too many people seem to know about it.”

This will change soon. Especially since many predict that the prices at outfits like Hamleys will be higher than that at wholesalers. “It can double at organised retail stores,” predicts Manish Kukreja, CEO of toy company Shinsei and president of The All India Toy Manufacturers’ Association, one of many urging the government to rethink the hike. “Something that cost ₹4,000 in January can now be marked up anywhere between ₹7,000 and ₹9,000. The appreciating dollar isn’t helping things either.”

Rent your Lego, instead Rental services like Funstation might find more takers now. The Mumbai-based outfit, with over 2,000 registered customers, ships Lego sets across the country. “We charge 1/5th of the market price. So if a set costs ₹10,000, we charge ₹2,000,” says founder Kashyap Shah. While the new customs duties will make inventory more expensive (they add 10 to 12 new sets every three to six months, keeping up with new launches), he says it could be good for business. “We will not be hiking our prices. Since Lego is already one of the most expensive toys in the market, as prices go up, parents will be looking at alternatives like ours. We’ll just need to do more rent cycles to cover our costs [what we did in five cycles, now we’ll need eight or nine].”

Meanwhile, on the gender scale: Young boys like the Lego City, with models depicting cities and services such as police stations, airports, trains, etc. The girls, on the other hand, are gravitating towards Lego Friends (construction toys with salons and water slides) and Disney Princess.

Also, as Indian consumers are cut off from ready access to a wider range of international brands, many fear alternative channels may crop up. Rahul Goel, MD of Trucare India, the exclusive distribution partners of brands like Lego, Disney and Playgro, cautions, “This could encourage [unscrupulous] imports, like the old days, when everything used to come through the grey channel. The hike could encourage such a parallel economy. That’s a risk.”

Think homegrown

The obvious solution is boosting local manufacturing. But the challenges, it seems, are plenty. Lack of infrastructure and government support are making people shy away from investing in R&D; they’d rather copy a successful product. “I’ve been working on a new project for the last 18 months and I will start production soon. But I know in six months, there will be a rip off,” says Kukreja, whose company makes toy cars, planes and the like.

At the moment, there is an upswing of manufacturing in categories like STEM and educational toys. But they are a small part of what’s on store shelves. Their consumption is low — mostly picked up by schools and learning centres — so the few companies that make them are exporting. “The Indian toy market is about 0.5% of the world’s toy market,” says R Jeswant, VP Sales & Marketing, Funskool India Ltd. “Awareness is also poor; it is only now that we are seeing a first generation of parents who have had exposure to branded toys during their childhood.”

Competing with China

What sells, instead, are battery-operated toys, large play sets, and games patented in the US and the UK. And the quality of their Made in India counterparts is not comparable. “Until consumption goes up, there won’t be R&D and international-standard manufacturing,” says Nahar, adding that this is where a more phased approach would have been beneficial. “China became the world’s largest toy manufacturer [85% of the toys India imports is from them] because of the government’s focus. They’ve built entire towns around thousands of factories, creating a symbiotic ecosystem,” he says, explaining that India doesn’t have similar infrastructure. “I’m interested in manufacturing too, but what has the government done to help manufacturers? For example, if I want to make a ride-on car, a single mould would cost me around ₹1 crore. Then, I’ll need to import the parts, as most of them aren’t available locally.

200% hike The new import duty may be 60%, but critics point out that with APTA — the 43% discount enjoyed between members of the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement (India, China, Korea, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, and Sri Lanka) — the actual tax levied on a huge segment of imported toys will be lesser. But Farooq M Shabdi, president of the United Toys Association, disagrees. “We’ve always had the APTA benefit. But where we paid around 11% tax earlier [after the discount], now it will be 34.2%. So, if you calculate, it is still more than a 200% hike, which will increase inflation,” he says.

The consensus is that the government is trying to do too much, too fast. “Duties are a deterrent; you are not encouraging the industry if the market shrinks. A three-year plan would have been better, where the government strengthened our infrastructure, gave us access to cheaper power and loans, and good technology,” says Kukreja. He gives the example of Toshiba machine he’d picked up recently, with a loan from SIDBI (Small Industries Development Bank of India), which has him paying over 9% as interest. “But the government has a scheme for the Khadi Gramodyog with just 4% interest. If MSMEs [Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises] like mine had that option, I could put up a machine that cost ₹10 lakh, with only ₹40,000 as annual interest, which barely comes up to around ₹3,000 a month. Imagine how much I could scale up my machines,” he concludes.",homes and gardens,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/r50p9t/article31060976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Toy-1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/the-import-duty-hike-could-make-india-no-country-for-foreign-toys/article31060977.ece
398,2020/03/13,"Don’t foresee any change in attitude of Lt Governor, says Puducherry Minister","Social Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy said the government would have to fight for the rights of the people and the welfare of the Union Territory

Urging people and political parties to shun differences to protect the interests of the Union Territory, Puducherry Social Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy said he did not “foresee any change in the attitude or style of functioning” of Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi in the wake of the recent Madras High Court order.

Speaking at a nutrition awareness programme for Anganwadi workers under the POSHAN Pakhwada scheme programme, the Minister said the court has asked the Lt Governor to work in tandem with the Council of Ministers for the betterment of the UT.

“But I don’t think she is going to change her attitude or style of functioning. We will have to fight for our rights. Opposition parties should shun their differences and join hands with the government to fight for the rights of people and the welfare of the UT. People should also join the government in this fight,” he said.

The government was due to provide free rice for 22 months. After the Lt Governor decided to switch over to cash disbursement to beneficiaries instead of supplying rice, the government had been requesting her to disburse the amount. But so far, there had been no response to the request, he alleged.

He also challenged Opposition leader and chief of All India N. R Congress N. Rangasamy to make public his stand on whether he agreed with the style of functioning of the Lt Governor.

Congress legislator T. Djeamorthy in his address said there was no point in continuing as public servants under the present circumstances. “We are not able to do anything for the public.

401,2020/03/13,"With no amenities, hostels remain unoccupied","The facilities at Ambedkar Government Law College, constructed at a cost of ₹2.98 crore, now look dilapidated

The near-abandoned girls and boys hostels at the Ambedkar Government Law College at Kalapet is yet another classic example of how public money goes waste in the Union Territory.

The hostels, constructed in 2008, remain unoccupied to this day due to lack of basic amenities, prompting hundreds of students to depend on working women’s hostels and other accommodations for pursuing their education in the college.

The two-storeyed hostels constructed at a cost of ₹2.98 crore now look dilapidated with thick vegetation covering the premises. While the girls hostel has 50 rooms with some having facilities to accommodate more than three students, the boys hostel has 39 rooms with similar conditions.

“Not a single room of the women’s hostel is occupied and the building has already started showing signs of dilapidation. Just a year ago, a few boys on their own occupied a few rooms in their hostel. It is a colossal waste of public money. Bad planning coupled with the failure to provide basic amenities in the hostel, including security guards, has prompted girls to stay away from the facility,” said an administrative staff.

According to Soundhariya Karthika, a first year student, the hostel has become unusable due to prolonged neglect. From the day the building was inaugurated, it remains unoccupied. There has been no maintenance,” she said.

Private accommodation

Most of the students from neighbouring districts of Tamil Nadu, Karaikal, Mahe and Yanam are dependent on private accommodation. Around 40 students from first year batch are staying in private hostels at Kalapet, said Ms. Karthika, a resident of Valavanur in Villupuram district.

Her batchmate, Krishna Veni Kumari, said, “It is sad that we have a facility on the college premises itself, and we cannot use it. We have to stay at Kalapet. We have to spend around ₹5000 for the accommodation outside,” she said. If the college hostel was made available, the students need not pay such a huge amount, said Ms Karthika.

R.V. Rajesh, a second year student, said that the hostels have everything including provision for a mess. “It is the lack of initiative on the part of the government to appoint staff to manage the hostel that has derailed the accommodation process. We have now occupied ten rooms. We cook ourselves with limited facilities,” he said.

There was no provision to give uninterrupted water supply to the hostels, he added. “Security is the main issue. Anyone can walk in freely any time,” he added.

B. Bhaskaran, a first year student, said there are around five high-mast lights inside the campus. None of the lamps are in working condition, he said adding that the lighting facility was provided by spending a huge amount of money.

According to an official with the Public Works Department, the government should immediately arrive at a solution so that students could occupy the rooms. “If it is going to be kept idle, the government will have to spend more to restore it. So it is better to start using the rooms at the earliest. Even now, the water and electric fittings must have become unfit for use,” he said.

An administrative staff told The Hindu that the college had written to the Directorate of Higher Education to appoint staff, especially security guards, to revive the hostel. “We have been getting repeated representations from students about the need to start in-campus hostel facility. In line with their demand we have written to the Directorate,” the staff said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/4kzpmn/article31053825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/13THGIRLSHOSTEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/with-no-amenities-hostels-remain-unoccupied/article31053826.ece

403,2020/03/13,Government defends takeover of Pathrakulam,"‘Land has never been assigned to Vidyadhiraja Sabha’

The State government on Thursday justified the takeover of 65 cents of property, including the Pathrakulam pond, which was under the possession of the Sree Vidyadhiraja Sabha at East Fort, Thiruvananthapuram, saying that the land had never been assigned to the Sabha at any point of time.

In an affidavit filed at the Kerala High Court, the government submitted that the property continued to vest with the government. The government had cancelled only the proposals for assignment of land to the Sabha. The cancellation order was passed after hearing the petitioner and considering their contentions. Besides, the Sabha was put on notice. The Sabha had also violated the conditions regarding payment of balance value of land and use of the land.

The contention of the petitioner that there was a Hindu temple in the property was not correct.

It was a small room where the statue of Chattampi Swamikal was placed and the petitioner had described it as a Hindu temple. In fact, Swamikal was a social reformer and not a deity.

‘Not informed’

The affidavit said that it was absolutely clear that the Sabha, to which the government proposed to assign the land, had transferred the property in favour of the trust even without informing the government or obtaining its consent.

Thus, the property, which was to be used for propagating the the teachings of Chattampi Swamikal, was now sought to be used for the benefits of the individual members of the Sabha.

The court had ordered that the status quo be maintained with respect to the takeover of 65 cents of property, including the Pathrakulam pond.

The interim order was passed on a writ petition filed by R. Ajay Kumar, secretary of the sabha, challenging the eviction of the sabha from the property and its takeover by the revenue authorities.

404,2020/03/13,Internet providers to step up network capacity,"Decision will benefit work-at-home workforce

Anticipating a spurt in work-at-home mode in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak, Internet service providers in the State have agreed to step up the network capacity by 30-40% of the present capacity to meet the demand arising from the situation.

The decision was clinched at a meeting of representatives of various telecom service providers in Kerala Circle and officials of the Telecommunication Department convened by the Secretary, Electronics and IT, following a direction by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to look into the issue.

The decision will be beneficial for those working in IT institutions. The government has come out with a set of suggestions to avoid social gatherings in public places in view of COVID-19 spread. Telecom service providers have assured the government that they are well equipped to face the current situation.

The major part of Internet consumption in the State is made available through local servers. Moreover, global Internet traffic is very low compared to the overall consumption. So, increasing the capacity would not be difficult, service providers said.

Consumers have been directed to submit complaints regarding the low availability of Internet due to the spurt in consumption to the complaint redressal number of service providers or the government call centre (155300). But complaints regarding insufficiency in the current network infrastructure should be strictly avoided. The IT Department will also demand daily reports from various telecom service providers.

As part of strengthening the steps to check the spread of COVID-19, Railways have closed down all waiting rooms at the railway stations under the Thiruvananthapuram railway division.

Although it was decided in the morning that only air-conditioned waiting rooms would be shut, the authorities swung into action and locked up all the waiting rooms across the division as a precautionary measure.

Divisional Railway Manager Shirish Kumar Sinha said Railways could not take any risk as waiting rooms were frequented by many commuters and it was difficult to keep a tab on all of them.

“These waiting rooms have bathrooms used by hundreds. The wash basins also are potential threats. It will cause inconvenience to the commuters, but we cannot take the risk in view of the COVID-19 alert,” Senior Divisional Commercial Manager Rajesh Chandran said here.

The Divisional Railway Manager said that Railways could not take the risk and avoid the breath-analyser test for loco pilots before the beginning and end of duty on trains.

Railways had approached the State for 2,000 masks needed for the frontline personnel who are in direct contact with the commuters.

Fans constitute an essential part of a football game, the players drawing energy from the passion generated in the stands. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, the final of the sixth edition of the Hero-Indian Super League between ATK and Chennaiyin FC at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here will be held behind closed doors. Both sides are going for a record third title.

Also Read We are not here by accident: Coyle

The teams have taken different routes to the summit clash, adding intensity to the contest.

More consistent

ATK has been more consistent than its rival, never dropping out of the top four in the league stage. After spending two forgettable seasons, the Kolkata outfit benefited from its decision of recalling Antonio Lopez Habas, the Spanish coach who orchestrated its trophy triumph in the inaugural season.

Under Habas, ATK regained its winning rhythm, thanks to Roy Krishna and David Williams who proved devastating in the frontline. The Fiji-Australia combination accounted for 22 goals, with Krishna contributing 15.

The final will be a test of the attacking prowess of the two teams. Chennaiyin owes it to the coaching acumen of Owen Coyle for reaching this far. The Irishman inspired one of the most remarkable turnarounds in the history of the tournament as Chennaiyin was lying in the penultimate spot at one stage.

Lethal combo

The key to the revival was the strikeforce of Lithuanian Nerijus Valskis (14 goals) and Brazilian Rafael Crivellaro (7), who emerged as one of the most successful combinations. ATK and Chennaiyin have met 14 times, the former winning six matches and the latter four. The other four games have ended in draws. In the current season, ATK beat Chennaiyin away but lost 3-1 at home.

The two sides have played two finals each and won on both occasions.

“I think we have worked hard to reach the final and we are not here by accident. We have been a team that had to win every week because of the form of the others... Odisha was winning, Mumbai was winning and obviously the top three teams (ATK, FC Goa and Bengaluru FC) were at the top,” Coyle said. “I think we showed an incredible mentality and we don’t want to come this far just to stop there. It has been an exciting season and we want to make sure we finish on a high,” he added.

Coyle, who replaced John Gregory as the head coach with Chennaiyin at the bottom of the table after four unproductive rounds, said the team gained momentum after the postponement of the match against NorthEast United FC (scheduled for December 12 but postponed because of the CAA protests in Guwahati).

“That postponed match gave me a good time to assess my players in the ensuing break,” Coyle said. “We managed a 1-1 draw against Jamshedpur FC in the first match under my charge and I would have fielded the same side again but for the break which allowed me to bring the necessary changes in the side to beat Kerala Blasters (on December 20).

ATK head coach Antonio Lopez Habas said keeping “a cool head and a fiery heart” is the mantra to succeed against the challenge of Chennaiyin FC in the ISL final.

“This is a league with playoffs and in this format we have to get our best form in the final.

“So I would advice my team to play with a cool head and a fiery heart to achieve the target,” Habas said on the eve of the final.

When asked about the inconsistencies visible in some of his side’s performance, Habas retorted by saying, “If there are no problems then we can do a Liverpool.”

Learn from mistakes

The ATK head coach said this referring to Liverpool FC’s outstanding run in the Premier League. “But again, Liverpool lost to Atletico Madrid (in Champions League). This is football and we have to analyse the mistakes and correct them as far as possible to bring up a better performance,” he said.

When it came to motivating the side in a match that will be played closed doors, Habas said football is not bigger than health issues. “This (the Corona Virus scare) is a worldwide problem and health is more important than football. We have to accept that and move on,” he said.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/keep-a-cool-head-and-a-fiery-heart/article31063161.ece

Daniel James doubled the lead when he side-stepped his marker and buried a crisp low shot into the bottom corner, leaving keeper Alexander Schlager rooted to the spot.

Juan Mata made it 3-0 with a clinical finish from 10 metres after 82 minutes before substitutes Mason Greenwood and Andreas Pereira put the icing on the cake in stoppage time.

Olympiakos, which knocked out Arsenal in the previous round, had centre back Ruben Semedo sent off in the 28th minute for a last-man foul but Youssef El Arabi fired it ahead in the 54th with a close-range finish.

Pedro Neto levelled with a deflected shot from 23 metres as Wolves piled on the pressure after the break.

Rangers fell behind to a 37th-minute Kai Havertz penalty, given after a lengthy VAR check as George Edmundson handled a Charles Aranguiz cross. Aranguiz scored midway through the second half as he drilled in a half-cleared cross before Edmundson pulled one back for Rangers, heading home a James Tavernier corner.

A trial date has been set for May 5 after talks between the two parties broke down.

The federation's court filing said men's national team players had a greater level of responsibility than the women and that their job “requires a higher level of skill based on speed and strength.”

Cordeiro, a 13-year veteran of the federation, said it was clear after a discussion with the board of directors that a new direction was needed.

“The arguments and language contained in this week's legal filing caused great offense and pain, especially to our extraordinary Women's National Team players who deserve better,” he said in a statement.

“It was unacceptable and inexcusable. I did not have the opportunity to fully review the filing in its entirety before it was submitted, and I take responsibility for not doing so.

“Had I done so, I would have objected to language that did not reflect my personal admiration for our women's players or our values as an organization.”

The language prompted an on-field protest by players, who wore their warmup jerseys inside out to obscure the U.S. Soccer logo prior to a game on Wednesday, and a critical response from several of the team's commercial sponsors.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qb8zgb/article31056527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USCORDEIROQUITSSOCCER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/us-football-president-cordeiro-resigns-over-court-filing/article31056528.ece
414,2020/03/13,Indian Super League |Thapa: Consistent and effective,"The India midfielder is looking forward to the summit clash

Anirudh Thapa has been the fulcrum of Chennaiyin FC’s (CFC) midfield and he has made everyone sit up and take notice in season six of the Indian Super League (ISL).

The 22-year-old creative midfielder from India has been consistent and effective in his box-to-box role. In fact, he was at his best in the first leg semifinal at home against FC Goa.

He produced a brilliant curling shot from outside the box to score the team’s second goal and then provided a fine assist to Lallianzuala Chhangte in CFC’s famous 4-1 victory.

Bleak period

As CFC locks horns with ATK in the ISL final on March 14 in Goa, Thapa looked back on the bleak period when the team was in the ninth spot after five matches, and how things turned around after the arrival of head coach Owen Coyle.

“When [Owen] Coyle came, every player was down. No one was doing well; both as a team and as an individual. I never thought we could make it [this far]. Coyle changed everything from the training session.

“He just said ‘it is just possible’ and made everyone believe that we can do that; that is the best thing. The training session’s intensity increased with Sandy [Stewart], the assistant coach coming in. They talked to the players individually and guided them by sharing their experiences,” said Thapa.

The India midfielder is looking forward to the summit clash but believes ATK has a good set of players and that it will not be easy.

“ATK is a good team as we have seen it throughout the season. They have a compact defence and are pretty good upfront.

“Roy Krishna, David Williams and Edu Garcia have been playing well. We can’t say that there is any weaknessess in ATK . Both teams are playing well and it’s a matter of who plays good football on the day.”

A different feeling

Thapa said playing the final without spectators at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda would be a different feeling.

“We haven’t played any match without them [fans]. If the fans were there, it would have been fun. It will be different without them as they have supported us when we were not doing well.”

Thapa said the mood in the camp was upbeat.

“We know where we have come from. Our form is really good. We need to go with our plan and everything will fall in line,” he said.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/hdsdbu/article31052516.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13THAPA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/indian-super-league-thapa-consistent-and-effective/article31052517.ece

418,2020/03/13,Medical college produces hand sanitisers,"Department of Microbiology in K.A.P. Viswanatham Government Medical College has been producing hand sanitisers which is being supplied to all wards in Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital.

It is organising workshops to train pharmacists at Primary Healthcare Centres to prepare sanitisers. Students are involved in producing hand sanitisers under the supervision of a trained pharmacist.

S. Dhanapal, Head, Department of Microbiology, KAPV Medical College, began the initiative after reading the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines on making the hand rub solutions. The WHO recommends hospitals and other institutions to make and use these locally-made hand rub solutions, and so, has made the formula and the preparation method available for free on their website, he said.

The preparation began two years ago and was being used at the MGMGH but usage has increased manifold since the coronavirus outbreak. ‘The preparation was an initiative to tackle hospital acquired infections, which could be contracted by patients from healthcare provider who treat patients,’ K. Lakshmi, Associate Professor, Department of Microbiology, KAPVGMC, said. Now, following the awareness programmes to prevent COVID-19, the demand and prices of hand sanitisers have increased. Named Germiclean by former Dean G. Anitha, the solution contains isopropyl alcohol, glycerol and Hydrogen peroxide in fixed quantities. Some commercially-made hand sanitisers contain carcinogens. The perfume and other chemicals used in them are not recommended by WHO.

The hand sanitiser is available at one-fifth the cost of a commercially-manufactured bottle of the same quantity, Dr. Dhanapal said. Excluding the plastic dispenser bottle, which costs ₹20, each 400 ml bottle of hand sanitiser would cost approximately ₹60. A single bottle lasts for about a month depending on use, he said adding the ingredients used are tested and quality is ensured before bottling.

The department was approached by the Department of Public Health to train pharmacists appointed PHCs. Regular workshops are on so that the product can be made available across the state, he said adding that nearly 100 bottles have been purchased to be used at the Tiruchi airport.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/medical-college-produces-hand-sanitisers/article31061821.ece
419,2020/03/13,Farmers demand water release,"Water will be released in Uyyakondan canal by Monday: officials

Banana growers, who depend on the Uyyakondan canal for irrigation, staged a protest here on Friday demanding water release to meet needs of standing cash crops till the end of May.

The agitation comes in the wake of persistent demands from farmers’ organisations to release adequate water from the Mettur Dam to meet the needs of standing cash crops such as banana, sugarcane and betelvine, dependent on the 17 irrigation canals between Mettur and Grant Anicut. A few days back, farmers of Thottiyam had put forth a similar demand to release water in the North Bank canal and others to save standing cash crops.

On Friday, a group of farmers depending on the Uyyakondan canal resorted to a protest in front of the office of the Executive Engineer, Public Works Department (River Conservation Division) demanding immediate release of water. They said PWD officials had failed to fulfil an earlier assurance to release water in the canal.

“We had petitioned the PWD authorities and they assured us that water will be released by Friday. They had been saying that water could not be released due to some maintenance work. But standing crops have started withering for want of water and as there was no sign of water release we were forced to stage a protest,” said Ayilai Siva Suriyan, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, affiliated to the Communist Party of India.

Mr.Siva Suriyan argued that usually about 2,000 to 3,000 cusecs of water would be released during the non-Mettur season to meet drinking water requirements and irrigation needs of farmers dependent on 17 irrigation canals.

Though there was no release for some years due to poor storage in the Mettur, last year water was released in canals when the storage position at the Mettur Dam was about 55 feet. Now, with the water level standing about 104 feet, the government should ensure release of water in canals till May. The release of water was essential to meet drinking water requirements of various towns and cities dependent on the Cauvery, he said.

He urged the PWD to take up all maintenance work on canals in Tiruchi district after May.

The farmers, who had called for an indefinite sit-in agitation, withdrew the stir following talks with the Executive Engineer. Mr.Siva Suriyan claimed that the official had assured that water would be released in the Uyyakondan canal by Monday.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/qokedk/article31067219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY14BANANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/farmers-demand-water-release/article31061816.ece

When they went there on March 11, they found two children, not related to the team herding the goats, were present.

The increase in the number of COVID-2019 cases in the country calls for urgent precautionary measures for screening of domestic passengers at airports. There are no masks, hand sanitisers and gloves at Visakhapatnam airport and they should be provided immediately, say O. Naresh Kumar and D.S. Varma, members of the Airport Advisory Committee.

In a letter to the Union Minister of Civil Aviation, they noted that though suitable precautionary measures were taken for screening of international passengers, since COVID-2019 has crossed the borders, there was every need to extend the same measures for domestic passengers.

They sought among other things provision of sanitisers and masks were made available at MRP at the airport, a passenger pass through thermal scanner to ensure that no passenger was allowed to travel with symptoms of COVID-19 and provision of a doctor and support staff 24/7 for the next two months at the airport.

All airport staff should be screened daily and provided with masks, gloves and sanitisers. Flights/airport buses, trolleys and washrooms should be cleaned and fumigated more frequently.

Mr. Naresh also sought that a COVID-19 testing lab should be set up in Visakhapatnam, the ninth largest city in the country, in terms of GDP. The lack of a testing centre in Andhra Pradesh was causing delays in confirmation and patients, with symptoms of COVID-19, avoiding testing to rule out the prospect of spending time in the ‘isolation ward’.

He also suggested that a mobile testing facility could be provided by the government to screen passengers and issue test reports in a few hours, instead of a few days.

429,2020/03/13,Luxury and the corona ‘crisis’,"As the coronavirus splinters Swiss watch fairs and cancels motor and tourism shows, ad man Swapan Seth brings India’s super rich into focus

There is a crisis looming in the luxury market, what with Italy’s coronavirus lockdown, disruptions in the luxury calendar and travel restrictions. But are the uber-rich affected, just like everyone else? They have their private planes, concierge services and access to the best medical experts, after all. Here’s what luxury connoisseur, Swapan Seth, who runs the design and brand consulting film, THIS CONTENT, has to say:

How do the one-percenters in India deal with the Covid-19 outbreak differently from their counterparts in the West and China?

The frustration is uniform. The Airinum, the five-filtration mask, is out of stock for both Indians and Americans. Of course, those in the West and China have far greater access to things like private jets. I mean, you can now escape to The Hamptons from NYC in a chopper, but you still need to take a flight to Goa or a ferry to Alibaug. How jackie-tacky is that.

With the cancellation (or virtual alternative) of many of the watch, auto, art and other big shows and summits, how must luxury retail reinvent?

Art Basel Hong Kong has got cancelled. Art Dubai has got postponed. The Geneva Auto Show, Milan Furniture Fair and The Singapore Yacht Show have been called off. There are rumours that Cannes, The Euros and The Olympics may also go under. In which case where will ladies flash their Princie diamonds. I mean, what happens to all the money made by ringing the opening bell at NASDAQ? It all seems so futile. And unfair.

Could you draw a parallel to any other emergency like Covid-19?

Let us put it this way. According to The New York Times, Baselworld was founded in 1917 during World War I. And ever since, it has never been closed. So, you go figure. Clearly there has never been such a social drought before. Or a calamity of such social cruelty.

The big fat Indian wedding. What is to become of it?

It gets ‘ketoed’. Seriously, there are rumours of a family having commissioned Dior to create hand sanitisers as a gift with the wedding cards. There is also a big buzz about Sabyasachi being approached to create a designer face mask. One wedding planner is in active conversation with Boeing to lease Dreamliners for mid-air weddings. Given that Antarctica is as warm as London, wedding planners are planning penguin parties. But then cruise ships are hardly encouraging anymore, so getting there will be a bit of a challenge. I suppose weddings will go back to being held at the local park with Chawla Caterers and coffee served from those antique espresso machines which doled out sickly-sweet coffee with chocolate powder sprinkled on it.

What constitutes germ-free hideaways for rich Indians?

Crowds need to be avoided. So London is out. I mean, what is the point in going to London if you can't bump into your neighbour at Harrods or your lawyer at The Audley. I guess Kasauli will become the new Kensington and Alibaug the new Antibes. And instead of spending money in Milan and their wealth in Waikiki, I suppose the ultra-rich will need to learn how to spend time on other strange things like the family, books, music.

Does it help to have a private pilot license now (several businessmen have been getting them over the last few years)?

Those who can afford yachts and planes already have them. Bollywood stars and politicians will have no issues. They can borrow those yachts and planes free of cost in any case. But really, what is the point of putting down a million on a yacht or plane when the entire world is quarantined. I think they have to wait it out until Elon Musk can get us all to the moon by 2023.

Could you comment on concierge services that will be activated with this outbreak?

According to The New York Times, there is a healthcare brand in the US called Sollis. It has built an isolation room for a client. It comes with ‘‘a ventilation system equipped with a negative pressure system to restrict the circulation of pathogens’’. It is basically an isolated guest wing consisting of a bedroom and kitchen stocked with IV hydration, medicines, lab supplies, gloves, gowns, masks, oxygen, food, and a set of dishes and linen. I have half a mind to ask my concierge service to arrange for a thermal screening at home.

430,2020/03/13,Let there be water: why we need community-driven measures to conserve the natural resource,"As we approach World Water Day on March 22, here’s why we need community-driven measures to conserve the natural resource, writes Nidhi Adlakha

We all realise the value of water only when we have limited access to it. Chennaiites know this well, especially after suffering one of the worst water shortages in history last year.

As we brace for another summer, is it likely to be any different this year?

In late 2019, a couple of projects were launched to recycle sewage for industrial use, and there were plans to set up additional plants.

A third desalination plant — with a capacity to treat 150 million litres of seawater a day — will soon come up at Nemmeli. And just last week (as per a report in The Hindu), Chennai Metrowater has said it will launch a study to identify inadequacies and improve the city’s water distribution infrastructure.

What we’re doing wrong

While these initiatives are all very well, there are a number of other factors to consider. For starters, the continued encroachment of our lakes and waterways has to stop.

As highlighted in these columns, it’s the indiscriminate destruction of waterbodies that was a major cause of the 2015 floods, and the government is very much to blame. Unfortunately, it’s no surprise that the buying, selling and restructuring of land, public or private, is a cakewalk in modern times if you are willing to grease the palms of officials.

Secondly, we need to look at continued efforts at the household level. The rainwater harvesting drive initiated in the city a few years ago was a success, and we need similar city-wide measures to recycle grey water, introduce water-saving appliances, and launch community drives to educate people.

These are measures that can be easily adopted across the country. World Resources Institute’s (WRI) aqueduct tools highlight how India ranks 13th for overall water stress and ‘has more than three times the population of the other 17 extremely highly stressed countries combined’ — which includes arid regions in West Asia and North Africa.

The data, which includes both surface and groundwater stress for the first time, states that ‘in addition to rivers, lakes and streams, India’s groundwater resources are severely overdrawn, largely to provide water for irrigation’. Lauding initiatives like the Jal Shakti Ministry, WRI lists other solutions we could pursue — more efficient irrigation, conserving and restoring lakes, floodplains, and groundwater recharge areas, and collecting and storing rainwater. Examples of successful case studies included Namibia — known for its severely arid landscape — where sewage water has been converted into drinking water for the past 50 years.

Australia’s water-trading scheme is another case in point. The largest in the world, ‘it allows for smart allocation of water among users in the face of variable supplies’.

Up north

If you’re thinking that scarcity issues are limited to our cities and farmlands, the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development’s (ICIMOD) report proves otherwise. It reveals how in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, Himalayan towns are facing ‘increased water insecurity in the wake of inadequate urban planning coupled with a rapidly changing climate’.

The first-of-its-kind study, it highlights how the interlinks between ‘water availability, water supply systems, rapid urbanisation, and consequent increase in water demand (both daily and seasonal) are leading to increasing water insecurity in towns in the region’. This insecurity is due to poor governance, inadequate urban planning, shoddy handling of peak tourist seasons, etc. The study goes on to the short-term strategies being used by local communities to help cope: groundwater extraction, which is proving to be unsustainable. There is a lack of long-term strategies for water sustainability in urban centres, and this requires the special attention of planners and local governments.

Here’s hoping

If implemented across cities, the findings from the HKH study will go a long way in not only making us water-secure, but also more aware of the issue at hand. Community-driven initiatives, sensitivity towards the environment, and educating children are what we need.

Late last month, I visited the ongoing Water Matters exhibition — a collaborative project of the US Consulate General Chennai, the Smithsonian Institution, and Care Earth Trust — and it was heartening to see not just school children visiting, but also families. Taking their children through the many interactive displays, parents were teaching them the importance of water and why wasting it is a crime.

Here’s hoping our future generations are more conscious and use this resource judiciously.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/b531j4/article31059266.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1168297664,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/why-we-need-community-driven-measures-to-conserve-water/article31059267.ece
431,2020/03/13,Helping authorities in waste management several households in Visakhapatnam take to home composting,"Over 30, 000 households in the city have surged ahead with home composting and are reaping the benefits

Every evening, at the stroke of five, K Subbamma drops everything and rushes to her terrace where over 100 plants wait for her. “It is like a date where I meet them and talk to them about my day. I am sure they listen to me and recognise my voice,” she grins. She spends almost an hour tending to her plants, trimming, checking for infestations and watering them.

A resident of Shivajipalem area, Subbamma has been gardening for almost two decades now but she is excited at how her taking to composting has enhanced her gardening efforts. She thanks the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) for organising a home-composting session to encourage people to take it up.

“All these years, I used cow dung from a cattle shelter as manure. But these classes taught me that like humans, plants too require all kinds of nutrition that the cow dung alone cannot provide. From then on, I have started composting at home and I use the manure for my plants. I collect the dried leaves and flowers from the garden and add them to the compost. It took me two months to fill a 40 kilo bucket,” she says. GVMC has been encouraging home composting to reduce waste at source. Since 2019, GVMC has tied up with several Self-Help Groups to promote and conduct workshops regarding home compositing in several localities. Since then nearly 30,000 households in the city have taken to home composting . According to Punyavathi, coordinator of one of the Self-Help Groups “Over 400 households are composting in Shivajipalem alone. We conduct at least two workshops there every month. Those who have started practising home composting are now helping us in conducting these workshops and volunteer to help other women set up terrace gardens. There are several households which do not have a garden, yet they home compost. They sell their manure to nearby nurseries,” she says.

Subbamma swears there is a change for the better in her plants. “They look healthier and are yielding more flowers. Even the fruits seem juicer than before,” she adds.

Just a few blocks away from Subbamma lives V Vijayalakshmi. She has hardly sent out any wet waste to the government-operated garbage pick-up trucks. Most of the waste from her kitchen is carefully preserved and added to a bucket in where it decomposes. She is proud of her garden with its flowering plants and brinjal, carrots, tomatoes and gongura plants.

While she started by learning aboutcomposting through YouTube, not all that she saw there necessarily worked for her. “At the GVMC workshops, I learnt that I did not need any fancy equipment. All I needed was an old flower pot or a cauldron punched with holes ,” she says. Composting relieves the burden on landfills and rejuvenates and nourishes the soil. Often however, the fear of a stink or a worm infestation holds people off from composting the waste at home. Vijayalakshmi has a way out for this. “Curd or sour buttermilk is known for accelerating the composting process. Adding them in between the layers of your pre-compost pile can help to introduce the correct bacteria to kickstart the process. It also keeps the unwanted pests away ,” she says. Vijayalakshmi shares several such useful tips during her classes.

According to Project Director, UCD, GVMC, Y Srinivas Rao, “Before we launched this programme hardly 400 houses practised composting. There are now over 30,000 households doing it. This will definitely reduce the pressure on the landfills. We are also encouraging recycling and reusing. Those interested in attending these composting workshops, can reach out to the coordinators of SHGs functioning in their area.”",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/mpjvbp/article31059133.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14bgvizagp1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/helping-authorities-in-waste-management-several-households-in-visakhapatnam-take-to-home-composting/article31059134.ece
432,2020/03/13,Other points of view: On the import duty hike on toys and Make in India,"While importers and parents dread the inevitable price hike, others wonder if the new import duty could be a stepping stone to something new

For toy design and manufacturing to improve in India, R&D is key. Institutions like the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad — which has a master’s programme in Toy & Game Design, the only one of its kind in India — are stepping up to meet the challenge. “Over the last year, we’ve been working with members of the All India Toy Manufacturers’ Association, on how we can contribute to their R&D for newer, innovative toys. Some are also investing in classroom projects,” says Shekhar Bhattacharjee (pictured above), the NID discipline lead. “Last year, Arihant Play sponsored a project, to create an inclusive playground for children with special needs [Autism Spectrum Disorder, Down syndrome, ADHD]. The first one has been installed at the BM Institute of Mental Health, Ahmedabad, and was inaugurated two days ago.”

Also Read The import duty hike could make India no country for foreign toys

An increase in local production will also be good news for toy designers and engineers. Many of NID’s graduates are working with toy start-ups today or have begun their own ventures, like Play Panda. “We have a great heritage and strong culture of toys in India. Currently, we are not carrying forward that legacy,” says Suhasini Paul, a Delhi-based toy designer and NID graduate. “At the moment, I cater to companies in France, Germany, Italy, China and Thailand because Indian toy manufacturers don’t do R&D; they just want to copy. This [tax] could be a stepping stone.”

What the educators say

Pro: “A shift from plastic toys could be a positive thing. Children don’t need fancy toys; in a CBSE school that I work with, they explored play and innovation using only unstitched fabric! The results were brilliant. I think we need more open-ended toys that promote creativity and thinking,” says Mallika Ganapathy, a consultant educator and trustee of Chennai-based Mirra Charitable Trust.

Con: “Montessori schools depend on toys as learning materials, as do STEM programmes and maker spaces [Lego kits, robotics equipment, science experiment kits, etc). The worry is that, as imports decrease, Indian manufacturers will become complacent. Up until now, many of our toys [like the ones Montessori schools depend on] have been getting better in terms of quality, precisely because companies have had to compete with international brands. This hike, and the subsequent decrease in imports, could put paid to this,” says Maya Thiagarajan, an educator and author.

Parents’ take

“There are start-ups doing sustainable wooden toys, like Brainsmith and Bloon Toys, but their selection is quite limited. I buy a lot of Fisher-Price and Lego, and they will become very expensive now. So, I’ll be shopping for toys when I travel abroad or ask visiting friend and family to bring them,” says Rachita Agarwal, a young mum and toy blogger (@little.r.a.t.s)",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/wa4zcu/article31080716.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EcoHivevillafor-cataloge,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/other-points-of-view-on-the-import-duty-hike-on-toys-and-make-in-india/article31061470.ece
433,2020/03/13,Off to a beautiful start,"Tiruchi-based Cauvery College student finds success with a beauty parlour on campus

“Every new procedure, every new product is a new achievement. These are milestones to be celebrated, just as we would do in a baby's life. My parlour is my baby,” says U Shrinidhi, who runs Maquillage Parlour on campus at the Cauvery College for Women.

A first-year Master of Commerce pupil, Shrinidhi says that enrolling in her college’s Student Incubation Center of the Entrepreneurship Development Cell (EDC) has given her the skills to pursue a career in the beauty and personal grooming business.

Along with a few mates from the EDC, she attended a month-long course offered by Lakme Academy in Chennai in July last year, which has equipped her to run a parlour all on her own, she says.

After the course, Shrinidhi felt that it would be prudent to have a parlour that hostel students and lecturers could use within the campus.

“During college events, girls usually have to run to parlours and spend a lot of money on facials, eyebrow trims and waxing. I felt a parlour within the campus would be both convenient and a way for me to use my skills,” she says.

As an initial capital, Shrinidhi took a loan of ₹1,30,000 under the Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEPG) — Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) to purchase products, equipment and furniture for the parlour.

Since it began functioning in January, Shrinidhi has been able to earn ₹10,000 per month through her parlour.

The college, under the guidance of P Vijayaraghavan, Secretary, College Governing Council, provided space, including electricity and other amenities. “Vijayaraghavan sir has guided us every step of the way. Along with EDC coordinators S Sowmya and R Subha, we have been able to realise our dreams,” she says.

Five students who attended the Chennai course along with Shrinidhi have been employed at the parlour. “Each of them earns 30% of every service they provide. I decided that I wanted to join hands with women who think like me. Creating entrepreneurial opportunities, especially for women will help empower us,” she says.

Maquillage parlour works between 12pm to 1pm and from 3pm to 4pm on all weekdays.

“If students require a special treatment, they must book it in advance,” says Shrinidhi, who also works at the parlour.

Their customers increase a day or two before college events.

After paying off the loan by which time she will also graduate, Shrinidhi says that a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) will be signed with the college. “This experience has given me confidence, pride and belief in myself. I want other students to see that they can do this too.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/k4c9op/article31060524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14TYMPCCBEAUTYPARLOUR,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/enterprising-student-launches-a-beauty-parlour-within-the-campus-of-cauvery-college-for-women/article31060525.ece
434,2020/03/13,Coronavirus: This team at Kerala helpline desk works round the clock in fight against the pandemic,"DISHA, comprising trained social workers and counsellors, answers questions about COVID-19 from across Kerala, other Indian states and abroad

“Sir, even if you return to Kerala, you won’t be able to step out of your house. You have to be on self-quarantine at your house. The decision is yours. However, if you are proceeding with your travel plans, do inform us once you land at the airport,” requests Sindhu JS, while speaking to a caller from Qatar. “He wants to come to Kollam to see his father in the ICU. He wanted to know how safe it was to travel to Kerala because of the Coronavirus outbreak. I had to apprise him of the situation, although I could empathise with his predicament,” she tells me before attending to the next caller from Thrissur who wants to know if she could get the COVID-19 test done even though she had no symptoms.

In another cubicle, Rakhi Raj J has a caller from Kozhikode who is upset because he has fever and wonders if that is a symptom of COVID-19. She connects him to one of the doctors in Kozhikode.

Sindhu and Rakhi have been attending calls without a break since 7.30 am when I meet them at 11 am at the office of the Direct Intervention System for Health Awareness or DISHA, the 24-hour tele-health helpline number. Functioning from the first floor of Arogyakeralam office at Thycaud, the small air-conditioned room can easily pass off as any call centre with rows of cubicles, computers and minimal furniture. But since January 22, a dedicated team of trained professional social workers and counsellors has been working 24x7, answering questions about COVID-19 from across Kerala, other Indian states and abroad.

At your service

While 14 of them have been working in three shifts — two morning shifts of six hours and a 12-hour night shift — in the beginning, it has been increased to 13 staff at a time during peak hours and five at night. Their job entails giving guidelines about the viral outbreak and precautions to be taken regarding travel, home quarantine and isolation.

“From just three calls on the first day, it jumped to 1,200 and then to 1,500 calls per day since fresh cases were reported from Pathanamthitta. The total number of calls crossed 8,000 on March 12. The calls come in every second and by the time one of us clears the doubts of a caller, many calls would have come in between. DISHA already has 15 staff members and we are taking 15 more trained counsellors on a temporary basis in order to reduce the number of abandoned calls,” says Akhila V Nair, floor manager, DISHA.

Help at hand DISHA helpline number is 1056 (toll free in Kerala and Lakshadweep) or 0471- 2552056.

A joint venture undertaken by National Health Mission and Department of Health and Family Welfare, DISHA was launched in 2013 to provide guidance, counselling and information on physical and mental health issues. It also has ‘Dial a doctor’ service that helps people seeking advice over phone from doctors. It acts as a helpline number in cases of outbreak of an epidemic or a calamity, as in the case of Nipah outbreak and the floods.

Launched in 2013, the helpline desk usually has five or six staffers at a time and there are two shifts. “We were active during several crises that hit the state, especially during the floods and Nipah outbreak. But we’ve never been flooded with so many calls,” says Akhila. Details about each caller is entered into the Google spreadsheet that can be accessed by the whole team simultaneously and officials of the health department in various districts.

“Those who haven’t reported at the airport after their arrival from a COVID-affected country get in touch with us to find out the place they would have to report. We pass on the telephone number of health centres or hospitals in the respective district. Then there are people who seek advice as they are stuck in Kerala due to travel restrictions to the countries where they work. They are worried about losing their job,” Akhila adds.

Many people dial DISHA if they have fever, cough or cold while some calls are to find out where to buy masks and hand sanitisers. Doubts are also raised about inter-district and inter-state travels. Some people want to know why they have to stay at home even after getting screened at the airport, according to Priyanka K Pillai, a staff at DISHA for the last three-and-half years. “We have to explain that airport screening is not foolproof and they may develop symptoms after a few days,” she says.

Laborious task

Convincing confused, upset, frightened and, in some cases, annoyed people, is not an easy task, say the employees. “We have to elaborate on the need to be safe than sorry and instruct them how to be under home quarantine — they have to stay in a well-ventilated room without interacting with members of the family, the things they use shouldn’t be used by anyone else, they have to maintain personal hygiene…,” explains Preethi SK, an employee for DISHA since its launch.

She adds, “Except for washroom breaks, we are glued to the seat so that we can attend all the calls. We hardly get time to eat the food we bring from home. So we keep having water so that we aren’t exhausted after talking continuously on the phone.”

The callers are advised to get back to the DISHA number if they develop any symptoms of COVID-19. Instead of rushing to a hospital, those who dial in are provided the contact number of the superintendent of the isolation ward in the district concerned so that arrangements could be made about their transportation and check-up, says Nishad KC, another staff member of DISHA.

In between, the team has to tackle angry callers as well. “A person who returned from Switzerland called up to ask why he has to be at home when just two cases have been reported in Switzerland. But we have a file on the geographical distribution of COVID-19 which says that Switzerland is one of the badly affected countries. I had to handle similar outbursts from people who had returned from Belgium and Bahrain. Then there are people who get in touch with us to vent their anger on the government machinery!” says Nishad.

Non-Malayalis also contact us seeking guidance. “We get enquiries in English, Tamil and Hindi. We can manage English and Tamil to an extent, but Hindi is difficult to handle for some team members. However, we try to help in the best possible way we can,” Akhila concludes.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/8anw1d/article31059934.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14tvmdisha1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/the-team-at-disha-the-24x7-helpline-desk-in-kerala-works-round-the-clock/article31059935.ece
435,2020/03/13,How to keep your child engaged at home as Kerala steps up to battle Coronavirus outbreak,"A look at some tips to help children keep themselves safe and enjoy the long summer break...

With schools closed, vacation classes of all kinds cancelled, cinemas shut down, weddings postponed, government functions on hold and entertainment programmes called off, residents of Thiruvananthapuram are gearing up for a long summer to battle and contain the spread of the Coronavirus.

“Since my son Siddarth’s school had closed in February, I knew he would be home during March. But now that all schools have closed for a long three-month vacation, he was a little worried whether he would have to write his examinations once the school reopens,” says entrepreneur Archana Gopinath, founder of The Reading Room in Thiruvananthapuram, which conducts activities for children, and workshops and open-mic sessions for grown-ups.

She adds that what is more worrying for start-ups like hers is the fact that the government has directed that all activities like camps and classes be stopped till March 31. “It is a question of livelihood. My story-telling sessions have been postponed and all programmes at The Reading Room have been cancelled or postponed until we hear from the government. But in the meantime, we have to pay rent and salaries of the staff in my space. We will have to find ways to survive this phase,” she adds.

While Archana is a work-at-home mother, parents who work long hours are worried since many crèches and day care centres have also closed to maintain social distancing. A mother working in a call centre in Technopark says that many employees are frantically turning to parents and in-laws for help as children would be home alone. “Many of those working in firms in Technopark hail from outside the state and they have been affected by the sudden closure of schools and creches. We understand why the government has done this. But now, we have to find ways to cope with this situation because there are mothers with babies and infants. We understand that many MNCs might offer such parents the opportunity to work from home,” says Reshmi*.

In the meantime, Prashanth Gangadharan, who runs Learning Alternatives for children, feels that this is an ideal time for parents to let their children choose the activity they would like to do and give them the space and help to come up with projects.

“Usually, most children are forced to go for the class their parents choose for them. Seldom do they have a say in what they would like to follow. Now, parents can sit with the child to help him choose a project and with supervised time on the Internet, help them come up with projects for the vacation. Moreover, there are so many options available on the net. They can learn the piano or the guitar, learn art or craft...,” says Prashanth. He adds that he is thinking of online sessions for the participants who come to his place.

Frame of mind Cineaste and film editor Appu Bhattathiri says he has turned to Netflix for his dose of cinema but is anxious about the trade as many biggies were waiting in the wings to release during the summer holidays. “All the postponements will throw the release date of films into disarray. In addition, small films, like Kappela, were doing well and the unexpected closure will be hard for the film and its team. In the same way, Jeo Baby’s Kilometers and Kilometers, which was supposed to release on Thursday, had to be postponed. I know how long he has been nursing this project. Like other technicians, I am also worried about the lack of work. However, this is something we have to face together. While, it is true that the industry will take time to recover, I hope we overcome this crisis without causalties,” he says.

Yoga instructor and dietician Uma Pillai of Yoga Plus has turned to WhatsApp for her group of young students. Since they are cooped up at home, Uma shot a video of her 10-year-old son Karthik exercising with a hula hoop and sent it to her students and told them to send her videos of them playing with it.

“I am planning to add videos of skipping, kick-boxing and yoga to send it in the group to get the children on their toes,” she says.

Safe vacationing!

Here are some suggestions from teachers and those working with children to keep your kids engaged at home...

Since museums, cinemas, playgrounds and sports centres have been closed and vacation classes called off, this is the best time to get them reading. Depending on age, help them discover books and authors.

Board games are an ideal pastime for the entire family. Since family outings would have to be curtailed, get that carrom board or chess board out and teach your children to conquer the board. Don’t know how to play those? No issue. There are several good teaching videos on YouTube.

Gather your child or children around for story-telling sessions. Retell the stories that grandma told you or come up with new ones for a new generation of children.

Play games, Antaakshari and plug into the new songs that your children listen to.

Get them gardening and let them enjoy the pleasure of watching a plant grow. And they can even grow veggies that they can harvest later. For starters, begin with Amaranthus, chilli, coriander leaves, ginger... If flowers are what fascinate them, start them off with balsam, which is easily available.

Get cooking with the children. Right from making lemonade and fruit juice there is a range of simple recipes to get them into the kitchen.

437,2020/03/13,Too soon to cancel more races: F1 boss Carey,"F1 boss Chase Carey insisted on Friday it was too soon to say whether other races will be cancelled this season over rising coronavirus fears as McLaren said 15 team members were now in quarantine.

The pin was pulled at the last minute on the opening Grand Prix of the year in Australia as concerns spiked following a McLaren staff member testing positive.

14 in quarantine

It saw the team withdraw from the Melbourne race and McLaren said another 14 personnel were now in quarantine at the team hotel for two weeks, in accordance with local health authority directives.

They were all in close contact with the person who tested positive.

“Any other team members who show symptoms will be tested immediately and self-isolate, in line with our protocol,” McLaren said.

With so many staff out of action, McLaren’s participation in the next race at Bahrain this month, that organisers already said will be run without fans, is in doubt.

Carey refused to be drawn on whether Bahrain and the third Grand Prix in Hanoi would also be called off, insisting it was too early to say given the fluidity of the situation.

The fourth race in China has already been postponed, with Holland scheduled to run after Vietnam.

“Right now, here, we are addressing the issues in Australia. We will in the coming days be looking at races that are more imminent like Bahrain and Vietnam,” Carey said in Melbourne.

“And we will have further announcements and decisions on how we navigate the short-term elements of our schedule. We know there are issues there.”

Carey, who was in Hanoi for talks about the inaugural Vietnamese race this week, said the situation was changing so rapidly it was hard to predict what might happen.

“It’s a pretty difficult situation to predict,” he said, describing the situation as “fluid”.

“I’ll use the last five days and you look at how things have changed over the last five days. Trying to predict what it is going to look like going forward I think is unrealistic.”

“Everybody wants an answer, we’d love to have an answer,” he added. “I think you can’t force an answer right now to something you don’t have an answer to.”

With the lucrative 22-race calendar under threat, there has been talk about whether cancelled races can be rescheduled for later in the year.

But Carey said there was no point thinking that far ahead.

“I don’t think at this point it’s productive to get into hypotheticals,” he said.

“Longer term we will see where it evolves. Obviously everybody hopes the world will get back to a place where it is a functioning world and functioning marketing places.”",motorsport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/9pnoo8/article31063128.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH14CAREY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/motorsport/too-soon-to-cancel-more-races-f1-boss-carey/article31063129.ece
